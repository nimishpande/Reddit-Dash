Cyclopentasiloxane is a volatile silicone also called Silicone D5. It does not accumulate on hair or skin and allows consumers to benefit from the advantage of this family without its disadvantages: soft, non-greasy feel and lubricating properties.
Nevertheless, it has been closely monitored for several years and its release into nature remains a concern. D5 is classified as vPvB (very persistent and very bioaccumulative). The risk to the environment arises from its presence in certain cosmetic products rinsed with water: from January 31, 2020, the maximum content of D5 will be set at 0.1% in cosmetic products rinsed with water, which in fact prohibits its use, since in such concentrations it will no longer be of any interest. It is prohibited in organic.","Must not be placed on the market in rinse-off cosmetic products in a concentration equal to or greater than 0.1% by weight of each substance, after January 31, 2020.

5791,PANTHENOL,Provitamin B5,"Panthenol is an alcohol widely used in cosmetics. This active ingredient goes into the formulation of shampoos and conditioners to make hair shiny and supple. Panthenol improves hydration, reduces itching and inflammation of the skin. It accelerates and improves the healing of epidermal wounds. It is often used in sunburn treatment products. When panthenol is applied topically, it penetrates the lower layers of the skin, is absorbed by skin cells and converted to pantothenic acid (more commonly known as vitamin B5). It is this penetration that allows essential hydration.
The ingredient does not exist in its natural state in this form is prohibited in Bio, it's a shame!

19762,PHENOXYETHANOL,Phenoxyethanol,"Phenoxyethanol is a synthetic preservative known by the acronym of EGPhE, widely used in cosmetics and increasingly controversial. Since 2012, the ANSM (National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products) has recommended that this preservative not be used in cosmetic products intended for babies' seats and that its maximum content be set at 0.4% for other products for children under 3 years old. It also denounces its liver toxicity, its potentially harmful effects on reproduction as well as many other inconveniences: the conclusions of the 2012 ANSM report are alarming.
In its opinion of May 2018, the Temporary Scientific Special Committee (CSST) responsible for the re-evaluation of phenoxyethanol at the European level, for its part concluded: ""The recommendation by the Ansm of non-use of phenoxyethanol in products It is advisable to extend it to wipes, which are very commonly used also for cleaning the seats of young children.In all other cosmetic products intended for children aged 3 and under, the maximum concentration of Phenoxyethanol could remain 1%. "" The CSST would therefore follow the ANSM for wipes but not for concentration. In any case, by law, phenoxyethanol is still allowed in baby wipes!
Phenoxyethanol is produced by ethoxylation (a highly polluting chemical process) by reacting phenol and ethylene oxide at high temperature and pressure. Note, however, that phenoxyethanol is naturally present in green tea, but it is not this version of the compound that is used in cosmetics. Due to its manufacturing process, Phenoxyethanol is banned in Bio.",The maximum concentration allowed in a ready-to-use preparation is 1%.,"ANSM (20/03/2019) - https://ansm.sante.fr/S-informer/Actualite/Les-produits-cosmetiques-non-rinces-contenant-du-phenoxyethanol-ne-doivent-pas-etre-utilises-sur-les-fesses-des-enfants-de-3-ans-ou-moins-Point-d-Information
