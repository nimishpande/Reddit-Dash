Content:
My(26f) skin type is oily acne prone and I'm seeking a moisturizer whose texture is gel cream ( neither fully cream not fully gel ).

Right now I'm using Hydro Active Aqua ultra light gel cream and it's suiting pretty good, but I want some moisturizer which is loaded with hyaluronic and niacinamide.

I came accross Loreal paris revitalift hyaluronic acid line filling water cream with ceramides, if anyone has used this pls review it? Also pls suggest moisturizer as per my needs.

Looking for something light, maybe with a bit of brightening or glow-up factor. Bonus if it doesn‚Äôt make me sweat like crazy after 10 mins outside.

I tried a small tester that had niacinamide + SPF in a gel cr√®me texture and it felt promising but open to more options!

What are you all using for daytime skin that doesn‚Äôt feel like a layer of ghee?

Currently confused with these 2 (check images)

Tried the Minimalist Oat Cleanser because everyone was talking about how gentle and soothing it is, but honestly, it didn‚Äôt work for me. Really tried to like it instead it broke me out very badly 

Skin type: Oily, acne-prone, mildly sensitive

Issues I faced:

* Didn‚Äôt feel like it cleansed properly, my skin felt like there was still a layer of dirt after washing.
* Made my face oilier within hours.
* Zero improvement in redness or irritation like I was hoping for.
* Struggled to remove even light sunscreen (had to double cleanse anyway).

Final thoughts:  
It might work for someone with very dry or sensitive skin, but for oily/acne-prone types, it feels like it just sits on the skin without really cleaning. This one is a big NO, definitely won‚Äôt repurchase. 

Anyone else had the same experience?

Hey everyone!

I‚Äôve been dealing with post-acne scars and mild dark spots for a while now. Currently using a salicylic acid-based cleanser + moisturiser + sunscreen, but I want to add either azelaic acid or niacinamide or glycolic acid whichever is the best to help fade the marks.

From what I‚Äôve read:

* Azelaic acid - good for redness, dark spots and even some active acne.
* Niacinamide - brightens skin tone, controls oil and reduces inflammation.
* Glycolic acid - chemical exfoliant that helps with texture, dullness, and speeds up cell turnover but I‚Äôve heard it can be a bit harsh for sensitive skin

For those who‚Äôve tried either or all three of them, what worked faster? Any recommendations for beginner-friendly pharmacy products only

My skin type: oily, acne-prone, sensitive.

Need suggestions on products and concentration Also, how should I introduce these to avoid irritation?

does anyone else struggle with this? like i know my skincare routine is good for me, i know it makes a difference in how my skin looks and feels, but some days i just can't bring myself to do it.



i'll be standing in front of the bathroom mirror at night, exhausted from the day, and the thought of cleansing, applying toner, serum, moisturizer... it just feels like too much. then i feel guilty about it the next morning when i see my skin looking dull.



it's not like the routine is complicated - just basic cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen in the morning, and cleanser, toner, serum, moisturizer at night. but somehow even this feels overwhelming when i'm tired or stressed.



has anyone found ways to stay motivated or make it feel less like a chore? i know consistency is key but i'm struggling with the mental game of it all.

I can supply a box of 9 pimple patches at about 250 rupees per box from a brand I've started called Vitamax. In case I get a large demand (HOPEFULLY), I can supply a variety of different products at wholesale prices at a high quality point without the markup from middlemen. If theres anyone who wants to review the product and is based in delhi, I can arrange for exactly ONE free box to be sent over to you because that's all that's left from the large sample I received. Everything else I handed out got pretty good reviews (because its a normal product only).

Skin type is normal to slighty oily. Not much acne prone.

Am -
Just washing with water
Dot and key ceramide moisturizer
Berry bright sunscreen

Pm -
Minimalists salicyclic acid cleanser
(No serums yet, just using the freebie trubiom cream from concious chemist for now lol)
dnk moisturizer.

I have concious chemists Snail mucin 70gm and the trubiom cream 10gm as freebie so I just use the snail mucin day and night and trubiom only at night since it has more conc, instead of serums rn...
Tbh my skin is already pretty clear and good already so I doubt i should use any serums anytime soon.

Finding the right pimple gel for oily skin can be tricky. Oily skin tends to overproduce sebum, which clogs pores and creates a breeding ground for acne-causing bacteria. That‚Äôs why the best¬†pimple gel¬†should be lightweight, non-comedogenic (doesn‚Äôt clog pores), and able to target acne at its source without over-drying the skin.

One product that checks these boxes is Acnestar Gel by Mankind. It contains Clindamycin, an antibacterial agent that penetrates the skin and reduces the bacteria responsible for acne. The gel works by reducing inflammation, drying out active pimples, and helping prevent new breakouts from forming. Since oily skin already has excess shine and greasiness, Acnestar Gel‚Äôs non-sticky and fast-absorbing formula is a big plus ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt leave any greasy residue behind.

Acnestar Gel is best used after washing your face with a gentle cleanser. Apply a thin layer over affected areas, preferably once or twice a day. Over time, users often notice reduced redness and size of pimples. It also works well under sunscreen or makeup, making it suitable for daily routines.

What makes this gel stand out is that it treats pimples without causing excessive dryness or flakiness. That balance is important ‚Äî drying products can cause your skin to produce even more oil, which defeats the purpose.

While no product works overnight, Acnestar Gel has gained trust for its consistent results with regular use. It‚Äôs affordable, accessible, and effective for mild to moderate acne. For those dealing with recurring pimples and oily skin, it‚Äôs definitely worth considering as part of a broader skincare routine that includes a good cleanser and moisturizer.
