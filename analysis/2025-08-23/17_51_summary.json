I am not sure what could be the reason?  \nThis started when my beard became a mess then I trimmed and shaved it after that it has only gotten worse also, I had to skip 1 day of serum just because it was finished :)\n\nDo you think any of these products could be contributing to the whiteheads? Also, I’ve seen a lot of people recommend the Minimalist Niacinamide serum over the Derma Co one — for those who’ve tried both, which one worked better for you?\n\nThanks in advance!",

I started using derma touch Kojic Acid Face Wash along with a pilgrim Vitamin C serum. Ever since, I’ve noticed little spots on my face—like bumps/small pimples.\n\nThe weird part is:\n\n* If I use **only the kojic acid face wash**, I don’t get pimples.\n* If I use **only a vitamin C serum** (I used Mamaearth’s before), I don’t get pimples either.\n* But when I use **kojic acid + vitamin C serum together**, I break out. its very minimal but still it feels irritating \n\nalso i haven't noticed any glow as such on my face even after using for a month nor did my pigmentation on the cheeks has faded. Has anyone else experienced this? Is it irritation from using both at once, or is it purging? Should I stop combining them?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts/experiences.",

Currently using a salicylic acid-based cleanser + moisturiser + sunscreen, but I want to add either azelaic acid or niacinamide or glycolic acid whichever is the best to help fade the marks.\n\nFrom what I’ve read:\n\n* Azelaic acid - good for redness, dark spots and even some active acne.\n* Niacinamide - brightens skin tone, controls oil and reduces inflammation.\n* Glycolic acid - chemical exfoliant that helps with texture, dullness, and speeds up cell turnover but I’ve heard it can be a bit harsh for sensitive skin\n\nFor those who’ve tried either or all three of them, what worked faster? Any recommendations for beginner-friendly pharmacy products only\n\nMy skin type: oily, acne-prone, sensitive.\n\nNeed suggestions on products and concentration Also, how should I introduce these to avoid irritation?
