I am not sure what could be the reason?  \nThis started when my beard became a mess then I trimmed and shaved it after that it has only gotten worse also, I had to skip 1 day of serum just because it was finished :)\n\nDo you think any of these products could be contributing to the whiteheads? Also, I’ve seen a lot of people recommend the Minimalist Niacinamide serum over the Derma Co one — for those who’ve tried both, which one worked better for you?\n\nThanks in advance!",
