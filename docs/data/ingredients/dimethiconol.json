    "description": "Dimethiconol is known to create a subtle shine, smooth and silky to the touch. It gives a \"bounced\" appearance to the skin temporarily, which allows it to fill imperfections and small wrinkles. Compared to other silicones, it is known to have a fluid texture and less oily, which facilitates its spread on the skin. Dimethiconol does not pose a health problem: the CIR has given it a score of 1 in 10 in terms of risk (1 representing the best of the ratings). Dimethethiconol is a large molecule that does not penetrate the skin, and is often used with Cyclopentasiloxane for better diffusion. Like all silicones, it is not very biodegradable. It is forbidden in organic."
