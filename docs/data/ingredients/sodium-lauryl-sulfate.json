    "description": "Sodium Lauryl sulfate is a surfactant widely used in cosmetics. It is produced mostly from palm oil. It has a very strong foaming and detergent power, but it is criticized for its very irritating and drying effect on the skin, so much so that it is found less and less often in shower gels and bath products. Manufacturers prefer to use the ethoxylated version (SLES = Sodium Laureth Sulfate) less abrasive or other softer surfactants. However, it remains very present in toothpastes for adults (57% contain it) and children (42%)."
