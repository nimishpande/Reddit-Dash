    "description": "Benzyl salicylate is one of Europe's regulated allergens. It is naturally produced by many plants and is used as a fragrance molecule in perfumed products: it is known for its light, balsamic, even musky scents. It is also a UV absorber, helping to stabilize products. The first sun creams were produced using this ingredient, but it was abandoned as it was not very effective."
