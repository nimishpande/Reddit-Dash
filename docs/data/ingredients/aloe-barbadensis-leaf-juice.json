    "description": "Aloe Vera gel is contained in the leaves of the plant of the same name. To extract it, simply make a cut at the end and press on it. This gel must be stabilized fairly quickly since in contact with oxygen it degrades rapidly. Aloe Vera Gel has a PH close to that of the skin (4,5), it is an excellent moisturizer, it promotes its elasticity and prevents skin aging. For the scalp, it would help collagen production and delay alopecia (hair loss). Several studies have also shown its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial properties, promoting healing, the treatment of canker sores, gingivitis or oral lichen planus."
