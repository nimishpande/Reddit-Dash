    "description": "EDTA (EDTA and its main salts used in Disodium EDTA cosmetics, Tetrasodium EDTA, Trisodium EDTA) is a chelating agent that has been used since the 1930s and for which industrialists have complete control of processing and use. Its main property is to complex heavy metals. That is to say, it will somehow neutralize them by forming with them a complex, then serve them as carriers and evacuate them. It is therefore quite logically used in medicine to fight against heavy metal poisoning (lead for example)."
