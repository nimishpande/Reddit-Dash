    "description": "Panthenol is an alcohol widely used in cosmetics. This active ingredient goes into the formulation of shampoos and conditioners to make hair shiny and supple. Panthenol improves hydration, reduces itching and inflammation of the skin. It accelerates and improves the healing of epidermal wounds. It is often used in sunburn treatment products. When panthenol is applied topically, it penetrates the lower layers of the skin, is absorbed by skin cells and converted to pantothenic acid (more commonly known as vitamin B5). It is this penetration that allows essential hydration."
