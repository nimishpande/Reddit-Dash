      "content": "​Hey everyone! I'm celebrating a huge milestone today: three years of consistent hair growth, and I've genuinely never been happier with my hair journey. It's been a marathon, not a sprint, and I won't lie—it's been a lot of work. But seeing the progress and feeling this level of confidence is so incredibly worth every single effort.\n​My routine is pretty simple, which is probably why I've been able to stick with it. I only wash my hair once a week, which has been a game-changer for maintaining moisture and preventing breakage. This has been essential for me. When I do wash it, my go-to style is a wash-and-go. I absolutely love how it defines my curls and cuts down on styling time during the week.\n​So, what's my secret sauce? I swear by Brazilian hair products, and I'm a huge fan of Novex in particular. Their deep conditioners and masks have transformed my hair from the inside out, making it stronger and more resilient. The difference is night and day. I also incorporate a coconut oil treatment once a week for that extra boost of hydration and shine. It's a simple, affordable step that makes a huge impact. To top it all off, I define my curls with Eco Style gel. It gives me the perfect hold without the crunch, which is exactly what I need to keep my wash-and-go looking fresh and frizz-free all week long.\n​I'm so glad I stuck with it. If you're on a similar journey, just know that consistency is key. Find what works for you and don't be afraid to experiment. If anyone has questions about my routine or product recommendations, feel free to ask! I'm happy to share more.",

      "content": "Hi friends! So I’ve acquired a few different skincare products over the last few months but I’m kind of at a loss rn on the best way to incorporate these into a set routine. \n\nSkin type and concerns: normal to dry, biggest goal is to get rid of my constant little bit of texture. It’s not acne or pimples exactly. Just always have little bumps on my cheek and forehead. Want to reduce pores. Would like to reduce discoloration if possible, I have the typical southeast Asian darkness around my chin. And then overall just want glowy and bright skin. Not sensitive or acne prone. \n\nProducts:\n1. Naturium Retinaldehyde Cream Serum 0.15%\n2. Good Molecules Overnight Exfoliating Treatment\n3. BoJ green cleanser \n4. MC Exosome Shot 7500\n5. MC Zero Pore Pads\n6. All the Beauty of Joseon serums \n7. I have a thinner gel type moisturizer as well as a thick cream on, both K beauty I’m just blanking on the exact names rn. (See edit)\n8. Vitamin C Serum by a Pakistani brand link below\nhttps://organictraveller.store/products/super-c-vitamin-c-serum-1\n\nI use BoJ sunscreen on all days except work days (I work in the ORs in a hospital and literally do not enter any room with windows for my entire 10 hour shift and my commute is hardly 10 minutes) \n\nI feel like I have a lot of aggressive and active skincare products and do not want to overdo it. I’ve just been trying everything to help with texture. I used the Exosome shot for the first time last night and it helped A LOT already! So I’m excited to see how these MC products help. \n\n1. I am a bit confused on what to use on top of the Exosome shot. What should my next step be? How often? Same with the zero pore pads. \n2. Do I continue using a retinol? How often and with what? \n3. Suggestions for any products to add is appreciated if you guys feel like I have gaps. Maybe toners? \n\nThank you in advance!\n\n\nEdit: the moisturizers are ILLIYOON - Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream and CosRx Propolis Light Cream ",

I used to struggle with acne- but in the past two years it’s gone down a lot. Prior to that, I was really good with my routine. At one point, I was using the youth to the people cleanser, and honey halo moisturizer. It worked great for me. Don’t ask why I stopped, changed products- I always like to try new things lol. \n\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago I started a new skincare routine. The Korres Greek Yoghurt Cleanser, and the Atobarrier 365 moisturizer. I’ve been super consistent. Twice a day, every day. The first week was great. My skin felt hydrated and was clear. Then all of a sudden I started getting pimples. Specifically on my forehead and cheeks. I didn’t change anything because I figured it was just purging. In the past week, I’ve noticed lots of redness right after cleansing, along with acne- again, specifically around my cheek area. Almost looks like an allergic reaction? No pain, itchiness, or burning though. \n\nWhat should I do? Should I go back to the youth to the people cleanser and honey halo moisturizer? Or is this truly just purging since this is the first time I’ve been consistent in years? \n\nI’d really appreciate any advice. I enjoy skincare but I am not super educated on it all. ",

      "content": "(used ai to touch up the post)  \nHi everyone — long time, many problems. I need blunt, useful replies (product recs, experiences with lasers, hair regrowth tips, and how to frame questions to my derm). No sugarcoat — tell it like it is.\n\n**TL;DR — problems**\n\n* Active acne (face; back/chest was an issue before), scarring, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), and hair loss.\n* Dealing with this for **\\~9 years**. Back acne is now mostly clear.\n* In treatment for just about a year.\n\n**Skin type / breakouts**\n\n* Oily. I get blackheads, whiteheads, painful cysts, and inflamed pimples — all of them.\n\n**Medical / Rx history (current &amp; important)**\n\n* **Oral:** Sotret (isotretinoin) — started a year ago. Dose history: 20 mg twice daily → 20 mg once daily (since March) → 10 mg once daily (since August).\n* **Supplements:** Follihair (capsule, nightly) (since a month).\n* **Topicals &amp; routine (AM / PM / other):**\n   * **AM:** Banzit cleanser; Tacrovera forte (tacrolimus 0.1% ointment) on pigmentation; Aquasoft FC (sunscreen + moisturizer); Olesoft Lite SPF 50; Trichowel serum (scalp); Reinvia-HS (hair strands).\n   * **PM:** Banzit cleanser; Xtralite Mild (azelaic acid + tretinoin cream) — used as a **2-hour wash-off on alternate nights**; Aquasoft FC (on nights after washing); Tyrodin (tranexamic acid + kojic + MAP + arbutin + Vit E) — used on red marks on alternate nights; Minofina (minoxidil + finasteride topical) on scalp; Eyecirque for under-eye.\n   * **Other/PRN:** Chaptex (lip), Benzac-AC (BP gel), Erypton-N (clindamycin + nicotinamide), Lupizol-ZS shampoo alternate days, Glotamin lotion (back PIH), Rega BPO spray &amp; creamy wash, Biosilk body moisturizer, etc.\n\n**What’s worked / not**\n\n* Back acne cleared — huge win.\n* Face: still active breakouts and lingering marks after a year on treatment. I get redness after Tacrovera and after Xtralite application.\n* Scars remain. My derm says **laser is the only option**, but online results look mixed — wanting real experiences.\n\n**What I want from this post**\n\n1. **Product recommendations/review** that actually help oily, scarring-prone skin — especially for PIH and texture. India-available recs preferred but open to imports.\n2. **Laser &amp; in-clinic advice:** real experiences only — which lasers helped your acne scars, number of sessions, downtime, realistic results, and how long after finishing isotretinoin you waited. Was it worth the cost?\n3. **Hairloss help:** experiences with topical minoxidil + topical finasteride solutions (Minofina or alternatives) and supplements — any visible regrowth stories or tips to speed results.\n4. **How to talk to my derm:** what specific questions to ask about lasers (expected % improvement, device/clinic examples, pre/post protocol, safe intervals with isotretinoin), and what to insist on or avoid.\n5. **Personal experiences &gt; theory.** Tell me real outcomes (good or bad) and what you’d do again.\n\n**Constraints &amp; notes**\n\n* I’m in **Chandigarh**. Willing to try in-clinic if the derm approves. **All these prescriptions already cost more than ₹10k.** Give realistic recs.\n* I gave my full prescription/routine above — use it to tailor answers.\n* Prefer straightforward, respectful replies.",

All I want is a healthy discussion and some perspective.\n\nI see a lot of you in this sub using products certain products that contain added fragrance (as in, it's mentioned on the ingredients list). For those of you with sensitive skin, does it not cause any irritation? \n\nI don't really have a severe acne problem (thankfully), it's just mild breakouts now and then. I do have PIH though, from healed breakouts. I have a sensitive skin in general, it's always been like that, not just because of a compromised skin barrier. I have mild oiliness on my face- a combination skin type.\n\nI see lots of cleansing products targeted towards skin that have oiliness but theoretically, those look too harsh to be applied on a face like mine, since it's also sensitive. Plus, most sensitive skin cleansers contain fatty alcohols, which my skin absolutely does not tolerate, my face starts forming bumps which are painful. \n\nWhen it comes to moisturizers, I have tried thick creams (cerave), gone without applying creams in hot weather (used a thick essence instead, rovectin), and currently apply a lotion since it's lightweight (1025 dokdo lotion), yet it causes my face to sweat when I step out in the heat. What do you people use? \n\nComing to sunscreens, I've mostly had a negative relation with it. None of them felt good to wear, so I'm not quite regular with it. Currently I use the Re'equil matte sunscreen (blue one), it's not as bad, but still makes my face a bit greasy as the day goes on. But, I suppose I have to work with it, it's the best one I've stumbled upon so far. It does have added fragrance though (IFRA), is that alright for sensitive skin? Or should I look for alternatives?

I asked for Creamy blond like in the picture no. 2. I wanted to get my roots lighter and some lowlights to get some depth in my blond hair. My natural color is 6/7 with ashy undertone. i also explained the reason why I needed this change. I just don’t have patience to go to a salon every 1-2 months to get the highlights, sitting for 3 hours in the chair is killing me. And I wanted this change so I can do roots by myself at home and just go at 3 month mark to get the highlights again. \n\nI don’t like my natural color, it doesn’t suit my skin tone so I wanted something lighter creamier that I can also do at home. My hairdresser agreed it was a great idea and she did this pic no. 3&amp;4\nWhat I got is not even close to what I wanted. She tried to pursued me that it was beautiful and I should sleep on it. I slept on it and was even more disappointed after I woke up. \n\nSo any advice on what to do with these dark lowlights and roots? Can she lifth these lowlights to level 8 or 9 so I can get that creamy blond? ",

I have combination skin (my T-zone and forehead are oily, but my cheeks are dry), and I just can’t seem to figure out what actually works.\n\nFor the longest time, I didn’t use anything at all, just my regular bathing soap (it weirdly never gave me acne). Then I went to a dermatologist, and she recommended the **Cetaphil Bright Healthy Radiance Creamy Cleanser...** and really that’s the *only* face wash that hasn’t messed up my skin. Everything else, like the Minimalist Salicylic Acid face wash, broke me out badly.\n\nShe also told me to use salicylic acid serum + Cleargel + another medicated cream for acne, but those only made things worse. Salicylic acid in general seems to destroy my skin.... both in face washes and serums. When I stopped using them, my skin actually improved.\n\nMoisturizers have been another nightmare: **Biosilk Moisturizer** broke me out, **Cetaphil DAM lotion** gave me heavy acne, **Neutrogena Hydro Boost**... same story\n\nSo right now, I don’t have a single moisturizer that works for me, and my cheeks are still dry. I’m sick of spending money on dermatologists (I honestly can’t keep affording it), and I don’t know where to turn.\n\nAnyone with similar experiences or recs? Thank you 😔",

I moved country last year so had to start with finding products all over again, but then I got pregnant so suddenly was super limited on what I could use. Then had a baby and obviously just haven't had loads of time to think about it since having her! My curls are doing ok...but I've seen them look way better. But I'm just not sure what they need, or why! My hair is low porosity, 2c/3a, and moderately thick, I guess?\n\nI shampoo and condition with HASK moisturising curl care range. They seem fine but I'm not obsessed with them - I have a feeling they're only available in my country though. I rake mousse through soaking wet hair then coat with flat hands with gel - both from Trepadora, which I think is only available in my home country and I'm about to run out of! I wrap in a t-shirt and leave it for a bit and then diffuse. My hair seems a bit flat but I love volume, and my curls are not as defined as I'd like and drop quite quickly. It's pretty humid here, and I wear a bonnet to bed.\n\nI'd love recommendations for mousse and gel in particular. The brands easy to get here seem to be clever curls, curlsmith, cantu, shea moisture, giovanni, mielle, ORS, Camille Rose, and creme of nature and aussie.\n\nI've no idea if I need protein, hydration, clarifying, etc. How would I tell? What sounds likely from my routine? Please help me rediscover the joys of being a full-on curly girl!!",

I ask for the same cut every time and sometimes it’s better than others, but I don’t know WHY (using the same and different stylists). it’s always hit and miss. \n\nI feel like stylists don’t really cut for my type of hair, giving me layers that are too far or too close apart (?), in the wrong place (?), or feathered or something, which makes my hair look more thin and sparse, and the ends are always so thinned out and scraggly.\n\n6 months ago I went to a curly hair salon and got a terrible cut - uneven and some chunks missing around my face…for $200! You can see in the pics how uneven it is. I should have gone back for a fix but I didn’t. \n\nI’ve been growing it out and am ready to a new stylist and possible new style. \n\nBut I’m not sure what to ask for- layers that are closer together? No layers at all? Are they bad for fine hair? I think I also don’t really know enough about hair cutting to even use the right terminology. \n\nOld shorter cut:\nFinally - there is a hair cut I had many years ago which I loved (pic 5 and 6)-shorter than I wear it now), but a few times I’ve tried to get it again it has failed miserably: pics 7 and 8 (too short, not enough shape?) and pic 9 (too short, and too pouffy and round overall- was a common problem trying to get this cut)Should I try that one again and if so, what do I ask for specifically? \n\nRoutine:\nWash every other day, curly hair lotion then mousse on very wet hair. Air dry then fluff/scrunch out. \n\nThanks! ",
