I tried looking it up but they speak about days of retinol and then other details that made it confusing for me. So far I've used Peach Slices snail care pack that includes their own: Purifying cleanser, blemish busting toner, intensive serum, intensive wash off jelly mask and all in one oil free moisturizer.\n\nAll of them says that they're usable daily besides the jelly mask one which should only be used 2 - 3x a week. but I'm a bit paranoid i've somehow accidentally done some type of damage to my skin barrier because im starting to notice dry flakes on my forehead (Also fyi i do have some mild acne on the middle of my forehead otherwise my skin is kinda clear with some red pigments on my cheeks like a flushed colour). So I decided to check around what I could do to try to take it easier on my skin to see if it really was damaged or i'm just using some things wrong hence where I got the skin cycle idea from. \n\nBut I wondered if it was possible to make a skin cycle with the products im already using or if y'all could recommend a better (hopefully equally as cheap) product?? Just some guidance on where to start could be nice and if i can still do a cycle with these products I already have would be even greater! I'm still kinda new to how skin care works and didn't really get serious until a few months ago, before that I just used some random exfoliator for men by nivea and then loreal moisturizer for sensitive skin XD (I dont know if i have sensitive skin but better safe than sorry).\n\nAlso if it is of any help the order i usually do the products is: Cleanser, Jelly mask (which i skip on the days i shouldnt do it), Blemish toner, Serum and lastly moisturizer.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

But that’s $$$. And stylist’s will always do your hair in a way that can’t seem to be achieved at home). Now I style my hair usually ends up curlier than the pic. \n\nCan anyone recommend their fave curl cream (and lightweight conditioner for future buy if possible)? \n\nRoutine: shampoo- Odele sensitive or clarifying shampoo, 4u lightweight conditioner (*this is made for much curlier hair, I just grabbed it because it said lightweight but didn’t realize the brand is mostly for type 3-4hair.

I was not very happy with the cut because it is giving Christmas tree and I want something rounder (like in the last pic). Any tips on how to achieve the look or close to it? I will also post this in the hair cut subreddits but wanted to try here too. Please remove it not allowed here. My hair is a mix, but mostly 3b/3c.\n\nRoutine: \n- Shampoo - Texture id clarifying shampoo or Aluram curl shampoo\n- Sometimes use conditioner but lots of times just use Mielle Pomegranate line Leave In\n- Design essentials daily hair lotion\n- Lotta Body Mousse\n- xtreme gel\nOften put texture id eucalyptus oil on my scalp because without it my scalp starts to hurt and flake sooner than without the oil\n\nSleep with a bonnet from Sally's and have silk and satin pillowcases.\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "First collage: (before cg routine) this is my hair air dried without touching it or adding any products after completely rinsing out a clarifying wash (v05) and conditioner (also v05). No products. \n\nSecond collage: (after one month of beginner cg routine) this is my hair after the following routine- v05 cowash, v05 condition about 90% washed out, eco style olive oil gel scrunched in very wet hair, plopped for maybe 20 minutes with cotton shirt, SOTC after hair completely dry\n\nSo after one month of this I’m still unsure of my hair specifics! If I had to guess, I would say I have high porosity. My hair isn’t dyed and I haven’t used any heat on it but it still just has kind of a damaged, dry feel. My hair almost never gets greasy. It does get wet and dry moderately quickly. And I have a lot of frizz! \n\nI would guess most of my damage is mechanical because I wear my hair up so much. I just can’t get it to look right down no matter how much I try! I do have a LOT of fallout and maybe it’s genetic but my hair, especially in the front around my face, just doesn’t seem to grow past a certain point. I did recently cut a few inches off the ends so these pictures are after that. \n\nIt seems like I may fall more into the wavy camp but I’m hoping maybe someone here has suggestions of what to add or subtract to my routine that might help with frizz and random straighter bits? Also any insight into narrowing down my hair type would be much appreciated. Several years ago a hair stylist did tell me that I had course hair but there wasn’t a lot of it, so course low density maybe? The texture and density seem more medium to me when testing using suggestion in the wiki. ",

      "content": "i have a mix of 2a-3b curls and ive been doing my routine on-and-off for years because i am a busy person and i just havent had time to do trial and error as much as id like to. also curly hair products can get pricey! im a college student 😭😭💔💔over time my curls have been more defined and healthy and ive found a routine that works for me for the time being. i dont use curly hair shampoos because when i have in the past its either dried my hair out or had no effect. (i have a lifelong goal to have like knee length hair so i usually go for anti breakage and hydrating shampoos since my hair gets dry easily, right now its at my butt. its also moderately thick but i have layers.) im willing to try a new one, but right now my shampoo/conditioner routine works for me. my hair is very soft and shiny. if these products are actually bad for curls though id like to know!\n\ni use the loreal dream lengths shampoo twice on my scalp every 2-4 days, rarely 3 times because i like to oil my hair 1-2x a week. i then use a hair mask then a little conditioner on my ends if i plan on using heat or not styling my hair in general. if i plan on doing my curl routine i usually dont use any conditioner or very little. \n\ni noticed that if i do my hair routine in the shower when my hair is still freshly soaked it comes out better. so ill flip my hair over, brush it, and then apply the not your mother’s curl talk gel and scrunch it in, then the miss jessies jelly soft curls and scrunch it in, and repeat this 2-3x. I KNOW THIS IS CRAZY but its literally the only thing that makes my curls not go flat in two seconds. \n\nit works for me but i definitely dont think this is ideal. i then plop in a towel for like 10-15 minutes, and i diffuse upside down. \nthis is where the issue comes. the top of my hair looks GREAT. my curls are defined, frizzless, theres a nice cast, the roots look great and theres no awkward perfectly straight part. the bottom looks okay, not as defined as it was when i used to brush style, but within 10 minutes it becomes dry and frizzy and TANGLES like no other. like i think ive had some light matting before\n\nnot to mention my curls just dont stay overnight, the pineapple ruins them. and the bonnet ends up on the other side of the room when i wear it. idk i know my routine sucks but the top looks so good so it feels worth it to me? i have a lot more curls on the bottom half though so im really sad that it doesnt look good. i can get dry frizz but its not as much an issue as before. please give advice 😭🥹\n\nin the past ive also used the shea moisture curl cream, it weighed my hair down like crazy but it made my curls look amazing! i used to brush style my hair (like the wrapping it around the handle technique) with like a knockoff denman brush and it made my curls look amazing and defined but extremely flat and the roots never stayed curled, when i do the upside down technique my roots curl. ive used other creams like the not your mothers curl talk curl cream and i didnt particularly like it, ive used maui moisture mousse i believe and it made my hair unbelievably sticky and stringy. \n\nthank you!!!!!!!!!!!",

My skin type is generally normal to combination, but in humid weather it gets oily, especially around my T-zone.\n\nHere’s what my current routine looks like (been doing this since my teenage years):\n\nFace wash: Clean &amp; Clear\n\nToner: Just plain Gulabjal (rose water)\n\nMoisturizer: Olay cream\n\nLip care: Vaseline or Boroplus\n\nThat’s honestly all I’ve been using so far, and my skin is pretty okay — not sensitive or acne-prone, just tends to get oily when it’s humid.\n\nNow that I’m shifting to Puducherry, I want to upgrade my routine a bit with products better suited for that climate — something lightweight, non-sticky, and simple.\n\nCould you please recommend:\n\nA good gel-based face wash (something gentle but effective for oil control)\n\nA light moisturizer that won’t feel greasy\n\nA sunscreen that’s non-comedogenic and matte\n\nOptional: any basic serum for hydration or glow\n\nMy budget is mid-range — doesn’t have to be high-end, just something that works well and is easily available in India (online or offline).\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions!

I wash my face (La Roche Posay), use moisturizer (La Roche Posay), and put on sunscreen (Centella) in the morning, and I'm left with a very shiny face (which is expected after the moisturizer and sunscreen ofc). If I put on makeup the shine goes away, but if I want a makeup free day, the shine drives me crazy! Are there any non makeup products you guys use to get rid of the skincare shine? I've tried oil absorption sheets, but they're pretty ineffective as the shine isn't oil-related in the morning. I like my current skincare products as they've worked the best for my skin problems and don't really want to change them too much, but I'm open to other products as well! Thank you in advance for any and all advice!",

      "content": "Hello everyone, I have this small circle scar on my nose it is a tinyyy bit raised, it started with a pimple 6 years ago (I'm 23) that I popped and which made a small fibrous bump (smaller than now), I didn't like it so I went to a dermatologist who decided to burn it with like a cauterizer or something, it then caused a tiny red scar (still smaller than what it is now) and he told me it would go away, I waited a long time and it still didnt go away so around a year later I went back and he said he could burn it AGAIN, so I did and it stayed the same way maybe got a little bit bigger I think, a year later I still felt like it was too red, so I booked with another dermatologist for laser treatment to remove the redness of the scar (I don't mind having the scar but it's really the redness that bothers me because it looks obvious as a pimple at the tip of my nose).\n\nSo now here I am 4 years after the last thing I did (laser) with this on my nose, it bothers me a lot because I believe I have an attractive face but this really ruins it for me (I know it's not that big but it's really a mental thing).\n\nAny ideas on what I could do to make it as less visible as possible, I don't think burning again would do something as it is now more a scar than just normal fibrous tissue, also I felt like the laser treatment would worsen because I didn't feel like it helped when I did it. I'm scared of doing something that would worsen my case but at the same time I really want it to go away. Would a tiny corticoid injection inside help? I'm opened to any comments, thank you :))",

Most products weren’t made for Indian skin, and I wanted something that actually delivered results.\n\nSo I decided to build it myself. I learned about skincare science, experimented tirelessly, and drew inspiration from Ayurveda, Japanese beauty, and Korean beauty. After late nights and failed batches, Sacred Kosmetics was born.\n\nI want this brand to be for the people and by the people, something everyone can trust and relate to. Our first serums are live, a sunscreen is coming soon, and every product blends modern science with traditional wisdom to give real results.\n\nI’m not here to sell. I just want to share my journey and ask for your support. Even feedback, comments, or sharing the story means the world.\n\nThanks for reading 🙏\n\n— Shreepad\n",

I used to always just get root touch ups and I would try to push out my appt as long as possible due to my budget which would be every 7 weeks. Well I brought up to my stylist that I was wanting something with less maintenance and she recommended partial highlights. So I have done that the last three times now. Yes, I am able to wait longer in between appointments with this however it is way more expensive! I have really thick hair and the appointment also takes 3 1/2- 4 hours!  Also the price will fluctuate with each appointment and she never tells me ahead of time or during the process how much it will be… I just find out afterwards. I was wondering if there is something else I could get instead of partial highlights or maybe just go back to root touch ups? I am not wanting/cannot pay around $300-$400 for partial highlights… thank you!",

      "title": "How to use DIY flaxseed gel?",
      "content": "Hello! I just recently decided to try out curly look (instead of straightening). I went to curly hair hairdresser, who basically gave me a short course on how to handle curly hair. I haven't tried styling my hair myself and decided to try DIY flaxseed gel as a leave in product, because most bought ones have some kind of strong smell.\n\nHairdresser actually used mousse in my hair and said it is probably better than gel, because my hair is very fine. She also said I don't need deep moisturizing.\n\nSo, because I'm doing this for the first time, I'm a bit lost on how much I should use the flaxseed gel? I did observe the hairdresser, when she applied the mousse, but like she said, you don't really get that much product in your hair, because mousse has a lot of volume. So I'm unsure about the amount of gel that's needed. My hair is medium length (almost bra strap length when straight) and not very thick)\n\nHere's how I made the flaxseed gel: I just made a small portion, 1 cup or water and 2 tbl spoons of flaxseeds. Boiled for 12minutes, until it became a thick gel. Strained, cooled and  stored in fridge during the night.\n\nI'll try to style it as I was advised, so the routine will be: wash, use conditioner (neither is made for curly hair), rinse. Then \"comb\" through my hair with fingers (I don't have the curly hair brush yet) and put in the gel, scrunch it, then scrunch few times with the towel and I was told I can also leave the hair in towel for a while. And then I will just let it dry (won't use hair dryer).\n\nBut my main question is, how much gel should I use? Tablespoon, a few?\n\nThanks in advance for suggestions, it's a totally new topic for me!",
