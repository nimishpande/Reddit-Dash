My hair is a mix, but mostly 3b/3c.\n\nRoutine: \n- Shampoo - Texture id clarifying shampoo or Aluram curl shampoo\n- Sometimes use conditioner but lots of times just use Mielle Pomegranate line Leave In\n- Design essentials daily hair lotion\n- Lotta Body Mousse\n- xtreme gel\nOften put texture id eucalyptus oil on my scalp because without it my scalp starts to hurt and flake sooner than without the oil\n\nSleep with a bonnet from Sally's and have silk and satin pillowcases.\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "First collage: (before cg routine) this is my hair air dried without touching it or adding any products after completely rinsing out a clarifying wash (v05) and conditioner (also v05). No products. \n\nSecond collage: (after one month of beginner cg routine) this is my hair after the following routine- v05 cowash, v05 condition about 90% washed out, eco style olive oil gel scrunched in very wet hair, plopped for maybe 20 minutes with cotton shirt, SOTC after hair completely dry\n\nSo after one month of this I’m still unsure of my hair specifics! If I had to guess, I would say I have high porosity. My hair isn’t dyed and I haven’t used any heat on it but it still just has kind of a damaged, dry feel. My hair almost never gets greasy. It does get wet and dry moderately quickly. And I have a lot of frizz! \n\nI would guess most of my damage is mechanical because I wear my hair up so much. I just can’t get it to look right down no matter how much I try! I do have a LOT of fallout and maybe it’s genetic but my hair, especially in the front around my face, just doesn’t seem to grow past a certain point. I did recently cut a few inches off the ends so these pictures are after that. \n\nIt seems like I may fall more into the wavy camp but I’m hoping maybe someone here has suggestions of what to add or subtract to my routine that might help with frizz and random straighter bits? Also any insight into narrowing down my hair type would be much appreciated. Several years ago a hair stylist did tell me that I had course hair but there wasn’t a lot of it, so course low density maybe? The texture and density seem more medium to me when testing using suggestion in the wiki. ",

      "content": "Hello! I just recently decided to try out curly look (instead of straightening). I went to curly hair hairdresser, who basically gave me a short course on how to handle curly hair. I haven't tried styling my hair myself and decided to try DIY flaxseed gel as a leave in product, because most bought ones have some kind of strong smell.\n\nHairdresser actually used mousse in my hair and said it is probably better than gel, because my hair is very fine. She also said I don't need deep moisturizing.\n\nSo, because I'm doing this for the first time, I'm a bit lost on how much I should use the flaxseed gel? I did observe the hairdresser, when she applied the mousse, but like she said, you don't really get that much product in your hair, because mousse has a lot of volume. So I'm unsure about the amount of gel that's needed. My hair is medium length (almost bra strap length when straight) and not very thick)\n\nHere's how I made the flaxseed gel: I just made a small portion, 1 cup or water and 2 tbl spoons of flaxseeds. Boiled for 12minutes, until it became a thick gel. Strained, cooled and  stored in fridge during the night.\n\nI'll try to style it as I was advised, so the routine will be: wash, use conditioner (neither is made for curly hair), rinse. Then \"comb\" through my hair with fingers (I don't have the curly hair brush yet) and put in the gel, scrunch it, then scrunch few times with the towel and I was told I can also leave the hair in towel for a while. And then I will just let it dry (won't use hair dryer).\n\nBut my main question is, how much gel should I use? Tablespoon, a few?\n\nThanks in advance for suggestions, it's a totally new topic for me!",

I wash my face (La Roche Posay), use moisturizer (La Roche Posay), and put on sunscreen (Centella) in the morning, and I'm left with a very shiny face (which is expected after the moisturizer and sunscreen ofc). If I put on makeup the shine goes away, but if I want a makeup free day, the shine drives me crazy! Are there any non makeup products you guys use to get rid of the skincare shine? I've tried oil absorption sheets, but they're pretty ineffective as the shine isn't oil-related in the morning. I like my current skincare products as they've worked the best for my skin problems and don't really want to change them too much, but I'm open to other products as well! Thank you in advance for any and all advice!",

      "content": "I've been growing my hair out for fun cos I've always kept it short and not really healthy. In trying out products and hydrating my hair in general I've learn that my curls are even more curly than I thought - and these days I have coils, 3B I'd say or maybe 3A.\n\nAnd to be honest... I'm not sure I like it. I don't know if it suits me. I think loose curls look the best in general, and I have a rounded, softer facial structure which I'm not sure it's suited for coils.\n\nIf you look at the last two images, that's what my curls were like most of the time previously, and that's what they end up being when I don't wash or take care of my hair. Obviously I'm not saying that's good, it's dry and frizzed to hell, but the looser longer messier style appeals to me, and I want to find the balance of my current hair health with less aggressive curling.\n\nRoutine:\n\nAbout once a week I'll shampoo + conditioner, then I'll apply leave in + Curl cream, then gel, then diffuse, then scrunch with a few drops of jojoba oil. I scrunch my products in general and I do the cupping thing for diffusing.\n\nSo obviously my immediate experiment was to stop scrunching so much. I diffuse cos I'm too impatient to wait for it to dry, but I tried diffusing without cupping. \n\nUnfortunately it didn't really make a difference - just a lot more frizz. The parts that weren't frizzy were still pretty coily.\n\nAnyone have any other ideas? I'm considering stepping up the heat on the diffuser by one (usually I just keep it at minimum). I'm hoping that that won't be enough to damage my hair.",

I will be playing soccer soon and it's very hot and humid in Florida, so I will be sweating a lot\n\nI've tried a few sunscreens in the past, but: \n• Some didn't provide enough sun protection (Neutrogena Clear Face) \n• Others were too heavy or occlusive and caused breakouts when I sweat (LRP Anthelios) \nMy current sunscreen, Purito Daily Soft Touch, works fairly well, and my skin is mostly clear, (just PIE) but heavy sweating has caused the occasional pimple.\n\nI'm looking for a lightweight, non-occlusive, sweat-resistant sunscreen that won't trigger breakouts and won't clog my pores like other sunscreens have. My skin is sensitive to certain products and chemicals like niacinamide and some alcohols, and I am still really sensitive to the sun because of Accutane.\n\nAny suggestions or other advice in general would be greatly appreciated!",
