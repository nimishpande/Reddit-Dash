      "content": "curly hair has been a special interest of mine since I discovered mine in may this year. a friend of mine has gorgeous, waist length, curly hair and after begging for months he finally let me me style it! he never used anything to it other than shampoo &amp; conditioner and oil (loreal) in the ends to comb it and air dry. also, I never ever did someone elses hair before. I don’t even remember purposely touching hair other than mine lol \n\nhis hair seems to be the complete opposite of my hair. he has low porosity hair that tangles like crazy. I read about tangly hair but omg I repeatedly combed it for what felt like hours. in the next second it looks like a family of meerkats live in there. he also has a lot of breakage from brushing it too harsh.\n\nI essentially used my styling products but to wash and condition we used his stuff.\n\nroutine: head&amp;shoulders shampoo and conditioner, bali curls moisture mask in between, balea curling creme, bali curls volume foam, taft 14 gel, microplop with tshirt, diffuse on high heat low fan and vice versa and then scrunch out the crumch with balea plex care oil\n\nside note: some comments on my last post said they would like their hair washed by me and coincidentally this happend lol ",

He actually rates it pretty highly which is pretty rare. He talks about it at 5:35 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgUFHMH99UY).\n\nstudy : [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7373546/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7373546/)\n\nTried to research about it a year ago but apparently it was only sold in South Korea until recently I searched for it on google and they have an international launch from some [Australian website](https://ceraderma.com.au/product/easy-hairfull/) . They also have free international shipping which is nice.\n\nThought it would be interesting for this sub as it is considerably cheaper than other models like irestore/theradome but actually has good clinical efficacy backing from reputable journals unlike the other two. Although its still $679 with discount though which is still pretty expensive. ",

I usually just end up putting it in a bun when it’s like this so it typically dries straight ish and puffy. The 7th photo is after a haircut I got two weeks ago, and she made it look great! But then the 8th photo is same day as haircut and it still just looks dry and puffy on my roots while the ends are more moisturized and defined.  Is there anything I can do to get mine like the last two? \n\nMy routine is:\n- Was hair every two days\n- Once a week clarifying shampoo (Suave)\n- Shea moisture conditioner every wash \n- After shower smooth in hair cream (pillow soft curls) \n- Then curlsmith curl conditioner\n- Lastly scrunch up with gel \n- I mostly shower at night, so I air dry and it dries overnight (barely)\n\nI know there are probably soo many things wrong with my routine, please please help.

The next morning is when i start my routine, and i wet it like crazy and then section off the crown of my head. Then i work in 4in sections on either side of my ear (leaving a section in the back to avoid a part) and run the cream through my hair with fingers followed by the tangle tweezer detangling brush(9 bucks at target). I get the gel and run my hands flat along the sections (normally 3 per section of hair). Then i use the deranged brush to brush style the sections. When i finish the back doing the same method, i part 5 horizontal sections in the crown of my head and do the same thing. I like a side part so after i've styled my curls i work a side part. Then i go over with mousse with flat hands and scrunch. I get a cotton t shirt and scrunch the water out and then i blow dry my hair. I ride a bike to work and now work at an office job. When i ride my bike i claw clip my hair and wear a bandana to protect it from the wind and my hair lasts 5 days, albeit very frizzy on the last day. When i worked retail my hair only lasted a day lol.\n\nANYWAYS LOL \n\nthe first picture was a week ago and the second was two years ago. i'm so proud of myself. I was never taught how to style my hair as a kid and only learned when i moved out over the last few years. I was dying my hair very heavily at one point, split dye black and pink, until i realized how damaged my hair was; it could barely form a curl. I had finger curled my hair on the second picture but it looked so mangly but i was so proud in the moment. So i went all black but then the black faded on the side that was formerly pink, leaving that super light brown you see there. The light brown is only on the old pink side, so half of my head! The other half is the normal dark brown. But once i stopped dying my hair it became so healthy. I am a little overdue for a trim (i trim my own hair) but otherwise i think im doing great!!",

My father has always had a thick head of hair (so did I). Unfortunately though it seems I took after my maternal grandfather, who experienced severe hair loss in his 30's and 40's. (I share my hairline with him)\n\nThe trick is in catching it early. I noticed my hairline receding up on my temples, and severe thinning on the front. I legitimately tried but couldn't grow it back to full thickness. It was the weirdest thing. \n\nI also had hair loss up on my crown area, but not full balding. \n\nI began finastride in Fall of 2023. It completely stopped all hair loss for me, but I didn't see any significant regrowth. I also experimented a bit with minoxidil but I wasn't consistent with the application of it. I also have cats, and it's toxic to them so I stopped out of fear of them getting contaminated with it. \n\nI stopped finastride a few months back and began dutasteride and oral minoxidil. I've been seeing slight increase in thickness, and my hairline is still holding (I'm now 32). I've been able to hold on with maybe some very slight regrowth in thickness thanks to the treatment. \n\nNot sure where I would be on the Norwood scale currently. \n\nI'm hoping if I keep treatment up I can prevent any future hair loss from this point. I just know when I started, within a few months hair loss halted. \n\nIt just barely reversed, but at least it held. \n\nI think the key is in starting early, right when you start noticing it.

      "content": "M23 I have started accutane (isotretinoin) around 2-3 months ago for my acne and folliculitis. I’ve started on a 20mg dose for the first month, then went on 40mg for the second and now the third and the dermatologist is possibly thinking of increasing my dosage to 60mg (close to my body weight) for the next month.\n\nEven tho my acne/ folliculitis isn’t severe, it’s the fact the it occurs in everywhere from my face, shoulders, back, thighs and butt. One of my biggest insecurities is the scarring and the PIH that it leaves behind. Before starting accutane, I did try spot treating with hydroquinone 2% and 4% but that didn’t do much.\n\nHonestly I’m feeling really helpless and for this month, I started breaking out and if anything the PIH looks worse on the new breakouts and idk what I can do about it because I got told to not use actives. I did use a few over the counter products like a Kojic acid bar soap for showers, 10% glycolic acid body lotion and 10% azelaic acid on new spots.\n\nAny advice/ feedback will be very appreciated :/",

Jojoba oil doesn't help. Zyrtec doesn't help. Topical benadryl doesn't help. Exfoliating worsens it. I use Dove soap bars. Not washing my torso (just the 'vital' spots) doesn't help.\n\nThe only thing that is maybe helping is going and sitting in the AC in my car because my house doesn't have AC. And that could just be time passing from the shower.\n\nMy skin looks very normal, at most it's just a little flush. I lose control of everything besides focusing on how unfathomably itchy my body is. I pace finishing my post shower routine so I can sprint downstairs to grab my keys and walk briskly through my apartment complex to my garage.\n\nSweating definitely makes it worse IF I AM NOT ACTIVE. If I am on a walk or doing something active I do not itch one bit. When I get home I don't itch UNTIL my shower is over. Sometimes if I'm sitting on my couch and just a lil sweaty because of no airflow I start to itch as well.\n\nAny ideas at all?

      "content": "hi guys, I am having a hard time finding a cleanser that doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped. I used the cera ve hydrating cleanser for years and absolutely love it but decided to make a switch. I found that I was getting tiny white heads every day and thought maybe that cleanser wasn’t cleaning enough (I know it could have been a different product but I wanted to try a new cleanser first). Well I switched to Soonjung pH 6.5 whip cleanser for about two weeks. I thought that since it’s a “whip” it wouldn’t be drying, but I was wrong. Foaming cleansers tend to be so drying for me so I usually avoid them at all costs. Then I switched to the La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser for Dry Skin and it’s also drying my skin. I find that it also makes my skin burn which was surprising since I see so many people recommend it for dry skin. Here are the products I was using while on the cera ve cleanser: Cera Ve Hydrating cleanser and toner, the ordinary HA serum, Cera Ve AM or PM facial moisturizing lotion. Here are the products I’m using with La Roche Posay cleanser: La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser for Dry Skin, Anua Rice 70 Glow Milky Toner (sometimes), La Roche Posay Lipikar AP + M Triple Repair Body Moistuzing Cream for dry skin, Cera Ve AM or PM facial moisturizing lotion.\n\nAlso, since starting the new cleansers I’m finding that my acne takes forever to go away, if at all. I didn’t experience this with the cera ve cleanser and i’m thinking of switching back and just dealing with the tiny whiteheads. Any advice you guys can give I’ll take.. Please help!!",
