      "content": "curly hair has been a special interest of mine since I discovered mine in may this year. a friend of mine has gorgeous, waist length, curly hair and after begging for months he finally let me me style it! he never used anything to it other than shampoo &amp; conditioner and oil (loreal) in the ends to comb it and air dry. also, I never ever did someone elses hair before. I don‚Äôt even remember purposely touching hair other than mine lol \n\nhis hair seems to be the complete opposite of my hair. he has low porosity hair that tangles like crazy. I read about tangly hair but omg I repeatedly combed it for what felt like hours. in the next second it looks like a family of meerkats live in there. he also has a lot of breakage from brushing it too harsh.\n\nI essentially used my styling products but to wash and condition we used his stuff.\n\nroutine: head&amp;shoulders shampoo and conditioner, bali curls moisture mask in between, balea curling creme, bali curls volume foam, taft 14 gel, microplop with tshirt, diffuse on high heat low fan and vice versa and then scrunch out the crumch with balea plex care oil\n\nside note: some comments on my last post said they would like their hair washed by me and coincidentally this happend lol ",

The next morning is when i start my routine, and i wet it like crazy and then section off the crown of my head. Then i work in 4in sections on either side of my ear (leaving a section in the back to avoid a part) and run the cream through my hair with fingers followed by the tangle tweezer detangling brush(9 bucks at target). I get the gel and run my hands flat along the sections (normally 3 per section of hair). Then i use the deranged brush to brush style the sections. When i finish the back doing the same method, i part 5 horizontal sections in the crown of my head and do the same thing. I like a side part so after i've styled my curls i work a side part. Then i go over with mousse with flat hands and scrunch. I get a cotton t shirt and scrunch the water out and then i blow dry my hair. I ride a bike to work and now work at an office job. When i ride my bike i claw clip my hair and wear a bandana to protect it from the wind and my hair lasts 5 days, albeit very frizzy on the last day. When i worked retail my hair only lasted a day lol.\n\nANYWAYS LOL \n\nthe first picture was a week ago and the second was two years ago. i'm so proud of myself. I was never taught how to style my hair as a kid and only learned when i moved out over the last few years. I was dying my hair very heavily at one point, split dye black and pink, until i realized how damaged my hair was; it could barely form a curl. I had finger curled my hair on the second picture but it looked so mangly but i was so proud in the moment. So i went all black but then the black faded on the side that was formerly pink, leaving that super light brown you see there. The light brown is only on the old pink side, so half of my head! The other half is the normal dark brown. But once i stopped dying my hair it became so healthy. I am a little overdue for a trim (i trim my own hair) but otherwise i think im doing great!!",

      "content": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30064598/\n\n‚ÄúResults were represented as 5Œ±-R2 / GAPDH fold change. Minoxidil treatment resulted in a 0.22 fold change for 5Œ±-R2 (p &lt; 0.0001). This antiandrogenic effect of minoxidil, shown by significant downregulation of 5Œ±-R2 gene expression in HaCaT cells, may be one of its mechanisms of action in alopecia.‚Äù\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4039155/\n\n‚ÄúAll of the above data were obtained in prostate cancer cell lines or in in vitro studies. To extend these findings to skin cells, we tested whether minoxidil has similar effects in HHDPCs (human hair dermal papilla cells) using an AR reporter assay. AR expression in HHDPCs was confirmed at mRNA (Fig. 4A) and protein (Fig. 4B) levels. As shown in Fig. 4C, minoxidil suppressed AR transcriptional activity in a concentration-dependent manner (compare lanes 4 and 5 to lane 2). We further tested minoxidil effects on AR protein stability in HHDPCs. As shown in Fig. 4D, minoxidil induced a concentration-dependent reduction in AR protein stability. These data provide further evidence that the efficacy of minoxidil in treating AGA may involve suppression of AR-related functions.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.dovepress.com/new-target-for-minoxidil-in-the-treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-DDDT\n\n‚ÄúResults: The combined analysis revealed that minoxidil treatment of AGA not only acts on androgenic receptors (AR) but also on 2 new targets, steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase (CYP17A1) and aromatase (CYP19A1). The biological processes linked to these targets were concentrated on several pathways, including enzymes and hormones. Further experiments have revealed that minoxidil suppresses the expression of AR and CYP17A1, boosts the activity of CYP19A1, decreases the formation and binding of dihydrotestosterone, and enhances the production of estradiol. Through these changes, minoxidil acts as a treatment for AGA.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúConclusion: Minoxidil may act by altering hormonal and enzymatic pathways. Our study finds two new targets (CYP17A1, CYP19A1) of minoxidil and demonstrates that minoxidil inhibits AR. These targets may provide new ideas for drug research.‚Äù\n",

He actually rates it pretty highly which is pretty rare. He talks about it at 5:35 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgUFHMH99UY).\n\nstudy : [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7373546/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7373546/)\n\nTried to research about it a year ago but apparently it was only sold in South Korea until recently I searched for it on google and they have an international launch from some [Australian website](https://ceraderma.com.au/product/easy-hairfull/) . They also have free international shipping which is nice.\n\nThought it would be interesting for this sub as it is considerably cheaper than other models like irestore/theradome but actually has good clinical efficacy backing from reputable journals unlike the other two. Although its still $679 with discount though which is still pretty expensive. ",

I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs good to do double layers of the weft on a clip, but I also need to cut it for what size pieces I need. \n\nI saw online about sealing the weft, so do I need to do that regardless of me trimming it into separate pieces? I saw stuff about a hot glue gun to I guess seal the sides? \n\nI just want to make sure I don‚Äôt mess this up and ruin the hair because it wasn‚Äôt cheap, and I feel like I‚Äôm flying blind. \n\nAny and all advice/help is immensely appreciated!

The highest I've been is 190 and starting from may I've gone from 175ish to 155 planning for 135. I've noticed some looseish skin around my butt and am worried about my stomach. I have started the journey to lifting as that would be the biggest thing besides surgery to help with loose skin but I would still like to add another thing to my routine to ease my mind about it.\n\nI've looked at people recommend gold bonds retinol lotion but I'm kinda skeptical cause a product not listing the actual percentage of retinol makes me wonder how much it will actually help vs just using regular lotion. A lot of people also said to use a regular retinol/tretinoin¬†serum mixed with lotion so should I go that route? Again I'm aware that loose skin isn't solved by products but as I'm aware there are things to help or at least be good at preventing loose skin from happening.",

Her routine is after the shower I brush her hair with detangler, put curl cream in her hair, and then she puts on a bonnet before bed. Sometimes in the morning if it‚Äôs crazy I redamp it a little to spring up the curls. But it does look a little wild by the time she gets home. Are there any tips I can use to make it better. For context my hair is bone straight. My daughter is mixed, Italian and black. So her hair texture is a lot different than mine. I‚Äôd love tips and to be educated on how to treat curly hair. ",
