      "content": "curly hair has been a special interest of mine since I discovered mine in may this year. a friend of mine has gorgeous, waist length, curly hair and after begging for months he finally let me me style it! he never used anything to it other than shampoo &amp; conditioner and oil (loreal) in the ends to comb it and air dry. also, I never ever did someone elses hair before. I donâ€™t even remember purposely touching hair other than mine lol \n\nhis hair seems to be the complete opposite of my hair. he has low porosity hair that tangles like crazy. I read about tangly hair but omg I repeatedly combed it for what felt like hours. in the next second it looks like a family of meerkats live in there. he also has a lot of breakage from brushing it too harsh.\n\nI essentially used my styling products but to wash and condition we used his stuff.\n\nroutine: head&amp;shoulders shampoo and conditioner, bali curls moisture mask in between, balea curling creme, bali curls volume foam, taft 14 gel, microplop with tshirt, diffuse on high heat low fan and vice versa and then scrunch out the crumch with balea plex care oil\n\nside note: some comments on my last post said they would like their hair washed by me and coincidentally this happend lol ",

The first photo is my products. The 2-6th photos are ones i took today after I woke up. My hair is half dry in weird spots, and just so frizzy and puffy and feels oily. I usually just end up putting it in a bun when itâ€™s like this so it typically dries straight ish and puffy. The 7th photo is after a haircut I got two weeks ago, and she made it look great! But then the 8th photo is same day as haircut and it still just looks dry and puffy on my roots while the ends are more moisturized and defined.  Is there anything I can do to get mine like the last two? \n\nMy routine is:\n- Was hair every two days\n- Once a week clarifying shampoo (Suave)\n- Shea moisture conditioner every wash \n- After shower smooth in hair cream (pillow soft curls) \n- Then curlsmith curl conditioner\n- Lastly scrunch up with gel \n- I mostly shower at night, so I air dry and it dries overnight (barely)\n\nI know there are probably soo many things wrong with my routine, please please help.

He actually rates it pretty highly which is pretty rare. He talks about it at 5:35 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgUFHMH99UY).\n\nstudy : [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7373546/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7373546/)\n\nTried to research about it a year ago but apparently it was only sold in South Korea until recently I searched for it on google and they have an international launch from some [Australian website](https://ceraderma.com.au/product/easy-hairfull/) . They also have free international shipping which is nice.\n\nThought it would be interesting for this sub as it is considerably cheaper than other models like irestore/theradome but actually has good clinical efficacy backing from reputable journals unlike the other two. Although its still $679 with discount though which is still pretty expensive. ",

The next morning is when i start my routine, and i wet it like crazy and then section off the crown of my head. Then i work in 4in sections on either side of my ear (leaving a section in the back to avoid a part) and run the cream through my hair with fingers followed by the tangle tweezer detangling brush(9 bucks at target). I get the gel and run my hands flat along the sections (normally 3 per section of hair). Then i use the deranged brush to brush style the sections. When i finish the back doing the same method, i part 5 horizontal sections in the crown of my head and do the same thing. I like a side part so after i've styled my curls i work a side part. Then i go over with mousse with flat hands and scrunch. I get a cotton t shirt and scrunch the water out and then i blow dry my hair. I ride a bike to work and now work at an office job. When i ride my bike i claw clip my hair and wear a bandana to protect it from the wind and my hair lasts 5 days, albeit very frizzy on the last day. When i worked retail my hair only lasted a day lol.\n\nANYWAYS LOL \n\nthe first picture was a week ago and the second was two years ago. i'm so proud of myself. I was never taught how to style my hair as a kid and only learned when i moved out over the last few years. I was dying my hair very heavily at one point, split dye black and pink, until i realized how damaged my hair was; it could barely form a curl. I had finger curled my hair on the second picture but it looked so mangly but i was so proud in the moment. So i went all black but then the black faded on the side that was formerly pink, leaving that super light brown you see there. The light brown is only on the old pink side, so half of my head! The other half is the normal dark brown. But once i stopped dying my hair it became so healthy. I am a little overdue for a trim (i trim my own hair) but otherwise i think im doing great!!",

My father has always had a thick head of hair (so did I). Unfortunately though it seems I took after my maternal grandfather, who experienced severe hair loss in his 30's and 40's. (I share my hairline with him)\n\nThe trick is in catching it early. I noticed my hairline receding up on my temples, and severe thinning on the front. I legitimately tried but couldn't grow it back to full thickness. It was the weirdest thing. \n\nI also had hair loss up on my crown area, but not full balding. \n\nI began finastride in Fall of 2023. It completely stopped all hair loss for me, but I didn't see any significant regrowth. I also experimented a bit with minoxidil but I wasn't consistent with the application of it. I also have cats, and it's toxic to them so I stopped out of fear of them getting contaminated with it. \n\nI stopped finastride a few months back and began dutasteride and oral minoxidil. I've been seeing slight increase in thickness, and my hairline is still holding (I'm now 32). I've been able to hold on with maybe some very slight regrowth in thickness thanks to the treatment. \n\nNot sure where I would be on the Norwood scale currently. \n\nI'm hoping if I keep treatment up I can prevent any future hair loss from this point. I just know when I started, within a few months hair loss halted. \n\nIt just barely reversed, but at least it held. \n\nI think the key is in starting early, right when you start noticing it. I'm hoping for some future gains with my current treatment in the next year but I'd imagine I would be way worse off right now if I didn't begin treatment years back. \n\n*I also apply rosemary oil regularly at night time 3-5x a week.

I used to be called young for my age but now my aged appearance is very prominent and I don't look like myself anymore. I've never done skincare in my life because my skin has always been good. Where should I start now that I've been having all of these problems? I don't even know the first thing about skin care and I feel sad I'm aging this early. I don't go outside much either so it's not UV damage. The only change that's taken place in the past year is that I'm now not depressed anymore and I've been smiling more, so I guess that's why I started aging so poorly? Please give advice.",

No combing.\n\nUsed a microfiber towel and air-dried both times.

So, itâ€™s not nearly as full as it used to be and I worry about when the hair/makeup stylist tries to style it for our upcoming big day. \n\nI went to Sallyâ€™s today to get some clip-in extensions for some temporary fullness (tape-in would cause future damage and my hair is too fine for sew-in) and the only color match they had was a weft, so I got some thread, some clips, and the weft (itâ€™s 100% natural human hair). Iâ€™ve read that itâ€™s good to do double layers of the weft on a clip, but I also need to cut it for what size pieces I need. \n\nI saw online about sealing the weft, so do I need to do that regardless of me trimming it into separate pieces? I saw stuff about a hot glue gun to I guess seal the sides? \n\nI just want to make sure I donâ€™t mess this up and ruin the hair because it wasnâ€™t cheap, and I feel like Iâ€™m flying blind. \n\nAny and all advice/help is immensely appreciated!

The highest I've been is 190 and starting from may I've gone from 175ish to 155 planning for 135. I've noticed some looseish skin around my butt and am worried about my stomach. I have started the journey to lifting as that would be the biggest thing besides surgery to help with loose skin but I would still like to add another thing to my routine to ease my mind about it.\n\nI've looked at people recommend gold bonds retinol lotion but I'm kinda skeptical cause a product not listing the actual percentage of retinol makes me wonder how much it will actually help vs just using regular lotion. A lot of people also said to use a regular retinol/tretinoinÂ serum mixed with lotion so should I go that route?
