Second labs now done 11/25, total T is at the upper limit, normal Estrogen, but SHBG over limit.\n\nNo long term sides, except clear semen which is noticeable. Hair loss almost immediately stopped &amp; have maintained and even regrown. \n\nHistorical baseline labs:\n- Total T: between 400-600\n- Free T: between 60-90\n- Estrogen: 25\n\nOther values not available &amp; no immediate test before starting Fin.\n\nLabs 6/24:\n- Total T: 896\n- Free T: 92.2\n- Estrogen: 42\n- SHBG: 50\n- DHT: 24 ng/dL\n\nLabs 11/25:\n- Total T: 1048\n- Free T: 85.9\n- Estrogen: 36\n- SHBG: 55\n- DHT not measured\n\nAlthough the Free T is consistently in range, I’m not sure if I need my Total T to be at the upper limit. Interestingly estrogen is down with SHBG going up, but I now want to adjust dosing to bring all the numbers down.\n\nTo note, physically I am pretty slim: about 120lbs. I did read about the ability of Fin to more greatly alter levels in individuals with low body mass/fat.\n\nAny thoughts on 1mg EOD vs 0.5mg daily?",

I have been trying to be healthy since then with exercise daily, good diet, good skincare routine but to be honest they seem to only be getting more prominent (also not a smoker or drinker). \n\nOn top of this I feel like my skin just looks dull, deflated and an uneven orange peel texture, making me seem much older than I am (some milk spots have also made a com back which I’ve not had since I was a teenager). I fear I may also have some permanent sun damage as well. If anyone has any advice or recommendations I’d love to hear them. \n\nSkin routine\nMorning:\nCleansing followed by sunscreen/moisturiser and re applying sunscreen throughout the day. \nEvening: \nShower, cleanse, retinol serum (not directly under eyes), moisturiser.",

      "title": "How to go back to curls after a pixie cut for 20 years?",
      "content": "When I was 11, I cut my then long and curly hair pixie short. My mom didn’t know how to manage it, and neither did I, and I was tired of all the effort and pain I went through when we tried to brush or style my hair. It was also always tangled because I did competitive swimming and putting on swim caps for training was hell.\n\nI've never had tight curls, but I did have them from my scalp down to the root.\n\nIt’s been just over 20 years, and I’ve decided to see if I could grow my hair out. As it got longer, I definitely saw waves, but not so much curls. It’s now at a point where some of my hair does straight up curl, but the hair near the top of my head is basically just completely straight, and some of it is wavy/semi curly/only curly at the ends and not through-out.\n\nI’m struggling with what I’m supposed to do, which products are good for my hair, etc.\n\nMy hair is really thick and I have a lot of it, so it’s always heavy. I haven’t been colouring it or styling it since I started growing it out 1.5 years ago, so I think it’s not damaged? But it looks like shit. I also cannot for the life of me get “clumps” of curls.\n\nI’ve tried a bunch of different curl product brands, I’ve tried cup diffusing, I scrunch, I’ve tried gel and mousse for holding, I feel like I’m completely lost.\n\nI’ve been to three “curl specialists” and had some pretty mid to bad experiences. One told me she didn’t know how to deal with my specific hair type, but gave me general curly hair tips (which was welcome, but ultimately no different than the information I’ve found on the internet). The second told me there was nothing I could do to take care of my curls, because cutting it short irrevocably damaged my curl pattern, and my hair follicles are now different forever.\n\nThe third gave me a “curly cut” but used a razor, which I’ve read you’re not supposed to do, and then dried my hair with a regular hairdryer, rolling my hair with one of those round brushes, high-heat, burned my scalp twice, and then pinned my hair in curls after every section she blow-dried. Like... yeah... I had curls... until I went outside and it rained...\n\nI've added some pictures of air dried parts of my hair with no product. The straight hair is mostly near the top of my head, whereas the curls are more near the neck. I also have curls near the \"middle\" of my head, but theyre interspersed with the straight hair.\n\nI'm reading so much contradictory information. Do I use protein treatments? Do I use protein shampoo or leave ins? Do I use \"hydrating\" products? What does that even mean?\n\n\nI understand time and hormones can change hair texture and curl patterns, and maybe I won’t ever have the thick head of curls I had as a girl, but since some of my hair curls and some of it is pin straight, surely some combination of products and care should make it at least look presentably wavy or something. Because right now I can only describe it as \"big.\"\n\nPlease help. Any tips you have, any product recommendations, any similar experiences, please send help. I’m losing my mind. And if you know any good curly specialists in the Netherlands, I’d love to hear about them!",

I’m sure I’ll post about my own hair at some point but for now I have a question about my kiddo (15M). He has a lot of adhd going on so hair care has been a challenge. He’s wanting to embrace having longer hair. His current routine is just a regular shampoo and conditioner every day (very oily scalp).  He understands scrunching upside down with wet hair and really he needs nothing else to get the curls to appear. He lets it air dry. But by the end of the day he’s got some frizz. I’d like to find ONE product to introduce him to that could help but not overwhelm him. I don’t think he really needs much for hold, but maybe a curl cream?  If he’s going to have hair this long, I’d like to help him take care of it better. Looking for advice, as I am a wavy (2b/c) girl.",

It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry?

My hair stays dry, frizzy, and full of split ends, and it never really holds its waves. Living in Toronto doesn’t help either — the cold, dry weather makes everything worse. I’m honestly at the point where I’m tired of experimenting because most products end up doing more harm than good.\n\nHere’s what I’ve been using:\n\n\t•\tOlaplex No.4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo – works fine for cleansing, but I notice more shedding whenever I use it.\n\n\t•\tShea Moisture Curl Conditioner – super moisturizing but feels too heavy for my fine waves; it tends to weigh my hair down instead of defining it.\n\n\t•\tMoroccanoil Leave-In Conditioner – smells amazing and makes my hair soft, but it doesn’t help with frizz or definition.\n\n\t•\tMarc Anthony Coconut Oil &amp; Shea Butter Curl Defining Cream – made my hair clump together weirdly and lose volume.\n\nIf anyone has low-porosity, wavy hair and has figured out a routine that actually works — especially something that adds moisture without killing definition — I’d love your help. \n\nAny product suggestions or routine tips would mean so much right now.

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "Hi! I'm super new to skincare. My routine is fairly simple and short, so I've been looking to expand it. I've *never* used a moisturizer before, so I figured I'll start with that. There are so many options out there and I'm super overwhelmed and lost. I don't know what would be a good choice, especially because I'm scared of wasting money. I don't earn enough to spend money left and right and experiment to full will. Thus, I'm afraid of taking big risks. I'd appreciate some advice.\n\nSome extra info if that helps:  \n\\-Skin type: combo (dry in certain areas and oily in others), acne prone, dehydrated, (prone to clogging too?), mild redness &amp; sensitivity.  \n\\-Affordable options (approx. ≤€20), preferably available in-store like a drugstore.  \n\\-Water-based and not too heavy.  \n\\-Current routine: Ziaja cleansing foam face wash, Nivea derma skin clear scrub (2-3x/week), Biodermal facial sunscreen SPF 50+ sensitive (I don't use it often though, because I don't like how oily it makes me feel.)",
