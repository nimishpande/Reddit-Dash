      "title": "Garnier Honey Water is amazing?!?",
      "content": "Over the past year I’ve been dabbling with sulphates and silicones again after YEARS of strict CGM. My scalp had terrible buildup, and my hair always felt weighed down and not so nice. I first started by using the Garnier Honey Treasures line (not to be confused with Honey Water) and was amazed! My hair was so shiny, soft, and bouncy again. However, I was still wary of buildup and other issues with using silicones again, so I’d only use it every now and then.\n\nAfter a while I wanted to try and use more natural products again, not because I was struggling with my hair (it was still so nice!), but because I was so attached to CGM. I felt weird about using the “bad” ingredients even though they were working just fine.\n\nAfter focusing on CGM approved products again, I noticed I was having a rough time with my shampoos. My roots would feel extremely stripped. They felt dry and stiff even under the running water. I found this so confusing as I thought I was using “gentle” sulphate free products. (I tried Renpure, Pantene, AG care, Design Me, some Herbal Essences, Kitsch shampoo bars, etc. All sulphate free).\n\nI figured a shampoo with sulphates was only going to make that problem worse as they’re supposedly much more harsh. However, I decided to give Garnier another try, this time with the Honey Water line.\nAnd WOW. The shampoo only contains one sulphate (I think?) and it felt so amazing while I washed my hair. It didn’t feel stripped at all. It felt moisturized! And the lather was amazing too!\n\nCompared to Honey Treasures, the Honey Water conditioner does not contain silicones, yet the slip was the same if not better. It has a lovely thickness to it and felt so nice in my hair. And what’s more, the matching leave in cream has no silicones either! I used all three and my hair feels incredible. Soft, shiny, and bouncy all over again. Even though the shampoo isn’t strictly CGM due to the sulphates, I like that the rest of the formula is silicone free. \n\nAnyways, just wanted to share this. I’ve been spending lots of money over time trying so many products… and sometimes it really is just that cheap drug store combo that makes your hair pop.\n\nRoutine\n\n1. Shampoo: Garnier Whole Blends Honey Water Shampoo\n\n2. Conditioner: Garnier Whole Blends Honey Water Conditioner\n\n3. Leave-in: Garnier Whole Blends Honey Water Leave-in Cream\n\n4. Gel: Innersense I Create Hold\n\nBefore getting out of the shower, I run my hair under the water and immediately put in the leave-in so it’s as wet as possible. I get out of the shower, then I rake in the Innersense gel and scrunch. I’ll also spritz more water in my hair to get that good squishy sound when I scrunch. Then I finish off by diffusing.\n",

Is it a hair growth issue or a styling issue?\n3- My hair curls well in dry climates, no to limited frizz, but in humid climates it becomes disastrous no hair product can tame\n\nRoutine:\nI shampoo (twice and only at the scalp area) and condition the length of my hair. I use a Japanese brand named Yolu, my hair started looking much better shinier and less frizzy since I started using them (and it smells divine) I brush my hair with the conditioner in, rinse it then VERY GENTLY dry with a microfibre towel. Then I brush it (I just do the hair parting) and let it air dry. I use a silk bonnet to sleep.\n\nWould appreciate any advice on how to fix my issues. I can’t diffuse or do the million step curly hair method. I’m a busy lazy girl who works 75+ hour weeks :’( would appreciate the advice!\n\nI attached photos for reference. ",

Six months ago, I finally got rid of it.  \n  \nAnd here’s the biggest mistake I made for years: I was obsessed with skincare and genuinely believed it was the only way to clear my acne. lmao  \n  \nI tried everything. Like, really everything. Exfoliants, acids, masks, expensive serums… I thought I just hadn’t found the right combo yet. I must have spent over $2000 chasing that “perfect” routine over the years.  \n  \nBut looking back, my obsession with skincare was actually making things worse. I kept switching products, over-exfoliating, drying out my skin barrier, and never giving it time to just HEAL. I know it sounds too easy, but when you’re constantly obsessing over your acne like I was, you forget how to just live like a normal person who simply doesn’t give a f\\* about their skin.  \n  \nWhat finally helped wasn’t another product, it was understanding why I had acne in the first place. For me, it was mostly hormonal and food-related. Once I simplified my routine and started tracking what triggered my breakouts, everything changed.  \n  \nI started noting when pimples appeared, what I ate, my stress levels, sleep, etc. I treated it almost like a job. I personally used an app (mine was called AcneTrack) to log everything, but you can literally do it in a notebook too. The point is: stop chasing miracle products and start looking for patterns. Period  \n  \nIf I could give one piece of advice: keep your skincare simple, eat real food, sleep well, and track your acne. That combo did more for me than years of expensive products ever did.",

I deleted my old post and corrected his and my hair type 😫, I think I was mistakenly 1 number up. I didn’t want all the responses to focus on my mistake!! Posting again. \n\n Hi all. First time here. I’m sure I’ll post about my own hair at some point but for now I have a question about my kiddo (15M). He has a lot of adhd going on so hair care has been a challenge. He’s wanting to embrace having longer hair. His current routine is just a regular shampoo and conditioner every day (very oily scalp).  He understands scrunching upside down with wet hair and really he needs nothing else to get the curls to appear. He lets it air dry. But by the end of the day he’s got some frizz. I’d like to find ONE product to introduce him to that could help but not overwhelm him. I don’t think he really needs much for hold, but maybe a curl cream?  If he’s going to have hair this long, I’d like to help him take care of it better. Looking for advice, as I am a wavy (2b/c) girl.",

      "content": "Hi everyone! Hope you’re all doing well 🤗\n\nMaybe 2 years ago I started using the CeraVe Non-foaming Cleanser, CeraVe AM Moisturizer with sunscreen, CeraVe PM Moisturizer, and tretinoin. (Used in the correct order, not as listed here).\n\nI noticed the AM moisturizer pilled up on my skin when applying. I also noticed more closed comedones and clogged pores when I used it, and my skin felt oily. I stopped using it for that reason, so I also stopped tretinoin.\n\nComedones got less bad when I stopped those two, but were still present. I decided about 3 months ago to switch to a new routine: just tepid water and a microfiber cloth.\n\nI’ve had good results using only water and a CLEAN fresh microfiber cloth for each face “wash.” My skin does not really feel tight and dry after this. In about an hour my face feels “normal” after cleansing.\n\nBut I’d like to get back into anti-aging and sun-protective things. I’d like to be able to use my tretinoin prescription. I think I have sensitive skin because I’m a ginger, and it handled the tretinoin well, but I can’t use it without a sunscreen.\n\nWhat sunscreen would you all recommend for someone very prone to comedones?\n\nI previously used the Olay AM moisturizer with broad spectrum SPF and that also caused comedones.\n\nI used to use the GoldBond Crepe Corrector on my face occasionally, and while a bit heavy, I don’t think it clogged my pores. Just for some reference!\n\nAny advice or feedback is much appreciated!",

My hair stays dry, frizzy, and full of split ends, and it never really holds its waves. Living in Toronto doesn’t help either — the cold, dry weather makes everything worse. I’m honestly at the point where I’m tired of experimenting because most products end up doing more harm than good.\n\nHere’s what I’ve been using:\n\n\t•\tOlaplex No.4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo – works fine for cleansing, but I notice more shedding whenever I use it.\n\n\t•\tShea Moisture Curl Conditioner – super moisturizing but feels too heavy for my fine waves; it tends to weigh my hair down instead of defining it.\n\n\t•\tMoroccanoil Leave-In Conditioner – smells amazing and makes my hair soft, but it doesn’t help with frizz or definition.\n\n\t•\tMarc Anthony Coconut Oil &amp; Shea Butter Curl Defining Cream – made my hair clump together weirdly and lose volume.\n\nIf anyone has low-porosity, wavy hair and has figured out a routine that actually works — especially something that adds moisture without killing definition — I’d love your help. \n\nAny product suggestions or routine tips would mean so much right now.

I don't earn enough to spend money left and right and experiment to full will. Thus, I'm afraid of taking big risks. I'd appreciate some advice.\n\nSome extra info if that helps:  \n\\-Skin type: combo (dry in certain areas and oily in others), acne prone, dehydrated, (prone to clogging too?), mild redness &amp; sensitivity.  \n\\-Affordable options (approx. ≤€20), preferably available in-store like a drugstore.  \n\\-Water-based and not too heavy.  \n\\-Current routine: Ziaja cleansing foam face wash, Nivea derma skin clear scrub (2-3x/week), Biodermal facial sunscreen SPF 50+ sensitive (I don't use it often though, because I don't like how oily it makes me feel.)",

I need your help!\n\nAs per the name, I’m helpless when it comes to most things, especially when it comes to skin care. \n\nI’m approaching this phase in my life when I’m ready to invest in my skin a little - particularly my face. My skin is actually pretty good. I have scars from average teenage acne. I have average size pores. I still get the odd whitehead but no under-the-skin/cystic blemishes anymore. I have natural red and pink undertones. I get hives as well, and quite frequently, just by existing in air. Right now, I want my skin to feel tighter, softer, and reduce redness. I also have a couple chins and feel like I’m getting rounder around my jawline. I also have very sensitive skin and can’t use most scented products. So I have a couple questions:\n\n1) Are those face rollers/sculpting tools worth it? Will these tools help me achieve what I am looking for?\n\n2) What sort of nighttime routine should I get started with? Right now I’m just a face wash and molecular water gal. And Aveeno sensitive skin moisturizer. \n\n3) Please give me all your product recommendations. I’m willing to spend a little money but I don’t need a second mortgage. \n\nThanks team. You’re all beautiful rockstars.",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community.

I have sensitive skin, so it works fine for me, but even when wearing deodorant it hardly takes that off, and I just feel like it doesn't do all that great at actually cleaning. It cleans well, yes, but can someone recommend something that is gentle, but also cleanses really well? Dial? Dove? Any others I should try once this bottle goes out? \n\n\n\nAlso, to add context, I've been using this body wash for a long time, maybe a few years, I think I'm just kinda wanting to see what else is out there. I've used this for so long because it just works, but sometimes it doesn't cut it on some days. ",
