      "content": "Hello, I’ve decided to be a bit vulnerable here. But I thought it would be a good idea to post it anyway, because I want to provide hope for others struggling, either with alopecia or with their curly hair. \n\nIn 2021, I first discovered the alopecia. It started out as a tiny spot, which quickly grew to a large one over time. It got so bad, I was finding hair constantly throughout my home. I finally shaved it off in summer of 2021. In spring of 2022, I started prioritizing my own health, started working out, lost some weight and started taking multivitamins. I didn’t expect it, but my hair, it started growing back! So I let it do its thing. But my previously wavy hair started growing back super curly!\n\nIt was definitely an experience. As it grew back, I ditched my previous habits of heat treating and bleaching, and focused solely on health. No heat treatment, no color of any kind. \n\nNow, my hair is much longer, healthy, and much curlier. It definitely gets less curly the longer it grows, but that is a trade off I’m willing to take. \n\nI still struggle some days, but for the most part I’m very happy with how my hair looks and feels. My curl routine is as follows:\n\nClarify 1-2 times per month with v05 clarifying shampoo. Regular washes 3 times per week with all about curls low lather shampoo, and all about curls conditioner. \n\nI use all about curls gel on the lower half of my hair only, and all about curls mouse through out my whole head. I do this because the mouse is lighter than the gel and I’ve found it doesn’t weigh the roots down nearly as much. \n\nI sleep in a silk hair bonnet to minimize split ends. I’m going to continue growing it out, I think my goal is to eventually have it reach my elbows!\n\nFor anyone struggling with their routine or alopecia, give it time! There’s always hope ❤️",

Stripped of marketing, 1) does older hair need its own formulation 2) can or has it been done? ",

Some people say get bangs, but whenever I have bangs I feel my hair is so thin they just never look good or cover most of my forehead really. \n\nAnother advice I heard was make sure your hair is behind your ears so it doesn’t cover your cheeks because that makes your face look long. But my forehead is huge so it’ll just show off my forehead. My chin is long, and gets even longer when I smile. I have a big long nose that looks even wider when I smile. I’m so frustrated and I feel so unattractive. \n\nAny general advice with makeup or hairstyles or anything would help. My hair length is currently at my chest and I have curtain bangs (which I am struggling to style since I’m not the best at hair and makeup yet.) \n\nBut any tips regarding makeup, hair or anything to make my face look better and more feminine would be greatly appreciated, thank you. \n\n\n",

My nose and forehead get noticeably oily, and I have open pores right above my cheeks.\n​The Dry Problem: The plot thickens! My nose tip and chin get dry and flaky sometimes, especially when I'm regularly using my Tretinoin.\n​Concerns: Prone to pimples and I have some marks/hyperpigmentation from (I know, I know 🤦‍♀️) popping them. I'm working on stopping!\n​Tretinoin Use: I use 0.05% Tretinoin as part of my routine.\n​Need for Toner: I absolutely need a toner to feel \"right\" before applying moisturizer. I can't stand the feeling of moisturizer going directly onto my cleansed skin.\n​Current Toner: I'm using the Simple Soothing Facial Toner right now.\n\n\nTL;DR: Combination skin on 0.05% Tretinoin. Oily T-zone/open pores, plus dry, flaky nose tip and chin due to Tret. Need a budget toner to help with oiliness/pores and hydrate the dry spots, while being safe with Tretinoin.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

It just ends up looking oily AND frizzy. \n\nSo What actually works? \n\nMy hair texture is 90% thick and pin straight, the other 10% range from kinky to coily, and i have babyhairs all along my hairline back and front. \n\nNo curly/wavy methods work because my hair is straight (at least 90% of them are-_-) and no straight hair routines that ive tried work for me either. \n\n\nit looks ugly 24/7 unless i brushed it in the last 30 seconds, every hairstyle is impossible because the frizz just ruins it, it wont hold a curl at all or keep straight if i use a straightener. even a simple ponytail or dutch braids, my frizzy and baby hairs just fall out of them no matter how tight and proper i do them. It seems no matter what i do it looks horrible. I cant style it to cover it or anything. \n\n\nThe frizz is not from damage or lack of moisture, my hair has always been like this, its my 10% of curly hairs poking out of the 90% of straight ones ruining everything. The better i take care of my hair, the worse it looks! \n\nBack when i bleached it i guess the damage made them all go straight, but im trying to grow it out now for a couple years and its just getting progressively uglier as time goes on. Doesnt seem to matter what products i use ive tried every common recommendation within my budget. \n\nHelp please. It seriously harms my confidence to be so pissed off at the frizz every time i look in a mirror. Curly wavy hair looks gorgeous when its frizzy. Straight hair JUST looks dirty and unkempt when its like this. I cant stand it. My natural hair texture is horrible, id give anything for it to actually be straight or wavy or curly instead of an untamable mix of all that looks ugly in every single hairstyle and when its left alone :( how do i fix it?

      "content": "Hi!\n\nI’ve been browsing a bit the past couple of weeks and I’m looking for some advice for my hair for the upcoming dry winter. It’s always dry here but the winter is the worst. I recently figured out I have fine, low porosity curls (probably 2c/3a if that matters). They were great when I lived in a place with some humidity but now they’re kind of dry, frizzy and limp and I’m wondering if I need new products. \n\nI don’t know much about humectants, but recently read they are better in more humid climates? So I’ve been looking for products without humectants and having a really hard time finding many. Also is it just the styling products that I should use without humectants or the shampoo and conditioner as well? \n\nHere’s some of my current routine:\nI just started using the Maui moisture fine curls shampoo and Trader Joe’s rinse out conditioner then the kinky curls leave in after. I only wash my hair once a week. Maybe I need to do another day and just wet it and add more leave in conditioner? I also don’t style my curls that much, I wear it up at work so it’s probably only a once a month type thing that I use styling products. I’ve used Miss Jessie’s Jelly Soft Curls for a long time but it has glycerin. I also diffuse my hair- usually low heat and low speed unless I’m in a hurry then I use the higher speed. I dry it like 80% then air dry the rest of the way and then break the cast. \n\nI came across the Love Ur Curls products recently and the gel has glycerin way down near the end of the ingredient list so I don’t know if that would still be considered a product with a humectant since it’s not one of the first ones? \n\nI know it’s probably some trial and error, but any advice from people in a similar situation is appreciated! Thanks! ",

I look at them every time I look in the mirror. I have been using Tretinoin cream 4 nights a week 0.05% since late August 2025. Should I just try to be patient?\nI also feel like the lines aren't even on both sides.\nLike one side of my mouth has less prominent lines than the other. Am I crazy or is one side of my mouth more lifted than the other?? I will say that I had dental work recently, a temporary crown on the side of my face that looks a little... lower. I've had it for 3 weeks and per the dentist's orders I avoid chewing anything hard or sticky on that side so many it's muscle loss...??\nI try to stay moisturized. I will admit that I drink alcohol every weekend and I'm not the greatest at staying hydrated. I drink a lot of coffee, too. I don't smoke.\nI'm trying to drink more water, a liter a day. Is there anything else I can do? At this point I don't think I'm ready for filler or Botox. Can't afford it and honestly don't think this is the right use case for Botox but let me know if I'm wrong. I would consider micro-needling.\nPlease help :(",

I have Seb derm on my scalp, it’s not an issue on my face but figured I’d mention it\n\nCurrently I am using:\n\nAM\n- cerave foaming cleanser\n- Vitamin C serum (would love brand recs for when this bottle runs out!)\n- cerave SPF\n\nPM\n\n- cerave foaming cleanser\n- Cerave retinol resurfacing serum (I’m on month 2 of using this, I use it every other night, is that okay? Do I need to use it more? And is this brand okay?)\n- cerave PM moisturizer\n\nMy questions:\n\n• I am told i need to exfoliate. I also have a milia on my cheek I’d like help with LOL, I have the ordinary glycolic acid - would that be good to use? And would once per week (on a night I’m not using retinol) be okay? Do I need more frequent use?\n•\t⁠I really liked using snail mucin toner (the brand I had was farmstay)- it just felt so good, if I wanted to add that toner back into my routine, where/when/how often should I use it?\n•\t⁠I also do red light therapy 5-6 nights per week (omnilux mens) - i quite like using the device. Should I be using anything else? Gua sha? Face roller?\n\nI like having a relatively simple routine but am just hoping for some critiques/ suggestions and answers to the above! Also no idea if I’m using these products in the right order or if I’m supposed to wait before applying moisturizer or add it to wet skin etc LOL- thank you so much for your help!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

I really want to achieve a more even and healthy-looking skin tone. I’m already working on my lifestyle: drinking enough water, going to the gym regularly, and following a dermatologist-recommended skincare routine.\n\n\n\nMy dermatologist suggested I go for 6 sessions of glycolic chemical peels and 3 sessions of Q-switch laser. I trust her, but I’m honestly nervous because I don’t want to make my skin worse. I’ve heard mixed things about chemical peels and laser on darker skin tones, so I’d really appreciate hearing from people who have actually had these treatments.\n\n\n\nIf you have a dusky / brown / deeper skin tone, could you please share:\n\n\t•\tWhat your results were like\n\n\t•\tHow long it took before you noticed improvement\n\n\t•\tAny side effects you experienced\n\n\t•\tAnything you wish you knew before you started\n\n\n\nI’d really value real experiences, good or bad. I’m not aiming for whitening, just a more even, glowing, healthy look.\n\n\n\nThank you so much in advance.",

If someone could help answer a few questions for me, I would really appreciate it!!!!\n\n1. I’ve never dyed my hair before. Is it possible to get this fun colour for just a little while, and then revert to my natural hair shade? Or will it still show up forever? Ideally my hair will be perfectly reverted within 3-4 months, but I don’t know if that’s an option.\n\n2. Will this colour look good? My face looks very pink most of the time, and I’m worried this colour may make my insecurities worse. I’m hoping it’s a dark enough shade!\n\nAny advice or opinions would be great! Like I said, I’m super new to this, so any guidance would be a huge help. Thank you!",
