      "content": "Hello, I’ve decided to be a bit vulnerable here. But I thought it would be a good idea to post it anyway, because I want to provide hope for others struggling, either with alopecia or with their curly hair. \n\nIn 2021, I first discovered the alopecia. It started out as a tiny spot, which quickly grew to a large one over time. It got so bad, I was finding hair constantly throughout my home. I finally shaved it off in summer of 2021. In spring of 2022, I started prioritizing my own health, started working out, lost some weight and started taking multivitamins. I didn’t expect it, but my hair, it started growing back! So I let it do its thing. But my previously wavy hair started growing back super curly!\n\nIt was definitely an experience. As it grew back, I ditched my previous habits of heat treating and bleaching, and focused solely on health. No heat treatment, no color of any kind. \n\nNow, my hair is much longer, healthy, and much curlier. It definitely gets less curly the longer it grows, but that is a trade off I’m willing to take. \n\nI still struggle some days, but for the most part I’m very happy with how my hair looks and feels. My curl routine is as follows:\n\nClarify 1-2 times per month with v05 clarifying shampoo. Regular washes 3 times per week with all about curls low lather shampoo, and all about curls conditioner. \n\nI use all about curls gel on the lower half of my hair only, and all about curls mouse through out my whole head. I do this because the mouse is lighter than the gel and I’ve found it doesn’t weigh the roots down nearly as much. \n\nI sleep in a silk hair bonnet to minimize split ends. I’m going to continue growing it out, I think my goal is to eventually have it reach my elbows!\n\nFor anyone struggling with their routine or alopecia, give it time! There’s always hope ❤️",

I don’t break out much these days, but the leftover marks and enlarged pores just won’t go away.\n\nCould anyone recommend what might help with this? Maybe something for pore appearance and fading these spots over time  like exfoliants, niacinamide, or any beginner-friendly products that actually work? I’d also love to know if it looks more like post acne pigmentation or something else.\n",

It takes a few hours for it to wear off. I’m sick of looking weird before going out everyday does anyone know any solutions? Or any dietary causing things that might be doing it\n\nI usually eat plain greek yogurt from fage, 2-3 large eggs a day, possibly a persimmon or two a day, 1 bottle of fresh coconut water, those mini packs of seaweed, a serving of potato chips that are about 150 calories 95mg sodium, about 1 bottle of water, definitely a bunch of fruit. I do eat vegetables but it depends on what my parents put on the table. I eat other things btw, but these are the consistent items I have everyday. I love eating eggs! We don’t have spinach right now, which I’m planning to get tomorrow. Would that help? I think I eat around 1000 to 1900 calories a day that’s just an estimate though\n\nIt’s been bothering me because I just wanna wake up looking normal 💔\n\nShould I try sleeping upright? I try to do that but it’s really hard to fall asleep that way and I end up waking up on my back, which is how I usually sleep. \n\nThank you for any advice! 😋 sorry if something doesn’t make sense I wrote this in a rush I can clarify anything\n\n\n\n\n",

I accidentally brushed/crushed it, and it left a nasty burn-like lesion that later turned dark. The skin healed, but now there’s a dark, uneven mark where it was — looks like a post-inflammatory spot.\n\nI’ve been cleansing gently and applying aloe vera gel, but it hasn’t faded much. The area also feels a bit rough in texture.  \nFor context: my skin is on the **drier side**, and I’m prone to small whitehead-type pimples sometimes.\n\nCan anyone suggest products or routines to help fade the mark and smooth the texture — preferably things that won’t irritate sensitive or dry skin?  \nI don't have any knowledge regarding skin care ,\n\nas long as i remember , i wash my face with Himalaya face wash , then apply moisturizer , that all\n\nAny advice or product recs (especially available in India) would be super helpful 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

He’s declined quickly since then and it’s very likely that he only has a few days left. He’s my first and only dog I’ve ever had, I rescued him 8 years ago and he’s been with me for the majority of my adult life. I thought I’d have at least a few more years with him, especially because of how happy and healthy he seemed less than a week ago, and these last few days have been devastating.\n\nWhy I’m here: my poor eyelids are so incredibly irritated. I’ve been crying off and on all day every day for over a week, and I think the constant saltiness from the tears and wiping of my eyes (whether it’s just my hands or with a tissue) has made them so irritated and sensitive. I’m wondering if there’s a product I can use that will soothe them but also won’t sting my eyes if I start crying again. I know I’m in for at least a few more days of this.\n\nEverything hurts already, and this small thing feels like it’s within my control. I’d appreciate any advice, and just any kindness in general.",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
