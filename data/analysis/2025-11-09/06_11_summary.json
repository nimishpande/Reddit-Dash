      "content": "Hello, I’ve decided to be a bit vulnerable here. But I thought it would be a good idea to post it anyway, because I want to provide hope for others struggling, either with alopecia or with their curly hair. \n\nIn 2021, I first discovered the alopecia. It started out as a tiny spot, which quickly grew to a large one over time. It got so bad, I was finding hair constantly throughout my home. I finally shaved it off in summer of 2021. In spring of 2022, I started prioritizing my own health, started working out, lost some weight and started taking multivitamins. I didn’t expect it, but my hair, it started growing back! So I let it do its thing. But my previously wavy hair started growing back super curly!\n\nIt was definitely an experience. As it grew back, I ditched my previous habits of heat treating and bleaching, and focused solely on health. No heat treatment, no color of any kind. \n\nNow, my hair is much longer, healthy, and much curlier. It definitely gets less curly the longer it grows, but that is a trade off I’m willing to take. \n\nI still struggle some days, but for the most part I’m very happy with how my hair looks and feels. My curl routine is as follows:\n\nClarify 1-2 times per month with v05 clarifying shampoo. Regular washes 3 times per week with all about curls low lather shampoo, and all about curls conditioner. \n\nI use all about curls gel on the lower half of my hair only, and all about curls mouse through out my whole head. I do this because the mouse is lighter than the gel and I’ve found it doesn’t weigh the roots down nearly as much. \n\nI sleep in a silk hair bonnet to minimize split ends. I’m going to continue growing it out, I think my goal is to eventually have it reach my elbows!\n\nFor anyone struggling with their routine or alopecia, give it time! There’s always hope ❤️",

It takes a few hours for it to wear off. I’m sick of looking weird before going out everyday does anyone know any solutions? Or any dietary causing things that might be doing it\n\nI usually eat plain greek yogurt from fage, 2-3 large eggs a day, possibly a persimmon or two a day, 1 bottle of fresh coconut water, those mini packs of seaweed, a serving of potato chips that are about 150 calories 95mg sodium, about 1 bottle of water, definitely a bunch of fruit. I do eat vegetables but it depends on what my parents put on the table. I eat other things btw, but these are the consistent items I have everyday. I love eating eggs! We don’t have spinach right now, which I’m planning to get tomorrow. Would that help? I think I eat around 1000 to 1900 calories a day that’s just an estimate though\n\nIt’s been bothering me because I just wanna wake up looking normal 💔\n\nShould I try sleeping upright? I try to do that but it’s really hard to fall asleep that way and I end up waking up on my back, which is how I usually sleep. \n\nThank you for any advice! 😋 sorry if something doesn’t make sense I wrote this in a rush I can clarify anything\n\n\n\n\n",

I cant use several makeup and skincare products which used to be fine for me. For example, the setting spray i used to have no issue with now burns immediately after applying.\n\nEvery face wash i try causes a burning sensation, and my face becomes bright red, hot, and very irritated. Ive tried cetaphil, spectro, the ordinary glycolipid cleanser, the ordinary squalane cleanser, skin 1004 centella cleanser, la roche posay effaclar foaming gel, and bonnyhill rice foam cleanser, and they all do this. \n\nIve been to an allergist, unfortunately she acted like i was wasting her time the entire session, and refused to test me. Said she cant do testing since its contact dermatitis and not a true allergy, and dermatologists will only test for metal allergies (which im fairly confident isnt true). \n\nDove baby wash doesnt seem to cause the reaction (at least not to the extreme that everything else does), but is very drying and worsens my acne.

I went to a dermatologist back when I was prepubescent and used epiduo and some other products for a while but I did not have great adults in my life and wasn't able to keep up with anything regularly. I do not remember if those products did end up helping at all. My acne isn't cystic or anything but I have quite literally never went a day without some sort of blemish. I have very large pores and ALWAYS have black heads on my chin and nose no matter how much I pick at them and am constantly breaking out with large pimples. That's another thing, I am a chronic picker, I am really trying to be better about that though. I have no sort of skin care routine as of right now except for a basic moisturizer because I kind of gave up on fixing my skin for a while there. I did just receive my free curology trial but I honestly don't even want to try it after seeing how much I would have to spend to keep up with it and would love to be able to just find some over the counter products to help me feel better in my skin. As mentioned above, I am a mom to two littles, I had them back to back and have struggled a lot with self care so this is part of that journey of getting my own self identity back! Thank you so much in advance!!!",

My only real experience with skincare has been trying acne products like benzoyl peroxide, but none of them have worked all that well and I never really got deeper into skincare, figuring my acne would make it aesthetically pointless anyway. My doctor has recommended using a cleanser and moisturizer daily to handle the effects of the medication - anyone here have a product (or products) that's worked well for them in keeping skin healthy throughout this process? My skin is already very oily so I'm not sure what I should be using to cut through all the nastiness whilst also not drying everything out excessively, especially since the Accutane and dry air from central heating will be contributing as well. I've tried Cerave moisturizing cream before for the winter dryness but it made my skin feel so greasy I could hardly stand it!",

My routine goes as:\n\nMorning:\n1. Cerave foaming cleanser\n2. Witch hazel toner\n3. Cerave moisture for normal to dry skin\n4. Cerave sunscreen spf 50\n\nNighttime:\n1. Cerave foaming cleanser\n2. Panoxyl acne bar\n3. Witch hazel toner\n4. Cerave moisturizer\n\nI figured that this wasn’t a too crazy one that I might see a little results, but honestly I have no clue what’s going on and the more research I do the more confused I get. If anything my acne has been getting worse all around lately but I only started using Panoxyl maybe 2-3 weeks ago.\nAlso if it helps I believe my skin is oily in the T zone and my cheeks stay pretty dry",

I currently co-wash with Suave Essentials Clarifying Conditioner for regular wash days and use Suave Essentials Clarifying Shampoo every month for removing build-up. My hair is low porosity, highly dense,and fine.I'm thinking of buying the shampoo and conditioner from Aussie's line. Please help! ",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
