Rake shea moisture curl smoothie through hair, then use bowl method. Scrunch out as much water as i can with my hands, then scrunch out excess water with towel, scrunch in xtreme pro expert and diffuse upside down, scrunch out crunch with &amp;honey melty repair oil.

The back/top/center of my hair is also low porosity and does NOT hold water well and I always had trouble getting any definition there but now my hair is even with this product. First 2 pics are wash day, 2nd two are next day. I don't break the cast. We'll see how the rest of the week goes. Got a long walk to an appointment tomorrow no idea what the weather is.\n\nRoutine this time was clarify, wash with curlsmith moisturizing shampoo, deep condition with amika (protein), rinse with cold water, redken acidic bonding 16%, chi thermal protectant, pretty curl girl strong hold gel, brush and then define and scrunch. I did add a tiny bit extra all over and the top right before diffusing.\n\nOh yeah and the cast sets quicker than the curlsmith souffle gel I was using. I wanted a cheaper price point and this new one is not cheaper but if it works better/longer then I will use less often and hopefully save money. It's concentrated so it says use less but I feel like I still used kind of a lot. Only comes in 100 or 250ml I think. Hopefully the place selling it restocks soon because it's like 30% off right now ;-;",

      "content": "hi!\n\nI'm sick and tired of my hair never looking anywhere similar the day after I shower ;(. I've tried a bonnet before but I think my personal issue is my hair gets under me while i sleep, flattening it. So, the bonnet doesnt help. My hair is thin and not that long so when I try to put it up to sleep in, the hair tie/scrunchie crushes it all, i guess. So, putting it up flattens it more basically. I have a satin pillowcase too.\n\nIn the picture I know my roots are also flat which I don't like. However, I'm trying to focus on one issue at a time (My hair flattening when I sleep) so I'm not worrying about that right now but I'll still take any advice. I think my hair is 3a. Also, my hair is still a bit wet from my shower in the picture but it looks like how it usually does after I shower by now (more or less)\n\nMy routine:  \n  \nShea moisturizer conditioner and shampoo. I brush my hair in the shower with the conditioner with a brush. After I shower, I use Carol's Daughter born to repair curl cream to brush my hair with my hands and then I do the ouidad method (idk if thats what people actually call it lol) and like \"flick\" my hair so it curls naturally. Then, I take the Curl Quencher ouidad gel and scrunch my hair with my hands. Then, I use a towel to continue scrunching.  \n  \nI just got a shea moisture mousse to try as I have thin hair and ive heard that mousse is better than gel for that reason. But I have used a different mousse before and i didn't see a difference between it and the gel honestly. I used the shea moisture mousse for the first time today. I let my hair air dry. \n\nI appreciate any advice! Thx in advanced\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ephttk8spa0g1.png?width=590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dd9bc354a5e9d67fd208e971a12446f0d363503\n\n",

I had great gain and thickening, followed by stopping my hair fall. Last september I added 1x 0.5mg dut to my 7x 1mg fin regimen. I even improved my hair thickness for 6 months. BUT I started to shed after the end of this 6 month.\n\nIn march 2025 I started to shed like crazy… This shed lasted until today, and still going. I tried to increase my dut dosage up to x2 and x3 with x7 fin per week but nothing changed.\n\nTo clarify, I do not use generic brands. Only propecia and avodart.\n\nSo, the question rises now: What should I do?\n\nA) Stop dutasteride fully because it gives damage (?) to my hair and only stick with finasteride. 9 month is already enough.\n \nB) 2-3x dut is not enough so increase it to ED.\n\nFor the option A,\nI do find it weird to be honest because some people say that I might not be responding enough to dut But dont forget, I have never stopped using 7x fin.\n\nCould you guys help me, or just share your ideas please? I am planning to see a doctor but they are generally useless since they are mainly not pro fin/dut in my country.\n\nI appreciate all the support \n\nBest",

I definitely know I responded to it because I did see a few baby hairs that eventually did grow into full strands but those have been very few and far between and now my worst areas are the thinnest they’ve ever been. I switched to dutasteride last week in hopes that maybe that will help but idk anymore. \n\nTo those of you who switched to oral Min, did you lose an insane excess of hair even after the initial first 6 months? \n\nJust feeling like I might be a bit cooked",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I've been on spironolactone for years now which I feel like has barely done anything for the little bumps on my back and chest. I've seen two dermatologists who both told me shit like \"you don't really have bacne, just hyperpigmentation\", and \"the best treatment is time\". I'm sick of waiting and want some OTC options from people who have dealt with something similar on their body. \n\nHere's what I'm doing now which has probably helped keep more acne at bay, but it's not aggressive enough for the texture and hyperpigmentation:\n\n* Neutrogena salicylic acid body wash (usually leave on for a few minutes)\n* Glycolic acid 7% toner\n* salux cloth once a week\n* washing my back after rinsing conditioner out of my hair\n* try to shower everyday (sometimes I go a day without doing it)\n\nI've used stridex wipes in the past which helped with active breakouts but not the texture/hyperpigmentation. I change my sheets twice a month which I know isn't often enough, but I don't believe that's the main cause. Recently, I've tried a prescription sulfur body wash and benzoyl peroxide wash, but I haven't been using them consistently. I don't regularly moisturize my back although I think it would help, I just don't know which moisturizer is best. I'd appreciate any recommendations!",

I look at them every time I look in the mirror. I have been using Tretinoin cream 4 nights a week 0.05% since late August 2025. Should I just try to be patient?\nI also feel like the lines aren't even on both sides.\nLike one side of my mouth has less prominent lines than the other. Am I crazy or is one side of my mouth more lifted than the other?? I will say that I had dental work recently, a temporary crown on the side of my face that looks a little... lower. I've had it for 3 weeks and per the dentist's orders I avoid chewing anything hard or sticky on that side so many it's muscle loss...??\nI try to stay moisturized. I will admit that I drink alcohol every weekend and I'm not the greatest at staying hydrated. I drink a lot of coffee, too. I don't smoke.\nI'm trying to drink more water, a liter a day. Is there anything else I can do? At this point I don't think I'm ready for filler or Botox. Can't afford it and honestly don't think this is the right use case for Botox but let me know if I'm wrong. I would consider micro-needling.\nPlease help :(",

I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "Hi!\n\nI’ve been browsing a bit the past couple of weeks and I’m looking for some advice for my hair for the upcoming dry winter. It’s always dry here but the winter is the worst. I recently figured out I have fine, low porosity curls (probably 2c/3a if that matters). They were great when I lived in a place with some humidity but now they’re kind of dry, frizzy and limp and I’m wondering if I need new products. \n\nI don’t know much about humectants, but recently read they are better in more humid climates? So I’ve been looking for products without humectants and having a really hard time finding many. Also is it just the styling products that I should use without humectants or the shampoo and conditioner as well? \n\nHere’s some of my current routine:\nI just started using the Maui moisture fine curls shampoo and Trader Joe’s rinse out conditioner then the kinky curls leave in after. I only wash my hair once a week. Maybe I need to do another day and just wet it and add more leave in conditioner? I also don’t style my curls that much, I wear it up at work so it’s probably only a once a month type thing that I use styling products. I’ve used Miss Jessie’s Jelly Soft Curls for a long time but it has glycerin. I also diffuse my hair- usually low heat and low speed unless I’m in a hurry then I use the higher speed. I dry it like 80% then air dry the rest of the way and then break the cast. \n\nI came across the Love Ur Curls products recently and the gel has glycerin way down near the end of the ingredient list so I don’t know if that would still be considered a product with a humectant since it’s not one of the first ones? \n\nI know it’s probably some trial and error, but any advice from people in a similar situation is appreciated! Thanks! ",
