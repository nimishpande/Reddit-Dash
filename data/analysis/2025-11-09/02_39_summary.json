      "content": "Hello, I’ve decided to be a bit vulnerable here. But I thought it would be a good idea to post it anyway, because I want to provide hope for others struggling, either with alopecia or with their curly hair. \n\nIn 2021, I first discovered the alopecia. It started out as a tiny spot, which quickly grew to a large one over time. It got so bad, I was finding hair constantly throughout my home. I finally shaved it off in summer of 2021. In spring of 2022, I started prioritizing my own health, started working out, lost some weight and started taking multivitamins. I didn’t expect it, but my hair, it started growing back! So I let it do its thing. But my previously wavy hair started growing back super curly!\n\nIt was definitely an experience. As it grew back, I ditched my previous habits of heat treating and bleaching, and focused solely on health. No heat treatment, no color of any kind. \n\nNow, my hair is much longer, healthy, and much curlier. It definitely gets less curly the longer it grows, but that is a trade off I’m willing to take. \n\nI still struggle some days, but for the most part I’m very happy with how my hair looks and feels. My curl routine is as follows:\n\nClarify 1-2 times per month with v05 clarifying shampoo. Regular washes 3 times per week with all about curls low lather shampoo, and all about curls conditioner. \n\nI use all about curls gel on the lower half of my hair only, and all about curls mouse through out my whole head. I do this because the mouse is lighter than the gel and I’ve found it doesn’t weigh the roots down nearly as much. \n\nI sleep in a silk hair bonnet to minimize split ends. I’m going to continue growing it out, I think my goal is to eventually have it reach my elbows!\n\nFor anyone struggling with their routine or alopecia, give it time! There’s always hope ❤️",

It started on my forehead but eventually spread all over my cheeks and face. I’m talking deep small bumps that wouldn’t go away no matter what over the counter brand I used.\n\nThe first time I went to a dermatologist was last year, she gave me tazaren cream for oily skin (0.1%) every night for 3-4 months. I introduced it gradually, suffered A LOT of peeling but after a while my skin was perfect, shiny and glassy. But I stopped using it as instructed and my acne came right back in a span of some weeks.\n\nSo I went to another dermatologist this summer. I was prescribed tazaren again and errybenz benzoyl peroxide (tube A, 2.5%), alternating between nights. In about two months my acne had improved and there was no irritation, even though i was sun bathing and going to the beach daily.\n\nI then went back and was prescribed epiduo (0.1%/2.5%) in the mornings, daily. I started using it as planned cause I had no idea what it could do. After about 1-2 weeks I noticed my skin getting very irritated so I stopped everything to give my skin a break.\n\nHowever, when I started my routine again, benzoyl peroxide would make my right eye red and itchy. Now whenever I use benzoyl peroxide on my face it ends up patchy, red and itchy. I starter contact therapy (20 mins) but I don’t feel like it’s doing anything.\n\nI have also noticed some new bumps on my forehead and blackheads on my cheeks. So,\nI tried adapalene yesterday for the first time in like 2 months and my eye is now red and somewhat itchy, the rest of my face is just a tiny bit red.\n\nI can’t visit my derm cause I study in another town, but after texting her she told me that the redness is normal and desirable. (doesnt feel that way lmao.)\n\nWhat should I do moving on? I truly am exhausted of dealing with my skin and being afraid to go outside.",

      "title": "How to go back to curls after a pixie cut for 20 years?",
      "content": "When I was 11, I cut my then long and curly hair pixie short. My mom didn’t know how to manage it, and neither did I, and I was tired of all the effort and pain I went through when we tried to brush or style my hair. It was also always tangled because I did competitive swimming and putting on swim caps for training was hell.\n\nI've never had tight curls, but I did have them from my scalp down to the root.\n\nIt’s been just over 20 years, and I’ve decided to see if I could grow my hair out. As it got longer, I definitely saw waves, but not so much curls. It’s now at a point where some of my hair does straight up curl, but the hair near the top of my head is basically just completely straight, and some of it is wavy/semi curly/only curly at the ends and not through-out.\n\nI’m struggling with what I’m supposed to do, which products are good for my hair, etc.\n\nMy hair is really thick and I have a lot of it, so it’s always heavy. I haven’t been colouring it or styling it since I started growing it out 1.5 years ago, so I think it’s not damaged? But it looks like shit. I also cannot for the life of me get “clumps” of curls.\n\nI’ve tried a bunch of different curl product brands, I’ve tried cup diffusing, I scrunch, I’ve tried gel and mousse for holding, I feel like I’m completely lost.\n\nI’ve been to three “curl specialists” and had some pretty mid to bad experiences. One told me she didn’t know how to deal with my specific hair type, but gave me general curly hair tips (which was welcome, but ultimately no different than the information I’ve found on the internet). The second told me there was nothing I could do to take care of my curls, because cutting it short irrevocably damaged my curl pattern, and my hair follicles are now different forever.\n\nThe third gave me a “curly cut” but used a razor, which I’ve read you’re not supposed to do, and then dried my hair with a regular hairdryer, rolling my hair with one of those round brushes, high-heat, burned my scalp twice, and then pinned my hair in curls after every section she blow-dried. Like... yeah... I had curls... until I went outside and it rained...\n\nI've added some pictures of air dried parts of my hair with no product. The straight hair is mostly near the top of my head, whereas the curls are more near the neck. I also have curls near the \"middle\" of my head, but theyre interspersed with the straight hair.\n\nI'm reading so much contradictory information. Do I use protein treatments? Do I use protein shampoo or leave ins? Do I use \"hydrating\" products? What does that even mean?\n\n\nI understand time and hormones can change hair texture and curl patterns, and maybe I won’t ever have the thick head of curls I had as a girl, but since some of my hair curls and some of it is pin straight, surely some combination of products and care should make it at least look presentably wavy or something. Because right now I can only describe it as \"big.\"\n\nPlease help. Any tips you have, any product recommendations, any similar experiences, please send help. I’m losing my mind. And if you know any good curly specialists in the Netherlands, I’d love to hear about them!",

      "content": "Hello everyone! I come in search of any advice possible. I am the only one in my entire family with curls and I have had to learn a lot on my own but I feel I am starting to miss certain areas. Any optimization to the routine or products would be super appreciated! I have 3c curls (as far as I’m aware), and have been dealing with a few issues regarding slight breakage, inconsistent texture on my strands of hair, small little knots on the ends of my hair which I just break off, and lots and lots of frizz which I’d call that the main issue. Also I get some split ends but it’s pretty rare as far as I’m aware. I live in Texas so humid air is always an issue here. I use Aunt Jackie products (transform and curl la la) as well as Aussie conditioner when I do wash my hair, which is about every 3-4 days. I always let it air dry with at most patting it dry right out of the shower and there’s usually not a day I don’t put both products in right after. I will say I do not brush nearly enough about every 7-10 days and by that point my hair is a big knotted, matted mess and it will take a couple of hours if I want to do it painlessly. I feel it shouldn’t be as bad as it gets though yet it could be for all I know. I do use a curl brush but it’s starting to wear down so I was looking into tangle teezer. Never dry brushing always in the shower btw. I do wear a bonnet to bed but I feel it might be too small as I have to tuck my hair in and by the time I wake up it’s a form fitted almost knot of hair. My curls are always decently defined after brushing product through but as soon as everything dries, I get very frizzy hair. I’m also overdue for a trim but I’m honestly not sure if that’s true because I have no reference point lol. Any questions to further clarify my routine will be answered asap! Thank you to anyone who helps in advance! Any advice appreciated! (Sorry if the censorship is weird lol I don’t like my face on the internet but that’s the best pic of my hair on an average day no brushing)",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
