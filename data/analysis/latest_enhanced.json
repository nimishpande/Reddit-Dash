Minimalist Sunscreen SPF 50\n\nThe “everyday reliable coworker” of sunscreens  never misses a deadline but lacks personality.\n\nLightweight and budget-friendly, but that alcohol smell lingers longer than your ex’s texts.\n\nVerdict: Solid performer, no spark.\n\n\n\n3. Fixderma Shadow SPF 50\n\nMore like Thickderma. Great protection, but the texture could double as cake batter.\n\nIf you’re oily-skinned, this will have you looking like you moisturized with candle wax.\n\nVerdict: Best for dry skin winters only.\n\n\n\n4. Re’equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch\n\nMatte? Yes. Dry touch? Sure. Comfortable? That’s a no.\n\nIt’s like applying successively smaller layers of chalk.\n\nBut hey, it’s one of the few that actually controls sweat.\n\nVerdict: Good for Athletes. Functional, not romantic.\n\n\n\n5. Dot &amp; Key Watermelon Cooling Sunscreen\n\nSmells great, feels cute, and then proceeds to melt faster than your patience in Delhi summer.\n\nGood for “I’m-just-running-to-the-café” days, not for actual sun exposure.\n\nVerdict: Influencer energy, not athlete energy.",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

For at least a year, I’ve been completely soaking my hair twice a DAY: once in the morning to style it (product and everything) and once at night while showering.\n\nBecause I want my hair to be healthy, I decided to start a new routine of having a wash day (night technically) followed by two full days of leaving my hair dry. This routine began last night:\n\n- conditioned hair in shower, brushed it out with wet brush under cool water\n- out of shower, applied It’s A 10 Miracle Leave-In Potion, Love Ur Curls Step 3, Love Ur Curls Irish Sea Moss Gel (a good palmful), and scrunched\n- left completely alone to get crunchy, stiff, and completely dry\n- loosely tied up in a pineapple and slept on satin pillowcase\n- woke up next day, lightly misted some parts with spray conditioner/water mix to try and get rid of frizzy strands (a forlorn effort, they’re still there in my picture)\n\nI’m honestly pretty happy with it, though mostly because I didn’t have to style it this morning and wait three hours for it to dry. I don’t expect it to be beautiful by the end of the day though, let alone tomorrow without a full refresh (I might trim my routine down to 48 hours between washes unless someone tells me otherwise).\n\nDoes anyone have any feedback on my day one post-sleep hair or recommendations on ways to get rid of the little frizzy/straight strands lingering?\n\n",

I wanted to give them some time to grow before the wedding and my hair dresser, who I’ve been seeing for 5ish years at this point, said she was going to cut them a little shorter than usual so they’d be at my eyebrows by the wedding. I was totally okay with this as it made sense. However, I’ve never had my bangs come out this uneven before. First two pictures are after just brushing and the second two are after using some heat to even them out. The uneven-ness is definitely better than before but they still look weird. My fiancé said the longer he looks at them the more bowl cut-ish they look — I asked for him to be honest with me and it was exactly what I had been thinking\n\nDoes this look that bad to others? How do I make these decent for my wedding? I never would have thought my hair stylist would have cut them like this since she’s never given me a bad haircut before, let alone just a bang trim. I’m going to talk to my hair stylist for the wedding and let her know.\n\nI’m trying to not freak out over them since I know there’s still a little time but I really hate how they look and have no idea how to deal with them. Any advice is appreciated!\n",

I wash my face like 4 to 5 times a week, first oil cleanse and after that i use a 100% natural light face foam to clean. I also use like 1 or 2 times a week either retinol, some kind of salicylic acid/blemish control/AHA BHA or bakuchiol peptide and toner after washing. For moisturising i use a 100% natural vitamin C cream.\n\nI dont know what im doing wrong and ive never found the solution to stop this from happening and taking these blackheads away.\n\nI noticed that using oil after washing to moisturise my skin is making it worse, so not doing that anymore. My skin is pretty sensitive so i usually dont try to stress it too much with all kinds of serums.\n\nIf someone could help me, id really appreciate it ❤️🙏 I am a 21 year old woman btw if thats necessary info",

Then tried what my skin used to like a long time ago with Ole Henrisken only to discover that Sephora doesn't carry it anymore so i tried something else and it immediately bothered my skin so i returned it right away (i don't even have sensitive skin) and now trying the Innisfree green tea set that the lady there suggested for me. \n\nI do like it a lot better. I like the gentleness of it. My skin healed shockingly fast and looks very even toned and bright right now which is what i want, but my skin is STILL SO DRY. My forehead especially. It becomes flaky and really tight only a couple hours into my work day, and when i go home for lunch, i have to put more on. My forehead has begun to lightly sting when i use certain things which i won't be doing again until this dryness is solved.\n\nThis morning, i even tried to put on my night rosehip oil and BOTH of my serums hoping it would help and STILL. Before my lunch even arrives, i HAVE to use my hand lotion to ease the discomfort of tightness because i just cannot stand the feeling of dry skin. My hand lotion is amazing for my hands but still doesn't help when im desperate. \n\nI live in Canada and winter is on its way where it gets quite dry but i was already having issues with the dry skin in the summer. I don't remember always having dry skin, this feels like a fairly new change (aside from the fact that winter is usually a bit more dry, otherwise, i've always had pretty \"normal\" skin).\n\nI've also tried for some time now to push my face moisturizer into my hair line because it feels like the dryness of my forehead carries into my hairline but i don't want to make my hair greasy either... maybe thats another post for the haircare sub.\n\nAnyway, i like a dewy, glowy, even toned skin, and clearly need much better moisture. Does anyone have any suggestions on ANYTHING to achieve all of these desires/needs? I will admit... I'm big on pretty packaging and i'm sure that's whats holding me back from actually finding something that my skin loves and i might just have to suck it up lolol.",

So I started using Peter thomas Roth water drench moisturizer and Paula’s choice toner. My acne IMMEDIATELY came back and went from the first picture to the second. It’s now been 4 months since the first photo and I still can’t get my skin to settle down. I wash my face with innisfree green tea face wash 2x per day, ordinary hylauronic acid serum at night and neutrogena hydro moisturizer. My biggest issue is picking, I have ADHD so it’s been really difficult. But even when I stop picking, I notice more pimples coming up on my cheeks right beside where the old pimples were. How do I get the white bumps (almost the stage right before they turn red, not white heads) gone before they start to rise? Any tips on how to heal my skin and get it back to where it was. First pic is me before PTR moisturizer and Paula’s choice toner, second photo is after. Third photo is the worst my skin got using the above mentioned products (plus others for damage control that did not work), 4th pic is what my skin used to look like before the closed comedones (and weight training 5 days a week). 5th pic is my skin today, first day off my period. Please help. I’m feeling helpless, and although this isn’t the worst my skin has ever been, I’ve had clear skin and I know I can get it again. Anyone with similar acne please comment products that worked for you. ",

Returns can be a hassle, so I’ve been experimenting with ways to \"try before you buy\" virtually.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried:\n\n1️⃣ **Brand AR Try-On Tools**  \nSome sites have built-in virtual try-on. It helps a bit with style, but the selection is usually limited to their own products.\n\n2️⃣ **Manual Photo Editing**  \nI screenshot wigs I like and use free apps to overlay them on my photo. It works, but it’s pretty time-consuming and not super accurate.\n\n3️⃣ **AI-Powered Try-On Sites**  \nLately I’ve been using AI tools that let you upload a selfie and realistically try on wigs from different brands. Saves a ton of time compared to manual editing.\n\n**My question to you:**  \nWhat methods have you used to preview wigs before buying? Any tools or tricks you’d recommend?",
