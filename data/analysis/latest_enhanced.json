I began treatment on September 8th, and as you can see, I’ve already had great results in just 3.5 months\n\nMy concern is the timeline: I’m getting married on September 2026, which is only seven months after the transplant. From what I know, seven months isn’t usually enough time to see the full results of an HT.\n\nRight now, I’m using hair fibers to cover the thinning areas, and it looks really good. So my question is - should I go ahead with the transplant in February, or postpone it and let the medications continue working (which would give me a full year of treatment by the time of the wedding)? Worst case, I could still use hair fibers for the wedding if needed.",

      "content": "Hi, all. I am need of any and all help.\n\nThe first 3 pictures are my hair in 2019. The other four from 2024-2025. During the pandemic, my hair lost a lot of density, elasticity, and shine. It was no longer bouncy, just dead. Since that time, I have struggled to keep it as beautiful as it once was. I am literally desperate. I have tried it all: mousse, gel, cream, diffusing upside down, airdrying, ploppling, diffusing like Manes by Mel explains, conditioner, no conditioners, vegan/cruelty-free products, commercial products, Biotin, sleeping with a bonet... Sometimes my hair looks better than other times, depending on where I'm living (the water quality) and how humid it is. My hair looked like the first picture when I lived where I currently live now, too, but now it can’t stay that beautiful. No matter what, I can never achieve the level of perfection (in my view) that my hair had back then (first pictures). The worst thing is, I can't even remember my routine! I think I used whatever product I saw, and I didn't care too much about the process. Right now, my hair is unable to grow (not even nicely, just grow) past a certain length, especially in the face area (I don’t have equal hair lenght). It seems dry, but I am always told I overcondition, so I am very confused... I am tired and don't know what to do. My hair used to fall on my shoulders and bounce. Now, it seems to be straight out of the roots, but it does like a plateau, then curly. The curl pattern and texture of the hair are better on the back of my neck than on my scalp and ends, but in general it has no life. I do not have any deficiency, but I do have PCOs, which I treat with birth control (since 2023). I haven't been pregnant.\n\nCurrent routine: wash thrice a week, cold water, John Frieda Frizz Ease Dream Curls Shampoo, Giorgi Mousse (level 4), once a week Milk Goat conditioner. To refresh, John Frieda Refresh Curls. Rosemary oil on my scalp before washing, with a massage. Before, I was using Aussie products (shampoo and cream). I use a bonet to sleep and dry it following Manes by Mel. \n\nPlease, what can I do? Am I ever getting that hair back? I've seen a lot of miracles around here... Help a gal out.",

Now it looks like the hair of an angel!\n\nI'm still having issues though, since the mousse I use requires me to only put in a small amount of it, (lest my hair get weighed the hell down) I end up not being able to actually form a gel cast on my hair. Despite a good chunk of my routine being hover diffusing on low heat.\nI feel like I'm missing out on some definition by not having a gel cast.\n\n\n\nAnother problem is that Im not actually sure how to use hair oil? The benefits of protection from dryness and less moisture loss are super enticing though.\nI just put a bit on the ends of my hair after putting leave in conditioner to hopefully preserve some definition. \n\nBut some people say you're supposed to scrunch out the cast with oil? I can't exactly do that in my situation.\nAnd others say doing this actually evaporates the oil when it comes in contact with the heat of the diffuser. So I'm kind of at an impasse.\n\n\n\nRoutine: After soaking in the shower, spray a bit of Camille rose leave in conditioner and scrunch the ends with a tiny amount of hair oil (not sure if I should use it before or after) \nthen apply Pattern mousse only on the ends and mids so the hair isn't weighed down.\n\nFollowing this, begin hover diffusing on low heat to hopefully make a cast. As well as gently cupping the roots to make some lift.\nThen afterwards, begin hanging head upside down and swaying to all different sides while cupping on medium heat.\n\nEither dry completely or leave semi dry to air dry the rest.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Hey gang you know the drill - self-esteem, clothing options, social life &amp; dating life being destroyed by this. 🤕💔\n\nExactly a year ago I had my first cyst on my right collarbone. (Dec 2024)\n\nI am Mediterranean &amp; my skin is crazy prone to pigmentation so even though it was tiny (I honestly thought it was a stubborn single ingrown hair) it looked sooo obvious and dark and wasn’t going away for months 😫😫😫\n\nCos I thought it was a hair I had it lasered and then saw a derm and used a $200 cream (Dermaceutic Mela Cream - a potent, clinical-grade skincare treatment designed to reduce dark spots, melasma, and uneven skin tone). This cream + 2 spot treatments of needling on the mark made it disappear in a few months and I was so relieved for the weird single-cyst era to be over.\n\nWELL I got another one last week on my left collarbone 😫😫 (outlined in blue). Yesterday my derm extracted the build up of oil/keratin/skin cells with a needle extraction) and then this morning I woke up with aNOTHER double cyst 5cm lower on my chest. (Outlined in brown square on photo)\n\nThis is the first time it hurts this much. Just did some warm compresses and have to wait until 2026 for clinics to be open but WHYYYY is this happening?!!!???!\n\nI am incredibly hygienic, ALWAYS shower after exercise (bacne ptsd lol), I use a shower filter, I drink heaps of water, eat organic whole foods only (no processed foods or sugar unless it’s a treat like 4 times a year), I’m not on any medication, I moisture my whole body every night with QV ceramides to keep things moisturised and not blocked so it’s just frustrating to be doing so much and getting cysts that I have never seen before 😣\n\nI’m 34F and wondering if it’s hormonal?😭 this year I started lasering my upper lip so nothing crazy but definitely noticed hair growth more than before 😞.\n\nI also get mild bacne but I am very self conscious and can’t show my back so my whole life I have shown my décolletage as a way of feeling sexy/free/attractive/confident . Not cleavage but just strapless tops, singlet tops and princess cuts etc…\n\nNow this has been taken from me and I am so sad about my wardrobe and also it’s summer here in Aus and now I am avoiding sun exposure for my pigmented skin and it’s just so depressing.\n\nI have always had acne-prone skin but now having to hide my face/back AND NOW CHEST is just super upsetting 😔😔😔\n\nI’m also worried about the costs of extraction. I think my dermal clinician did a good job but I read about making sure the “sac” gets removed and that’s more like a minor incision/surgery by a professional gp/plastic surgeon/dermatologist.\n\nAnyone else dealt with this?? They’re not as hectic as the ones on google images but enough to impact my self esteem and clothing choices.\n\nAnyone gone to a clinic in Melbourne for something like this??",

      "content": "Hi!\n\nFirst 2 photos are February 2025, and rest are today. December 2025.\n\nSo I had acne as a teenager and eventually I cleared it up with retinoids and benzoyl peroxide. Haven’t had bad acne in years (25 now). Well, February 2025 I started going to the gym heavily, in turn drinking energy drinks frequently. I also started using Tretinoin on my face around this time instead of my Adapalene. Fast forward to now my skin is wrecked and it began to get bad around March/April 2025, but is progressively getting worse. So I have tried EVERYTHING. Stripping back my routine to my old one that cleared my teenage acne. Using Adapalene again, stopping Tretinoin. Using Azaleic acid, Mandelic acid, BHA. I did read where energy drinks can cause acne and inflammation through cortisol and B12. So I laid off of those a lot. It seemed to help a little, but still hasn’t really been long enough. (About 2 weeks now) Is my skin barrier ruined? Do I stop everything and just repair my barrier? Like what is causing this to happen? I wash my sheets weekly, I am VERY CAREFUL of what goes on my skin because it is so sensitive. Is it hormones, do I need Accutane? I’m just so lost at this point as to what is going on. I don’t sweat in the gym, I wash my face twice a day with La Roche (have used it for years). Like nothing crazy has changed besides starting Tretinoin over 8 months ago now, gym, energy drinks, and that’s it. I still use Tretinoin about 2-3 times a week, but even Adapalene can’t seem to figure it out anymore. HELP.",

      "content": "Would appreciate any help from anyone who knows or has been through the same thing-- I'm gonna be as descriptive as I can here: My hair is 3a/2c. Around 6 inches long on the top with a layered haircut. Pretty high density.   \n  \nAnd I realized I have a problem where my hair doesn't really start curling from the root but around 1 inch up from the root. And that often makes it flat at some parts. I have a routine that counters this, which is finger curling while it's wet and has product in it. This method manually lifts every square inch of my roots, so it definitely helps. But the method isn't sustainable due to how long it takes, it's just not very feasible on certain days (I style it every day because it gets messed up when I sleep even with silk pillow cases, I roll around too much apparently :( \n\nI try a method where I section it and scrunch each section, when I don't wanna go with the long finger curling routine. It doesn't work because I'm probably not sectioning it properly, I don't know if my hair density is making it harder. But when I do this method it just dries flat and doesn't curl at the root. I can't figure out how to use the curl defining brush to make things easier. It makes my hair stand up in some places and flat in others. \n\nRoutine that doesn't work:   \n\\- Wash hair with shampoo. Company: DesignMe Curly shampoo. Condition with the same company's \"volumizing conditioner\"   \n\\- Apply Miche gel-to-foam styling mousse, rake it through, and unsuccessfully try to form clumps with a curl defining brush. Then scrunch whatever I get as a result. I try to section my hair unsuccessfully and scrunch it in sections. Then I diffuse upside down. \n\n  \nWhats the best way to get curls to curl at the root when they tend to curl at mid lengths? \n\nThanks!",

I've been using Aveda Invati that I purchased on sale, and while it's clearly high quality, it's also incredibly expensive...especially now that it's no longer on sale. That being the case, I'm looking for another natural shampoo and conditioner that work well for people with thinning hair. I will add the disclaimer that I'm well aware no shampoo or conditioner actually treat hair loss. That's not what I'm asking here. I just need a good natural (i.e., no SLS, etc.) shampoo and conditioner that aren't egregiously expensive but that are specifically not problematic to those with thinning hair. If they add noticeable volume and fullness that's great, but most important are the ingredients and overall quality. I realize every scalp is different so opinions are subjective, but it would be great to have some recommendations. Yes, I have looked through the wiki and tried to do other research in this sub. There are just so many products out there, new ones come out all the time and old favorites are sadly prone to formula changes, so any recommendations to help narrow the field would be much appreciated!",

      "content": "Hello all. My skincare journey has been and still is a wild ride.\n\nI had acne for 10+ years before finally going on accutane in 2021 (photo 1). Almost finished the course but I got super depressed and started getting weird skin growths on my shoulders/neck/face and was advised to stop taking it. Acne still cleared though! (Photo 2 and 3)\n\nMy skin regime is relatively simple since that’s all I can really make myself maintain. \n\nMorning:\n\n1. CeraVe Gentle face cleanser\n\n2. 4 drops of my dermatology office’s house made Vitamin C drops\n\n3. Dermatology office’s 30spf sunscreen\n\nEvening:\n\n1. CeraVe Gentle face cleanser\n\n2. Skinbetter AlphaRet retinal cream (also moisturizes)\n\nAfter saving up money, I went to a dermatologist for Co2 laser scar removal for my acne scars in early 2025. We also did a few rounds of subcisions with no fillers before and during the laser. After a couple months, I informed the doctor that I still had pinprick gridlike holes all over my face, and she said it was an unfortunate case that my skin did not react well to the laser. (Photo 4, 5, 6)\n\nAfter healing from that, I’ve been going in every 4-6 weeks for microneedling to help get rid of the pinprick scars and hopefully improve the overall texture of my skin from my acne scars. I’ve had 3 microneedling sessions so far. (Photo 7, 8, 9)\n\nI feel like I have noticed no improvement yet for my skin texture from all of these treatments. If anything, I fear it might actually be worse as I’m starting to see more wrinkles forming on my face. Especially my forehead and around my eyes. I think I’m looking much older than I am (I’m almost 29).\n\nAm I overthinking it? Am I following the right course of actions to try and get rid of acne scars and improve my skin texture? Is this aging my skin?",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\nI’ve been on adapalene (Adaferin 0.1%) for about more than a month now. At first, I had a big purged a lots of painful cystic acne and whiteheads. but recently the breakouts have slowed down. Still, my cheeks are red, covered in dark marks from old acne and some picking, and I’m feeling really low about how my skin looks.\n\nI’ve been using a gentle cleanser (CeraVe Hydrating facewash), minimalist HOCl spray, Foxtale ceramide moisturizer, sunscreen daily, and adapalene at night. I used to pick at my skin a lot, which made things worse, but I’m trying to stop.\n\nI just need some advice or reassurance:\n\nDid anyone else’s redness and scars look this bad before it got better?\n\nHow long did it take before your skin tone started evening out?\n\nIs there anything gentle I can add later to help fade these red/brown marks faster?\n\nI know it takes patience, but it’s hard to keep believing that it’ll get better when I feel like I’ve made my face worse. Any encouragement or similar stories would mean a lot.\nThank you 💛",
