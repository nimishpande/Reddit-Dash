The Phase IIa trial that read out in June 2025 showed that 31% of male patients with a higher degree of hair loss had a greater than 20% increase in hair density at week eight—which was four weeks after the completion of treatment. No patients in the placebo arm hit this exploratory endpoint.\n\n“Pelage is not alone in the burgeoning alopecia market. Veradermics is developing an oral extended-release version of minoxidil for pattern hair loss, which is in Phase III trials. Gil and Weng believe there could be combination opportunities in the future.\"",

Literally the best hair day I think I've had since I got this lazy bob cut. The only thing I think could be better is the frizz, but that's a never ending problem for us curly hair girlies... :V\n\nRoutine: In a warm shower I wash my scalp with Shea Moisture shampoo, comb Shea Moisture conditioner through hair, rinse out conditioner with cold water, scrunch hair with Not Your Mothers Curl Talk, and plop everything with an old t-shirt. Once my hair is dry enough that it isn't soaking, I let it air dry.\n\nPLEASE let me know what else I should introduce into my regiment!! I'm definitely looking for advice. The #1 thing I have noticed that made a big difference is just using more product than you'd assume is needed. I'm also open to trying a different hairstyle (if you think that it would suit me better).",

I started doing research and here’s my routine:\n\nWet\n\nNot Your Mothers Defining Curl Talk Cream\n\nBrush\n\nSection off\n\nUse edge brush to wrap curls\n\nThis is reflected in the first picture. The top of her head is straight so I had to do a little baby sprout pony tail after that fell pretty quickly. \n\nThe other photos are her hair just wet, brushed, and kinda “shook out” with my fingers. This was easier but I’m not sure if it’s best for her curls. \n\nShe uses Aussie moisturizing shampoo. We do not condition because her hair is so short. Should I be doing that?\n\nIs my routine right? It seems so long and tedious. What do I do about post nap bedhead? She will not do a bonnet and I’d have to get all silk bedding because she breakdances in her sleep. Is it ok to wet it down and brush it three times a day (morning, post nap, bed time)? \n\nI’m so lost. Mine and my eldest’s hair is pin straight. My friends are recommending a lot of products and to use a cotton shirt or special hair towel. Any other advice is welcome!! \n\nAlso is it normal the top of her head is straight? ",

Now I am anti destruction and trying to be better 2026 but I need help with the issues i already had.\n\nI am currently doing IPL to help with chronic ingrowns. I typically had 2 hairs growing out of each follicle and was prone to ingrowns and couldn’t help but pick.\n\nHow do I lift these without messing myself up and scarring myself? The one in the first pic seems to fill with blood and want to be popped but I am refraining. PLEASE please help. I am going on a trip to Mexico next month and I want to be in a bikini with confidence.\n\nAny steps or skincare routine for this area is greatly appreciated, as well as consideration for current IPL use and how it may help or hinder. I have the Philips lumea.\n\nPlease help or advise on what you guys think I should do and how to lift an old cyst/ grown over healed area.

I feel like it’s quite a bit darker than I wanted. It’s so much money and I can’t afford to get it redone, but I really wanted to have lighter blonde hair. Granted the photos of my hair aren’t with natural light, but I don’t really think it’s the blonde in the photo. We discussed a root tap and I said I wanted a slight blend as high as possible so I get away with not dying it for a while. But it feels like the brown is still in quite a bit of my hair?\n\nAm I being delusional? Should I say something? Or just try go elsewhere next year maybe.
