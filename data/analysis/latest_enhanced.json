Put 2-3 drops of jojoba oil into palms and rub together and scrunch out the crunch\n\nI need to look into training my waves/curls. Any suggested changes?

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "title": "[Misc] Do you think skincare will take a stronger turn to be more like at-home medicine? With less guesswork needed for more tailored products?",
      "content": "\nThis is very long and has quite a bit of rambling, my post wasn’t ever up where I thought I had posted it (taken down by mods), so I thought I’d try here. So this is long, but I want you to see where my mind’s at for help with answering this question. I hope that this subreddit is the right one to post my kind of question here, as while I am happy with my skin, I want to know where skincare science may be headed out of personal interest and and my interest for science and updates in care. \n\nI have personally been overwhelmed by skincare in my past. For reference, I am 27F, I have dry/combo, sensitive skin. I’m very pale and have rosacea. My skin history is that I had immaculate skin until I started the pill at 16 (both siblings having cystic acne during and pose puberty), and then boom, acne galore, (rarely deep cystic acne like my siblings, but I was absolutely covered in whiteheads. I had acne for years, even after cessation of the pill. Nothing helped. The migraines also sucked. \n\nI’ve spent literal thousands on skincare, a current body 2 red light mask, prescribed derm creams.\n\nI’ve pumped my body full of antibiotics like doxycycline (despite relentless sunscreen reapplication throughout the day and UV blocking filters for the windows in my room, I still got sunburnt on this antibiotic!! How?? My skin was clear while on it for a month though..), spiro &amp; isotretinoin didn’t work for me long-term (mental health took a weird turn on the latter, even at 10mg). Switching birth control gave me chronic migraines, switching to the copper iud didn't affect the acne in any way. \n\nI did the whole COVID-19 popular 5 to 20 step routines (I still have products half used that I tried during this period of time sat on my shelf at home as reminders to spend more wisely). I’ve tried all the methods, skin cycling, slugging, you name it, i’ve spent months to years testing it, and had a dermatologist holding my hand throughout this whole process too, also throughout the (mainly failed) rosacea prescription treatments like metronidazole. \n\nAnd after so much time, literally over a decade of trying to fix my face, and going through essentially each percentage of each product, like 1% to the TO’s infamous 10% Niacinamide(!), I was able to create a pretty minimal routine that did click. Not much of a surprise to you all here but it’s made up of a smallish set of the well-known, tried and tested crowd pleasers, think tret, azelaic acid, vit. c, glycolic acid, (tea tree for rosacea) sunscreen, etc. But it really did take years of trying each thing out at varying %s for the allotted time necessary to really figure out what would work for my sensitive, reactive skin. For me it was the gentleness of East Asian skincare that helped me the most, the gentle prevention rather than the strong treatments like more common in the west where I live.\n\nAnd so now looking back at my own history, when being asked for recommendations for people who are in similar shoes as I was, and when looking for products in stores and online, I’ve been noticing how much skincare has (and also hasn’t) changed over the past decade and how now it feels like more and more brands are talking about what I think I would have needed from the get-go, the ‘personalisation’ factor, diagnostics, or testing. I’m interested in science and like to look at new derm papers that come out, and I’m in the loop with people/channels like Lab Muffin, James Welsh, DermAngelo, Doctorly, Dr. Dray, etc., but I am not one to think of myself as a pseudo-professional. I recognise where my knowledge/comprehension limit starts and ends. But I still want to make good recommendations when people ask for my opinion as my before and afters are (I'm happy to say!!) pretty shocking.\n\nSo I was thinking about how to help some friends who asked me, and I was just wishing there was something totally ‘individualisable’ at home, like in a biological sense? or customisable? I’ve seen Curology do their custom products, with meh to okay reviews from what I can tell from reddit, but then I found stuff like myDNA on the r/AUSSkincare subreddit, (also meh reviews because it doesn’t really tell much about the current state of skin, as far as I can understand) and then skin microbiome testing? I was thinking like how people have these differences tolerances and there is one percentage that will make everything in combination with other perfect percentages work amazingly. So again im thinking there has to be something we can look at to see how we each react independently, kind of like an allergy or food intolerance test. What percentages cause mild inflammation, anaphylaxis, or what % of a person’s known allergen won’t have any effect. I went through the usual journals and found biomarkers being what I think I’m thinking of. \n\nThen I saw L’Oreal looking into patenting biomarkers like FLG2 (Filaggrin-2) for barrier function/hydration. So if loreal is putting a lot of money into this, it looks like it’s going to be a thing sooner or later, but it did get me thinking and coming up with questions like how much science do people actually want behind their routines? Or would this even work? An at-home mini-clinical experience? That you’d have to do every once in a while at home to keep up to day with the state of your skin? I try to envision myself doing this and I’m totally down for it, I like my routines, like the current body 2, but I don’t know if there’d be enough people behind this idea due to practicality to be able to hope for something like this to be a reality. \n\nLike if you had the option of a product tailored to you, based on a deeper profile of your skin (not just oily/dry, but something more nuanced, like ingredient sensitivities), would you have the energy for it? Or does it feel like overkill? Would you trust your own readings of the at-home results? Would it make it too complicated? Or would this just be the obvious only thing to go with and ditch the whole routine for whatever the results of the tests were to give you? Having the privilege to forget about trial and error?\n\nSo I think I’m asking here to figure out if there’s an actual want for something like this, or if this is a figment of my imagination. I don’t know how much money it would take to get something like this going and seen as user friendly. I’m not sure if people doing at home skin type tests, being referred a topical and then effectively healing is also what a lot of this health routine and hobby community would be looking for. With ChatGPT making all these custom routines these days (alas doesn’t work for me!), I’m wondering if my personal hope for something like this would be unrealistic.\n\nSo yes, is this product idea even realistic in terms of user practicality? Like L’Oreal giving you kits at home for measuring your skin as it is right now with an at-home test, kinda like Covid tests, uti tests, blood glucose tests, or even like the ancestry tests, then at-home results indicating which proclivities you have towards ingredients, saying like this cream with 2% Bha and 4% Niacinamide with these stabilisers will help. Or would you prefer doing something like this at the derm and listen to their interpretation of the results?\n\nFor me personally, I love the idea of not having had to waste so much time and money on products/doctor visits that don’t work for or even hurt me, but I also wonder if there’s a line where it stops being fun and starts feeling like medical treatment. Like I said above, I found what works for me, I so so wish I had found the solution the decade earlier, but what I didn’t say is that I continue to try new things out just because… because skincare isn’t just healthcare, but also a hobby to me. Would the hobby die if it were like medicine all the time?\n\nSo Ill end this to say thank you for reading all of this rambling, and that I’m curious where you all stand on my thoughts here... could this be a thing? Would you do it? Would it be the right line of progress in the skincare world? Do you like the “keep it simple and proven”, “testing out to see what routine works” approaches, or do you get excited about the idea of more high-tech, personalised skincare in the future like moi? There's always new thing coming out, like spicules, PDRN, etc. so I'm interested how far fetched this may be. Like swab your face, get results at home, and recommendations of what would biologically predisposed to handling better or worse. \n\nThanks again and wishing y'all glowing skin ",

      "content": "I’m new to cleansing oils and enzyme cleansers. Yesterday I got the Mara enzyme cleansing oil and the Dr. Dennis Gross creamy cleansing oil to use 1-2x a week, and mainly use Mara most nights. \n\nI plan on using a cleansing oil at night to double cleanse. My main concerns are getting a deep clean and getting gunk in my pores out. I used it last night and loved it. My skin felt so smooth! \n\nApparently Mara is ok to use daily. I say that because I don’t want to overdo actives. I use the DDG peel pads, prescription retinol, and Farmacy honey glow (not all everyday, and in rotation, I give my skin a break every few nights). \n\nIt is on the pricier side- usually I don’t mind spending money on skincare but it has to be worth it for me. The enzymes are listed so low on the ingredient list so I wonder if I can use a cheaper one that’s just as good. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Is it ok to use the enzyme oil cleanser (or any) most nights while using DDG cleanser 1-2x a week with all my other actives? \n\nIf not,\n\n2. Should I use a different, gentler cleansing oil?\n\n\n3. Are enzyme cleansers just a buzzword thing? Does it mostly matter if I use targeted serums, etc.?\n\nI’m late 20s, combo/oily leaning skin, somewhat acne prone, sensitive, but ok with most actives as I’ve been using them for a few years. \n\nI’d love your insight and experience! Also any advice for routine would be nice.",

      "content": "Could you advise me how to use this products in correct dosage to ensure I will not cause my skin any harm? I have oily skin with acne and a lot of scarring. Every little pimple is leaving a scar even if I am not touching or squeezing it.\n\nCURRENT ROUTINE: \n\nFace wash AM/PM\n1. Dermedic Hydrain3 Hialuro creamy cleansing gel\n2.  bean cleansing oil\n\nSPF\n1. Paula’s Choice Youth Extending Daily Hydrating Fluid SPF 50\n\nMoisturizer\n1. Cetaphil PS Lipoactive for dry and sensitive skin\n2. Avene Cicalfate+ repairing protective cream\n\nOnce or twice a week but never on the same week\n1. Ph Doctor RetinALL 0,05 by inti skin\n2. The ordinary salicylic acid 2% solution\n\nFor breakouts and as spot treatment\n1. The ordinary azelaic acid suspension 10%\n\nWhat works and what I think doesn’t: \nDOES HELP\n1. Salicylic acid and azelaic acid I think work well for me. I have used them in the past and they helped, the best for me was the previous formula of the ordinary salicylic acid.\n2. What did help but only temporarily are dermapen and acids treatments done by a certified skin professional. I have done many sessions and spent thousands on dermapen. The results were amazing and it did get rid of my scars. But after a few months acne came back and I have scars all over my cheeks and chin again. Doing these treatments every month would help but I would have to do that infinitely and they are very expensive and only give temporary results.\n\nDOES NOT HELP \n1. All retinols and retinals I have tried were causing breakouts and painful cystic acne even months into using it.\n2. Moisturizers I use I think are not great for my skin type. They make me very oily. I used to use snail mucin but it had a burning sensation and was not great for my skin.\n3. All dermatologists say that it’s acne vulgaris and no meds would help, they only give skin treatments based on benzoyl peroxide like Duac or Epiduo. They never work and I have tried multiple times. They only cause breakouts, my skin is very dry and sensitive and I am left with more scars and in worse condition every time after using it.\n\nNEW ROUTINE: \nThese are the products I want to incorporate in my skincare routine:\n1. The Ordinary Glucoside Foaming Cleanser – can be used daily, morning and evening\n2. The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG – can be used daily, morning and evening for eyes\n3. The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% – can be used daily, morning and evening\n4. The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% – use in the evening (not every day, may cause irritation)\n5. The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Masque – use once a week in the evening\n6. The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Beta Glucan – can be used daily, morning and evening\n7. La Roche Posay Effaclar H Iso-Biome (moisturizing cream) – can be used daily, morning and evening\n8. Avene Cleanance Aqua Gel (mattifying gel) – can be used daily, morning and evening on the entire face 9.Avene Cleanance Cleansing Mask – can be used 1–2 times a week, leave on for 5 minutes, then rinse off\n10. The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% – can be used daily, morning and evening\n\nWATCHOUTS: \nI know I should not use salicylic and azelaic acid together. As for Avene and Salicylic Acid masks - I think I will use them once a week and one week use the Avene one and the next week salicylic acid mask.\n\nWHY NEW ROUTINE:\nMy skin is sensitive so I don’t want to overdo it. I want to change my routine because over the last few months my skin has worsened. I have a lot of texture, bumps, whiteheads and scars. Every day I have at least one new pimple and they always leave scars and marks. All of the scars are bright red and even though I don’t have much inflammation it looks like I do because of my skin texture. I also want to finally deal with oily skin. My makeup looks bad and makes the texture very visible, it gets cakey after a few hours and just slides off my skin. I use Estée Lauder and setting powder so it’s not caused by bad makeup but by my skin.\n\nAny advice on this routine? Do you think it’s good? How can I make sure to not overdo it?\n\nI’m sorry for the long post! Wanted to share all context and products I have used",

It used to be wavy when I was a child, now I think its 3a/3b. Unfortunately, I neglected it for many years and I finally decided to start taking care of it. However, I am not quite sure if I am doing things right in my current routine and I still struggle with some things so I would love to hear your thoughts!  \n\n\n**1st Picture is after washing them. My routine:**  \n\\- Shampoo (only 2 times per week)  \n\\- Conditioner  \n\\- Mousse  \n\\- Scrunch  \n\\- Air Dry\n\nI detangle my hair using a comb while the conditioner is applied. After scrunching, I shake my head for some time to \"style\" it.\n\nIs this a good result? Anything I can improve?\n\nI recently added leave in conditioner and gel to that routine but the picture was taken before these products were included.\n\n**2nd Picture is morning after washing day**  \nAs you can see, my hair looks absolutely fried. I don't sleep with bonnet. What should I do? Do I have to do my routine every day? So far, I only do it every 2nd day because I am afraid of using too much product. I just rinse them with cold water when I don't wash them that day. Should I apply products every day?  \n\n\n**3rd Picture is something I would like to change.**  \nI currently have a fringe but it's mostly coils. Whenever my hair dries, they clump together to these coils. I don't really like that since the other parts are not very coily. How can I style my hair to get rid of these coils? I didn't wash my hair on that picture. ",

      "content": "Hey guys. I have gotten a weird burning sensation and tightness all over my face since almost a week now. This made me think I have a damaged skin barrier, however whenever I've had any damaged skin barriers in the past, I've usually cured it through 2-3 times application of SebaMed Clear Gel. However, this time this application didnt really help, and im still struggling with extremely burning and tightness, and big pimples due to damaged skin barrier. I used to usually wake up with oil on my face but now i wake up with complete dry skin, hence I've stopped morning washes. I then heard that CebHydra moisturizer is really helpful. Using that religiously, but even that's not working. Its been over a week now and I don't know what to do. Ive stopped applying sunscreen as well, as it burns when I do so. My eyebrows have started to shed skin and it looks like I have eyebrow dandruff😃 Could yall give any advice or share your experience? It would be really helpful!",

It worked wonders for the skin and especially my seb derm, left my skin feeling shiny and very smooth.\n\nI always got compliments whenever I used it. So I really hope I can find a similar product that works like the Glamglow one because unfortunately they no longer make products anymore :(\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestion? I would really appreciate it because it was the best facemask for me. Looking for similar ingredients it had like [Mandelic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mandelic-acid), [Tartaric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tartaric-acid), [Lactic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactic-acid), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Glycolic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycolic-acid).

I tried doing rice water, but that just made my hair all weird (might be a mistake on my part but I did watch like a hundred tutorials). \nI’ve bought a clarifying shampoo and the CurlSmith Bond salve rehab. That did work but only for day 1, my curls actually stayed, but day 2 and day 3 I noticed they are once again super limp, mushy, overly soft. I’ve also been diffusing instead of air drying. \n\nSo I need your help. What protein rich products/routine would you recommend? Styling products? I’ve ordered the CurlSmith protein enriched shampoo but it hasn’t arrived yet. (I know to be careful to not go straight into protein overload, but I swear that’s not happening anytime soon). I previously used the NYM curl talk cream, it says it has rice-something in it, is it okay to keep using or is mousse better or no styling products whatsoever? \n\nHelp please :,).

No other products. Never had a problem. The next time I went to get it done, i had my hair bleached a little then she did the blowout. I was still using the same products but noticed my hair becoming frizzy. No problem, text my hair dresser and she isn’t sure why it didn’t take but that she’d fix it for free. In the meantime, i switched  to the Brazilian Blowout shampoo and conditioner wondering if that would help. It didn’t. So she fixes it and it’s BETTER after a couple of weeks, but still a teeny teeny bit frizzy. That was a couple of years ago and she hasn’t bleached my hair in at least a year and a half. A few weeks ago, I had her do another blowout and this is it less than a month after?! This time, she recommended i use Redkens acidic color gloss shampoo and conditioner. Any ideas why this keeps happening?",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\nI'm hoping to get some advice on these spots on my thighs that showed up about two months ago (see attached picture).\nHere are some key details:\n• They are reddish/purplish marks. When I try to squeeze them, nothing comes out. They also don't feel like hard bumps under the skin.\n• I don't think it's caused by friction from clothing, as I always wear loose-fitting cotton pants/shorts.\n• I had started IPL hair removal on this area, but I took a break for a few months. These spots appeared during the time I was not doing any treatments. I'm wondering if pausing the IPL could have caused this.\n• What I've tried: I have already used glycolic acid, but it didn't seem to make a difference\nMy plan is to restart my IPL sessions soon and incorporate a body cream specifically for hyperpigmentation (dark spots).\nHas anyone experienced something similar? Any idea what this could be, and what ingredients or products might help fade them? I'd appreciate any help you can offer. Thanks!",
