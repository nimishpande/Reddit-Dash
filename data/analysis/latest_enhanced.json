      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

However, I have gone days without picking and my skin was still red and very broken out. *\n\nI’ve had acne since elementary school (around age 12). It’s been 8+ years and it’s been really impacting my day to day life and hurting my mental health a lot. I am CURRENTLY trying to get a script for accutane but it’s a process (as I’m sure you all know). I’m also quite sensitive to medications and it’s expensive so we shall see.\nApologies for any spelling errors in the following part…\n\nthings I’ve tried:\n- topical treatments like differin gel and proactiv \n- niacinamide, salicylic 1&amp;2%, hyaluronic\n- tranaxemic acid (helped a little I think?)\n- birth control\n- going dairy-free (did nothing lol).\n- scrubs, anti-fungals, big hydrocolloid strips, pore strips, anything to physically get the oil out\n\nCurrent routine:\nAM: splash water on face, moisturize if need be. Makeup + spf if going outside. \n\nPM shower: double cleanse, oil based cleanser(Anua heartleaf) then water based(cerave or youth to the people). Around 2-3x per week I will use the innisfree volcanic pore cleansing foam in place of my water based cleanser to dissolve excess sebum then absorb it with a clay mask (1x/week). \n\nAfter shower: paulas choice lactic acid exfoliator (not every day) + moisturize (dieux lipid moisturizer). \n\nI know that sounds like a ton of products but I essentially cleanse, exfoliate, and moisturize. \n\nI know my picking doesn’t help, but I only pick when there’s actual things to pick at. \n\nAdvice needed! Recommendations? Is it just bad hormonal acne or something else? Will accutane actually do anything? Closed comedones or blackheads?😭 thank you guys in advance 🥺🧎‍♀️‍➡️\n",

I moisturize my face twice a day using Korean skincare (Aestura, Numbuzin, Aqua Squalene, etc.) and use Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion everyday all over my body after I shower in the morning. My friends always comment on how soft my skin feels.\n\nI am just wondering how she could immediately call out my dry skin. I don’t see any crust, or flakes or major dry patches and literally my skin feels so soft. Are there signs that I’m missing? I’m not necessarily glowing but maybe I’m used to one kind of look when “dry skin” comes to mind.\n\nMy dermatologist recommended La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ Balm. What else can I do to get hydrating skin from within? I drink a lot of water, I cook 90% of my meals and they are Asian forward with carbs, protein and veggies. Do I just lather myself in lotion every hour on the hour?",

This happens even though I moisturize with Cetaphil face moisturizer after washing with cetaphil gentle face cleanser. So I only wash my face once in the afternoon. \n- At night and in the morning, I spray skinsmart antimicrobial facial cleanser on my face. I also spray my pillow and eye mask every night with it. \n- I used to use PanOxyl but couldn’t really tell much a difference so stopped.\n- I used to use tretinoin cream and it worked really well for a while and then randomly stopped working for me.\n\nI’m so tired of looking like I’m on meth with scabs and big red dots on my face all the time. They’re on my neck, chest, shoulders, and back too. I’m also unemployed after being laid off and I don’t think a face like this is helping me get another job. I also have OCD and obsessively pick at my skin which disrupts healing, but even when I am getting better with picking, pimples still appear.\n\nOther meds I’m on:\n- Adderall \n- Wellbutrin\n- Lexapro\n- Rx vitamin D\n- insulin\n\nAppreciate all help!!!",

      "title": "Can fragrances weaken skin barrier without causing irritation over time ? [skinbarrier] [acne] [skinrepair] [fragrances] [essentialoils] [skincare]",
      "content": "Aloha guys!\n\nThis is gonna be long..sorry in advance\n\nI know it’s been said that fragrances are usually not recommended for skincare as it «can» potentially damage skin barrier or apparently weaken it over time, cause irritation, exacerbate inflammation etc.\n\nSo ideally I’d like to use fragrance free products to ease my mind &amp; reduce risk of damage. I mean ideally I’d like to not have to use anything at all &amp; have perfect skin (ahhh don’t we all wish lol)\n\nMy skin type is: combo acne prone sensitive skin oily T zone/ normal cheeks. My breakouts are normally localized in my T zone (forehead/nose/chin) w very few occasional breakouts on cheeks.\n\n8yrs ago, I didn’t have a routine &amp; had to go through the headache of building myself a skincare routine by trying out several different products to see what would work for me.\n\nI tried products from cerave/aveeno/cetaphil/neutrogena &amp; maybe more.\n\nFirst I had tried cleansers formulated w actives such as SA &amp; had found that it caused me irritation. ( idk if it was the strength 2%, fragrance or just my skin not agreeing w SA) After trying a few cleansers for acne skin, I figured out that my skin liked a gentle cleanser w/o actives better &amp; instead preferred an acne treatment in gel form…\n\nThe cleanser that worked for me : Neutrogena ultra gentle foaming cleanser for sensitive skin (yes I had tried their non foaming hydrating cleanser, but felt like it wasn’t washing the extra oils off my face on T zone)\n\nNext was the search for a moisturizer It was a lengthy costly &amp; discouraging process. Most moisturizers claiming to be for sensitive skin or non pore clogging always left my skin feeling either greasy, felt sweaty upon application, felt like butter was sitting on my face or would break me out. After thoroughly investigating online I gave Neutrogena hydro boost water gel a try ( their original formula w fragrance)\n\nIt became my HOLY GRAIL. Immediately felt perfect on my skin. Skin felt hydrated but not greasy &amp; didn’t break me out. I was so happy. I then found my acne treatment which became Neutrogena BP daily gel 2.5%\n\nThis was my routine. I eventually added kora organic Noni oil (which contains tiny traces of essential oils) &amp; this also was my holy grail. It gave my skin the extra moisture it needed to compensate w the harsh BP.\n\nThis was my perfect simple routine for over 7yrs.\n\nWell well well. Idk exactly where I messed up but I believe the downfall of my skin could be due to several factors.\n\nI was on hormonal BC for 1yr. It gave me several ovarian cysts issues so I suspect it’s also why I suffered from some cysts on my face as well. However at the time I didn’t connect the dots so I decided to change my routine &amp; completely switched to cerave. It was alright but not great &amp; I feel overtime I got more cysts.\n\nSkin didn’t feel good so I went back to original routine. Then Neutrogena decided to mess w their formula &amp; I, among many other customers was so dissapointed. Their new « fragrance free» hydro boost gel simply wasn’t the same. I also recently found out they changed their BP gel formula &amp; their ultra gentle cleanser formula as well. So now I’m triple confused on what could be the reason for my skin slowly deteriorating…\n\nI know I am at fault for some of the issues though bc when my skin started breaking out more I did what I shouldn’t have done: I started exfoliating more. I suspect I over exfoliated &amp; stripped my skin barrier which lead to more &amp; more &amp; more breakouts.\n\nSo I’ve been in this vicious cycle for over 2yrs now. Taking intermittent actives breaks &amp; trying to reintroduce w/o success.\n\nMy signs of damaged skin barrier are :\n\nNo irritation Increased oil even on my cheeks Inflammation Deeper more visible lines especially forehead Skin feels dehydrated but oily. Surge of breakouts especially cheeks which was never a problem area before.\n\nMy problem is that everyone is saying that you NEED ceramide, niacinamide, gentle NON foaming cleansers &amp; absolutely no fragrances so heal your skin.\n\nHere’s my dilemma:\n\nThe problem is no other moisturizers/cleansers seem to agree w my skin so idk what to do.\n\nNeutrogena since put their original hydro boost gel formula back on the shelves(I believe bc so many people complained) I’m happy bc my skin still loves it. It still feels great, doesn’t irritate my skin &amp; feels soothing even if it has dye/fragrance.\n\nThat’s where I’m confused &amp; my dilemma. In reality, the product feels great… but in «  theory » is a big no no…my question I guess is can fragrance be ok for some people if they do not cause irritation ? I mean it doesn’t sting burn or break me out… but could it be « hurting» my barrier silently? This is so weird… sometimes I’m skeptical of these claims.\n\nIdk what to replace it with.. I tried CeraVe ultra light moisturizing gel which I was hoping to love bc it’s the most similar to my gel but it feels sticky on my skin once applied &amp; simply doesn’t feel right even though in «theory» it would be a better option for skin repair purposes &amp; skin barrier health… I also tried their peptide night cream &amp; I can see sweat emerging from my pores immediately after application… it’s like none of the «  recommended products » work but all the products that wouldn’t be advised ( aka fragrances &amp; essential oils) feel great 😭😭😭\n\nIdk what to do. I did a 2 mths break from exfo + actives maybe 6 mths ago. I was using my same fragranced moisturizer &amp; kora Noni oil during that «  healing » time . I obv had breakouts &amp; skin felt so oily &amp; congested bc I wasn’t addressing my acne w actives. I then reintroduced my BP slowly &amp; exfoliation as well. I successfully cleared my skin after 2mths but I guess I messed it up again w only 1 too many exfo. One week I did ONE sulfur mask &amp; it completly  wrecked my skin so I had to start another 2mth active break again… now I’m wondering if the reason why my skin got messed up so quick by only 1 use was bc it was never repaired all the way &amp; barrier is weaken..I’m wondering if the fragrances in my moisturizer + oil are preventing my skin barrier from healing all the way. But my problem is I can’t find anything else that feels right other than what I currently use.  Should I just stick with what I use since it feels good on my skin even tho it has «  fragrances » &amp; just listen to my skin ?\n\nDid you guys ever repair your skin using products that contained fragrances or essential oils? I mean they don’t irritate my skin …&amp; everything else I use feels weird on my skin.\n\nAlso I suspect my Eucerin advance hydration 50 spf may be causing some breakouts it’s soooooo greasy anyone has suggestions? I love Supergoop unseen &amp; their mineral option for reef but it’s so pricey.\n\nTo whoever read all of this I appreciate you forreal 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽",
