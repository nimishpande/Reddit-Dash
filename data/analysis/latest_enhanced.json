      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

My curls look great after a shower then they loose their bounce and I get frizzy after that. If I braid it when I go to bed I can make them last maybe 2 days. I just ordered a curl defying brush, but any other input/advice is welcome! Thank you so much, pics are to show what I mean 💜",

I know I can just wash or wet my hair on day 3, but I would love to extend another day in light of the winter and how cold and shivery it is in the mornings. \n\nFWIW, I wash every three or four days. My wash day routine is Chagrin Valley olive oil and babassu shampoo bar. I work from scalp and let rest flow down to ends. I start to detangle / gently separate strands as I wash. Then I follow up with Curlsmith frizz free conditioner. I detangle with my fingers in the shower and add in the same Curlsmith as a leave in, then Curlsmith in style shower gel that I rake and shake through as well. \n\nI love the curl definition and moisturizing of the in shower styling gel and how it accentuates my curl pattern. I alternate my shampoo bar every other wash with the prescribed shampoo from my dermatologist to combat dry flakes. It does not tangle my hair. \n\nI have also tried finishing with the Marc Anthony strictly curls foam mousse.\n\nTLDR —&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How do you wear your hair wrap/ bonnet at night, when you have short, tangle prone hair; presently the length is around my ears?&lt;——-\n\nThanks so much for your advice.\n\n",

I'm also currently scheduled for an upcoming appointment with a dermatologist, as I might have Seborrheic Dermatitis.\n\nDue to red spots and flakes I've seen on my face, in my eyebrows, next to my nose, or in my moustache area, I try to stay clean-shaven with Schick razor blades (with skin guards) and have been staying up to date with using moisturizer. I'm unsure if my Dermatitis is due to using Clean &amp; Clear without moisturizer, or if it's a skin condition.\n\nI was recently recommended Byoma at a beauty store to use for moisturizing after I shower. I'm unsure whether to continue using that, La Roche-Posay's moisturizing cream, or both. I used La Roche today, and it feels good so far. A store employee I spoke to also recommended Vanicream and La Roche-Posay's sunscreen, so I took pictures of them for later.\n\nIs there anything I'm missing, or should I revise?

      "content": "Apologies in advance as this is a lot to read... Sorry.\n\nSo I have type 2c hair which is coarse and thick. It is very volumized however it is dry and brittle. I have low porosity hair, however my hair doesn't seem to ever be able to hold moisture for long. I have never used protein in my routine and have just used moisture, so I do not know whether or not I should try using protein, as no matter how much moisture I add it doesn't look great. But on the other hand, my hair fits the symptoms of hair that lacks moisture - its volumized, dry, brittle and hard. I also do not know whether or not I should use lightweight or heavyweight products on my hair (when I say products, I mean leave in conditioner and regular conditioner as I do not use curl cream/gel etc.), because I always used lightweight products as I thought it was to do with your hair type - wavy = lightweight, curly = heavyweight etc. - however since realizing my hair is coarse, I do not know if that should mean I use heavyweight products or not. \n\nMaybe the main point I have always been confused on - before ever starting a proper routine was when my hair looked the best. It was more volumized, thick and just looked healthy. But now I feel as if there's no point dropping everything in my routine because I have spent so much money on it all, and it is probably a singular thing that is causing this problem of my hair being damaged no matter what I do.\n\nTo provide context: I recently buzzed my hair to restart from the damage, however I was confused why it was even damaged in the first place as I had followed what I thought was a good routine (will list what I did in next para). My hair is in the process of growing out again, and although it is not noticeably super damaged yet some of my friends have pointed out how it looks \"dry and brittle\" up close. I am not exactly sure what type of damage I have, however I would love some clarity if possible (from the attatched pics). My hair has always been dry and flaky.  Also recently been using a medicated shampoo to help with my scalp condition I won't mention as it is against the rules of the sub.  \n  \nIn my old routine, I shampoo and conditioned twice a week, deep conditioned every other week, clarified every 3 weeks, used a leave in conditioner, rosemary oil, and argon oil after hair had dried. I also only used As I am products and the Camille Rose Conditioner. I never used any styling techniques and just let my hair air dry - patted with a cotton t shirt first though.  \nSince growing out the buzz, I have swapped out the Camille Rose conditioner for Innersense pure inspiration daily conditioner, which is a lightweight conditioner, however it seemed to work well on my hair, but the next day it was looking not great (Pic provided of it). That could also be down to the fact I am using a very stripping shampoo atm (I have to keep using that for now at least, however feel free to suggest changes for everything else). Also as I am writing this I have noticed that my bedhead feels softer looks somewhat more healthier then, say, day 2 of my routine - although day 1 always looks quite nice. \n\nAlso when thinking about the root of my problem, here is what is going through my mind right now, please tell me if any of these are the issue or if they're irrelevant to the issue:  \nLack of protein  \nProducts are too light and don't moisturize my hair enough  \nMy water is hard water  \n  \nSo to summarize my questions:\n\nShould I start using protein in my routine (if so how much, any product recs?)  \nShould I use heavier products?  \nWhat type of damage did I have and what was the cause of it?  \nAnd finally please advise me with what in my routine to change, I have a bit of a budget so go crazy lol  \n\n\nThanks!!",

I used palmers cocoa butter hand cream and pot and the pot doesn't really do anything I find\n\nIt sits on my skin but doesn't moisturise and the hand cream makes My hands itchy and drier then before.\n\nI'm wondering if I have a mild reaction to fragrances in skincreams/lotion. I have eczema on my scalp so I'm trying to use fragrance free shampoo\n\nI am prone to dry skin although my skin isn't particularly dry. I have a range or hormonal issues that aid my dry skin hypothyroidism and pcos. \n\nWith my pcos I do not get spots. I have been very lucky in this department. I do not get spots easily and none at all on my face.my body can feel greasy though as well as greasy eyelids.\n\nIs it worth changing my products to fragrance free? \n\nI have noticed that since using fragrance free stuff my skin is alot better and less blotchy.

      "content": "Hiya! i recently tried out the beauty of joseon ginseng cleansing oil together with the green plum cleanser as a double cleansing routine but had to stop after trying for 2 months bc my normally quite calm skin was noticeably worse. i’ve not gone back to removing makeup with micellar water and washing my face with plain water then moisturising and my skin is back to how it was before. \n\nthe reason i wanted to try an oil cleanser however is so that i can start using sunscreen. when i’ve tried to use sunscreen in the past i’ve noticed i don’t like how my skin texture changes and my pores clog more and read that the best way to remove sunscreen properly and avoid these things is with an oil cleansing step in the routine. i did use the beauty of joseon sunscreen this summer and generally liked it for daytime wear but again didn’t feel like my skin was right hence trying to find an oil cleanser. \n\nif anyone has any advice on how to incorporate an oil cleansing step without seeing increased breakouts and pores clogging up massively i would appreciate it!! \n\ni’d also like to start using a salicylic acid serum but in order to feel comfortable doing that given that i’m eczema prone, I’d like to have a sunscreen firmly in place in my routine without issues. and in order to have a sunscreen, i’d like to have an oil cleansing step without issues. \n\nnot necessarily looking for sunscreen advice as i’ve tried a few and decided i like the beauty of joseon. mainly looking for cleansing advice as i’ve put using sunscreen on hold until i’m happy with a cleanser.

(Not all at once of course)\n\nFor context I’m a 30F with hormonal acne for at least that last 10 years and I feel like I’ve tried everything. I’ve read every article, I know how every ingredient works and I’m just tired. Tired of every new ad, brand and promise.\n\nI’ve come to realize that my skin actually seems to do better with less, clean cleanser, moisturizer &amp; spf\n\nI know that after the purge of retinol and tret comes bliss and I would be lying if I said I was patient every time I’ve started those to wait for the blissful period. However at the same time I don’t want to rely on these products forever to have clear skin.\n\nSo my question for this community is has anyone been here? Gone completely back to the basics and saw improvement? Anyone who has been a complete skincare addict now have a 3 step routine? If so what can we use for anti aging in a minimal routine?\n\nPs. Beef tallow didn’t work for me, it made my skin more dry and aggravated my breakouts. Things i actually notice that help are staying hydrated and a good sweat (working out)\n\nAlso I’m not hating on any of the above products, just personally for me, I’m tired lol\n\nLastly, what does everyone do with products they purchase that don’t work for them? This is the worst part about the addiction lol I’m drowning in expensive products that I don’t use and probably won’t - what a waste! I hate it 😢\n\nTIA 🫶🏼",

      "content": "Hi all, I'm deciding between the Laifen Swift or Dyson Supersonic. My hair is natural (never colored), fine/thin, 2c type. I was previously using a $24.99 Chi Low EMF hair dryer that I purchased back in 2018! I recently noticed 2 cracks on the exterior so it's time to move on.\n\nI'm looking for something reliable that will last 5+ years. I don't mind maintenance of cleaning filters, etc., just looking for something solid that will be gentle on my hair. I mostly blow out my hair/rough dry with a brush and want to get into diffusing my curls. I've been using the Dyson for about a week and upon first use my hair didn't feel as dried out (parched)/frizzy as what it does with my Chi. I never even knew my hair was looking rough until I tried the Dyson - it made my hair silky smooth and pretty straight even without using a brush.\n\nI also ordered the Laifen which is coming in the mail next week.\n\nDo any of you use either blow dryers - what would you recommend? Longevity wise, how are they holding up? Other opinions &amp; comments welcome. Thank you!",
