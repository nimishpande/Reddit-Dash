I was like ok because tone was commanding. Then when I asked her about some product she went out and started attending some other client. Then I was checking out some Skincare products then she came to us saying we are closing, Then me and my friend said it's 7:00 pm only why are u asking us to leave when everybody is there checking out some products. Then she said I will ask them too first u leave. We asked her why are u being so rude to us, then she said and I quote,\" tum jaisi ldkion ko mn achee se janti hun, kuch kharidna nhi hai bss ghumne aajati ho.\" I said this is your work u don't own it, u can't make us go out, then she said while shouting-\" kaam krti hun mn yahan\" I said yes then again \" kaam krti hun mn yahan \" I said yes then she said \" naukar hun tumhari\" I said mne ye toh nhi kaha aap naukar ho, then my friend come rescue and they had big argument in which she called us so many things  \" batamiz ladkian\" \" maa baap ne kuch sikhaya nhi\" ache se janti hun tum jesi ldkion ko\" \" kharidna kuch hai nhi ghumne aajati ho\" My friend continuously saying lower your voice, . She said \" bahar niklo yahan se kabhi aa mt jana yahan \" then I asked my friend to leave ki koi fayda nhi behes krke. When we were going out she came in the market outside the store nykaa and said while shouting \" batamiz ladkian kbh aa mt jana yahan wapis nikl jao\" while whole market was listening and seeing us, we didn't utter a word as we were in shocked why would she do that. Also mention this was happened in front of manager and she didn't said a word to her. Also I asked my friend who worked there and he said that this keeps happening her, and the staff here is ridiculous u should not visit this store. I filled a complaint against her at nykaa also wrote an email, but they didn't even revert back. Now I don't know what to do, should I do something or just remain silent now. This incident has effected me alot.",

      "content": "We started going to a dermatologist since almost a year ago. I was having hairfall and my wife had accompanied me. When my consultation was done, my wife casually asked about her face. She had had these scars from her college days which didn't bother her at all.   \nThe doctor suggested her some treatments,which she got done eventually post some research and had a drastic improvement.   \nThe problem is that she has become a little obsessed now, almost to the point of addiction. She keeps going to the doctor every month or so now for something or the other. This is not a rant about the doctor, she is very sweet and sincere and great at what she does, she would even tell my wife to take it slow. My wife is spending around 30k a month on this.  \nI mean we're well off, own a house in a posh society on the golf course road in ggn. The money is not really a problem, in fact it's a small fraction of what we earn.  \nShe justifies it by saying she feels beautiful and feels very confident and has become more social now, but I feel that this is an unhealthy obsession. I mean, we're all ageing, it's the inevtiable truth.  \nI've tried to have this conversation with her, but she deflects it by saying Zindagi na milegi dobara and other similar bs. Does anyone else have experience with this sort of thing?? How did you tackle it?",

I'm currently going on a journey of tackling darker areas and kp (knees elbows inner thighs), I only started a week ago but don't want to cause more harm than good, so I wanted to share my routine and see if anyone has any advice :) My current routine is:\n\n* Alternating between two body washes- Naturium The Smoother Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Body Wash &amp; Lactovit Lactourea body wash\n* I then mix the Naturium Tranexamic Topical Acid 5% and Alpha Arbutin Serum 2% and apply that to just those areas and wait for it to dry- I used to use their Multibright but they discontinued it, I didn't see much improvement but I was only using it for about a month before it ran out\n* Then I use their The Smoother Glycolic Acid Body Lotion\n\nI do this in the evenings, there is a bit of a tingle after I apply the body lotion but no burning. I am probably a 3-4 on the Fitzpatrick Scale, I have Middle Eastern heritage. I know that some say glycolic acid can increase hyperpigmentation so I'm not sure how good it is for daily use or sensitive areas, I'm not sure what the percentage is for the lotion or if its high enough to cause this. My skin is slightly reactive, I tend to get red very easily even just from putting my clothes on but it goes away after a few minutes and doesn't hurt. Should I alternate days? What do you guys think? Are there other things you've tried that you recommend? :)",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

However - some of these sheet masks are drenched with product. For instance, I'm currently wearing a numbuzin - No.2 Water Collagen mask as I type this and I'm dreading when my Alexa goes off because I'm not sure how to do this. The essence on this mask is so so so thick, that moisturizing over it immediately I feel would potentially clog my pores. Which leads me to my next question of will the essence evaporate if I wait a bit?\n\nBasically, I'm not sure how to go about moisturizing after super wet sheet masks without mixing it all around or *maybe* clogging my pores.\n\nAdvice welcomed &amp; appreciated",

Recently I did a DIY unicorn cut to get some layers and bounce, I also cut some length I've cut quite alot off, it's only been 2 weeks but this is what I'm left with, I still think I need more cut as my hair is super thick and I think it's being weighed down but I'm a lil scared to go shorter lol! Part of me thinks my curls are gone or not coming back and it makes me so sad🥺 my routine is, curl cream on super wet hair straight after washing, mousse and then a curl pudding, and air dry, Please any advice would help! I wanna stick to this as much as I can! My hair feels super soft and I'm wondering if that's why the curls aren't really \"holding?\" I end up wearing it back in a bun because I hate how it looks🤦🏻‍♀️ so I'm getting nowhere with my journey really!
