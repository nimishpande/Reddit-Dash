It still is, though the frizz has gone down a tad. I also got advice to get a specific hair brush to try and clump my hair into bigger chunks so as not to leave it stringy, but it still turned out like this.\n\nI use not your mother’s curl tall shampoo, conditioner, and curling cream, and Garnier Fructis gel just to build up a cast. I partially diffused it on a cool setting then let it air dry. I then scrunched it again with a light hair oil to brake out the cast.\n\nAny advice on how to get those bigger clumps? I tried the curl defining hairbrush but to no avail. Am I perhaps just forcing curls and don’t really have them naturally? My mom says that I’m making my hair into something it isn’t 😭 ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "21M with oily, acne-prone skin.\n\nMy skincare journey started around August 2023. I began using only **Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid Cleanser** and **Pilgrim Vitamin C serum**. I did **not** use any moisturizer or sunscreen at that time.\n\nAfter the Vitamin C finished, I switched to **Minimalist Niacinamide serum**, but I noticed my skin actually got worse. Over time, I kept starting and stopping skincare randomly. For almost 2 years, I was basically just using the salicylic acid cleanser without proper moisturizing or sun protection.\n\nAfter researching, I now realize that skipping **moisturizer and sunscreen** probably damaged my skin barrier.\n\nI stopped all skincare for 1–2 months and recently restarted. I don’t plan to visit a dermatologist due to bad past experiences and lack of good dermatologists in my city.\n\n# Current Routine:\n\n**AM**\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n* JOY Almond &amp; Honey Body Lotion (on face)\n* Deconstruct Gel Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n* JOY Almond &amp; Honey Body Lotion (on face)\n* Minimalist Vitamin K + Retinal Under Eye Cream (for dark circles)\n\nFrom my research, a **simple 3-step routine** seems best:\n\n* AM: Cleanser + Moisturizer + Sunscreen\n* PM: Cleanser + Moisturizer (+ retinol later)\n\nI’m thinking of **changing my moisturizer**, since I’m currently using a body lotion on my face.\n\nI’m not in a rush at all — even if it takes **1–2 years**, I just want my skin to heal properly.\n\n**Looking for suggestions on:**\n\n* Whether my current routine makes sense\n* If I should stop or limit salicylic acid\n* Moisturizer recommendations for oily, acne-prone skin\n* When (or if) I should introduce retinol\n\nAny help would be really appreciated 🙏",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Hi guys!\n\nI have been using 0,05% tretinoin daily for about 5 months now. It has done wonders for my acne, but my skin texture looks off. I don’t really know how to describe it, but sometimes I get these reddish patches on my face and i just have textured skin overall. I think my skin barrier is compromised. Would it be wise to tone down my tret use? Maybe applying 3/4 nights a week instead of every night. Please leave any other tips down below. Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: more context of my skin history, might be insightful:\n\nUsed to have almost flawless skin, however the end of last year i suddenly developped very inflammatory acne. Used tret 0,025% (daily) and doxycycline for a while alongside gentle cleansers and moisturizers. Worked, but my acne came back just before summer. Started 0,05% tret (sandwich method daily) in august, which helped tremendously. I barely have breakouts anymore. Sometimes I do get (painful) inflamed pustules which could maybe be the result of my damaged barrier.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nAM:\n\nWash with water\n\nLayer of CeraVe moisturizing cream\n\nPaula’s choice 10% azelaic acid booster\n\nLayer of CeraVe moisturizing cream\n\nSkin1004 spf\n\nPM:\n\nLRP toleraine cleanser\n\nLayer of CeraVe\n\n0,05% tretinoin\n\nLayer of Cerave",

My hair is currently longer and well-defined, but the length makes it heavy and it tends to fall into my face, which I don’t like.\n\nI’m thinking of going shorter (around jaw-length) with a rounded, voluminous shape more of a curly halo / cloud silhouette rather than layers that hang down.\n\nWhat I’m aiming for:\n\n\t•\tNo bangs or fringe\n\n\t•\tMinimal hair on my forehead or eyes\n\n\t•\tAs much volume as possible all around (especially at the crown)\n\n\t•\tA bold, intentional shape rather than a shag or wolf cut\n\n\t•\tI’m okay with big hair I actually prefer volume\n\nFor context, I’ve had short curly hair in the past, but that was before I followed any curly routine (no conditioner, no styling products), so it fell forward a lot and looked messy. Now my curls are much more defined and controlled, so I’m wondering if the same length would behave very differently.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\t•\tDoes a short, rounded, high-volume cut work well for 2C-3A curls?\n\n\t•\tWhat length range keeps the shape full without hair falling into the face?\n\n\t•\tAny red flags or specific instructions I should give my stylist?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone with similar curl types or experience with shorter curly cuts.

Lightweight Daily Moisturizer (use daily morning and night)\n\n6. Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 (use daily in the morning)\n\nMy goal is to reduce redness and pore size.\n\nI've already noticed a huge difference, especially on my forehead. It used to be very dry, almost irritated. In the past, I used numbers 1 (gel) and 5 only.\n\nI don't know much about skincare so I wanted to get some recommendations on my current routine or other things I could try! I'm curious about a roller? Can I use two toners (Good Molecules has another that reduces pore size)?\n\nAny other tips generally, maybe for makeup?\n\nI've been really enjoying myself doing skincare, so I'm excited to learn more!",

Turns out the real issue wasn't cleaner skin, it was destroying my skin's microbiome + barrier. \n\nThat tight after wash feeling isn't clean, it's damage. Your skin needs its good bacteria and barrier intact to actually behave. Once i stopped over-cleansing and dialing up actives, things changed. \n\nNow I only use:\n\n1. one gentle facewash  \n2. one simple serum  \n3. one moisturiser\n\nThat’s it, no 10-step routine.

      "content": "My hair is 2a-3c. It is quite thick and wavy/curly. The hair porosity test kind of confused me at first but my hair floated in the end. I tried the slide test and it was smooth which would mean low porosity I guess. Some people said just doing an observation test is best so I tried that. It took about a minute to get fully wet with no manipulation. It takes quite a while to dry naturally too. It is also quite shiny so (I think?) it is safe to assume I have low porosity hair.\n\nRight now I use Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus curl and shine shampoo with the Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus curl and shine conditioner to tighten my curls and wash it about 3-4x per week. Now I want to grow my hair out more to shoulder length. The end goal is a wavy wolf cut style. The problem with my current shampoo is that it makes the curls too tight whereas I want something that will make my hair more loose and wavy to reach my intended style. After looking online I found the Bumble and Bumble Surf Shampoo &amp; Surf Conditioner however it is rather expensive and I don't know if its right for my hair.\n\nI saw some people saying I should be looking for shampoos that fit my hair porosity rather than style however I am seeing way too many opinions on this and I don't know which to follow. I don't know much about hair at all and no one in my family has hair like mine so it would be helpful to know what to look for.\n\nSome extra information in case it is required: my hair is longer on top ranging from 7-15cm and slightly shorter in the sides. The ends of my hair curl and coil whereas the the base of my hair is quite wavy and tends to sit. I'm 21 and male.\n\nI really don't know much about hair or what to do with it so any advice is welcome. If more information is needed then let me know.",

Shampoo with Balea Lovely Pistachio \n2. Shampoo once more (I have oily hair)\n3. (Every 2nd-3rd wash) Natura Siberica Frozen Berries conditioner\n4. Wellaflex mousse for styling curly and wavy hair\n5. (Sometimes) Langhaarmädchen Naturlockenspray.\n\nNever in my life have I protected my hair while sleeping, it's a little bit past my shoulders when wet and dries exactly at my shoulder length. Regarding refresh routines.... I have used a few sprays of the Naturlockenspray and that's it. Please don't hate me for my routine, I was never really taught how to take care of non-straight hair 😅 \n\nIs it normal that the back part of the hair is just living its own life or am I doing smth wrong? I airdry every time, cause I don't have a diffuser (it came with my hairdryer, but I had to move suddenly and that was before I found out that my hair is wavy). I also scrunch the hell out of it while it's damp, today however (picture 1) I tried it on soaking wet hair. Will update later with the results. ",
