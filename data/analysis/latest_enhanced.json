I don't ever see any flies in my house, I am a clean mfer. But I also, usually right after a shower, apply the foam directly from the can right into my hair. And I leave the cap off the bottle. So...I've probably been applying dead flies to my hair every day for years after showering.\n\nApparently they like the ethanol in the foam formulation. I've never felt so grossed out.

      "content": "A while ago, I read a comment from a Mexican woman living in Paris.\nShe said that since moving to France, her hair had never been this short, not because she wanted to cut it, but because French hairdressers always insist on trimming.\nShe realized how in France, every visit ends with “your ends are too dry, we have to cut”, and it made her lose the motivation to even go anymore.\n\nShe explained that in Mexico and latin America in general, women place huge importance on their hair, which seems to be traditionally seen as a symbol of femininity and sensuality. \nThat resonated with me because I’d love to proactively care for my hair, instead of constantly cutting it like burned grass, also, curly cuts cost 3x the price of a regular haircut in France and I’m never happy with them. My curls are fine for me, I just would love them to grow longer, and it feels stupid trying to achieve it with what hairdressers recommend in Paris, hence, cutting a good 5-10cm of length to make it “grow longer and healthy”.\n\nSo, I wanted to ask Latin American curlies for their insights on this.\n\nWhat are your real, local secrets for healthy, long, shiny hair?\nNot the viral stuff like Skala while the whole world knows but the real insider things like traditionnal ingredients or rituals, local brands or products that actually work but aren’t famous abrod, habits or techniques that make the biggest difference for growth and softness, and also, how you deal with dryness and frizz in humid climates\n\nFor context: my hair is 2C+/3A, it hates hard water (calcium buildup) and breaks easily if I use too much protein.\nI’m trying to focus on health and length retention, no cuts for now \n\nMy routine is not locked, I change it from time to time according to the weather and period of the year and I’m willing to try different methods.\nLast wash day I used a clarifying shampoo + Nuxe Rêve de Miel rince conditioner + Flaxseed Gel on soaking hair + warm and then cold diffuser at 80% dryness + Davines Oi Oil to finish breaking the gel cast \n\nThank you so much if you take the time to share!",

After years of always blow drying and curling cause i never knew what to do with all the frizz and messylookingness. \n\nI went to the only curly hairstylist close to me that didn't charge literally not even exagerating $390 for a \"curly transformation cut\"\nThis woman charged me $75 and taught me what i needed to use, when and how my hair should be as I apply it. \n\nSince then ive kept experimenting and trying different products and order. I've been able to recreate these curls two days in a row! This is like day 3 or 4 curls. \n\nEven though it seems like so much product (im learning thats necessary for curly hair) my hair doesnt feel weighed down or like my curls fall. They feel super touchable and secure yet soft. Im super happy\n\n\nPRODUCTS USED AND ORDER:\n\nouidad spiral curls shampoo\n\nOuidad spiral curls Conditioner\n\nNot your mothers leave in (only apply once when my hair is drenched wet after wash) \n\nScrunch excess off with microfiber towel\n\nCurlsmith Airdry curl cream\n\nOuidad thermal control gel (decent ammount has been KEY) \n\nOuidad spiral curls mousse \n\nDiffuse just to form cast\n\nNot your mothers oil to scrunch out cast \n\n\nKristin Ess Texture spray (use lightly)- this has been KEY in keeping definition,  helped me feel like if i pull my curls or run my hands through it it just stays well and defined. Ill put my hair in a messy bun often and when taken down it looks just as good. \n\nAussie Flexible hold hair spray (suuuper light just for frizzy prone areas) \n\n\nRefresh: \n\nOuidad loose waves Curl activator or thermal control activator\nOuidad Gel\nOuidad mousse\nDiffuse \nOil\nTexture spray\n\n\n:)))\n\n\nIve just now gotten the Umberto Gianni gel and foam to try (i had already ordered them before I unlocked this combination) so im hoping I like them!",

I haven't committed to anything yet and am hoping some of the experts here can weigh in. What I've surmised so far is:\n\n* I should stop washing my face when I shower since the water is probably too hot.\n* I should wear some lightweight sunscreen throughout the year.\n* Only some kind of laser treatment can fix the broken capillary but sometimes they go away on their own.\n* A chemical exfoliant is better than a physical one. I'm hesitant to put anything chemical on my face though.\n* Good sleep is great for your skin and I haven't been sleeping well the past two years but I suppose that's a separate issue.\n\nCan anyone recommend a good routine with specific products in mind? I understand the idea of like a cleanser and a moisturizer but I'm really at square one here with like what good options are -- and some of the things I've tried have just felt too heavy (like the Cerave moisturizing cream)",

My skin wasn't so textured or chock full of whiteheads, so I don't know if these worked or not. I couldn't really tell a difference. \n\nMy sister just gifted me CosRX's 6 peptide skin booster and their AHA BHA PHA LHA peel because she knows I love the mucin. I'm wondering if these can help my skin, and more importantly, if I can use both together. \n\nMy skin is dry, with big pores and a nose prone to flaking. I used to have very oily skin as a teen and it's just kind of wilding out to be honest. We have extreme weather so it either gets very dry or very oily, but it's extremely prone to blockage.

      "content": "Hey everyone!\nFirst off, I rarely ever post on Reddit, so I hope I’m not breaking any rules 😅\n\nSome context:\nLast summer, I grew my hair out into a mullet, but I didn’t really like how it turned out. So, I decided to get a low taper fade instead.\nMy mistake was getting it done out of town — the barber completely messed it up. He even nicked my ear with the clippers and made it bleed😵‍💫.\n\nAfter that, I got super unmotivated to take care of my hair because I hated how it looked. I mostly just wore hats for a while.\nNow, about 3 months later, it’s grown out a bit, and I’m starting to like it again.\n\nSo, I want to get back into hair care and really take care of my curls — I think they have some real potential 🙃\nThe problem is, I don’t really know what I’m doing, and I’m honestly overwhelmed by all the advice out there.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\nEvery morning:\n\t1.\tRinse my hair with super cold water\n\t2.\tLet it air-dry a bit while I get dressed (I don’t use a towel)\n\t3.\tSpray some heat protectant\n\t4.\tGently separate my curls with my fingertips\n\t5.\tUse a blow dryer with a diffuser to dry my hair\n\nSometimes, if I’m going out later, I’ll do the same routine again.\nEvery couple of days, I use shampoo and conditioner.\n\nMy questions:\n\t•\tWhat should I change about my routine?\n\t•\tWhat kinds of products could/should I add to reduce frizz and make my curls look better?\n\nAny advice or product recs would be super appreciated 🙏\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR:\nGot a bad haircut months ago and stopped caring for my hair. Now it’s growing back and I want to take care of my curls again, but I’m overwhelmed by all the info out there. Here’s my basic routine (cold rinse + heat protectant + diffuser). What should I change or add to reduce frizz and enhance curls?\n",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
