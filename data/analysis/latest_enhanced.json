Its been 10 months since I started growing it. Discovered I have a pretty wavy/curly hair and started a curly hair routine. It was very difficult to maintain it and had to learn how to take care of it. I'm planning to grow it out for another 1-2 years and see how it goes. \n\nRoutine: Normal Shampoo, Dove Conditioner/Mask, Leave-in Conditioner while damp, Coconut Oil also to keep the make the hair weigh down. Otherwise it would get frizzy and reach for the ceiling lol.",

She doesn’t understand curly hair at ALL but she’s constantly making comments about my appearance. My hair being a point of contention whenever I visit.\n\nSo I was recently with family for my sisters graduation. While we’re waiting, a woman a few rows below us goes to sit down.

She has beautiful hair!” I stare at this woman’s hair (which is beautiful) and see all of the flaws my mom points out for my hair: dusts of halo frizz, wayward curls, etc… nothing wrong with it, but things people like my mother shame me over. Her hair type is JUST like mine, but her hair goes down mid back rather than my shoulder length. I say “Seriously? My hair is just like that and you insult it all the time!” She goes quiet for a moment, thinking, and then says “well, idk. It’s longer and it looks better on her.”\n\nJust can’t win.\n\nRoutine, since I still need to put one down I guess?

I’ve got autism and the social dynamics of the hairdressers confuses me and gives me a lot of anxiety.\n\nSo I’m trying to prepare myself and I have a question.\n\nThe hairdressers I choose is kinda small very accepting of different ppl and kinda laid back. The lady who owns it is always there and does the nails and is really nice. I’ll possibly be the only hair client in there. I’ve been there for nails before.\n\nWhen the staff are talking out loud across the room about stuff that peaks my interest is it rude to join in? Am I joining in on a private convo or not? Sometimes I think they’re trying to include me but I’m not sure so I stay silent but then I worry that’s being rude. \n\nIm getting a cut and ombré balayage with a mixture of bright colours needing bleached so feel I’m gonna be there for a few hours and it’s stressing me out!\n\n \n\n\n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I'm envisioning an app that has a scanning option where you can scan you face for example and have any concerns identified ie. specific pimples, specific patches of hyperpigmentation, eczema etc. If anything is out of the ordinary, you will be ref'd to a dermatologist immediately; it could potentially even help with early serious skincare detections. It would then give you tailored treatments / how to apply them to treat those specific breakouts and accelerate your healing timeline. All of your scans are tracked and you can see pasts scans and get advice on what products, diet, lifestyle factors may be affecting your skin. You can also create a custom skincare budget and have products recommended to you that fit that budget. You can buy products directly through the app (maybe a discount?) and can also scan your existing products to see what works for you, how to use them and if anything is hazardous. There would also be a specialized ChatGPT for skincare in the app that you can ask any questions about your skin / general skincare. \n\nIt would be free to use with maybe a premium tier? Or completely free with monetization from in-app product purchases.\n\nWould you use it? Got any ideas? If I build an app like this, I wouldn’t want to do it without the input of the community.",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I want to figure out what the cause of this anxiety may be.\n\nAbout a month ago I started getting a fairly persistent lump in the throat sensation called globus ssensation and that has spiraled into other anxiety symptoms, just an overall general uneasy feeling.\n\nI did begin oral Finasteride (.5 mg daily) about 3 months prior to the onset of symptoms, and I can’t help but wonder if that has any causation to how I’m feeling now. I don’t want to stop Finasteride for no reason but I also want to be objective regarding my approach. Here is what I’m thinking and I’d love feedback.\n\n1. I did have bloodwork done prior to beginning the Finasteride. Is it worth getting bloodwork now? If so, what should I be looking at specifically to see if it can be contributing to anxiety\n\nThank you very much",

There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine?

It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

I detangled after conditioner (Pantene's) in the shower and then outside, with wet hair. Then some Pantene mouse, dry It with the diffuser and the second photo is the result I have. Why on earth do I think It looks better on the third photo??? I did absolutely nothing more than washed it and conditioner, then air dried. I think I might have fine and medium/low porosity hair...

Steriod cream and rubbing Vaseline after baths worked temporarily and then it flared back up again (through the steroid cream and vasoline treatments). I  changed everything about my life: bed sheets, laundry soap, showering temperatures and timeframes, soaps, vasoline and oils use after showers, oral supplements (fish oil, turmeric,  etc), I've had steriod shots and Nemluvio shots, I've stopped drinking coffee and alcohol and increased my water intake...on and on and on. Someone told me it could be linked to spiked protein from Covid-19 and I have just started taking supplements for that but I am reaching out because I am desperate. In hopes someone can help...",

      "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI am 28 years old. I am looking for a proper skin care routine that is not too complicated. I want to slow down the aging process of my skin, and also would like to brighten it up a bit. I have a few acne scars that I would like to lighten. I also used to have dark circles during my teenage years, but as I got older they went away. They come back if I don’t sleep well or am not hydrated enough.\n\nI was really into holistic and natural approaches to treat skin issues. I’ve had acne in the past, and I would use honey, turmeric, oils, etc in my skin care routine. I would purchase a few skin care products, and then discard them after being lazy lol. But now I want to take things seriously. Luckily I have nice skin with the occasional pre period pimple but I’m not sure how effective my current routine is. There’s no guidance.\n\nI wear sunscreen religiously. I do a face mask with nizoral and cleanse with panoxyl 10% occasionally to keep away the acne. I just have a pimple or two right before my period. Am I using nizoral and panoxyl correctly? No idea. Just works for me so far. I moisturize with cetaphil sometimes. And I sometimes sleep with rosehip oil on my face.\n\nI have used a vitamin C in the past but it broke me out a lot. I currently own tretinoin but have not used it yet. Ideally, I think I should incorporate a type of retinol, vitamin C, and tretinoin. But I’m not sure.\n\nWould really appreciate any help or guidance.",
