      "content": "There you go...\nI've always had lots of different hairstyles; I've always loved my hair and doing different things with it.\n\nThe first time I cut my hair short and shaved one side, I was 12 years old, and it lasted at least 10 years with the shaving and other haircuts.\nIn 2022, I shaved my head (the first time was in 2018).\nThis year I stopped everything; it's all grown out naturally, except I have no idea how to take care of long hair. This summer I did everything wrong; it was always tied up. I can't get it to reach my ears; I don't know how to take care of it properly.\nAnd now we have huge knots several centimeters long that are naturally creating dreadlocks. I'm in a vicious cycle; it's getting worse every day, and I'm afraid it will continue.\nI don't know what to do. I don't have the energy to keep changing my hairstyle; I don't want to anymore... so I have three options.\n\n1) Simple, quick, effective: I cut it. Just the tangled strands so I can get a proper haircut in January without feeling self-conscious (I want a short bob with a longer strand in the back for a braid; I can't cut it properly if it's like this).\n\n2) I'm continuing with the dreadlocks I've already started. I'm adding more strands, doing it carefully to manage the tangles and the self-consciousness (I've already had them done; I learned them when I was younger, along with other hairstyles...). However, I'm European and Caucasian. I've had dreadlocks in the past; they were beautiful, but now I know about cultural appropriation and the history behind dreadlocks, so I don't want to be disrespectful by wearing them. (Here too, I'm taking into account opinions and historical and hair knowledge. I don't want to offend or appropriate things I shouldn't. I'd like to remain respectful beyond aesthetics and practicality.) 🙏🙏)\n\n3) I'm untangling everything, but I don't know how to go about it or if I can go to hair salons that can help me (always being clear and respectful of their work, finding a suitable professional so as not to put a hairdresser in a difficult situation and waste their time).\nI'm open to all your opinions and suggestions 😊",

The first photo is how they cut my hair the first time I saw them since I was growing out my pixie and realized I have naturally wavy hair. This was 2 years ago and I’ve since grew my hair out well below my shoulders. Looking back at pictures with my short hair, I really missed that era and went to cut my hair with them again. I showed them the reference and explained exactly how I want it to look but (third picture) this is what my hair looks like right now after trying to somewhat decently style it. The fourth photo is immediately after the haircut. I just don’t know what went wrong or what I should do… I realize my hair probably has to grow out before I do anything else with it but how do I go from this to the voluminous, wavy hair in the first and second photos? Any advice will be greatly appreciated 🙏\n\nMy usual styling routine are the Odele volumizing shampoo and conditioner, then the Twist by Ouidad lightweight styling gel and a styling foam. I usually diffuse my hair but it looked horrible with this haircut so I ended up straightening it. ",

I’ve always had issues with frizz and getting my hair to cooperate, but I feel like it’s finally time to ask for help, lol. \n\nHere is my routine: \n\n1. I wash my hair every other day. In the shower I use Pantene pro-v repair and protect shampoo. Once that’s washed out I use Monday curl define conditioner, and I brush it through my hair with a wet brush. I let it sit while I soap/shave and washing it out is the last thing I do before I get out of the shower. \n\n2. I dry it with a microfiber towel until it’s just damp, then I use Jamaican black castor oil leave in conditioner from the body shop. I get a blueberry/grape sized glob, rub it on my fingers, and then do my best to spread it through my hair without running my fingers through it to mess up the curls. \n\n3. Once it’s all spread through I scrunch my hair up with my hands for a bit, and then I let it air dry. I don’t brush or comb my hair unless I’m in the shower with conditioner in it. \n\n4. I typically only use the leave in conditioner when I’m planning on going out somewhere, but I get frizz whether or not I use it. I’d really love to see my hair with more defined curls, especially at the top of my head, with less of the frizz of course!! Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ",

I’ve noticed that right after ejaculation, my scalp follicles start tingling, and hair fall seems to increase. Continuous ejaculation over consecutive days appears to lead to excessive hair loss. It also seems to alleviate sebum production, acne, dandruff, excess body odor, and sweating.\n\nI’ve been trying to identify the vitamins and nutrients lost during ejaculation and have experimented with supplementing them—mainly zinc, magnesium, amino acids, etc. I’ve also noticed that cardio and exercise help me recover more quickly from the post-ejaculatory phase.\n\nMy question is: Has there been any study on what happens in the male body immediately after ejaculation?\n\nAdditionally, hair loss has historically been a male-specific issue, and it is mostly men who lose semen/energy during reproduction, whereas women do not. Also relevant is sexual dimorphism—men tend to have more body hair, and perhaps cannot “afford” to maintain scalp hair, as it is anatomically expensive. Hair loss also appears more prevalent in Caucasian men, who generally have higher body hair density compared to many Asian populations.\n\nSorry for the rant.\n",

      "content": "This is my first post and I hope I’ve used the right tag/flair, I wasn’t sure what to post this under. I’m using ChatGPT to sum this up for more immediate help lol.\n\nTL;DR: I used a 5-year-old Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion on under-the-skin acne out of desperation and reapplied it nightly for several days. It initially helped, but then caused severe irritation—dryness, burning, pain, and clusters of small white bumps. I didn’t realize it was the cause at first and kept using it, which made things worse. Now my skin stings even with gentle cleanser, feels like it’s burning, and the only relief is tons of Aquaphor, which I can’t keep on overnight. I’m looking for urgent advice on how to heal my damaged skin barrier quickly because it’s painful &amp; horrible looking.\n\nI’m in some desperate need of help. I am completely at fault due to not only using old product, but overapplying it. But at the end of the day, I need some relief 🥲 \n\nLast week, I had several blemishes that I felt the need to rid myself of ASAP. They were those stubborn, under the skin bumps. I did some research &amp; found that the Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion helps a lot with those blemishes that are beneath the skin. I saw a pic of the bottle on one of the sub-Reddits I was browsing &amp; I was like I think I actually HAVE this somewhere?!? Lo and behold, I did! I know it’s at least 5 years old and I haven’t used it, but I was desperate (stupid, I know). I applied it &amp; all was well, my blemishes were going down. Went to work the next day, things were still fine but the 3 areas I put this on were drier, and I noticed one of the blemishes kinda started to surface during the day. Long story short, I had been reapplying it either once or twice a night for at least 4 days (at night). On the morning of the 5th day, I didn’t apply it, but I randomly had what I thought was a rash appear on my cheek. I thought I could have possibly gotten some sort of chemical on my hands and then touched my face, so I chalked it up as that &amp; proceeded to use the buffering lotion again the next 2 nights. That’s when I put two and two together, when I woke up and my skin had a bunch of white bumps, not necessarily whiteheads, but almost like tiny little bites or something. To not make this longer than need be, I’m now left with skin that is not only very dry in those areas, but HURTS. I feel like I’ve been repeatedly slapped in the face for hours and it burns sooo bad. I am trying to avoid using any products, but with the dryness and winter, it’s like that makes it worse. Even my sensitive skin La Roche Possay cleanser stings. My literal only sense of relief has been from lathering my face in Aquaphor &amp; I don’t want to sleep with it like that and get it all over my hair and pillowcases (I have to work and dont have the time to redo my hair in the mornings).\n\nI’m seeking some serious help to try to heal this immediately bc it not only looks bad, but it’s very uncomfortable as well.

      "content": "TLDR at bottom! \n\nHey, r/endometriosis directed me here. I started taking 50mg of notethindrone acetate a day to treat endo symptoms- Endo went away, my hormonal acne EXPLODED. Deep cystic jawline/cheek breakouts. I wanted to ask a few questions from any of you all that may have had a similar experience?\n\nI've had (forehead) acne since I was 13. They tried 2 separate birthcontrol pills early on (also because bad periods. Spoiler alert it was endo), nothin'. Tried prescription tretinoin around 15. Nothin. Looking back this was deffo aggressive puberty acne cuz I've never had it on my forehead since.\n\nIt migrated downwards onto my cheeks/jaw around 16 years old when covid hit. I also credit my skin barrier being damaged to those evil baby hair mini razors off of amazon. It never recovered. \n\nWe tried spironolactone, it was ineffective and stopped working a couple months in + made me really dizzy. I eventually got off birthcontrol around 19 yrs old and... my acne got better? It took almost a year but it started clearing up noticeably. Got good skincare routine going, and was later going to focus on scar tissue once my skin was stronger.\n\nJump to 21 and current year. Massive painful flare sent me to some specialists. Got diagnosed with endo. Been trying to deal with it until now but it was impacting my life very negatively in ways I hadn't honestly realized since it was such a constant. They put me on progesterone and YEESH the acne is bad. \n\nSo. All that being said (cuz I'm really hoping someone out there had the exact same experience)... The only solution to clear skin seems to be no hormonal medication whatsoever, but then my life sucks cuz of endometriosis 😩 I have 0 idea how birthcontrol medications work because they all seem to have different levels of testosterone/estrogen. If anyone out there is in the same boat, did you find *anything* that worked for you?\n\nTLDR: Stubborn hormonal acne when taking birthcontrol pills/ or Skyla IUD, (VERY bad on) progesterone, spiro is useless. Cuz they all seem to make it worse? How to treat when endometriosis is also wrecking my shit? \n\n",

A Rezo cut, dry cut curl by curl or Deva cut more face framing is a huge part of it. It's interesting that so many introduce new products everyday, sponsored, and claim the products achieved that look alone. Find a Rezo specialist in your area, get the cut and you won't need  those rudiculousy expensive products, just regular brands with a routine.\n\nMy routine is wash with Redkin color extend, condition with Pantene, use the Flora Curl line cream, mousse gel and plop with microfiber towel.  I air dry.  I use a silk scrunchy to pineapple it for sleep. I rewet with spray bottle and scrunch each day until I was again every 4 days.\n\nI  am done with the expensive stuff, just get a professional curl cutter.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
