I’m trying to achieve even 10% of what she has.\n\nI am currently on day 3 after washing. My current routine for this week was: I shampoo with moisturizing curl talk shampoo, then I do Mielle rosemary mint strengthening hair mask. Then I do 3-in-1 Curl Talk conditioner and don’t fully wash it out and squish in a bit to my ends before exiting the shower.\n\nThen I praying hands Pattern styling custard and drag it through a bit on top.  I then use them bounce curl clips while diffusing on warm setting for heat and low intensity with minimal movement to set the curls. I fluff out the roots after dry with the bounce curl volume comb. I scrunch in Ouai hair oil once dry.\n\nToday I sectioned my hair out while using tresemme keratin smooth weightless anti-frizz finishing spray at the roots and using the bounce curl volume comb diffusing where I sprayed after using the comb on low cold setting to set the spray.\n\nI’m pretty happy with the results, but looking for more tips if anyone has any? \n\nI may just need a hair cut. I just can’t seem the back to achieve the same volume at the back that I get around my face. At the side part it seems flat as well.  Amy other hair spray, how to cut the hair (I just cut my own hair how I feel like, so I’m not scared to try), or technique tips?\n\nI also want to understand how they do her lazy messy updo (see photo)??? I’m totally lost on how that is achieved.\n\n\n",

Avene Gentle Foaming Cleanser (I double cleanse with the DHC Cleansing Oil when I’ve been wearing makeup) \n2. Finacea/Azelaic Acid (AM)\n3. Soolantra/Ivermectin (PM) \n4.

I’ve been using 1 mg finasteride for 3 months, and I just started using the (cheap) Kirkland 5% minoxidil solution once a day.\n\nI started on the recommendation of a trichologist, and she did a baseline evaluation with a trichoscope.\n\nAll the vellus hairs you can see in the images are brand new—similar length, very tiny, but pigmented.\n\nThe images cover a 4 mm × 7.5 mm area (about 0.3 cm²). The white patches are residue from the cheap minoxidil/vehicle.\n\nI know these vellus hairs most likely won’t become terminal, but I’m impressed by how quickly minoxidil can push hairs into a growth phase and make them sprout so fast, seemingly all at the same time. It gives me hope it will positively impact my terminal hairs too (I’m currently around \\~30 follicular units per cm² on an NW7 pattern, with a lot of thin single-hair follicular units), so I can eventually go for a transplant.\n\nI’ll keep updating this.\n\nCheers.\n\n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "title": "Doom and Despair of Sensitive Skin - I Give Up... [Acne] [Routine Help] [Sun Care]",
      "content": "To give a brief overview I am a 30y/o male and I have been using skincare on/off for the better part of the last 10 years of my life. I have been through it all... dermatologists, accutane, etc. Essentially, i am teetering on the edge of giving up skincare entirely (below will explain why)\n\nBelow is a summary of all my findings:\n\nEver since I turned 20 years old and started hitting the gym, i was eating more and discovered that whey protein isolate is the devil for acne prone people. This triggered me to visit dermatologists as a desperate ploy for help. They did what every dermatologist does... without ever assessing skin type, lifestyle habits, etc... Here is some generic samples of a Cetaphil cleanser, etc. Nothing worked. I went on antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, and eventually Accutane. WOW my skin cleared, for about 8 months... then it relapsed again.\n\nAt this point I really didn't care anymore, it was what it was... my acne never got that bad. Eventually my skin actually got so clear I literally almost had no blemishes at all... my skincare routine at the time. A shower... once maybe twice a day. That's it... I worked out and tried to eat healthy-ish and nothing else.\n\nFast forward a few years and I started dating someone new. I had a really rough breakout over the winter season. Earlier that fall I was applying SPF from Cetaphil and some stupid black mask that my brother's girlfriend had convinced me to try now and then, including that clay mask in the red container. Needless to say that clear skin I had earlier was completely ruined... and I could not get a control on my breakouts.\n\nI started a simple skincare routine because of Hyram on YouTube and I mean SIMPLE (CeraVe hydrating cleanser + moisturizing cream)... my skin slowly improved and later I incorporated Paula's Choice BHA 2% Bottle. Honestly my skin was pretty good here, aside from the fact I would occasionally still get a really nasty pimple. However, one big problem. I have never been a SPF person. In fact, every single chemical sunscreen I have ever worn has caused pretty severe breakouts. The year or two of BHA with no SPF literally made my wrinkles so bad I looked like I was 80 years old.\n\nSo I heard about retinoids and it sounded like a gold mine for all my issues. Clear acne, wear a mineral spf and all is good right? WRONG. I tried Differin with all the correct steps from online sources... once, twice a week for a few weeks up to 3 times a week only.. SPF usage normal routine. I have NEVER broke out so badly in my entire life... My mother literally asked me if I was okay because she was concerned for my health...\n\n(BTW before you say try different products... over the years I have researched and tried many popular suggestions all with the same results)\n\nI started to think... why does my mother and father not have these issues? They both said they didn't really struggle with acne (There goes the genetics argument). Looked at old photos of myself in high school (when everyone has acne), I didn't have any...\n\nHonestly at this point I was so deep in depression I just literally said \"F it\" and quit everything. I bought myself a showerhead filter and stopped showering in hot water on my face. Drank beer, showered and went to sleep, for the next month and a half. Not one single new pimple popped up on my face. Just a bunch of old scars from all the damage.\n\nTake what you will from this post, I am not knocking anyone's routine. If something works for you keep doing it. I just think for some of us, we cant really tolerate skincare and we will get shamed for being unhygienic, or not wearing SPF to protect against skin cancer.\n\nTo be completely fair, we are all going to get wrinkly and die some day regardless of what we do to our pretty little faces.\n\nI vote life a happy life, and I welcome any comments/advice to spark comments or debate on the topic.\n\nCheers to a Happy New Year!",

I can’t use my fingers much so it’s impossible to properly wash my good hand without help. Opening products is also a problem. So far I’ve just been closing them as best I can and having my husband tighten them when he’s around to help. I want to wear makeup but I already know double cleansing is going to be a nightmare and I’m not showering as much because I need help from my husband to (we have really busy/opposite schedules so it’s a whole thing). \n\nAny advice/tips??

I just tried the following products \n\n L'Oreal Paris EverPure Sulfate Free Hair Gloss Glossing Lamination Mask\n\nL'Oreal Paris EverPure Frizz-Defy Sulfate Free Shampoo with Marula Oil\n\nL'Oreal Paris EverPure Sulfate Free Glossing Conditioner with Glycolic Acid\n\nAnd all seem really great. The issue though is they are so very floral. I am super sensitive and it’s just way too much for me. The only floral I can handle is rose. So I’m wondering if anyone has any suggestions on products that are super similar but come in like vanilla? Coconut would probably be ok too. And like I said rose is also fine 9 times out of 10. Rose is actually usually the scent I use but there are a couple rose scents that are too floral. Specifically I’m starting to experiment with hair masks - I can survive with the other shampoo and conditioners I’ve used in the past but want to find a hair mask too. \n\nI think it’s lilac, lavender, and peony that really get to me.

This was my hair 2 days after being washed.\nMy routine is that I use Aveeno clarifying shampoo then Aussie hydrating shampoo, then I use As I Am hair cream, I section my hair and apply it, use a styling brush then use curlsmith hair gel (strong hold), I do that to all sections of my hair then air dry. I sleep with my hair tied up in a pineapple with a bonnet. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week. I tend to airdry rather than diffuse.\nI have dyed my hair a few months ago and find that it's affected my curl pattern which is looser, and my hair is more dry. Am I applying too much hair products? I've tried mousse and it doesn't make much of a difference, I don't add oil because it looks greasy, I have had people comment that it looks \"full of products\". \nI also struggle with my hair in the morning, the day after I wash it, when I take my hair down it doesn't naturally fall, just stays awkwardly all over the place so I end up tying it back because it looks terrible. But if I don't use a lot of products, it becomes so frizzy, and I don't have the patience to finger curl.\nWhat am I doing wrong?",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

I would really like to find something that holds my hair in place and also stays wet. I was told leave in conditioner so I tried that, though it does hold/stay wet for a while, it dries within a few hours and makes my hair very puffy which I don't like. Is there such a thing as a hair product that has the wet look and STAYS wet? I love the wet look but I hate when using something like gel and it just dries and stays in place because it gets hard and crusty almost. I want something that stays in its general shape but I can still run my fingers through naturally. Does this exist? I can only seem to find gels that make your hair hard or leave in that dries after so long. Help!",

Every time I apply it, I feel a burning or stinging sensation in my eyes. I do not apply the moisturizer directly on my eyelids or very close to my eyes.\n\nThe burning starts shortly after application and feels uncomfortable. I’m not sure if this is normal or a sign that the product is irritating my skin or eyes.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this with Dot &amp; Key moisturizers?\n\nShould I stop using it, or is there a safe way to continue using it?\n\nAny help or personal experiences would be appreciated.\n\nThank You!",
