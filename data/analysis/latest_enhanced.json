      "content": "A while ago, I read a comment from a Mexican woman living in Paris.\nShe said that since moving to France, her hair had never been this short, not because she wanted to cut it, but because French hairdressers always insist on trimming.\nShe realized how in France, every visit ends with “your ends are too dry, we have to cut”, and it made her lose the motivation to even go anymore.\n\nShe explained that in Mexico and latin America in general, women place huge importance on their hair, which seems to be traditionally seen as a symbol of femininity and sensuality. \nThat resonated with me because I’d love to proactively care for my hair, instead of constantly cutting it like burned grass, also, curly cuts cost 3x the price of a regular haircut in France and I’m never happy with them. My curls are fine for me, I just would love them to grow longer, and it feels stupid trying to achieve it with what hairdressers recommend in Paris, hence, cutting a good 5-10cm of length to make it “grow longer and healthy”.\n\nSo, I wanted to ask Latin American curlies for their insights on this.\n\nWhat are your real, local secrets for healthy, long, shiny hair?\nNot the viral stuff like Skala while the whole world knows but the real insider things like traditionnal ingredients or rituals, local brands or products that actually work but aren’t famous abrod, habits or techniques that make the biggest difference for growth and softness, and also, how you deal with dryness and frizz in humid climates\n\nFor context: my hair is 2C+/3A, it hates hard water (calcium buildup) and breaks easily if I use too much protein.\nI’m trying to focus on health and length retention, no cuts for now \n\nMy routine is not locked, I change it from time to time according to the weather and period of the year and I’m willing to try different methods.\nLast wash day I used a clarifying shampoo + Nuxe Rêve de Miel rince conditioner + Flaxseed Gel on soaking hair + warm and then cold diffuser at 80% dryness + Davines Oi Oil to finish breaking the gel cast \n\nThank you so much if you take the time to share!",

After years of always blow drying and curling cause i never knew what to do with all the frizz and messylookingness. \n\nI went to the only curly hairstylist close to me that didn't charge literally not even exagerating $390 for a \"curly transformation cut\"\nThis woman charged me $75 and taught me what i needed to use, when and how my hair should be as I apply it. \n\nSince then ive kept experimenting and trying different products and order. I've been able to recreate these curls two days in a row! This is like day 3 or 4 curls. \n\nEven though it seems like so much product (im learning thats necessary for curly hair) my hair doesnt feel weighed down or like my curls fall. They feel super touchable and secure yet soft. Im super happy\n\n\nPRODUCTS USED AND ORDER:\n\nouidad spiral curls shampoo\n\nOuidad spiral curls Conditioner\n\nNot your mothers leave in (only apply once when my hair is drenched wet after wash) \n\nScrunch excess off with microfiber towel\n\nCurlsmith Airdry curl cream\n\nOuidad thermal control gel (decent ammount has been KEY) \n\nOuidad spiral curls mousse \n\nDiffuse just to form cast\n\nNot your mothers oil to scrunch out cast \n\n\nKristin Ess Texture spray (use lightly)- this has been KEY in keeping definition,  helped me feel like if i pull my curls or run my hands through it it just stays well and defined. Ill put my hair in a messy bun often and when taken down it looks just as good. \n\nAussie Flexible hold hair spray (suuuper light just for frizzy prone areas) \n\n\nRefresh: \n\nOuidad loose waves Curl activator or thermal control activator\nOuidad Gel\nOuidad mousse\nDiffuse \nOil\nTexture spray\n\n\n:)))\n\n\nIve just now gotten the Umberto Gianni gel and foam to try (i had already ordered them before I unlocked this combination) so im hoping I like them!",

      "content": "The first picture is how my hair looks after I wash it and after it has fully dried. The second picture is how my hair looks less than 48 hours of not washing it later. I am genuinely feeling so hopeless that my hair can look any good for more than 12 hours. It tangles up so fast. Sometimes it feels like it tangles *as I'm detangling it in the shower*, I'd run my fingers through detangled areas and they'd already feel tangled again. I want my hair to remain in shape and obey gravity rather than poofing up (the individual hairs are extremely thin). And I don't want to expel *all* of my energy to do it and waste *all* of my money on just conditioner, as it takes me 40 minutes to shower *without detangling*, an hour with, and I have to use about half a bottle of conditioner per shower because of how much hair I have, how dense it is, and how hard it is to make sure everything is fully covered between the curls. I would really like to have some advice.\n\nAs for my routine, I usually use either \"conditioner for normal hair\" or \"clay conditioner\", although I do experiment with different conditioners too. But those two are the ones that have made detangling my hair the easiest. I usually use either \"clay shampoo\" or \"shampoo for curly hair\", but again I occasionally buy different types to experiment. I have looked for sulfate-free shampoos and products intended for detangling and felt little improvement. The brands are nothing special, just the ones I find in grocery stores and pharmacies. I wash every 2-4 days. Sometimes just conditioner and sometimes with shampoo as well, depending on how itchy my scalp feels. Sometimes I even do conditioner first to detangle, then shampoo, then conditioner again to soften. If my hair feels too tangled, I detangle it by brushing it with a handheld brush while the conditioner is still on (only way I'm able to brush at all), starting at the tips and working my way up to the scalp inch by inch. I occasionally detangle with my fingers instead but it's usually less efficient, more painful and feels like it results in more hairs falling off than with the brush. I usually wrap my head in a towel to soak most of the water then leave it to air dry the remaining moisture. I've tried just rubbing my hair quickly instead of wrapping, and I've tried using an old shirt for either one instead of a towel, the end result after fully drying looks the same. I don't use any leave-in products, as most of them give me sensory issues, make my scalp itchy, and/or make my hair look even worse. I do have spray serums that I use sometimes, and they have done the best job of slowing down the overpoofing of my hair and maintaining its oobedience to gravity, but they also accelerate getting itchy and needing shampoo again.\n\nAlso important to note: I have had chemical straightening before. I had even less of an idea of how to take care of my hair, so threw years ago I had a chemical straightening. A year later, two years ago, I had it renewed and it was botched and didnt stick, and even the attempt to fix it was imperfect and didn't last as long. I have since cut all the parts from the first straightening and grown out new roots, but I imagine I still have some damaged tips at the top layer of my hair.",

Some of the products were recommended by my old dermatologist. \n\nMy current routine is this: \n\n• Fixderma salyzap salicylic acid wash \n• Himalaya clarifying and refreshing toner (blue bottle)\n• CosRX snail mucin 92\n• Cutimax O oat moisturiser (derma rec) \n• Ishield-G SPF 50 sunscreen (derma rec) \n\nAt night I'll use the drunk elephant A-Shaba complex eye serum. \n\nEarlier I was also using Fixderma AHA lightening gel and Dermatica Azeproactive on her recommendation. My skin wasn't so textured or chock full of whiteheads, so I don't know if these worked or not. I couldn't really tell a difference. \n\nMy sister just gifted me CosRX's 6 peptide skin booster and their AHA BHA PHA LHA peel because she knows I love the mucin. I'm wondering if these can help my skin, and more importantly, if I can use both together. \n\nMy skin is dry, with big pores and a nose prone to flaking. I used to have very oily skin as a teen and it's just kind of wilding out to be honest. We have extreme weather so it either gets very dry or very oily, but it's extremely prone to blockage.

      "content": "Hey everyone!\nFirst off, I rarely ever post on Reddit, so I hope I’m not breaking any rules 😅\n\nSome context:\nLast summer, I grew my hair out into a mullet, but I didn’t really like how it turned out. So, I decided to get a low taper fade instead.\nMy mistake was getting it done out of town — the barber completely messed it up. He even nicked my ear with the clippers and made it bleed😵‍💫.\n\nAfter that, I got super unmotivated to take care of my hair because I hated how it looked. I mostly just wore hats for a while.\nNow, about 3 months later, it’s grown out a bit, and I’m starting to like it again.\n\nSo, I want to get back into hair care and really take care of my curls — I think they have some real potential 🙃\nThe problem is, I don’t really know what I’m doing, and I’m honestly overwhelmed by all the advice out there.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\nEvery morning:\n\t1.\tRinse my hair with super cold water\n\t2.\tLet it air-dry a bit while I get dressed (I don’t use a towel)\n\t3.\tSpray some heat protectant\n\t4.\tGently separate my curls with my fingertips\n\t5.\tUse a blow dryer with a diffuser to dry my hair\n\nSometimes, if I’m going out later, I’ll do the same routine again.\nEvery couple of days, I use shampoo and conditioner.\n\nMy questions:\n\t•\tWhat should I change about my routine?\n\t•\tWhat kinds of products could/should I add to reduce frizz and make my curls look better?\n\nAny advice or product recs would be super appreciated 🙏\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR:\nGot a bad haircut months ago and stopped caring for my hair.

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

I don't mind a little poof but it just looks so bad. So dry. And again I don't know how to get rid of that bowl shape. I've been clarifying it with Neutrogena clarifying shampoo. I'll clarify twice a month. \nI take shower every other day but honestly I heard that's not good for curly hair so I'll use a shower cap and wash it twice a week instead. \nAny changes I should do? I've tried talking to curly hair specialist but they haven't been able to help me. ",
