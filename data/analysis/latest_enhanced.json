      "content": "Hi! I generally love my curly hair, but I don't often wear it down because there's one section of my head that grows almost straight and incredibly fluffy (and has for all 25 years of my life). It's unfortunately really noticeable when I wear my hair naturally, standing out from the curl pattern on the rest of my head, and it bothers me a lot. Styling doesn't help, as this section won't hold a curl no matter how much product I add or how much scrunching I do.\n\nDoes anyone have ideas for what I could do to make this section curly? Maybe per.m this piece? Have you experienced this and found a solution that you like? Thanks in advance :)\n\nThe first image is my normal curl pattern on most of my head and the other two images show the straighter section in different lighting. Sorry they're bad! Trying to avoid doxxing myself\n\n\\[Irrelevant but as required, my routine: I use the Herbal Essences Jojoba Oil &amp; Lavender Curls Shampoo (infrequently) and Aussie Miracle Curls with Coconut Oil Conditioner in the shower, then the Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine Leave In Conditioner and Odele Air Dry Styler (wouldn't recommend) right out of the shower before air drying.\\]",

I haven't been happy with a wash day in a long time. The pictures I've included are in reverse chronological order.  Lately my curls have been feeling stretched out, misshapen, suuuper frizzy. My gel/mousse situation is leaving my hair feeling like straw after it's dry, and also way, way too dry. I'm just kind of at my wit's end. I've tried a good handful of products, am super for real in need of some new recommendations. I started using gel and mousse earlier this year, love the definition and hold, would really love for my hair to still feel soft afterwards though. I feel like my shine is gone too. I have low porosity, medium dense hair, completely virgin, no heat at all since shaving it.\n\nI tried prose a few years back and was really happy with it, couldn't afford to keep getting it. Since looking at the mega document on here and other people's experiences, it seems like it might not be worth a rebuy? \n\nI'm currently using innersense shampoo, conditioner and mousse, loma maximizing volume gel.  \nWash day's just include normal shampoo cleanse, conditioner sits while I do body stuff, scrunch in mousse/gel combo, let it dry, scrunch out. I've tried and failed with some refreshes in between, it usually just ends up in clips or braids before the next wash\n\nwould love product or routine recommendations, drug store or \"designer\", anything in between.

I already have sunscreen, so I’m skipping that part.\n\nWhat I’m really looking for is that deep hydration, the kind that makes your skin feel plump, bouncy, and healthy-looking after application.\n\nAlso, I’ve been seeing a lot of people talk about milky toners, do you guys think it’s worth pairing one with my moisturizer for better hydration? Or should I just focus on a single powerful moisturizer for now?\n\nAny recommendations would mean a lot! 💬",

And also have just started wearing make-up regularly, over the last year or so.\n\nI’ve been buying all kinds of products and spending all this money I don’t have, and would like to know what would be necessary for a solid routine at this point?\n\n**Also, quick note**: I’ve lost around 200 pounds over the last 3ish years. So, I have tons of excess skin all over my body (have a picof arms after working out so you can see), and maybe you can tell in my face and neck, though thankfully, I didn’t carry a lot of weight there. I’m just very grateful for my health now, which got me wanting to pay attention to my appearance.\n\nI have sensitive, combo skin &amp; still have some occasional acne + acne scarring/sun spots.

      "content": "Hello! I’m looking for some advice on my skincare routine. I’m 24 years old and I feel like I could be doing more for my skin. I have combination skin that is acne-prone, dehydrated and prone to redness. The acne I have is hormonal around my chin which my dual hormonal birth control has helped with but it’s not gone completely. I also do have a bit of congestion on my forehead and I’ve recently gotten some bumps around my nose. \n\nHere are the products I’ve tried in the past but made my issues worse. I figured it might be helpful ! ⬇️\n1. Skin 1004 - Centella Sunscreen \n2. Anua - Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil\n3. Anua - Heartleaf Quercentinol Pore Deep Cleansing Foam\n4. Byoma - Barrier and Repair Treatment \n5. The Inkey List - Super Solutions 10% Azelaic Serum\n6. Torriden - Dive In Hyaluronic Acid Serum \n\nMy current routine ⬇️\n1. Grown Alchemist - Gentle Gel Facial Cleanser \n2. Cocokind - Calming Magnesium Mist \n3. Grown Alchemist - Skin Renewal Day Cream\n4. Dr Dennis Gross - Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel Pads (I love this stuff)  \n5. Youth To The People - Youthscreen Sunscreen \n\nProducts I’m interested in ⬇️ \n1. Prequel - Gleanser + SA \n2. Prequel - Pre Gleanse\n3. Prequel - Half &amp; Half \n4. Experiment - Molecular Mesh \n5. Stratia - Lipid Gold \n6. Stratia - Interface \n7. Cocokind - Electrolyte Water Cream \n\nWith my current routine, I find myself unimpressed with the products I use - my skin hasn’t gotten worse but it hasn’t gotten better. The cleanser is nice but I think is a bit drying and lately my moisturiser has been burning my skin, only a small amount (I’m wondering if it’s the niacinamide). The only two products I’m impressed with are the daily peel pads and the calming mist. The daily peel pads are really helpful with my congestion and hormonal acne but I still have some lingering spots which are super stubborn. The mist feels refreshing and does help with redness. \n\nThe reason I want to try the products I listed is because I’ve seen them over this subreddit and Tik-Tok. I want to know if it’s really worth the hype! I see the high praises these products get but I’m worried I’m seeing undisclosed sponsorships. I also can’t afford my routine. I tried the products on a whim but it’s expensive and honestly, not the most responsible purchases. The only thing I don’t mind spending money on are the peel pads, I purchase the $20 pack and cut them up so they last longer. \n\nI would love to hear what you guys think of my routine and the products I’m eyeing. What I should swap, what your personal experiences are, what products I didn’t list but should add, whatever your thoughts and options are please let me know! \nI know it isn’t perfect but I love my skin and I need to treat it better! It’s an organ after all lol",

My usual go-to is blow drying my hair with a traditional blow dryer and my head flipped upside down, guiding the blow dryer through with a paddle brush on the outside. Sometimes I’ll use my Dyson air wrap but only the paddle brush and round brush attachments if I want a little more volume and bounce. \n\nI have moderately thick hair, lower porosity, medium strands. I’m also super oily and a daily washer. I don’t dye my hair and I use heat 1-2x/month. Historically, my hair doesn’t tend to hold styles very well, but I also can’t say I’ve ever tried THAT hard. \n\nRight now, my go-to product when styling is the It’s a 10 miracle leave-in light, followed by a random hairspray. I primarily want to learn how to curl my hair and have it be able to last all day - I ordered a 1.25inch metal long barrel curler and I’ve been watching videos on how to use it. \n\nWhat are some holy grail products that I should try? Goals are volume at the root, lasting style, and a touchable look (not crunchy/crusty). I also don’t want products that will weigh my hair down and make it look flat, which I seem to be pretty prone to. \n\nI’ve got lots of events coming up that I need to be able to style my own hair for (I’m engaged) so I’m ready to do lots of practice on my own time.

      "content": "Hi everyone. I’m in the early stage of building an Indian skincare brand. Before I finalise formulations and a few other core elements with my team, I want to properly understand what conscious skincare users on Reddit actually want.\n\nQuick context on why I’m doing this:\n\nI have tried many Indian and international skincare products. Some worked but most did not. Many Indian brands copy Western formulations, overload actives, or prioritise marketing over results. I know brands like Minimalist and Conscious Chemist already operate in this space, which is why I want your feedback to understand what you still feel is missing and what you genuinely want from a skincare brand.\n\nI don’t want to build this in a bubble and just with market data rather me and my team want to build it with the community.\n\nI’d really appreciate honest feedback on a few things:\n\n1. **What do you wish an Indian skincare brand did differently from the ones out there right now?**\n2. **Which products are you tired of seeing? Which ones do you still feel are missing in the Indian market?**\n3. **What kind of formulations do you personally trust more?**\n   * **gentle, dermatologist-style basics**\n   * **targeted actives**\n   * **barrier-first simple routines** \n4. **What pricing feels “right for quality” to you?**\n5. **What are the biggest red flags that make you lose trust in skincare brands?**\n\nand further,\n\nIf there is one Indian brand that currently nails skincare for you, who is it and why?\n\nI’m not here to sell anything. I just want to listen and shape the brand based on real feedback, not assumptions.\n\nYour responses will directly influence what gets built.\n\nThanks in advance to everyone who shares their thoughts.",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
