      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I started losing my hair in 2019, tried minoxidil, stopped, then lost more hair because I stopped lol. Losing my hair was driving me crazy. Hate to say it but I couldn't even look in the mirror sometimes. My friends would say \"bro you're 6'8\" nobody can even see it\" and that actually helped me get through it believe it or not. That and hair fibers. \n\nI started using hims min/fin topical spray and shampoo. I did experience side effects when I was using it twice a day but I recently showed down to twice a week and I'm still experiencing growth. I also use pumpkin seed oil about an hour after I spray the topical solution so it has time to settle (I started seeing a lot of growth after I stopped immediately using products after the hims spray)\n\nIn the light it's still a little noticable but I've come too far to even care about that. I genuinely can't believe I got my hairline back.",

I was thinking of dying them. Please suggest some hair dye and post- dye care routine. Also would it work if I just dye the grey hair and not my entire head. \nIt would be a big help.

I can’t STAND the back of my hair. It’s stringy and flat and weird, and only curls at the bottom. I have strands that frizz and don’t define no matter what I seem to do. At the same time, my hair can look flat and weighed down, and only curls at the bottom in most places. I’m not sure what I can do. I don’t know if I should be adding more moisture or if I’m adding too much. How can I get my hair to look less weighed down at the top and in the back? Any help would be appreciated.  \nI usually use Herbal Essences honey shampoo and conditioner, but lately I’ve been using garnier fructis conditioner. I wash my hair maybe 2-3 times a week, or more if it gets sweaty. I try to leave in conditioner for as long as I can before washing it out and I always leave in a tiny bit. I only brush my hair wet, and I apply products while it’s pretty damp. Daily, I use OUAI leave in, or Sleep on it overnight curl cream. Neither really do anything, I still have a ton of frizz and weighed down looking hair. I shower before bed, and let my hair air dry 70% before I clip it up. I swear I could put in the whole bottle of product and my hair would still look dry. The second pic is a failed attempt at defusing. In the 3rd picture I included, I had used gel as well to style my hair, and I like the way it looks. It was completely air dried. It was also summer, and my hair always seems to be prettier in the summer. The fourth pic is just air dried hair after my normal routine. Any advice would be really appreciated. I’m not sure what my hair needs. Plz give tips!!",

And the locks get staggered and separated after a short while after I comb, so it looks really uncombed and unmaintained. \nMy office colleagues have been recommending me to do a layer cut, that would make my hair a bit voluminous, and would complement my waves. Is that true? \nWhat type of layer cut should I do? I don't want to lose length and my hair shouldn't appear thinner than it already is. (Actually my hair is a bit thinner than in this pic). Will long layers work? \nI usually do hairstyles like the second picture. \n\nThanks everyone. ",

While I don't hate it, because like I said I've been doing fantasy colors for 12 years, and it's a super gorgeous orange, it's not what I was going for.

      "content": "I'm 19FTM and never really had acne when I was younger, maybe a few spots going through puberty, so I never had a skincare routine aside from just washing my face with water and soap. Since starting hormone treatment (about a year ago) I've started getting acne as I'm going through male puberty and I have absolutely no idea how to combat this. All the basic products I see people recommend like Cerave cleansers are at \\*least\\* £10 and people act like this is cheap, plus the amount of people that have like 5+ products in their skincare routine.... ofc I'm willing to spend that money but I want to know it'll actually work if I'm gonna spend a week's worth of food on making my skin clear up :/\n\nRight now I just wash my face with the Simple cleansing facial wash but just ran out of it. I've started infrequently using St Ives apricot facial scrub too which I know is controversial but it seemed like the best option I could afford. I'm going to ask for some specific items for Christmas, so what should I get and how do I build a cheap, \\*easy\\* routine that should actually work to reduce hormonal/puberty acne? My skin is probably on the mildly oily side if that changes things.\n\nThanks so much in advance for reading and for any help!!!",

It's stunning to discover tastes you didn't know before after more than 3 decades on this shitty planet.

It took a minimum of 45 minutes to do every morning and it still didn't look awesome. It looked okay. Some days just under ok. I always put on a hood because I was just so done. \n\n\nI mentioned wanted to get my hair relaxed and do a pixie cut, and then came the pressuring to relax my hair. I started to actually feel bad so I relaxed my hair. I was happy with it for about 2 weeks. Now I'm just frustrated and angry.  My hair is kinky but relaxed. Meaning the ends are straight but the rest is whooping my ass. I miss my 4c hair. Every time I see 4c posts online or someone with 4c irl I feel sad. I'm back to covering my hair and wearing hoods. I look like a hair and lint covered lollipop. \n\n\nI'm prone to making impulsive decisions when I get stressed out/ sad so I really want to think. What should I do? I like having short hair, but I do have this subconscious belief that it's not as cute or feminine, or some bullshit like that to have short hair. I don't want to impulsively do anything. I'm so sad :(\n\n\nShould I: \n\nA. Cut off all my hair, go bald, and start from the top \n\n\nB. Try to fix the damage and somehow revert my hair. \n\n\nC. Cut off the super straight parts and leave the kinky parts. \n\n\nD. Start wearing wigs/sew-ins. \n\n\nE. A better suggestion",

I've kept it in double dutch braids for years and have been scared to try anything new with it. It's also sooo heavy. I can't do high buns or pony's because it falls eventually and hurts, and no claw clips hold it. Any, and I mean any advice is appreciated. My hair is beautiful and I love it, I'm so grateful to have such amazing hair, but I just don't know what to do with it. I was kind of thinking of half cornrows, but as a blue eyed white chick, I feel like I'd be judged. I shampoo twice with like herbal essence shampoo, and conditioner with the Enjoy luxury conditioner, but that's literally it. I don't straighten, curl or do put any product in my hair. I try not to brush my hair cuz then it frizzes but it gets so knotty, even with braids, and it becomes almost impossible to do hairstyles. I know the photos aren't the best, but they were the best I could find right now. ",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

Occasionally I'll use a sauce hair mask.\n\nHair drying method: I allow my hair to air dry, it's the easiest for me.\n\nI'd say my hair is average, maybe even sort of thin with average density I think.

It's also hard to make my hair look good without shampoo since my likes to curl (especially when it gets oily)\n\nI'm currently using just a shampoo (TRESemmé) but I'm thinking of switching to a daily shampoo + conditioner (like a natural one or head and shoulders) so I don't know if that might help\n\nAlso, is my hair supposed to be this thin?
