My main concern right now is dehydration. no matter how much water I drink, my skin still feels tight and looks a little dull.\n\nIâ€™d love to hear your recommendations for products or routines that have actually worked for you when it comes to improving hydration and overall skin health. Iâ€™m open to serums, moisturizers, masks, or even treatments, but would prefer to stick to skincare over in-clinic procedures for now.\n\nIf it helps, my skin type is normal/ acne-prone. My goal is plump, glowing skin that looks good both on and off camera.\n\nAny suggestions (or even brands you swear by) would be super appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance ðŸ’•",
