When I try to add a products to get more uniformity in the ringlets my curls just don’t look the same at all when they dry. It looks more like straight hair being forced to curl.\n\n I’ve experimented with different products &amp; application methods. Scrunching never looks good but I’ve also tried rubbing the product in with my palms, either way I just fully lose my ringlets. \n\nMy current routine;\nShower products: For shampoo I alternate between Aveeno Blackberry &amp; Quinoa Shampoo &amp; L'Oreal Paris EverPure Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo &amp; for conditioner sally’s brand deep conditioning keratin mask.  \n\nLeave in products currently (used in picture) : Creme of Nature Pure Honey Curl Activator &amp; Cantu Coconut Oil Shine &amp; Hold Mist\n\nI do like the way my hair curls naturally &amp; I’m just looking for a way for my ringlets to all be defined &amp; preferably the same size. \n\nThank you!!",

      "content": "First off, I know my hair is wavy not curly (please curl police spare me lol). But I can't even post on wavy hair subreddit cause they don't allow any mention of hair type or porosity or density etc. \n\nMy routine: Davines love curl shampoo and conditioner, Ouai leave in, curl products (NYM curl cream, Davines curl mousse, Kaleed (local brand) rice curl gel), scrunch, plop 30mins, diffuse until half dry, air dry. For context I live in high humidity tropical country, hard water, and low porosity hair with high density.\n\nI have tried every routine. I found that only using mousse still makes my hair frizzy (pic 3) and puffy when dry, with low definition on my waves. Mousse and gel gives some hold but never last overnight (pic 4), and I still get halo frizz. Cream and mousse and gel give me the best hold that last me 2 days (pic 5). However, my waves are much tighter when my hair is wet after plopping, and dries with much looser waves. I wonder if I force it to be tighter during products and scrunching? Is there such a thing? If not, any suggestion on how to keep the tight waves when dry? \n\nAlso if anyone has advice on lesser effort for wavy routine that keeps frizz at bay lol. I did wavy hair routine last year for about a month, then quit cause it was too much effort. Went back to only shampoo (not even conditioner), air dry, then claw clip or bun my hair almost all the time. When I need to style my hair, I either used curling iron, or heatless curl overnight that gives me neck pain in the morning. I just got back to do the routine last month and I'm close to quitting again 😭. My hair takes 4-5hrs to air dry completely without products, 6-8hrs to air dry with products on. Diffusing to half dry on low heat takes 1.5 hours, with luck (if it's sunny, 75% humidity), the rest will completely dry in 4hrs. If it's rainy (96% humidity), I'd actually sleep with half dry (scalp area dry) and hope for the best for the rest to dry overnight lol.",

I was on adapalene and isotretinoin in 2020 and it cleared my skin but I shifted to Delhi in 2024 and it took a toll on my skin!😣\n\nI came in June and skin started getting worse! Went to a dermatologist in October but he kept on prescribing very expensive hyaluronic acid, vitamin c and niacinamide serums even when I told him I’m allergic to niacinamide😒\n\nSo finally in November my neighbour aunty told me to give raw aleovera a chance and started using it everyday at night after my skincare routine and cleared my skin😭😭😭\n\nMy cousin who is around 18 has acne since he was 14, just how my skin looks. Even he started aleovera and he’s happy with the results! (I will post his before and after in few months)\n\nWith aleovera I followed a simple skincare routine: \n\n1. Facewash : Simple Facewash (using it since 3 years now)\n2. Moisturiser: Formula rx hydra veil moisturiser (love of my life💝)\n3. Sunscreen : I was using reequil matte during the summer season and currently using minimalist fluid sunscreen 🧴 \n4. Bioderma Micellar water or Deconstruct cleansing balm for makeup removal 🎀\n\nI use to 10-15 step routine before this and I have over consuming way too much! \n\nHow I use the aleovera:\n\n1. Cut a piece from plant\n2. Clean it with water\n3. Keep it in water for 20 mins (it ensures all the yellow part is removed)\n4. Apply it after 1 Hour after doing my skincare routine which is just applying my moisturiser \n\nTo anyone who is going through acne just give aleovera a try! Please please please😭😭\n\n*Some people are allergic to aleovera too so do a patch test! ",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I live in Pennsylvania, am 41f. I drink at least 70oz of water/day, I use a humidifier at night, in the morning I either splash with water or use Mad Hippie Jelly Cleanser, then use Beekman 1802 Milkshake toner, then the Ordinary Barrier Repair Serum, then Beekman Bloom Cream, then Just Kids spf 50 sunscreen and Cetaphil Ointment. At night, I use Mad Hippie cleanser again and I do the toner and serum, but then use the Ordinary Rose Hip oil followed by Peach and Lily Overnight Star cream, and then the ointment again. I was using dermalogica's dynamic skin retinol serum but stopped a few days ago and haven't noticed an improvement. I also use omnilux men's mask for 10m every other day. I'd have some tightness in the summer but not like this. Could I have damaged my skin barrier/what should I do to wake up feeling better?",

      "content": "So I am learning how to better take care of my hair and I was wondering something. Right now I don't have hard water after moving in August but before that I had like the hardest, grossest water you can imagine. Like chokes a brita in a month bad. Like drink it unfiltered and you get more thirsty bad. So I'm wondering if I would benefit from chelating my hair once or twice to make sure the buildup is gone? My hairs been crazy tempermental and I think this might have something to do with it. I've heard it can make hair seem like its low porosity when its really not but also all my hair is new as of the past year and a half so it doesn't have any heat damage or color treatments. Its very fine and coily and dense where its had the chance to fill in but thin on top since that is still working on growing in\n\n  \nRoutine as of now:\n\nInnersense Detox clarifying shampoo once every 2 weeks\n\nNot your Mothers curly hair shampoo\n\nOuidad Curl Quench conditioner\n\nInnersense I create Hold Gel for styling like maybe one pump at most\n\na little bit of jojoba oil on days after wash day \n\nI wash every 3 days or so and use a silk pillowcase and a bonnet but its just so frizzy no matter what I do and it seems like it hates too much product. I usually also diffuse a bit upside down then air dry and my hair on top of my head is way shorter than the sides since its got a lot of catching up to do since it suddenly started growing back in December. Trying to find a style that I can manage to do every morning but also compliments my face well. Thanks in advance for the help!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

It's pretty when I can put effort into it but I have chronic illnesses/mobility issues so I've had to stop straightening it and sometimes can't do much to it (simply brushing it makes my arms weak). \nI wear it up in a bun usually but my hairline is getting bad bc of it. It's nearly shoulder length so it's not long enough to braid (also would be hard with my arms). I've considered cutting it super short but I don't feel feminine enough with it that short. I also hate how it feels when it touches me which is another reason I keep putting it up. I just need advice on what to do with my hair bc it's ruining my self confidence and just thinking about it makes me want to cry at this point. \nMy current routine is wash (2x week bc it gets too dry and frizzy if I go longer)\nBrush (wet)\nDry with a tshirt\nStyle with curl cream and mousse\nAir dry \n(I'm aware my routine is not great but it's what I can afford and manage)",

      "content": "Hello y’all,\n\nI started to use 1 mg oral fin ED and topical minoxidil 2 years ago. I had great gain and thickening, followed by stopping my hair fall. Last september I added 1x 0.5mg dut to my 7x 1mg fin regimen. I even improved my hair thickness for 6 months. BUT I started to shed after the end of this 6 month.\n\nIn march 2025 I started to shed like crazy… This shed lasted until today, and still going. I tried to increase my dut dosage up to x2 and x3 with x7 fin per week but nothing changed.\n\nTo clarify, I do not use generic brands. Only propecia and avodart.\n\nSo, the question rises now: What should I do?\n\nA) Stop dutasteride fully because it gives damage (?) to my hair and only stick with finasteride. 9 month is already enough.\n\nB) 2-3x dut is not enough so increase it to ED.\n\nFor the option A, I do find it weird to be honest because some people say that I might not be responding enough to dut But dont forget, I have never stopped using 7x fin.\n\nCould you guys help me, or just share your ideas please? I am planning to see a doctor but they are generally useless since they are mainly not pro fin/dut in my country.\n\nI appreciate all the help and comments",
