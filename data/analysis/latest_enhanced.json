The explanation is gonna be long bc i had to spend so long perfecting my hair bc it's SOOOO picky.\n\nI didn't really unclump the bottom parts so ignore the uneven lengths.\n\nRoutine: \n\nShampoo and conditioner: Marc Anthony triple moisturizing \n\nLeave in conditioner: As I am Leave in \n\nCurl cream: Miss Jessie's Multicultural Curl Cream\n\nGel: The Doux Big Poppa Gel\n\nBrushes: Tangle Teezer and Knock off bounce curl brush \n\nFor each small section: Wet hair. Apply leave in. Wet again. Brush . Add curl cream. Massage. Brush. Wet. Add gel. Massage. Brush with knock off curl brush. Repeat for every section .  If my hair did not feel silky after this I'd wet it again and add some more gel LOL. I have a lot of hair so it took a long time. \n\nBlow drying it took even longer. If i try air drying or scrunching with a microfiber towel before diffusing, my hair will throw a fit and then frizz up. I hover and blow dry on high until there's a lot of casting and definition, then with medium heat i put the diffuser to the bottom of my hair and blow dry up. I flip my head side to side doing this. Then after i see more definition and it begins to dry i switch to cold and scrunch the hair till its half its length and just repeat that. It was still damp when i stopped so i let it air dry for a few hours.\n\nLast week I washed my hair and used Loreals glossing shampoo and conditioner. Before that I used loreals clarifying shampoo and conditioner and mielles babusu and mint deep contioner. I use those three in a cycle.\n\nWhen i sleep i normally wrap it in a silk scarf and then put  a bonnet on over that. I'm a crazy sleeper and it works.\n\nI normally hate doing my hair because of how soaked i get but i cant function with a towel over my shoulders. It's overstimulating and i hate it lmfao. But i made myself power through it and here we go! Pretty sure this is the most perfected my routine has gotten. But there's still some frizz so who knows...\n\nLOL i love it tho. So cute. I have curtain bangs too.",

So, I'm making this post to hopefully help some folks keep good spirits about this whole thing. Especially as talk of new treatments is all the rave right now.\n\nI just want to start right away with saying that regardless of who you are, you aren't alone in the slightest. Hair loss is a very common condition, and there is no shame in being upset about it. You're not bad or worth and less just because your hair is losing density or is receding (or both). It's not your fault, nor really anyone's fault.\n\nIn the modern age, there are a plethora of treatments available to you. From Fin and Dut, to Minox and dermarolling. These aren't universal remedies though, sadly, and won't work for everyone. If these don't work for you, don't beat yourself up for it. The fact that you are trying is more than enough; hell, most folks don't even know they can stop / slow down hairloss in the first place. If worst comes to worst, you can always try wigs / hair systems, and you shouldn't feel bad for doing so. You can also get a hair transplant, given that the medications helped stabilize your loss. Plenty of sources on reputable surgeons and clinics out there. Caring about how you look isn't something to be ashamed about, especially if you're more masculine leaning. \n\nOf course, you might not want to wear wigs, which is more than fair. I could literally feel my wallet die when looking at some of those prices lol. That and the upkeep for those things seems about on par with something in a museum.\n\nRegardless, you don't have to be bald if you don't want to, especially in this day and age (given you are willing to spend a lot of money on this stuff lmao). And even if you do go completely bald, you aren't any less you than you were when you first started losing it. You still have value, regardless of how you look. \n\nNow regarding the future, I'm pretty optimistic. It's a common trope to say that it'll just be five years away (regarding any type of cure), but it seems like things are definitely rolling right now in a good direction. Technology will continue to advance and with that, more R&amp;D regarding this issue and funding pertaining. Now, I don't necessarily believe things like PP405 or VDPHL01 will be our true panaceas, but from what we know about them, they'll certainly help us down the line regarding our hair loss. The future is very uncertain, but it doesn't come all at once; just a day at a time. Patience is key.\n\nRemember, we're all in this game together whether we wanted to be or not. The best thing we can do is keep our spirits up and support each other when we can. ",

I use a cleanser (just at at night) hydrating serum and moisturizer (morning and night) and then at night I’ll top off with a cicaplast b5 cream. I also moisturizer throughout the day. I also drink a lot of water.\n\nIs there anything else I can try? I’m almost tempted to extract them (hygienically) with tweezers myself even though a derm would say not to. They come out super easily and it’s not irritating. It seems like the pores will be even more enlarged getting filled 24/7 with these plugs, which Ik is contrary to the mainstream view that extracting them is worse for your skin.\n\nI just can’t walk around with these spikes coming out of my nose much longer.\n\nOpen to suggestions.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",
