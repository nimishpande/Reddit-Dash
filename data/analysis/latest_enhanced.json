      "content": "I started losing my hair at 23. I‚Äôm 27 now and it‚Äôs noticeable enough that people politely pretend not to notice. I‚Äôve tried everything you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to try minoxidil, finasteride, special shampoos, diet changes. Nothing has stopped it. I know looks aren‚Äôt everything, but it‚Äôs hard not to feel like I‚Äôm aging in fast forward while everyone else gets to look young a little longer. The vanity part stings, but honestly the confidence hit is worse\n\nDating apps made it very clear how much people care about hair. My matches dropped like 90% as soon as it started thinning. It‚Äôs depressing to realize how quickly you become ‚Äúless attractive‚Äù over something you can‚Äôt control.\n\nI play battlefield with friends most nights and even in the chat, jokes get tossed around about my hairline like it‚Äôs just harmless fun. Maybe for them it is. For me it‚Äôs a constant reminder.\n\nSo I‚Äôm asking guys who‚Äôve been through this:  \nDo I just shave it and move on?  \nDoes confidence really make that much of a difference?  \nHow do you accept a change you never wanted?\n\nI don‚Äôt want to feel embarrassed about something that‚Äôs just genetics but right now I do.",

Then the Bed Head Foxy Curls Mousse, I usually do a blob with about 2 inch diameter. I have alot of hair but the strands are thin. Then the Noughty Jelly, just a bit distrubuted over my hair as thin and even as possible. Then the heat protection and after that I diffuse, usually takes me around 30mins for complete dry hair on low heat and low speed.

      "content": "About my Skin:\nI have a combination skin, I live in a very hot humid weather. 23.\nI had a very resistant clear glass like skin with general hyperpigmentation until last year when I suddenly started getting cc because I did not take care of my skin for a very long time, then I started picking on the whiteheads and blackheads which lead to more acne. \nCurrently dealing a with pustules on cheeks sometimes, blind acne on the chin, whiteheads and skin coloured bumps throughout the face when I ocassionally forget to double cleanse my sunscreen, lot of PIE &amp; PIH, some texture from old acne, and general hyperpigmentation. Prone to comedones.\n\nSkin care Routine:\nAM: \n1. Simple Refreshing Facewash\n2. Reequil Ultra Matte Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n1. Garnier Micellar Water\n2a. Simple Refreshing Facewash\n2b. Minimalist 2% SA cleanser which I mix with Simple Cleanser on Sundays and Thursdays.\n3. Minimalist Tranexamic Acid Serum that I use on days I don't use SA Cleanser. \n4. Simple Hydrating Moisturiser mixed with pure aloe vera gel.\n5. Reequil 0.1% Retinol which I'm currently not using but planning on reintroducing on days without actives after my skin adjusts to the current routine.\n\nSunscreens I've used before:\n1. Lakme a canon event üò≠\n2. Dot &amp; Key pink - not good fliters\n3. Dr Sheth - not good filters again\n4. Deconstruct gel sunscreen - liked the texture and matte finish but they changed the formulation and it started pilling\n5. Minimalist fluid sunscreen - really good protection as per this sub but looks really oily on my skin, for this weather, makes it look very dull and oily (would work out well for people in dry weather), stings my eyes.\nI don't prefer sunscreen that has a very dewy effect.\n\n6. Current - Reequil ultra matte sunscreen, I like this sunscreen, primer like texture, doesn't make my skin look greasy, doesn't sting, good protection, claims to be water resistant,  does break me out if I don't cleanse my skin well.\nI started reading from this sub that few people started experiencing darkening skintone and white dry patches, I did not notice much in my skin but I did feel like my skintone had changed slightly, not sure if it's tanning or the product or if I didn't apply it well. And I also read that this is a common issue with any silicone based sunscreen.\nI still like this sunscreen but wondering if it's good enough.\n\nI was looking at \n1. BOJ Aqua one - but many claimed it's not worth as they wouldn't spend that much on a sunscreen that is not water resistant.\n\n2. UV Doux - really hyped in this sub, but it is also a silicone based sunscreen, and I fear it is same as Reequil.\n\nWhat's your thoughts about this??\nSorry for the long post, I do yap a lot.",

My routine before I washed it I made a flaxseed hair mask at home and applied it with a heat cap on since I have low porosity hair, then I shampooed and that‚Äôs it. I have to admit that the salon didnt apply heat protectant before blow drying it. Today I did a hot oil treatment and reshampooed. So now I‚Äôm devastated cuz my hair which is usually 3B/3C and very very curly at the bottom literally struggles to curl now a lot  parts look straight and now my whole hair looks like it‚Äôs 2a/2c with ends that barely curl. I actually crashed out at this can anyone pls give me a solution im panicking !!",

I am a college student and I saved up a lot of my money (400$) to get a balayage to help me feel better after a breakup lol. I did my research, looked through social media and got many hair consultations before i decided to go to a stylist. Said stylist was given specific inspo pics, i made sure to ask if it was realistic. I asked for a caramel/ light brown balayage, one that is subtle.\n\nThe first time she did my hair, she glazed it to red. Even her colleagues told her that she messed up by using the wrong dye. She offered to fix it again the following week for free so of course i go back. I was left considerably worse and even farther from my original inspo picture. \n\nI am disheartened, and really disappointed and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. Should i dye it? Should i let it rest since it‚Äôs been bleached 2x in the last week? Should i use purple shampoo and does my hair look as bad as i think it does? Any advice or tips on how to fix are greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading. \n\n",

Is it specific to what you‚Äôre trying to achieve? Or is it just preference / trial and error?\n\nI‚Äôve got a winning combo of rosacea+kp+acne+dry skin so my skin needs are vast. I generally try to keep it pretty simple, not overdo the actives, keep it moisturized, but my current routine isn‚Äôt doing much so as I look to slowly switch out products, I wanted to see if there‚Äôs an ingredient order I should be paying attention to or if that even matters.\n\nThank you very much!",

Im so annoyed at myself for doing that because now I'm left with legs that look like this.\n\nOver the next few winter months, I thought l'd do anything I can to help lighten these (Especially since I won't be out in the sun as much). l've done a bit of research and I heard things like kojic acid, glycolic acid, etc?\n\nIf anyone knows of any holy grail products that can be used to lighten these up? Or an actual routine that I should follow; like what products to get, the exact steps I should follow with them, etc. I'd be so appreciative! I know that scars can take years to fade but whatever I can do to help minimize them, as l'm super insecure about my legs at the moment. I also am going to stop scratching from now on so l don't get any more scars. Thanks!",

First I use shampoo I use the nutritive shampoo, hair mask and conditioner. I will detangle my hair while in the shower with the conditioner in. Then I will wash it out and start scrunching all the water out. After that I will use some hair gel (it‚Äôs a strong paste from a local hair dresser that I delude with some water to create a more creamy texture) and scrunch it into my hair after that I will use a towel and scrunch to get the excess water off. Then I try and diffuse my hair which is still a bit of process. After that I plop it into a t shirt and wait till the last bits dry and it sets and that‚Äôs how I end up here. Am i using the wrong products or should I use a different method? I saw some people use a comb and twirl the hair around that, is that more suited for curlier than wavy hair or the other way around? \nAnyways I‚Äôm super thankful for any suggestions or tips on how to deal with this mess.
