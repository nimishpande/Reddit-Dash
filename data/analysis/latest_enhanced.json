It went from very easily defined and highly dense curls to the suggestion of a curl ish wave and shedding more than it ever had in my life. I had lost a substantial amount of weight but in a very healthy way and had overall objectively increased healthy behaviors as well, and the only times my hair had straightened out or shed was when I was very sick with a restrictive eating disorder so I was very confused. Well, found out recently that my birth control was actually totally screwing with my estrogen levels and had caused two large lesions on my liver, essentially taking up half the thing. And when the bloodwork marker that led us to this began to creep up higher and higher? That’s when my hair started changing. I’ve always known my hair was very sensitive to my health, but for some reason this didn’t occur to me this time. So this is your friendly reminder that if your hair suddenly and drastically changes in any way, talk to a doctor! Get some blood and hormone panels done!!\n\nRoutine (currently, R)\nAveeno thickening shampoo \nSkala maracuja 2 in 1 \nSkala as styler or Innersense products ",

      "content": "Just wanted to share what I’ve learned after testing a few LED masks recently, especially about the difference between red and blue light therapies for skin.\n\nI picked up a Glotech mask from LED Esthetics since it covers both red and blue wavelengths. At first, I wasn’t sure if I really needed both, but after a month of daily sessions, I noticed some interesting changes:\n\n- Red light: Helped soften fine lines and made my skin look a bit firmer over time. I started seeing a noticeable glow and better overall texture, especially on drier patches.\n\n- Blue light: Was more of a game changer for breakouts and random patches of redness. Used this on days when my skin felt oily or inflamed much fewer breakouts, and the old marks faded faster.\n\nTbh I think using both gave me the best of both worlds. Red light is awesome for anti-aging and texture, while blue is great if you deal with acne or frequent spots. If you’re only picking one, think about your main skin concern, but for me, a mask offering both was worth the investment and made the whole routine pretty easy.",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I wear makeup like maybe once a week and do mascara, brows, bronzer, blush, and a bit of eyeshadow, but I always feel like my products are just not hitting the mark, like my bronzer looks either transparent or like a harsh/muddy line. My mascara looks pretty great tbh, but I just feel like I'm not quite there with everything else. Lip liners and lipsticks stress me out becuase I have a nice color to my natural lips and a lot of products are lighter then my lips and idk what color to get for liners or what product? It's expensive and extremely overwhelming. I don't get my nails done and I wish I did but it's so expensive and when I do them myself they fall off in like 1-3 days.\n\nDon't even get me started on my skin... I have extremely large pores, texture, fine lines, uneven texture, rosacea, black and white heads all over. I mean my skin actually used to be decent but now it's a gross greasy mess. Idk what to do about it! I am very overwhelmed. The new products I have tried (Rhode glazing milk and barrier butter, and PanOxyl 10% Benzoyl Peroxide Cleanser) haven't helped after a few weeks of trying. I am thin but my face and neck are very bloated as well.  \n  \nIk this sounds like a dump of complaints which it is and I apologize for that. I just feel like my products are falling short in every sense of the word and I am willing to spend the money on products that will significantly increase my appearance / experience.\n\nI just get frustrated that I feel so close but so far lol. I think if I could get the right products doing the right things, that would be much better for me. Any advice is greatly appreciated! I can also provide extra information if needed. Tysm!",

      "content": "I am trying to understand the relationship to DHT levels and hair loss. I recently noticed a shed for 3-4 weeks so I started to dive deeper into what could have caused it. \n\nI started TRT and tirzepatide around the same time in June and my testosterone went from 300 to about 800 on 140mg a week. I lost about 20-25 pounds during that time frame and somewhat unrelated but relevant, I normally do blood donations and my most recent donation the center only had double RBC equipment. Shortly after when I ran my labs my ferritin levels went down to 6. \n\nI have since been trying to recover iron and am currently sitting around 13 one week after supplementation. My DHT levels came back at 65 which seems to be within limits,  but that means I was likely in the 20-30s prior to TRT. \n\nReading around old posts, it seems that the absolute DHT levels on their own aren’t a culprit to accelerated hair loss, it’s more of the sensitivity to the DHT if I am quoting correctly. In my case, I am trying to understand would taking a DHT blocker help stop the shedding, assuming it’s DHT related and not due to low iron? I have also dropped my testosterone dosages fwiw, it seems I am having less shedding now about 4 weeks later. I haven’t noticed any significant hairline recession and the hair overall still seems healthy. ",

      "content": "TLDR -&gt; tried everything, FUT, FUE, with meds, without meds, hair fibers, SMP, long journey, happy with the end result! Decided it would be interesting to share my story because I tried almost all that is possible :)\n\nLong story\n- 23 years old - FUT 2000 grafts front\nI’ve started losing hair at a really early age, can’t find too much photo’s but it was noticeable back when I was 18. At 23 I decided to do a FUT as that seemed to provide the best results. Transplant was performed in the Netherlands.\n\n- 23 years old - finasteride (only 4 months)\nFinasteride was recommended to stop further hairloss, tried it for approx 4 months, but felt a bit down that time of my life and stopping Finasteride seemed like the first thing to stop as that could have been the cause. Luckily my life got much better, and never really thought about going back to Finasteride after.\n\n- 27 years old - FUE 2600 grafts back\nWithout Finasteride, the hairloss of course continued… so at 27 I noticed a lot of hairloss at the back of my head. So I went back to the same clinic and did a new hairtransplant. This time I went for FUE as the recovery from FUT was pretty heavy and painful to me, really didn’t feel like going through that a second time. (Unfortunately couldn’t find any pictures)\n\n- 29 years old - hair fibers for about a year\nContinued to lose hair, mainly density, so started using hair fibers. That worked for about a year. But at some moment I had too few hairs left and the fibers became to noticeable. So I cut the hair short but really hated the way it looked.\n\n- 31 years old - FUE 1200 grafts middle\nAt 31 I still felt really unhappy and decided to have a chat with the clinic that did the hair transplants. Somehow I don’t feel I have 2000 grafts left which were transplanted 8 years back with the FUT at the front. The clinic agreed I lost grafts from the HT and felt that it was there responsibility to fix it. So I got offered a free HT to fix the front.\n\n- 32 years old - FUE 500 grafts hairline\nAfter the previous hairtransplant, I was a bit surprised that the surgeon decided to put down the grafts from the back towards the front and then run out of grafts before he got to my hairline… the clinic agreed and gave me another free HT this time to fix the front of my hairline. That I was happy was important, I was glad that they felt it was their responsibility, it would however have been even better if they could have done it in one go…\n \n- 33 years old - SMP (2 full days) &gt; buzzcut\nEven after all of these hairtransplants, the front indeed looked okay… but from the top you could look right through my hairs. And I didn’t have very much grafts left. So I felt like the only option that I would have left is to shave it all off, fill it in with SMP, so that with a buzzcut I at least had the illusion of hair. So I went for two full day sessions of SMP, which… by the end of the day was really really painful. As my head was full of scar tissue from all of the transplants, apparently scar tissue is more sensitive when tattooed.\n \n- 34 years old - start finasteride and minoxidil &gt; grow out hair\nAfter a year of wearing the buzzcut and frankly, being pretty happy about it. I still felt I should give it one last try. So I decided to do the full package, grow out the hairs, hope SMP helped a bit with the illusion of density, use Finasteride and minoxidil to give the remaining hair as much stimulation as possible and give it a year to see if I could be okay with the result. \n\n- 35 years old - today\nAnd… to be fair it exceeded my expectations! It’s not a full head of hair, I’m limited in my haircuts, and in specific lighting you still notice it’s thinning. But concerning the years I’ve spent being unhappy, I’m very pleased I can enjoy this state of my hair for a couple of years. And it also helps that I know I would also be okay with the SMP/buzzcut look when I eventually will lose the density (hopefully somewhere in my 40/50ish)\n",

(last pic is when i use the straightener)\n\nif anyone could leave styling, product, or even new cut suggestions, that would be so helpful. thank uuu 🫶🫶🫶",
