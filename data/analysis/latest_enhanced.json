      "content": "I'm till kind of in shock, so bear with me. I'm in my early 30s and I literally just found out a little over a month ago that I have curly hair.\nFor context: I've been blow-drying my hair straight twice a day (morning and night) since before junior high. Just brushing it straight down when wet and blow-drying it flat. I rarely flat ironed, but the constant blow-drying was doing the job of keeping my hair straight. I genuinely had NO idea I had any curl pattern.\n\nThe Discovery:\nAbout 5 weeks ago, I decided to do a \"curl test\" just out of curiosity after a conversation with friends, and waves started forming. I was honestly confused. Fast forward to now and I'm apparently 2C/3A? Wild.\n\nMy Current Routine:\n\nBriogeo Curl Charisma shampoo\nDivaCurl conditioner\nBriogeo Don't Despair Repair protein treatment (1x/week in place of conditioner)\nPattern styling cream (quarter size at night, dime size for morning refresh)\nCurlsmith heat protectant when diffusing\nI only brush right before the shower with a mixed bristle brush (per my stylist's recommendation)\nFinger detangle in the shower\nT-shirt/microfiber towel to scrunch out water (no rubbing)\nPrayer hands + finger waving + scrunching with product\nDiffuse upside down: medium heat/low speed, then switch to low heat/low speed when nearly dry\nSleep in silk bonnet on silk pillowcase\nMorning refresh: spritz with water until dampish, small amount of Pattern cream, scrunch\n\nI shampoo and condition every other night, but I get my hair wet every night to refresh.\n\nThe Journey So Far:\nWeek 1-2: Barely any curl definition, looked stringy and weird wet, questioning if this was real\nWeek 3: Had a full crisis. Almost gave up and went back to straight hair. The greasiness, the unevenness, the awkward in-between phase - I was DONE.\nWeek 4: Got my first curly cut from my stylist (who was SO excited). She gave me layers and removed weight without touching my length. Game changer.\nWeek 5 (now): The photos you're seeing are from morning refreshes, not even full wash days. I'm honestly still processing that this is my hair.\nThings I've Learned:\n\nThe \"healing timeline\" people talk about is REAL. My existing heat-damaged hair has legitimately improved in curl definition over these 5 weeks.\nYour hair can look completely different in just a month\nWeek 3 almost broke me, but I'm so glad I pushed through\nThe underlayers of my hair are curlier than the top layers (which apparently means the top was getting more heat damage and needs more time to recover)\nFinding a stylist who understands curly hair is everything\n\nThe first photo is my hair when I still wore it straight (many months ago). The e next pic is early curl from week 1. The oast photos are from the last couple days - just morning refreshes, not full wash days.\nMy family thinks I'm crazy and wants me to go back to straight hair, but my girlfriend and all my curly-haired friends have been incredibly supportive. My stylist literally went buck wild when I walked in with curls for the first time (never told her ahead of time).\nIf you're in week 2 or 3 and thinking about quitting - PLEASE don't. I almost did. And now look.\nHappy to answer any questions!",

Wash Ouidad Anti-frizz shampo quick to get most of my products out, then InnerSense scalp detox, BounceCurl gentle clarifying shampoo (been a bit and Ouidad shampoo usually does a good job with getting rid of build-up).\n2. InnerSense Conditioner (although NYM conditioner worked and felt quite similar in post about my recent hotel water fiasco) - detangle brush, then while still in shower: \n3. Rake in: dollop of AG Beach Bomb Cream\n4. Rake in:  *NEW* dollop Briogeo Curl Charisma cream\n5. Rake in: *NEW* dollop Briogeo Curl Charisma gel - detangle brush to distribute everything evenly throughout hair, then scrunch every direction raking hair off scalp, rewettingas needed to get clumps to reform &amp; wet-plop in shower cap - finish shower. Then out of shower, the following...\n6. BounceCurl EdgeLift brush - section top &amp; crown, and leave sides &amp; back dangling and do those first\n7. *NEW* NotYourMother's Beach Babe foam, glaze and scrunch, concentrated on roots area, but also lengths each section \n8. Biosilk Rock Hard gelee, emulsify in wet hands and glaze on quarter-size dollop per section, then scrunch until hands feel \"clean\" of product. I put a little emulsified NYM Flash Freeze gel (5) just on the ends that tend to straighten.\n9. Microplop, enough to dry fairly fast\n10.

Fluff roots. Scrunch any cast around face by smoothing lengths roots to ends with tips of my fingers carefully. \n\nBedtime: Use coily tie to put my hair at my forehead and silk bonnet to sleep.

My hair knots very easily at the ends, i always do better with short hair. I wash nearly every day and have always had my hair get oily FAST even without activity. \n\nThis is my hair freshly washed but no product. When I blow dry, i blow dry, take a break to brush, blow dry, take break to brush, and so on. I have a hard time doing them at the same time lol. Last time my hair was cut it was layered. \n\nI cannot easily hold styles. Texturizing sprays and mousse do nothing. Teasing my hair never worked, and blowdrying with round brush doesnt do anything different.\n\nI have always hated my hair and been so frustrated styles dont work. I just want to do what is best for my hair so trying to figure out which type it is. TIA!!",

They aren’t red anymore so most of the time I just don’t care, but as my financial situation is pretty good now, I would like to do something about them.\n\nI’ve been having them for about 16 years so time is not gonna help more.\n\nI had lasers twice about the age of 18, don’t remember which ones.\n\nMy skincare has been full of things like azelaic/lactic/glycolic acid for years so yeah…I guess it’s not gonna work any better neither.\n\nAre there any treatments worth trying?

      "content": "[PART 2] of comparing Indian version of skincare products with its foreign counterparts. \n\nToday I tried to compare Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra Indian variant with its USA counterpart. \n\nFrom the first screenshot we can conclude that the USA variant is silicone free and has \"more,\" exactly 5, ingredients which creates \"hydration\" for the skin and has 2 \"less\" ingredients which may cause \"oily skin\".\n\nNow from the second screenshot, the major differences are:\n\nThe Texture:\n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses Silicones (Cyclopentasiloxane and Cyclohexasiloxane). These give the cream a silky, smooth feel that disappears quickly into the skin. It feels more like a velvety finish. \n \nThe Right Side (USA): They swaps these silicones for Natural Plant Oils (Brassica Campestris Seed Oil and Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil). This makes it feel much richer and greasier. It doesn't evaporate quickly, it stays on the surface longer to physically nourish the skin. Which may make it bad for our Indian skin, due to humid climate. \n\nThe Seal: \n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses Stearic Acid and Palmitic Acid. These are fatty acids that create a thick, physical seal on top of your skin. It’s designed to waterproof your skin so moisture can't escape.\n\nThe Right Side (USA): Uses Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and Sodium Citrate. Instead of just sealing the surface, it focuses on soothing irritation and providing antioxidant protection.\n\nThe Emulsifiers:\n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses more traditional, synthetic emulsifiers (PEG-100 Stearate, Steareth-21). These are very stable and give the product a long shelf life and consistent texture.\n\nThe Right Side (USA): Uses Cetearyl Glucoside, It is generally considered more skin-friendly for people with extremely sensitive or eczema-prone skin because it mimics the skin's natural structure.\n\nThis concludes this comparison between two variants of Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra between two different regions. \n\nTo my research a few people claiming that we, here in India, get inferior products as compared to the foreign counterparts, I think it's not inferior at all, it's just made/formulate in such a way that it supports our skins that too in a very humid climate, just like we have here in India as compared to cold weather in any western country!!!\n\nLet me know what you guys think. \n\nP.S. I'm not a dermat, so I cannot fully differentiate between the ingredients list all by myself, so I used Google and Gemini to help me sort things out. If there's any mistake I'd love know in the comments section! ",

      "content": "ive had acne since i started puberty and for years its been persistently awful. my whole face is just disgusting even though im a (somewhat) clean person. i shower every day, i wash my hands after using the bathroom, and i dont touch my face. ive tried every single thing i can, did everything people told me to. it made everything worse. recently i stopped using everything except for dove soap twice daily for a month to try and heal my skin after yrs of caking product after product on as it got worse and worse. my skin cleared up a lot but it was very dry and still had some acne. so, to hopefully clear the rest out and give some moisture back to my skin, i started using cetaphil daily cleanser at night and then in the morning i used a 30spf hylaurinic acid vitamins moisturizer from ambi after cleaning with just the dove soap. im breaking out again and my skin hurts. idk what to do at this point. ive never been to a dermatologist. but i can go to a regular doctor, im going for a yearly this week, so do you think i should ask the doctor to perscribe me something? what should i ask for? i like using my liver for things other than meds if u catch my drift, so no acutane 🌚 my mom would never let me go on that anyways. they tried to put her on it in her 20s and she said fuckkk no and me too tbh😂✌️ my mom also said that she doesnt moisturize bcs it gives her zits she just uses this charcoal face wash and her skin is good now but shes in her late 50s and when she was 20 she had bad skin but not when she was my age and i heard my dad always had bad skin when young but maybe i heard wrong but anyways hes an adult now and he doesnt have acne or anything even tho he doesnt shower or eat well and he does drugs and drinks every day but no acne. i tried using my moms charcoal thing and it did nothing. i only say that bcs ik skin is partially genetic",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I like how it looks after shampoo and styling. I just do a slick back which automatically does a 70/30 after air drying it. However, the days I don’t shampoo, I like the texture of the hair (it’s shiny and doesn’t look frizzy) but it just feels greasy which messes up the hairstyle.

(I’m working on a skin care routine for her, hoping it will help some). I was hoping to find some advice/recommendations for products that work well on very mature skin. \n\nAlso if you know any beauty influencers on YouTube or TikTok who have very mature skin I would love to check them out! I’m a visual learner so seeing them actually using products would be amazing!\n\nThank you guys in advance!!",
