The last one is the most recent one! \n\nMy routine essentially just consists of double shampooing with head and shoulders shampoo and just any old hydrating shampoo, and the conditioner I use is Sukin Hydrating Conditioner. Then I brush style in the shower, make sure not to disturb the clumps, then once I'm out of the shower I add in Garnier Aloe Vera leave in conditioner and Hask curl cream. After that I scrunch with a t shirt and plop it until it's about 50-60% dry, before adding in the Cake curl scrunching jelly and then leaving it to air dry the rest of the way. I don't brush once I'm out of the shower and I typically wash my hair every 4-5 days :)",

      "content": "TLDR: listened to my mum's advice on hair. Regret.\n\nSo I only went to this salon because my mum reccommended it, and she and my sister were going and we had somewhere to be. But I had a bad feeling about it because it was a small salon in a shitty area, and, most of all, it was my mum's idea.\n\nContext: I've got curly hair, around 3b curls, and fine. Mum also has curly hair, but it's looser curls, mostly waves which disappear after she puts it in a bun- and she has NO idea how to deal with curly hair. She's the type to think if I just 'take care of it', it will just magically turn straight. And that it being out curly is \"messy\". Yeah, that type.\n\nAnyway, we had somewhere to be and my mum was kinda pressuring me into it and I thought, hey, I haven't had my hair done in AGES, and maybe I shouldn't be so prejudiced as to think a small business in a shit area ran by a middle aged auntie can't do anything a bigger salon can do. So I went. And yeah, my instincts were all correct.\n\nThe woman was very old school about hair, seemed to think that flat ironing curly hair was 'fixing' it (right up my mum's alley). Not a fucking drop of knowledge about curly hair. She reccommended a conditioner with non-water soluble silicones, then said my hair is \"thick\" and \"difficult\"- now I KNOW my hair and I KNOW that it is FINE- quite dense, yes, but fine. And DIFFICULT?? Tf?\n\nSo she first washed my hair twice, no problem, I do the same. She focused on my scalp the first time- but then on my mids and ends the next. Is that normal? It was a \"deep cleanse\" apparently, so it would've been quite harsh for my hair. She towelled my hair so it was half-dry- I noticed she used the same one on me as she did on my mum and sister and other clients, no washing it, no replacing it. Then she brushed my hair while blow drying- again, same comb she used on other clients, no washing or replacing it, just tugged out the hairs off it 🤢🤢. Didn't detangle starting from the bottom, didn't do it whilst it was wet, she just ripped through my damp hair with a very stiff comb (albeit wide-toothed comb) from top to bottom. I could literally hear my strands breaking, and a bunch of hair came out. Not to mention it fucking HURT. She said that the brush she was using was really good because it detangles hair well- yeah love, by ripping half of it out so you have nothing to detangle.\n\nThen came the actual straightening- NO heat protectant. And I did ask her about heat protectant, said I have one in my bag, and she just shook her head and said, \"no, no, no it's fine\". Um, okay. I know heat protectants don't completely prevent damage but you'd want to bloody minimize it, wouldn't you?? Then she proceeded to rip through it again with the stiff comb while straightening, and going over the same strands like a million times- I'm not exaggerating, she'd go over the roots like a dozen times or more before straightening the mids and ends. Again, NO heat protectant. Then no setting spray.\n\nAnd in the end, do you want to know how much it cost? Do you want to know how much the split ends and sore scalp cost? Do you want to take a fucking guess?\n\nONE. HUNDRED. FUCKING. POUNDS.\n\nAnd I wouldn't even be this fuming about it except, you know- IT LOOKED NO FUCKING DIFFERENT TO WHEN I STRAIGHTEN IT AT HOME. I must stress this. NO. BLOODY. DIFFERENT. Except for maybe the FUCKING LOADS of split ends I can see it in now.\n\nAnd I've had my hair straightened at a salon before, and it had turned out nice- better than when I straighten it at home, because that's why you go to a salon, to get something you can't do at home, DUH. It lasts longer, and it looks smoother- you know, less like you straightened it and more like you just have straight hair.\n\nBut this looked the exact same straight-but-poofy that I can get at home. And she said it would usually be £50 for straightening- still a bit steep if you ask me, considering the quality- but that because my hair is long and thick (it's not thick) and \"DiFfiCuLt\" it would have to be more. I'm pretty sure I just paid to be hate crimed???\n\nAll that damage, all those split ends, all that pain, and all that money... for FUCK ALL.\n\nAnd I was getting so happy because I've been taking care of my hair and it's grown so long. 🙃🙃🙃\n\nLesson learned: never listen to my mum about my hair again, and go to actual curly-friendly salons.\n\nObligatory routine information: Wash with shampoo and conditioner once a week, clarify and deep condition once a fortnight, leave-in conditioner and serum and protective hairstyle like braids.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

The texture also looks rough.\n\nI consulted a dermatologist and was advised to use a moisturizer. I’ve already tried multiple brands including Cetaphil, Dermaco, and Epilyno (dermatologist-recommended), but I’m still seeing no real improvement.\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this?\n\n\t•\tWhat was the actual cause in your case?\n\n\t•\tDid anything other than basic moisturizers help?\n\n\t•\tWas it dermatitis, fungal infection, allergy, or something else?\n\nI’m not looking for a diagnosis, just real experiences or routines that worked. It’s making me feel quite insecure, so any input would really help. Thanks 🙏",

      "content": "**The issue and the story:**  \nHello! I'm 25 and I've been using the same skincare routine for around 5 years. My skin was always quite nice, when breakouts happened I knew why - too much sweets, my period, bad sunscream. But lately, it's been getting progressively worse. English is not my first language, so I'll do my best here:\n\nI have a lot of red dots, small red patches on my cheeks, jaw, forehead. They don't always turn into full blown pimple with yellow tip. The skin is also generally more red. You can see them on a photo - I know it is not the end of the world, it just happened quite suddenly and I want to control it before it gets worse. It is also more intense in coulour that photos show.\n\nWhat changed? Well, my boyfriend dumped me 6 months ago and it was well... quite sudden and traumatic. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, lost hair, all package. So yeah, immense stress - but as I said, it was some time ago.  \nHovewer, I am crying every two days. So that is my first suspect - could crying and rubbing face cause the irritation?\n\nSecondly, I started working out. So maybe more sweating than before caused this?\n\nNo other changes happened - the same products, same city (water in pipes), I wash bedding and towels as often as before.\n\nWhat do You think? Could my suspects cause it? Or maybe it is just time to look for new products? Or idk, buy silk bedding?\n\n**Skin type:** oily in a T-zone, prone to dryness, probably combo\n\n**Current routine**: I've been using the same routine for about 5 years.\n\nMorning - Cetaphil Emulsion to wash my face, La roche-posay Toleriane sensitive creme for hydration, during sunny time I add sunscream (I know, I know, should be all year) - so latetely I haven't been using it, only when I used serum night before\n\nEvening - makeup remover tonic, Cetaphil Emulsion to wash my face again, La roche-posay Toleriane dermallergo nuit OR when I feel really dry Cetaphil lipoactive moisturizing cream. Since the problems appeared, I also use Effeclar serum from LRP - but changes on skin were first, not my usage of the serum. I use it a few times a week, after using it I add sunscream the next day.\n\nI don't use much makeup, only concealer and face powder, no foundation.\n\nI'm from Poland.\n\nThank Your for Your help!",

I got a recommendation from a friend to use curl cream then a mousse then optional but a anti frizz cream after that. Unsure as to what brands are good though especially for the mousse and anti frizz. I have low porosity 2C/3A hair anddd goals are for my hair to have more definition and less frizziness, not much hold though!\n\nRoutine: Wash 1-2 a week, I use tsubaki shampoo and conditioner and then a few drops of coconut oil (stopped now) after for frizz",

      "content": "Hey Skin Care Addicts,  \nI have a question, because I've kind of hit a dead end on my skin care journey or so it seems like. For context, I am a 30 year old male with a history of mild acne as a teenager and young adult, which seemed to disappear when I started a whole food plant based diet around 8-9 years ago. Nevertheless, the past three years I worked in the music industry and had a very dynamic, very adrenaline filled job, which also unfortunately led me to burnout, sickness and I had to quit in order to save myself. As I started a new life chapter, about 2-3 months after I quit, I started noticing acne appearing again, even though I had had about 5-6 years of basically the best skin I've ever had. I panicked and started going to pharmacies, reading online, one thing led to another and in September 2025 I started using a salicylic acid cleanser from CeraVe (I think it should have 2% SA). Note: I had never done anything to my skin, had never used a cleanser or moisturizer, had never treated my skin in any other way. My skin started purging immediately and hard. I kept the SA daily (might have been an error in hindsight) and all the zones on my face kept producing (cheeks -&gt; inner cheeks -&gt; nose + fold of nose -&gt; forehead -&gt; temples). After about 9-10 weeks on daily SA, I sensed that all the zones on my face had purged and I tapered down the SA to 3x a week. Around week 12-13 I noticed some improvement, active spots were diminishing, overall redness was going away, but there was A LOT of PIE left and some zones were still cycling (primarily cheeks). Unfortunately I kept going with the SA, because I was told that I needed to reach at least a week of no actives on my face, which wasn't really happening. At week 16 of constant weekly SA use, I noticed that things were getting worse. Old zones that used to be quiet started producing new pimples and the cheeks kept em coming. Skin was overall feeling calm, but it was a construction site on my face and I couldn't take it any longer. Reading up online, it seems like most people's experience with SA was short lived and the peak purging happened around weeks 4-5, which for me was quite early. My peak purging phase was weeks 7-8 and I still had some zones left around weeks 10-12.  \nAs of 1.5 weeks I've quit the SA cleanser completely and am now focusing on healing with this simple routine:\n\nAM:  \nclean face with plain lukewarm water -&gt; CeraVe Hydrating Moisturiser -&gt; Eucerine Oil Control Tinted SPF 50+ (this keeps me confident when outside, since the tint covers up 60-70% of my PIE and active spots, it's been life saving)  \nPM:  \nCeraVe Hydrating Cleanser -&gt; CeraVe Moisturising Cream PM w/ Niacinamide\n\nI also used to occasionally use the La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 Gel (supposedly for skin repairment), but I couldn't really tell whether it was helping or not, so I stopped it.\n\nSince I've stopped the SA, I have noticed that I might have stopped the over irritation on my skin and things are calming down, though very slowly. It's only been 1.5 weeks but I already see some improvement, at least compared to weeks 14-16 on the SA cleanser. However, my cheeks keep cycling a bit and overall PIE is very dominant on my face and I don't see any improvements week by week (or maybe microscopic ones). I know this is a very slow process and I'm trying to get used to the feeling.. but I was wondering whether anyone has had similar experience with SA and if you all have any tips on how I could continue this routine and improve results?\n\nMy primary goal would be to heal the existing inflammation on my face and blend PIE to be even with skin tone. I'm not really keen on trying out any new actives at the moment, since I believe my skin needs a rest from the 16 weeks of purging, but I know people have had success with Vitamin C or azelaic acid.. Any tips on those or should I wait until the skin is calm and then try things out?",
