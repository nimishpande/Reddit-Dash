She doesn’t understand curly hair at ALL but she’s constantly making comments about my appearance. My hair being a point of contention whenever I visit.\n\nSo I was recently with family for my sisters graduation. While we’re waiting, a woman a few rows below us goes to sit down. My moms pokes me, leans over and says “wow! She has beautiful hair!” I stare at this woman’s hair (which is beautiful) and see all of the flaws my mom points out for my hair: dusts of halo frizz, wayward curls, etc… nothing wrong with it, but things people like my mother shame me over. Her hair type is JUST like mine, but her hair goes down mid back rather than my shoulder length. I say “Seriously? My hair is just like that and you insult it all the time!” She goes quiet for a moment, thinking, and then says “well, idk. It’s longer and it looks better on her.”\n\nJust can’t win.\n\nRoutine, since I still need to put one down I guess? Shampoo and conditioner is whatever, denman brush for styling, Aluram curl cream and air drying for finish.",

The lady who owns it is always there and does the nails and is really nice. I’ll possibly be the only hair client in there. I’ve been there for nails before.\n\nWhen the staff are talking out loud across the room about stuff that peaks my interest is it rude to join in? Am I joining in on a private convo or not? Sometimes I think they’re trying to include me but I’m not sure so I stay silent but then I worry that’s being rude. \n\nIm getting a cut and ombré balayage with a mixture of bright colours needing bleached so feel I’m gonna be there for a few hours and it’s stressing me out!\n\n \n\n\n",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I am so self conscious about them. \n\nThings I have tried in the past few years:\n\nNiacinimide - in supplement form\n\nSalicylic Acid - La Roche Posay face wash and Paula’s Choice exfoliant \n\nAzelaic Acid - Paula’s Choice \n\nPanoxyl face wash 4%\n\nBenzol peroxide 5%\n\nPyunkang Yul balancing gel \n\nPimple patches \n\nFor the past month or so I was using Panoxyl everyday, morning AND night, and then using the Pyunkang Yul moisturizer. I realized that I might be drying out my skin, and maybe that is what is making me so oily and have so many comedones. \n\nSo, this week I changed it up:\n\nAM- Rinse face with water \n\nPM - Cetaphil gentle cleanser \n\nAM &amp; PM- Cetaphil moisturizing lotion \n\nPM- after cleansing and moisturizing, I put Vaseline over top to seal it. \n\nOverall, what do you think I should expect from removing actives from my skincare routine? do you guys think actives were the reason I have such oily skin and closed comedones? What more can I do to make them go away? ",

I want to figure out what the cause of this anxiety may be.\n\nAbout a month ago I started getting a fairly persistent lump in the throat sensation called globus sensation and that has spiraled into other anxiety symptoms, just an overall general uneasy feeling.\n\nI did begin oral Finasteride (.5 mg daily) about 3 months prior to the onset of symptoms, and I can’t help but wonder if that has any causation to how I’m feeling now. I don’t want to stop Finasteride for no reason but I also want to be objective regarding my approach. Here is what I’m thinking and I’d love feedback.\n\n1. I did have bloodwork done prior to beginning the Finasteride. Is it worth getting bloodwork now? If so, what should I be looking at specifically to see if it can be contributing to anxiety\n2. I may lower my dose to .25 mg daily to see if the anxiety disappears or lessens. However, would it best to quit cold turkey and begin back up at .25 mg or should I just start with the lower dose now? I wonder if the buildup of finasteride in my system from my current higher dose may be problematic.\n\nThank you very much",

I'm envisioning an app that has a scanning option where you can scan you face for example and have any concerns identified ie. specific pimples, specific patches of hyperpigmentation, eczema etc. If anything is out of the ordinary, you will be ref'd to a dermatologist immediately; it could potentially even help with early serious skincare detections. It would then give you tailored treatments / how to apply them to treat those specific breakouts and accelerate your healing timeline. All of your scans are tracked and you can see pasts scans and get advice on what products, diet, lifestyle factors may be affecting your skin. You can also create a custom skincare budget and have products recommended to you that fit that budget. You can buy products directly through the app (maybe a discount?) and can also scan your existing products to see what works for you, how to use them and if anything is hazardous. There would also be a specialized ChatGPT for skincare in the app that you can ask any questions about your skin / general skincare. \n\nIt would be free to use with maybe a premium tier? Or completely free with monetization from in-app product purchases.\n\nWould you use it? Got any ideas? If I build an app like this, I wouldn’t want to do it without the input of the community.",

I started the styling process but I noticed that my hair is much staighter at the top of my head than the end of my hair. I have a layered cut so in theory it should curl.\nI'm wondering if the years of bun mania might have ruined the curl pattern at the top of my hair. Does anyone else have any experience with this? Do you have any suggestions about fixing this issue?\n\nMy routine:\n- Brush before shower (I know it's not recommended, but brushing during shower made my hair worse imo)\n- Shampoo and conditioner: Amway's, for normal hair\n- Brush my hair again, after the first detangling, while it's wet\n- Section my hair and apply a light hold gel, I do not have the name for the brand unfortunately\n- Flip over my head and apply a foam from the same unknown brand\n- Dry it with semi warm setting\n\nMy curls most of the time look defined\n",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

They first showed up after using the Prequel Gleanser. I stopped using it after a week and started using a sulfur face mask daily, and they seemed to go away, but then they came back.

      "content": "It looks wavy/frizzy in the first picture; but it definitely has the potential to be really shiny and curly like my bottom layers... (pic2)\n\nNot sure what's up, as the pictures suggest, it looks like a weird divide between the top half of my hair and the bottom half. I can also never seem to get both sides to have good looking waves, as the left side (pic 3, shows more of the back too) looks way better than my right side (pic1).\n\nI have high porosity hair, and it's often very dry past wash day. I do have professionally bleached/dyed hair, however I've had the same issues with my texture and dryness before bleaching it.\n\n\nHere's my routine (pic 1-3):\n- Shampoo twice with \"Imel Ruby Rings Shampoo for Curly Hair\"\n- Apply \"For the Love of Curls\" moisturising conditioner for 2 minutes across all my hair ( just barely not touching my roots ). Detangle with a medium sized tooth comb then wash it out. I have tried the squish to condish method in the past ( which leaves most of the conditioner in my hair ) but it did not make a difference honestly.\n\nThen while my hair is still wet:\n- Apply a good amount of Taft Curl Mousse everywhere.\n- And finally I scrunch in a pea sized amount of Taft Maxx Power Styling gel around my hair.\n\nPic 4 is when I only used a generous amount of Taft Maxx Power Styling gel on wet hair for reference…Without any conditioner though, as I only used the shampoo I mentioned earlier. it looked better than usual when initially diffused, but lacked any definition or any sort of longevity past 2 hours.\n\nI diffuse and that's it. Have no refresh routine ( which sucks, aside from wash day I brush out my hair to get more volume, and usually it's still moisturised so some curls form at the bottom ).\n\nHonestly just looking for a way to get consistent longevity and definition, maybe volume too if you guys have a way of it not being frizzy and not becoming flat immediately. Thank you in advance!!",

It started as 2 small spots on each clavicle area and then spread all over my torso, neck, shoulders, etc. I have been to multiple dermatologists, they took biopsies, and they can only diagnose it with atopic dermatitis (which is a medical bs term meaning 'We have no clue what it is but something is irritating your skin'). I have tried many different things and nothing seems to be working. Steriod cream and rubbing Vaseline after baths worked temporarily and then it flared back up again (through the steroid cream and vasoline treatments). I  changed everything about my life: bed sheets, laundry soap, showering temperatures and timeframes, soaps, vasoline and oils use after showers, oral supplements (fish oil, turmeric,  etc), I've had steriod shots and Nemluvio shots, I've stopped drinking coffee and alcohol and increased my water intake...on and on and on. Someone told me it could be linked to spiked protein from Covid-19 and I have just started taking supplements for that but I am reaching out because I am desperate. In hopes someone can help...",

Here is my routine: I wash my hair every two days, with Garnier's hair food banana shampoo (I guve It two washes). I detangled after conditioner (Pantene's) in the shower and then outside, with wet hair. Then some Pantene mouse, dry It with the diffuser and the second photo is the result I have. Why on earth do I think It looks better on the third photo??? I did absolutely nothing more than washed it and conditioner, then air dried. I think I might have fine and medium/low porosity hair... Thank you very much in advance.",

Ive seen people get good results with glycolic acid ive only tried it once tho and the resurfacing one im scared it will brake me out or something but i think it may be good for the scars. Also please let me know with the products i have how should i change them maybe start using the other 2 and should i ditch something? I also have niacinamide + zinc from TO but i dont use it anymore. I think the cleanser already has it.",
