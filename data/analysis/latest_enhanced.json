I’m wondering whether it’s a curly cut or if anyone knows which way she cuts her hair? Also I know that her hair isn’t freshly styled and probably multiple days in\n\nMy routine consists of herbal essence shampoo and conditioner and I detangle in the shower. I don’t usually style my hair (I braid it in a protective hairstyle) but when I do I just go in with the Marc Anthony curl cream + the mousse, umberto giannani gel and diffuse my hair upside down and occasionally I’ll put a claw clip while I diffuse at the top for more volume. I wear a silk bonnet to sleep. Also, my hair wet reaches my upper thigh so it’s pretty long",

      "content": "Hi everyone, looking for some help. \n\nI was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease last year and have needed over 5 surgeries in just 10 months. \n\nDuring the year I went to the hair salon to feel better about myself, I had thick, heavy, brown healthy hair. I went in and got a bleach test done - was told it came out perfectly. Went in the next day to actually get my whole head done and she fried my hair from roots to ends. Straw, broken, disgusting. This was in June. They blamed me and I had to fight for a refund, they wouldn’t even blow dry my hair it was ripping out &amp; they still let me leave after paying $700AUD. (I eventually got a refund but it was not easy).\n\nSince then I’ve had to keep my hair short &amp; continue to cut the dead bits off. I refused to shave it because I’m already very sick &amp; didn’t want to lose the last part of me I liked. \n\nI use K-18 and a mix of other products for bond repair, moisture and smoothness. I haven’t found a product that really works yet. I have had to cut some short layers into it because my hair is still fried and straw like.\n\nMy hair has killed my confidence so much. I understand I may have experienced some hair loss due to my illness, but I kid you not it was dead. Every cm of it. \n\nI think about shaving my head everyday, but as a sick 28 year old woman who wants to elope this year I don’t want to have short hair. I want to feel pretty. I’m terrified to go back to a hairstylist.\n\nDoes my hair look as bad as I think it is? I have added a before picture. \n\nPlease lend me some advice, I haven’t wanted to look in the mirror since June 2025. ",

I’m brand new to my wavy hair.\n\nMy waves are fairly defined near the roots, but the mid-lengths and ends are kind of limp and stretched. They don’t have the same bounce or clumpiness as the top.\n\nI need help figuring out why this is happening and how I can improve it. Could it be that I’m using too much conditioner? Or maybe I’m not putting enough product on the lengths? Or are my lengths too damaged? My hairdresser says they aren’t, but I have no idea — I’ve always gone to my hairdresser with straight hair, since I’ve never really embraced my waves until now.\n\nMy Hair Routine\n\nBrand: HairLust\n\nSeries: Curl Crush\n\n1. Leave-in / Curl Cream (on soaking wet hair)\n\nI apply a curl cream to soaking wet hair, focusing on the mid-lengths and ends. I smooth it through  and then gently scrunch to encourage wave formation.\n\n2. Gel (to lock it in)\n\nI apply gel on top to seal in moisture and hold the waves. I glaze it over the hair and scrunch again to enhance definition.\n\n3. Diffuse\n\nI diffuse on low heat and low speed until about 80–90% dry, trying not to touch the hair too much to avoid frizz.\n\n4. Scrunch out the crunch\n\nOnce completely dry, I scrunch out the cast to soften the waves and add movement.\n\nPlease heeeelp! Also I would appreciate any beginners advice ",

      "content": "First pic is my hair without brushing \n\nSecond is my hair after brushing - this is how my hair always is - really frizzy\n\nThird is my hair wet after washing it \n\nFirst, I would like to know my hair type. Is it curly or wavy? All my life I’ve just brushed my hair and worn it in a ponytail because it would always end up really frizzy because I don’t really know how to style it. Even when I used products for frizzy hair it still does  nothing for me.\n\nExample: John Frida FrIzz Ease, L’Oréal frizz serum, OXG Argan Oil, and many more.\n\n \n\nMy routine now is:\n\nShampoo: Shea Moisture Hydrate &amp; Repair Shampoo and Conditioner and \n\nTRESemme keratin smooth shampoo and conditioner ( I’ll rotate between these two brands)\n\nLeave in conditioner: Shea moisture leave in conditioner or Garnier banana hair food 3-in-1. I’ll use a bit of this on the ends of my hair.\n\nI’ve been trying the curly hair method and these are the products I use:\n\nCantu curl cream \n\nJohn frieda dream curl mousse\n\nEco olive oil gel \n\nWhen doing a curly routine I wash my hair and apply conditioner then leave in conditioner.\n\nThen I apply the curl cream and mousse in sections and follow up with the gel and scrunch. I squeeze the water out of my hair with a T-shirt then I use a diffuser to dry my hair. At the end I’ll use that argan oil to break the get cast\n\nI’ve only tried the curly hair method a few times but my hair is always so frizzy still and idk how to fix it. \n\nDo I need more hydrating products or protein products?\n\nAlso should I use hair oil and which hair oil would you recommended?\n\nI heard brushing your hair when it’s dry with a brush causes frizz, so should I wet my hair every day and brush? Wouldn’t that cause breakage?\n\nI have way too many questions lol\n\nI appreciate anyone who can give me some answers :)",

Conditioner is too heavy, heat styling does not hold.  I get my best hold from cool air diffusing/air drying.  Tension styling destroys my pattern.  Dripping wet styling does not work.  also please don’t come at me for my hair color I’m growing out black box dye 😭\n\n  \nMy hair seems to respond best to:\n\nstrong clarifying/chelating shampoo\n\nvery light or no conditioner\n\nprotein gels (especially cheap ones honestly)\n\ncool air diffusing + air drying\n\nletting clumps form while dripping wet, pulling apart where I feel separation in my mid lengths, and then locking them while still damp but no longer dripping\n\nMy absolute best result was when I used crappy shampoo on a small section in my sink and then quite literally the cheapest protein gel I found at WalMart.  Protein gel, even with zero conditioner and strong clarifying + chelating shampoo, makes my hair so shiny and soft, it literally looks like a hair commercial.  I need SOME slip for clump integrity, but even Verb Ghost conditioner is too heavy.  (Trying Odele leave in as a rinse out next wash) \n\nI have used conditioner maybe 3 out of my last 15+ washes and my hair looks and feels thicker and healthier than when I was using it regularly. \n\nI just want to understand my hair better and learn more about routines that will actually work.  But all I can find is the usual heavily moisturize/oil/etc advice. the last photo is from the first day I used no conditioner. The one before that was a wash day when I still used it regularly\n\nthe photo of my wet clumps was my best clump day yet. it never stays like that when it dries, but I’m willing to sacrifice definition to keep my length. I know that’s a huge limiting factor here.   \n\n\nFull routine used today:\n\nKristin Ess chelating shampoo 2x\n\nNot Your Mother's conditioner \n\nScrunch with tshirt/no product until not soaked\n\nAmpro protein styling gel\n\nI threw on some Clear Ice styling gel half way through for funsies.  My hair tolerates a LOT of product and really loves protein gel (but hates protein foam)\n\nDiffuser on high heat/speed set on sink while I hovered around it to dry my roots\n\nLift/hover diffuse on cool followed by air dry\n\nScrunch out with a small bit of Olivia Care Shine Hair Elixer\n\n",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I tried a silk pillowcase but it wasn’t much help. I let it air dry mostly, but I help it along with a towel, or I give up go to bed with it still a little damp.  Sometimes I get a crazy good curl but I don’t know how to replicate it. \n\nI’m looking for any suggestions of products or techniques I should try, I would really like it to look pretty instead of a frizzy mess.

They seem different to normal spots as they don’t develop a head and fade if I don’t touch them. If I moisturise, the pores clog more. If I don’t moisturise, they still clog. I also am prone to some spots in my back and chest but wouldn’t say it’s full blown acne.\n\nI have to shower at the end of every day thoroughly because there is so much oil on my skin, sometimes my neck and shoulder area is slick ish with oil. It’s making me miserable and not to mention, sebum does also smell oily/greasy. I could be the cleanest person after a shower and less than 12 hours later would start to feel the oil.\n\nI’ve tried so many things, just washing with water, gentle moisturisers, zinc cream, salicylic and glycolic body washes and moisturisers, thicker moisturiser. Im a fairly active person but shower after the gym and don’t shower more than once a day.I’m at my wits end. Any advice?",

I’m transitioning MtF and on spironolactone 50mg and estradiol 1mg. Spiro cleared my skin everywhere except my back. I also moved back in with my parents, which has been lovely but stressful.\n\nI went in for a back treatment and the esthetician said there was nothing to extract, just scarring or discoloration. She suggested vitamin E oil and serums, did a full routine with red light, and I left feeling like I paid for an extraction that never happened.\n\nNow I’m wondering what to do. Glycolic or salicylic chemical peels a few times a year? I’ve always had clear skin, and now at 30 my body said surprise.\n\nI already exfoliate with Japanese cloths, use fresh towels, switched to hypoallergenic detergent, wash sheets weekly, apply salicylic spray after the gym, and wear sunscreen. I’m in the sun often, but that’s never been an issue before. I usually shower 1x in morning or every other, and I use a gentle face wash, sometimes benzyl peroxide and leave it on for a minute, a gentle rice toner or a BHA/AHA toner other days, and a simple moisturizer. I do... use different cleaners a little too much and haven't been consistent, going between Tatcha, the Green Mochi one, benzyl peroxide, La Roche Pussaaayy's Gentle, and Paula's Choice.\n\nWhat does a baddie do 🙈\n\nWould a salicylic back peel on my butt and back help kick start the process?
