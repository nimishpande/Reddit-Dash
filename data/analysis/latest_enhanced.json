      "content": "I have heard that blowdrying your hair can cause heat damage, and that products to prevent heat damage can cause build-up on the hair that can weigh it down and make it seem limp and heavy. I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

The Phase IIa trial that read out in June 2025 showed that 31% of male patients with a higher degree of hair loss had a greater than 20% increase in hair density at week eight—which was four weeks after the completion of treatment. No patients in the placebo arm hit this exploratory endpoint.\n\n“Pelage is not alone in the burgeoning alopecia market. Veradermics is developing an oral extended-release version of minoxidil for pattern hair loss, which is in Phase III trials. Gil and Weng believe there could be combination opportunities in the future.\"",

I started doing research and here’s my routine:\n\nWet\n\nNot Your Mothers Defining Curl Talk Cream\n\nBrush\n\nSection off\n\nUse edge brush to wrap curls\n\nThis is reflected in the first picture. The top of her head is straight so I had to do a little baby sprout pony tail after that fell pretty quickly. \n\nThe other photos are her hair just wet, brushed, and kinda “shook out” with my fingers. This was easier but I’m not sure if it’s best for her curls. \n\nShe uses Aussie moisturizing shampoo. We do not condition because her hair is so short. Should I be doing that?\n\nIs my routine right? It seems so long and tedious. What do I do about post nap bedhead? She will not do a bonnet and I’d have to get all silk bedding because she breakdances in her sleep. Is it ok to wet it down and brush it three times a day (morning, post nap, bed time)? \n\nI’m so lost. Mine and my eldest’s hair is pin straight. My friends are recommending a lot of products and to use a cotton shirt or special hair towel. Any other advice is welcome!! \n\nAlso is it normal the top of her head is straight? ",

Once my hair is dry enough that it isn't soaking, I let it air dry.\n\nPLEASE let me know what else I should introduce into my regiment!! I'm definitely looking for advice.

Ive recently fixed my hair up from my last post on here(I looked wayyy different lmao!) and I was wondering what products I should use to fix this frizz? I live in a humid area so is it just a lost cost? Genuine question! I use lots of products depending on what Im trying to do but I wonder if its over kill? My routine is shampoo and conditoner in the shower, mousse, heat protection spray, some leave in conditioner, defuse, add a tiny bit of hair oil and in the mornings when I don't wash my hair (I wash it 2 times a week sometimes 3) I use some water out of a spray bottle and some condioning spray, sometimes a tiny bit of hair oil. Is this over kill? What should I do instead for my curls? I dont use a bonnet or curlers should I invest in either of those? I wish my hair would have tighter curls but I'm ok how it is now! Last pic is my hair when I brush it dry (Which Ive stopped doing! This picture is from some time right after I got it cut and lightend!)\n\nThank you!!! ♡♡♡",

I'm getting my hair thinned and trimmed on Tuesday\n\nso I have questions..:\n\n\\- What products should I use to begin with? I don't own any right now I just use whatever my mum has lying around the house..so whatever products you guys think would be good (I'm uk/ireland area if that helps for specific products)\n\n\\- how do I maintain it after day 1, usually I just brush it out because it gets frizzy but I want to stop it from going bad like that\n\n\\- how do I style my hair down...? I never wear my hair down and I haven't since I was 8 so I kinda have no idea how to wear my hair down without it getting in my face or just looking stupid \n\n\\- what's better? bonnet or plopping with the shirt?\n\nokay thats all the questions I could think of rn but any advice is great, I have no clue what I'm doing but it seems to be doing alright just a little frizzy ",

Is this a few weeks before it lightens or months? \n\nMy derm said the dark spots are permanent but we can “save” the pink areas by lathering Vaseline. Day 1-3 I didn’t have access to aloe Vera or anything helpful. It was so red and bumpy (no pus luckily). Day 4 I went to the dermatologist who advised  putting Vaseline every hour. \n\nThe pics are day 4-6 and trust me the dark areas are darker in person. When I look in the mirror I just feel so sad bc it’s so noticeable to me and makes me so self conscious. Any thoughts and experiences help! ",

(in addition to potentially asking for bangs lol)\n\nphotos 9 on are my hair when it was a touch longer, and how i’d grow it out. back then, i used the exact same reference photo from pinterest. i loved my hair in those photos, from the fresh cut in may, to how it’d grow out to just above my shoulders, which is where im currently trying to get to. i think the level of choppiness of the layers could still be put into mt current hair length right? or is my hair still too short at this point and i should just let it grow a bit more first.\n\nmy mom thinks i should just wait to cut my hair until its a bit longer, whereas i think if i need more layers, i should get them Now as i’m growing it out. i feel like my hair is very bulky and bulbous lol. also, it still isnt curling quite like how i like it to :,) \n\nim still thinking ill go to the salon to ask about bangs anyway so maybe i can get my stylists input too lol",

I’m looking for some advice or a routine intervention.\n\nAs you can see in the photos, I get these random \"semi-perfect\" curls that actually want to spiral and behave. But the rest of my head? It’s just a frizzy, undefined mess. I know the curls are in there somewhere, but I can’t get them to come out consistently across my whole head.\n\nMy Current Routine (Daily):\n\n1. Wash: Sebamed Everyday Shampoo.\n\n2. Condition: Garnier Banana Hair Food (leave in for 5 mins, then rinse out).\n\n3. Leave-in: Garnier Fructis Aloe Vera Hair Mask (used as a leave-in on wet hair).\n\n4. Technique: Scrunching with a 100% cotton T-shirt.\n\n5. Drying: First, I diffuse with my head upside down (cold/low speed). Then, I let it air dry for a bit while I finish my morning routine. Finally, I finish it off by diffusing with my head right-side up.\n\n6. Finish: Isana Argan Oil scrunched in at the end.\n\n7. Protection: I sleep with a satin bonnet every night.\n\nI’m based in Germany, so I mostly shop at dm or Rossmann. I’m finding that despite this routine, only a few strands clump into that semi-perfect shape while the rest stays chaotic. I'd love to hear your thoughts on why my hair is so inconsistent and what I can do to get the rest of my hair to join the party!",
