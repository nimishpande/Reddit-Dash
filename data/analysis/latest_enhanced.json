You can do anything you want with your hair :D\n\nAs I said yesterday, I haven’t had my hair cut professionally aside from a trim in a decade. I saw this girl on insta (little\\_warren) and I loved her hair! I was in NYC with my boss for a week so I decided to  go to a curly hair salon. I showed them the inspo pic and they totally nailed it. It was pretty expensive but totally worth it. I was there over 2 hours and they washed/cut/styled/dried my hair perfectly. \n\n  \nSalon: Rëzo Hair Salon 226 5th Ave, NYC / Stylist: Fari Feliz\n\n\n\n*Routine:*  \nI never wash my hair more than once a week.\n\nShampoo: TRESemmé Bouncy Curls/\n\nConditioner: Garnier Fructus Hair Filler + Vitamin Cg Strength Repair /\n\nCurly hair brush in the shower / Loreal Professionnel Tecni Art Bouncy &amp; Tender Force 2 on soaking wet hair /\n\nRight after that TréLuxe Hi! Definition Curl Enhancer Styling Gel in the shower before I step out /\n\nMicro Fiber head towel wrap, 15 minutes, no rubbing or twisting hard. Remove towel and air dry 15 minutes with diffuser on hot until 3/4 dry.\n\nUse big clips to gently scrunch and clip the bangs, middle and top back of hair with 3 clips. Leave for 20 minutes. Gently release the clips and scrunch out the cast then a gentle scrunch with Olaplex No7 rubbed into my hands.\n\nI sleep with a silk bonnet with my hair pinned pineapple style up top. I refresh after a couple of days with a fine mist water spray bottle and scrunch. I do that for the rest of the week and maybe touch up with a scrunch of Moroccan Oil rubbed into my hands once or twice a week.\n\nThat’s it!",

      "content": "Notes from a skin cosmetologist.\n\nIndian skin tans easily, marks easily, and holds onto pigmentation longer. Ik, it's a little sad. Mostly because our melanin response is very active (thanks to sun + heat + inflammation).\n\nIf you're dealing with tanning, dark spots, or acne marks, here are ingredients that actually work, and (istg this is more important) how they work:\n\n1. Mulberry Extract\nA gentle tyrosinase inhibitor. What this does is it slows the enzyme that makes excess pigment. Good for people who want brightening without irritation.\n\n2. Niacinamide\nDoesn’t lighten melanin!\nInstead, it reduces melanosome transfer, which means less pigment gets passed to the surface layers.\nAmazing for acne marks, PIH\n\n3. Alpha Arbutin\nA stable brightening ingredient that also inhibits tyrosinase, but gradually\nGreat for uneven tone without harshness.\n\n4. Licorice Extract\nContains glabridin + liquiritin. Magical as they are, both work as tyrosinase suppressors + anti-inflammatory... Licorice is giving 😌\nSo it treats dark spots and the inflammation causing them.\n\n5. Centella (Cica)\nMy favourite when it comes to formulating! Not a brightener by itself, but reduces inflammation + oxidative stress, which are major triggers for pigmentation.\n\nBiggest rule for pigmentation :\nREDUCE INFLAMMATION FIRST.\nBrightening only works when the skin is calm.\n\nHope this helps!",

I had never even heard about finasteride until the surgeon told me to get on it immediately, and ideally delay the surgery. I declined delaying it as I had travelled to Turkey. However, I got on it as soon as I got home. \n\nAfter going on fin for 3 to 4 months, I realised my hair was no longer brittle. My hair grew back nicely in the transplant area and all my hair felt less brittle. In 2023, I was happy and added oral minoxidil to the mix. I definitely felt some more thickness after the first shed, but not as much as I had hoped for.\n\nAbout 5 months ago, I added dutasteride to the mix three times a week, still taking the full dose of fin to try and avoid a shed. I am not quite sure why, but adding this has had an absolutely insane effect on my hair. I am in my 40s and have been thinning since I was 17. I would say my hair is now thicker than when I was 18. Loads of small hairs.\n\nAt the barbers today, I looked in the mirror and with my wet hair I could not see any scalp. I honestly cannot remember the last time I saw that. I have come home and shone my phone light on my scalp looking in the mirror and there are so many new short hairs with fresh regrowth. I was planning to ditch fin after six months, but I might just keep this stack now as it is working so well.\n\nI just wanted to give a perspective from someone who has taken fin and min for a long time, and the thing that worked the most in the mix several years later has been Dutasteride.\n",

I planned to buy Azelaic Acid 10% and Niacinamide 5% as separate serums to target PIH/PIE and occasional acne, but buying them separately is bit expensive. Then I found this product, which has almost the same ingredients and ratios I was looking for, combined in one cream. But I’ve never used this brand before, so I’m a little skeptical about effectiveness and formulation quality. Would you recommend this over buying azelaic and niacinamide separately?",

      "title": "[Routine Help] [Personal] Prescribed three acne medicines!!!",
      "content": "Hello! A few weeks ago, I went to visit my primary care doctor to get a dermatologist referral as I have been suffering from what I believe to be hormonal acne (which is sometimes cystic) for about a year or two. My problem areas consistently being in my T-zone, but they appear the most around my mouth and along the chin and jaw. I have this cystic pimple that appears on my chin about every two months that swells up so big, my bottom lip gets swollen too! My body acne has also been getting worse, I have been getting it a lot more on my thighs and bottom than I used to, and my back gets like 5 huge pimples every other day.\n\nI assumed it was hormonal acne as I am a 21 year old woman and I rarely change my routines up. I try and keep a simple-ish skincare routine; anua oil cleanser, panoxyl face wash, thayers witch hazel toner, and cerve daily moisturizer (and of course sunscreen). Every now and then, I would use glycolic acid if I remembered, but it wasn't something I used all the time. I use the panoxyl wash on my body too, and again, glycolic acid if I remember, followed by eucerin advanced repair cream. I've had a routine similar to this in the past when my skin was most clear, but I was also using a curology prescription back then. I do notice that the days I completely forgot to do anything to my face, my skin would calm down the most, but still, acne would appear.\n\nAnother assumption was stress as I do have poor stress management. But I noticed that the acne would just linger for so long, and nothing I seemed to do worked. I did attempt to remove products from my routine in the two-ish years this has been occurring to see if maybe my skin became accustomed to the products (I don't know if this is genuinely something that can happen btw). Again, nothing seemed to help!!\n\nMy primary care doctor did not give me a dermatologist referral as she said they'd just prescribe me accutane (that's definitely not the only things derms do, but ok). I told her the products I use and she seemed baffled that I use an oil cleanser and told me to remove it from the routine as it's pore clogging, which makes sense but slightly upset me as it makes my skin soft lol. She then prescribed me clindamycin phosphate/benzoyl peroxide cream, tretinoin cream, and spironolactone. \n\nI'm not sure if prescribing all three of these is normal? It felt like she threw whatever medicine at me to see what sticks haha. I'm mainly confused about this because I don't understand how we're supposed to know what's working best and what treatment will continue. I'm also afraid of the tretinoin because I know that there is a purging period! In 2021, I bought retinol from the ordinary not knowing how to properly use it. I did not use it little by little each week like what's recommended and I broke out horribly! I feel like my skin never recovered from that if I'm being honest. That's my main concern about using tretinoin. \n\nI've begun using the clindamycin phosphate/benzoyl peroxide cream and spironolactone and my skin already feels better (it's been a week using the cream and only two days with the spironolactone so take that with a grain of salt LOL). Is it normal for these three products to be prescribed all at the same time? Should I just have tried to get the dermatologist referral or would they have done the same thing? Should I hold off on using the tretinoin to see if my skin improves with the other two prescriptions first?\n\nAny guidance is appreciated! :-)",

It's always this bad, and it has been for several years. I'm really not sure what to do. The first thing I notice is the massive amount of redness, but I'm looking to ignore that today as I'm getting laser treatment in the next few months to address that. What im looking for advice on is anything else I can work on outside of the redness. I'll be honest and say I haven't applied a single product to my face in about 6 months. It's really demotivating because no matter what I used or did it didn't get better or worse... there's like no data points to even work off of.\n\nI went to a dermatologist a few weeks ago who said the redness ect. Is fine and just gave me some epiduo... as much as she's a professional that didn't seem right that it's just that... so I haven't used it yet.\n\nIve had so many people talk about so many different conditions and I'm not sure if I have all of them or none. The main ones tend to be:\n\nRosacea (confirmed by my derm),\nSeb derm, \nAcne (obvious)\n\nIn a nutshell im totally confused. I don't know what's wrong, im not even sure what works to fix this..  im just looking for some advice. As I said I want to ignore the redness for now, my chief concerns are:\n\nHydration (skin is dry immediately after using any moisturiser),\n\nTexture (look at all those bumps in the photo),\n\nFlaking,\n\nAcne\n\nA \"pre laser\" routine if you will, since that's the main thing thats going to help.\n\nThank you all for your advice!",

I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
