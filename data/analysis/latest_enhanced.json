It was painfully slow at first, but things have definitely gotten better! Here are the dates of the pictures for reference:\n\npic 1: 8/5\n\npic 2: 9/19\n\npic 3: 10/30\n\npic 4: 12/1\n\npic 5: 12/22\n\npic 6: 1/22\n\npic 7: today! \n\nI’m really happy with my progress so far, but I’m anxious about whether it’s dense/healthy enough to grow out into a proper hairstyle. Do you guys think it’ll grow out nicely? Do you think I’ve hit a ceiling or could more regrowth be possible? I’ve gained a lot of hair back, but it’s still noticeably thinner than before my hair loss. \n\nThanks again to this community for all the info that got me this far!",

My hair is naturally super super thin but frizzy, I have the same hair as my mom but she gets it straightened with keratin. \n\nSo for funsies I decided not to brush my hair after the shower and used a conditioner ( shea moisture)  and did the bowl method, followed by texturizing spray (bed head) and curl mouse (pattern) . I also “ plopped” my hair for a bit and then diffused it and it turned out like this ( will attach pics). My curly haired friend said that I don’t actually have wavy hair, that anyone with straight hair can use a few curling products and end up with the same hair. Do I actually have wavy hair? Or am I just gaslighting myself? If I do have wavy hair I can imagine i’ve damaged it quite a lot over the years by not taking care of it properly. Please help! \n\nRoutine: \n\n1.

Being a competitive swimmer left my hair damaged and broken. Long story short, I buzzed it and then grew it back out. \n\nFast forward to now: the first picture is my hair after oil and a diffuser (my sister who has VERY curly hair recommend I try the diffuser) and it worked! However, the second picture is after sleeping on a satin pillowcase and having it in a large claw clip all day (I work in food service so it has to be put up). My bangs are dried with a round brush. \n\nRoutine:\n\n1) Aussie miracle shampoo and conditioner (finger combing in the shower) \n\n2) scrunching with a towel and adding Aussie leave-in conditioner (not in this photo since i’m out of it), then Palmer’s amino binding complex hair oil, and lastly i tired Aussie (can you tell i like the way their products smell? xD) mousse. And lastly argon oil heat shield. \n\n3) I used a cheap diffuser from Amazon (hey, it had good reviews!) and dried my roots a bit before the rest if my hair flipped over the top of my head, then flipped on either side, then established a part standing straight. \n\nI basically want to know how to keep the curls looking curly if it’s possible with my lifestyle. I love the way they look, but they keep falling out. \n\nAlso, it’s hard to tell in the photos, but the bottom layer of my hair wants to be straight. Any advice on how to handle that with curlier top pieces? And if anyone could tell me what type of curls I have that would be appreciated! Because I have no idea. \n\nThanks for reading this far! ❤️",

I said I didn’t want ashy tone because it doesnt suit my complexion well. \n\nWhat I got is not what I asked for clearly.

What do you think? \n\nI want :\n\n\\- lived in balayage that looks beach sunkissed and that looks natural when my roots grow \n\n\\- honey/golden tones, i dont want blue tones or ashy toners, they tend to make me look washed out and older\n\n\\- i want dimension in the lower part of my hair (now its all bleached out) \n\nThanks!!!",

I didn’t like how short hair looks on me so I grew my hair for a year but now I am quite worried about the volume. I know I have seen people like celebrate hair volume on here, I feel like because my hair is quite thick, and my hair expands as it dries quite a bit during the day and I don’t know if it’s creating a “bobblehead effect” cause I am quite short for a man at like 5’3” ( 162cm) and athletic-skinny guy so the volume is making a bit uncomfortable like I don’t know if it’s making me look worse or not. I am neurodivergent and very blind to my own looks and social cues of whether people like my hair or not because no one tell me if it’s bad or good and I can’t read peoples mind. Would really appreciate guidance and whether I should keep it, do something about the volume, cut it or just shave it all off. \n\nMy current routine: Wet Hair, Maui Moisture Heal &amp; Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo For Dry &amp; Damaged Hair , Maui Moisture Heal &amp; Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner For Dry &amp; Damaged Hair and Maui Moisture Heal &amp; Hydrate + Shea Butter Hair Mask For Dry &amp; Damaged Hair (I use it as leave in and it smell really good tbh). I scrunch it in, part my hair off center and extra strong hair spray because I live in a windy city. Try to break the cast in a few hours after fully dried but then it starts expanding, worse if I keep adjusting it with my fingers and if there’s humidity. My curl pattern changes daily but I think I am a bit of 2b, 2c maybe a bit of 3A",

Over the past several months, I’ve been trying samples of k-beauty skincare and I've been really enjoying using them. The samples I've tried include Mixsoon bean and sentella essences, most of Peach and Lily’s line, Aestura deluxe sample from Sephora, innisfree green tea moisturizer and spf and, most recently samples from HaruHaru’s hyaluronic acid toner and milky essence. These samples helped me decide what my routine will look like.\n\nI'm 33F have dehydrated combo skin and my concerns are texture and anti aging (no wrinkles, but fine lines are starting to form). My skin can get sensitive \\*sometimes\\*.\n\nDay:\n\n\\- Wash with warm water or use a Peach &amp; Lily Lazy Day pad \n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice Hyaluronic Toner for Sensitive Skin\n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice Probiotic Barrier\n\nEssence\n\n\\- Peach &amp; Lily Rescue Party Barrier Serum\n\n\\- Aestura Atobarrier 365 Lotion\n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice Bakuchiol Eye Cream\n\n\\- Innisfree Daily UV Defense Invisible Korean Broad Spectrum SPF 36 Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice Moisture Cleansing\n\nGel\n\n\\- TIRTIR Milk Skin Toner\n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice Probiotic Barrier\n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice Night Knight Retinol\n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice 5 Ceramide Barrier\n\nMoisturizing Cream\n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice Bakuchiol Eye Cream\n\n\\- erborian 17 ingredients Night Perfecting Oil\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or comments about any of the products? Does anyone have a good dupe for Tatcha the Indigo Night Cream? I'll miss that in my routine, but it's out of my budget now. Also looking for good K-beauty masks or treatments! I know medicube is popular, but they have really mixed reviews on Ulta. So far I just have Peach &amp; Lily Cryo Reset Calming Mask Pads and other non K-beauty masks/scrubs/treatments.\n\nTLDR: Most of my routine is now K-beauty, looking for a thicker night cream and any K-beauty treatments/ masks/exfoliators for sometimes sensitive, dehydrated/combo aging skin. 🙏 ",

I need to find a new conditioner because it's a little bit pricy, and it isn't working the way it used to anymore (my curls are only lasting beautifully for like 2 days when I used to get a solid 3/4. I get super dandruffy in the winter and need to solve that too. For styling, I use innersense's quiet curl control (LOVE) and miss jessies softcurl light gel. After styling products, I use bouncecurl's styling brush to section and then diffuse! \n\n Any recommendations would be so lovely!! Sidenote: I'm a bit picky with scents and prefer smells that aren't very strong, I love how light and subtle innersense products smell. Pics are how my hair used to be with same routine (minus the gel) and now on a day 2. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/48idi2go7shg1.jpg?width=1372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e8b9a57af52aabba9ff910288e07054276b971c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dwdho77w6shg1.jpg?width=1576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37f9f459b0699040044163328a832786d1aebcf5\n\n",

It’s been \\~6 days and it’s not improving.\n\nWhat I’m seeing:\n\n* [Image](https://i.imgur.com/j1IX4K4.png)\n* Two small raised “swollen” lines / a noticeable bump along the nasolabial fold area (not just a shadow) highlighted in red\n* No current irritation, burning, or itching\n* No obvious swelling elsewhere\n* It looks the same every day — not better or worse\n* I eat a very clean diet and workout every day, I haven't had any fluctuations in BF % of weight gain\n* Cream I [used](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BBSP2JNQ?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&amp;th=1)\n\nWhat I’ve done since noticing it:\n\n* Stopped the retinol product immediately\n* Keeping skincare very basic (gentle cleanser + bland moisturizer), no actives\n\nQuestions:\n\n* Has anyone had a retinol moisturizer trigger an actual *bump* in this area (milia/comedone/cyst/dermatitis)?\n* How long did it take to go back to normal?\n* Anything safe to do to help it resolve faster (warm compress vs cold, specific gentle products to use/avoid)?\n* At what point would you see a derm for something like this?\n\nIf helpful I can post close-up photos in consistent lighting.

I am wanting to find products to help build a skincare routine or add onto my routine as it seems my skins not pairing well with my previous routine/products i use anymore. \n\nmy skin goes between dry and not dry but not oily and i’d say is a bit reactive to new products.\n\nproducts i normally use are:\n\nCerave face wash- renewing sa cleanser  or the foaming facial cleanser\n\nThayers original toner\n\ncerave- pm mouisturizing lotion (i used to use the am lotion but don’t like how oily it makes me face feel after i assume due to the sunscreen in it)\n\nI would like to keep it a very minimum product, simple routine so 5-6 products or less.\n\nI’m also looking for serum recommendations to keep my skin moisturized,and start a skincare routine to keep up and update as i age for wrinkles, fine lines, etc.\n\nAs well as eye creams for dark/sunken under eyes as my insomnia makes the more prominent on nights i can’t sleep well/sleep.\n\nI’m not a fan of some routines that make your skin look overly oily(or glowy) as they say. I hope this info helps as i’m not sure what information would help or if this made any sense! any help is appreciated greatly so i can get my skin back to some type of normal",
