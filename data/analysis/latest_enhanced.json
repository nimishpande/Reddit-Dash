      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Tried posting this in the wavy hair subreddit as my hair texture varies from a lose curl to a sad wave, but they keep removing my posts/ wouldn’t allow new ones to go through. Im hoping that someone knows how to deal with this.\n\nThis is my natural hair with the waves and everything, just a small amount of product. About 2a-2c on a good day? Why is it that no matter what I do the top of my head refuses to have any texture? I have the same issue with some other parts of my hair and then the mid section is incredibly wavy/curly. No matter what I do my hair ends up like this and im not confident wearing it like this in public — it looks greasy. I already have layers cut into my hair to try to reduce weight and use very minimal product. It gets actually greasy fast so I usually have to wash my hair every day or every other day. I have used so many different products and I get the same results no matter what I do. Am i just screwed to have hair that doesn’t work with me?\n\nMy routine: shampoo with either raw sugar’s moisture smoothie shampoo or the truly unruly shampoo (all over, my hair hates product buildup and I need a clean canvas). Then run either raw sugar’s the grow pro conditioner or the sensitive one conditioner (i get raw/itchy spots on two sections on my scalp) through all of my hair as if i avoid my roots they get greasy faster or my hair is too dry there and i get breakage. Then squish the conditioner out under hot or slightly cold water (depending on how i feel, a chemist was able to prove water temp does not matter in hair that much), and rinse almost all of the conditioner out. Squish being’s major no-free leave in for 2a-2c into my ends to prevent dryness, and squish hairitage’s play it cool heat protectant all over as I usually have to use heat products to make me look presentable. Lastly, squish in miss jessie’s jelly soft curls soft gel to try to get some definition. I usually just let it air dry as diffusing sometimes makes it worse, but my hair is still bad when I let it air dry. If its too wet (as it gives me sensory issues) i might scrunch the ends with a hair towel (i think its microfiber?).",

This made it super red and sore- pictured. It said to use for 5 days and I used for 6 then stopped and it’s no better but actually seemed worse while I was using it) and am currently trying zero and using absolutely nothing on my face at all- only washing my face with water and not even using moisturiser. This seemingly worked a bit but as it got really dry and sore, that seems to have flared it and left to spreading. I’m scared to use any moisturiser as all types I’ve tried have aggravated it in the past. \nI’m supposed to have my wedding make up tried next week but think I’m going to have to cancel? \nAttached are 3 photos of different angles today where it really seems to be less inflamed and red but the spots are suddenly spreading thick and fast. There are also a cluster of them around my eyebrow not pictured.\nI’ve also attached a photo of it only a few days ago when it was seemingly getting better but VERY dry.\nAnd a photo of it weeks ago when it was red and sore\nAnd a photo of how it ‘started’.\n\nCan anyone:\n1.

Also, once in a while it makes my skin feel warm, kind of like an allergic reaction.\n\nI switched last month to Peach Slices redness line and so far I think it's ok, but looking at pictures from past years my skin p much looks the same.\n\nMy routine is the following:\n\nAM:\n\nwash with water\n\nSupergoop mineral sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\nBioderma micellar water (if spf doesn't come off, clinique take the day off balm)\n\nPeach Slices Redness Relief cleanser\n\nPeach Slices Redness Relief moisturizer\n\n\\- every other day PS azelaic acid\n\nI went to a derm and they suspect rosacea so they gave me triple cream (metro, ivermectin, azelaic acid). it was EXPENSIVE tho and i didn't see much difference with it. I'm using Peach Slices azelaic acid now and sometimes it's okay, other time it irritates me. (been using for about 4 weeks now)\n\nThe thing is, I'm not sure it's rosacea because if I go goblin mode and stay indoors for like a week (no skincare, no makeup, no spf), my skin looks PERFECT and COMPLETELY CLEAR! no redness whatsoever.\n\ni am at a loss, is skincare a scam? lol\n\ni almost want to drop all skincare, but i can't stop using sunscreen, and i have to take it off to sleep, thus requiring me to use cleanser and moisturizer. what do i do?? :v",

I have issues with acne here and there and oily skin, i’m almost 30 so i’m seeing some wrinkles forming too. and I feel like i have some dark eye circles.

So anyway, I've played the blame game with ingredients over the past 5 years or so, and after having no luck eliminating things, I finally realized that it doesn't matter what I use or if my routine contains one product or 5, the one singular constant in any routine i've tried is regularly exposing my face to surfactants and water. It doesn't matter if it's a creamy cleanser, gel, foaming, milky, or even just straight micellar water, rinsed with tap water or distilled, even just once a day.The symptoms are the same. Eventually my face is red irritated, and tight. I have fine lines and enlarged pores *all over*. The worst of the worst is most likely to happen after a day of doing food delivery (so I'm in the car with some type of air blowing on me, whether its the ac or heat) and after I get home, I will experience the most *painful* flushing. Putting a little humidifier in one of my cup holders has not stopped this from happening unfortunately. It doesn't happen every time, but it happens often enough. \n\nAll of this stops shortly after I've stopped washing my face, whatever the reason has been. The last time my skin tone and texture looked really good was when I stopped doing anything except moisturizing because I'd gotten sick and got out of the habit. I was breaking out more, but I wasn't having the painful flushing, redness, irritation and tightness. The thing is, I don't want to not have a skincare routine. I really like having one! And I don't wear makeup but this is the first time in my life I'm committed to wearing sunscreen every single day. But you need to wash off sunscreen, right? Any advice or guidance would be appreciated. Im feeling a bit lost as to where to go from here.",

On my nose and chin, they’re deep and dark, while on my cheeks they’re more shallow but still noticeable.\n\nI’ve tried a bunch of things:\n\n-Salicylic acid (in cleansers and serums)\n-Glycolic acid\n-Niacinamide\n\nUnfortunately, none of them have made a real difference.\n\nAnd here’s my current routine:\n\n-Cleanser: La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Cleanser\n-serum: COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence\n-Moisturizer: CeraVe lotion\n-Sunscreen: Garnier Super UV with Niacinamide\n\nExtras:\n\n-Twice a week: Glycolic Acid by The Ordinary\n-Once a week: BHA Blackhead Power Liquid by cosrx\n\n\nIf anyone has suggestions, especially for stubborn blackheads on sensitive skin, I’d be super grateful!",

I was excited to start taking care of my hair, but I’ve had the hardest time managing it. I have a horrible problem with frizz and I’m truly at a loss on how to handle it. I feel like I’ve tried everything and I have a million bajillion product attempts, but nothing has given me any sort of progress. I’ve followed hair routines that are similar to my hair type and porosity type, I’ve bought Camille Rose shampoo and conditioner that are supposed to mend frizz, I tried Not Your Mothers Sculpting gel and after that didn’t work I tried the same brands Flash Freeze gel. I’ve also tried using Not Your Mothers mousse- that didn’t work so I tried Doux’s mousse, but I still had frizz. I have tried SO. MANY. CURL. CREAMS. I’ve tried Rizo’s, Not Your Mothers, LUS, everything I could find; the only one that showed clear signs of decreased frizz was Rizo’s, but there’s still frizz galore. I’ve even been spending a good 3 hours after wash and routine day diffusing my hair with cold air. I’m not sure if it’s the way I’m applying products or the order I rake them in?\n\nMy routine right now consists of:\n\nSoaking wet hair washed by Camille Rose shampoo and conditioner, then I section and spray Not Your Mothers leave conditioner. I then rake in Rizo’s curl defining cream followed by Doux’s texture foam enhancer. After that I take a styling brush and brush out each section. Finally, I use Not Your Mothers flash freeze gel and I scrunch each section and then I diffuse on the coldest setting and allow a gel cast to form. (I’m not sure if this helps, but I have a medium hair strand, it’s not super think, but a strand is noticeable between my fingers and is far from thin.)\n\nAfter the routine, sometimes my curls with separate from each other and I’ll have really small strings of curls that look super weird. The shape and frizz-less curls will usually last the day, but once I’m home from school, my hair is ridiculously frizzy and it won’t last make it another day. I am truly at a loss and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Any advice is super welcomed. I’ve never dyed my hair or had any treatments done, my hair is completely virgin- not sure if that information makes a difference.\n\nI never realized how difficult curly hair can be.",

I hear something different from anywhere I look, so should I do straightening, relaxers, keratin treatments or something else entirely? Please let me know \n\nSecond - as I described, I wear my hair forward (currently an overgrown mod cut) and I want my hair to be long to the sides like in the images attached (yes ik they are women in the photos i just couldn’t find good ones with guys). I know obviously it will take a long time to grow out- so my issue is figuring out what to do while waiting for it to grow. \n\nI need hair style recommendations for transitioning from short to long because I obviously can not wear it forward anymore.
