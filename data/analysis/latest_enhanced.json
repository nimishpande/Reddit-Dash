In Feb 2025 I added oral min alongside the current medications. \n\nI decided to stop the topical usage of minoxidil and stick with only oral, hoping the switch would be fine. I made the transition gradually too, over the course of a few months.\n\nSadly to say, I’ve been shedding for over half a year nonstop and have lost all my hair. I keep losing hair every day. I know people say to give it time, but this 6+month shed hasn’t slowed down one bit, and I haven’t seen any crazy regrowth with oral min. I’ve literally had sheds and recovered from them in the amount of time I’m shedding right now.\n\nI’ve since started using topical minoxidil again, alongside both oral fin and min pills. \n\nAny comments or recommendations will be greatly appreciated, I’m basically starting over again. I’ll be using topical AND oral min, with oral fin.\n\n5% topical min, 0.5 oral fin, 2.5 oral min. Dosages have remained the same throughout the entire journey. Hopefully I can make another comeback.\n\nIn hindsight dropping topical minoxidil was definitely a dumb move, as I had great hair last summer. I only wanted to stop it because pills were easier. ",

She doesn’t understand curly hair at ALL but she’s constantly making comments about my appearance. My hair being a point of contention whenever I visit.\n\nSo I was recently with family for my sisters graduation. While we’re waiting, a woman a few rows below us goes to sit down. My moms pokes me, leans over and says “wow! She has beautiful hair!” I stare at this woman’s hair (which is beautiful) and see all of the flaws my mom points out for my hair: dusts of halo frizz, wayward curls, etc… nothing wrong with it, but things people like my mother shame me over. Her hair type is JUST like mine, but her hair goes down mid back rather than my shoulder length. I say “Seriously? My hair is just like that and you insult it all the time!” She goes quiet for a moment, thinking, and then says “well, idk. It’s longer and it looks better on her.”\n\nJust can’t win.\n\nRoutine, since I still need to put one down I guess? Shampoo and conditioner is whatever, denman brush for styling, Aluram curl cream and air drying for finish.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I've bitched about my fine curly hair on this sub before, and while I am perfectly okay with my current routine (it terms of how it makes my hair feel), I am still at a loss with the general shape of my hair, especially my roots constantly falling flat.\n\nMy current cut is grown out, but I initially asked  for shoulder length layers and an eye length bang. It looks fine for about a month but my hair grows so fast that my roots end up looking flat again, I find myself having to trim at home but there is only so much I can cut off. My hairstylist trims/reshapes every four months. I've tried root clips and foams, but neither give me a consistent or lasting lift. Root clips actually will slip out of my head when styling sometimes. \n\n\ncurrent routine for guidelines:\n\n1. clarify once every 3-5 days with ouai detox shampoo. apply leave-in conditioner as needed afterwards. \n\n2. Detangle, then define curls while wet. Seperate clumps.\n\n3. Microflop until damp, then apply mousse/foam (I alternate between NYM Curl Talk, Herbal Essence's Mousse, and Innersense I Create Lift)\n\n4. Diffuse upside down (kinda wanna stop doing this, it's hurting my back), incorporate root clips once 50% dry. Add a tiny bit of foam at the lengths for extra grit. \n\n5. Finish off with hair spray. \n\n⁠",

I think it’s either clumping correctly with the layers or my hair stylist is thinning but it kind of looks like I have Albert Einsteins electrocuted look. My hair is falling outward which is making it stick out instead of blending in. My biggest annoyance is that the front pieces also have some major gapping that makes it look super sparse. \n\nI would greatly appreciate tips/routines, thoughts on what I could ask for when I get it cut or haircut styles that would look good with my hair type. \n\nA little background: I bleached a my hair a bunch like 3-4 years ago and had to regrow a lot of it so it’s still not as thick and healthy as it used to be. \n\nMy routine: I use the Moroccan oil curl cream or pillow soft curl cream and Aveda confixor. I scrunch both products in with super wet hair and I let it air dry/sometimes diffuse. ",

Paired with this I get quite dirty so I’m having to apply sunblock to a dirty face and I have it on my face all day.\n\nMy second problem is because of this my acne has gotten quite bad. I try and clean my face before each application but it doesn’t seem to help.\n\nI’m looking for suggestions on sunblocks that will last a while on my face and neck even while sweating. I’d also appreciate recommendations on face wipes I can use during the day before re-applying, as well as a good oil cleanser and secondary cleanser that will help properly clean my skin at the end of the day.\n\nIf anyone has any other tips, e.g exfoliating recommendations, that’d also be appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance",

In the meantime I always took care of it, tried products that would help me mantain it, but I didn't bother styling it. \nThis year I want to wear my hair down. I started the styling process but I noticed that my hair is much staighter at the top of my head than the end of my hair. I have a layered cut so in theory it should curl.\nI'm wondering if the years of bun mania might have ruined the curl pattern at the top of my hair. Does anyone else have any experience with this? Do you have any suggestions about fixing this issue?\n\nMy routine:\n- Brush before shower (I know it's not recommended, but brushing during shower made my hair worse imo)\n- Shampoo and conditioner: Amway's, for normal hair\n- Brush my hair again, after the first detangling, while it's wet\n- Section my hair and apply a light hold gel, I do not have the name for the brand unfortunately\n- Flip over my head and apply a foam from the same unknown brand\n- Dry it with semi warm setting\n\nMy curls most of the time look defined\n",

I'm envisioning an app that has a scanning option where you can scan you face for example and have any concerns identified ie. specific pimples, specific patches of hyperpigmentation, eczema etc. If anything is out of the ordinary, you will be ref'd to a dermatologist immediately; it could potentially even help with early serious skincare detections. It would then give you tailored treatments / how to apply them to treat those specific breakouts and accelerate your healing timeline. All of your scans are tracked and you can see pasts scans and get advice on what products, diet, lifestyle factors may be affecting your skin. You can also create a custom skincare budget and have products recommended to you that fit that budget. You can buy products directly through the app (maybe a discount?) and can also scan your existing products to see what works for you, how to use them and if anything is hazardous. There would also be a specialized ChatGPT for skincare in the app that you can ask any questions about your skin / general skincare. \n\nIt would be free to use with maybe a premium tier? Or completely free with monetization from in-app product purchases.\n\nWould you use it? Got any ideas? If I build an app like this, I wouldn’t want to do it without the input of the community.",

      "content": "I am relatively new to the world of skincare. i'm 24 and only really started paying any attention to my skin when i was 22 because i really wanted to try out face masks for the first time and my ADHD went, Wishlist every product! you'll try them all and know what works!......not realistic with my time OR money. The reality is that i ended up buying one random facial moisturizer (rael miracle clear barrier cream) and a random cleanser (garnier micellar water w/ vitamin C) and i used that very inconsistently whenever i wanted to randomly use a random face mask i had gotten. This replaced the also very inconsistent who knows what was in it acne face wash cream that my mom told me to apply using a very scratchy sponge whenever i started getting acne.\n\nRecently i've gotten more serious about taking care of my skin my skin looks fine to me now save for occasional acne, i just want to make sure its taken care of as i age (i've noticed fine lines already). I also see skin care as a fun self care habit to have. right now i'm using that cleanser and moisturizer once a day, time varies but as long as it happens i can tick my mental box. I use rubber gloves when doing the dishes, moisturize my hands if they feel dry, and started using palmers cocoa butter all over my body after a shower/bath. Face masks are happening roughly once a month now. I want to add a sunscreen but i know i'll only use it if it *replaces* my current moisturizer in the process, i figure i'll just pick between the two depending on if it's closer to AM or PM. I don't know what my skin type is, it might by dry? or combination? or normal? idk, all i know is my face feels normal to me and the years of doing nothing to it didn't have me feeling a particular kind of way.\n\nIf i had to list any concerns i'd say i get occasional acne, want to deter aging signs, am trying to heal a surgery scar on my leg (currently using scar tape and instead of washing it daily like i should it's just....there til it falls off and i use a new one. i blame the neurodivergence and life) and i feel like i just....look tired, that's likely from the stress and poor sleep, poor diet, poor hydration and poor exercise though. All things i gotta work on but....one step at a time. i've also noticed some faint yellowing on skin off to the side of the eyes, i'm light skinned but i don't burn easily so it's possible the yellowing may be from...natural skin tone fluctuation??\n\nAny thoughts? Opinions? Chastisement for not using sunscreen yet? I think i'm okay but there's a lot in there in terms of chemicals and what not that when i go look at it i think i need everything and surely that's not the case. it all confuses me sometimes and i get lost in the capitalism. I'm also not a makeup user. Don't drink, smoke, or do drugs that aren't birth control, vitamins, or for an illness.",
