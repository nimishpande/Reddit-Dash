      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI went to the dermatologist today because I wanted to start finasteride. I’ve been using minoxidil for over half a year now with good results. In the Netherlands minoxidil is available without a prescription, but finasteride isn’t.\n\nI intentionally waited to start finasteride because my partner and I had a desire to have children. Now that this is no longer a concern, I figured it was time to finally begin.\n\nHowever, the dermatologist refused to prescribe it. He said that very recent research (&lt;1 year old) showed worrying results regarding male breast cancer as a side effect. According to him, depression was still “manageable” because they could monitor that, but the breast-cancer findings caused him — and apparently the entire medical team in my region — to completely stop prescribing finasteride.\n\nHe also mentioned hearing at a conference about a finasteride topical lotion that includes 15% minoxidil, which he suggested as an alternative. That sounded like overkill to me and honestly made me question his knowledge a bit. He also said there was no difference between dutasteride and finasteride in terms of side effects or their frequency, which added to my doubts.\n\nObviously I assume a doctor should know more than someone like me who gathers info online, but the whole consultation left me feeling like he might not be fully informed on hair loss treatments.\n\nMy question to you all:\nHas anyone heard about this supposed recent study linking finasteride to increased male breast cancer risk? I can’t find anything about it anywhere.\n\nThanks in advance.",

I’ve had curly hair my entire life and have never learned how to properly take care of it.   \n  \nI’ve gone through phases of short hair (shown in photos), and I’ve found that my curls would naturally form and look decent (?) without too much work. As soon as my hair grows out enough to touch my shoulders, that goes to hell. Chaos ensues.  \n  \nI’ve decided to grow my hair out and I’m struggling to manage.  \n  \nI’ve included photos of when I attempt to do a curl routine, and also when I just let my hair naturally dry. You can see both do not look very good.  \n  \nI’m 99% sure that my hair is super thick and has very low porosity (it refuses to get wet and then takes literally forever to dry). I’ve tried curl products in the past and they usually just weigh everything down and make my hair greasy. Weirdly enough, when I use basic shampoo and conditioner, my hair actually looks better?\n\nI'm pretty sure my hair is *relatively* healthy. Like I don't think I have any heat damage or anything like that. I try my best to not overdo washing or brushing. \n\nI honestly haven't given too much thought on the products that I use. I just buy whatever looks good enough. I gave up trying to find products for my hair since they never worked and just made my hair worse. \n\n**Products + Routine**  \nRight now I’m using:  \n1. Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Shampoo  \n2. Dove Daily Moisture Damage Therapy Conditioner\n\n**When I try a curl routine, I use:**  \n1. CURLSMITH Curl Defining Styling Souffle Medium Hold\n\nI shampoo and condition as usual, and then I usually comb &amp; dry my hair a bit. Then, using the \"praying hands\" motion, I'll apply the gel to my hair while upside down. Then I let it airdry. My curls always end up sitting really weirdly and it looks awkward. \n\nI have three main questions:\n\n1. What should I change about my routine?   \n2. What specific (*preferably* budget) products do you recommend for my hair type?   \n3. What haircut should I get? What should I ask for? \n\nThank you!",

I was depressed, crying a lot (can't mention the reason here), barely eating, sometimes only once a day or not at all, drinking almost no water and sleeping maybe 3 hours a night. Most of the time i had trouble sleeping because of nightmares.\n\nA few years later I met my partner (we were LDR before), and my life improved a lot. I started eating and sleeping normally again and got way better. But the one thing that hasn't got better is dark circles around eyes. I still have dark circles that extend pretty far to the sides of my eyes don't even know what that area is called.\n\nNo one in my family has dark circles, so I'm pretty sure it's not genetic. I've also never smoked, drank alcohol, or used anything lile that till now. Any pics i take all have so much dark area around my eyes it makes me saddd\n\nMy question is: Can depression and all that i mentioned cause the area around the eyes to become hollow? And if so, is it possible for this to get better? All i do is facewash and face moisturizer that's all.",

      "content": "\nHubs and I are planning to start trying for a kid in January and my procrastination means I still haven’t started Tretinoin or used my red light mask. Turns out neither is allowed during pregnancy/breast feeding, so I probably won’t be able to start Tret until like 38-40, depending on whether or not we have another kid right after. I’m basically 36 now - birthday within a month. I’ve read that even BHA isn’t a sure bet for safety during baby making times. 🥲\n\nMy main improvement in my 30s skin care has been adding in peptide moisturizer and recently a peptide serum as well. (Drink Elephant Protini line) I have stumbled slightly on sunscreen but I’m fairly consistent and have been since my early 20s. My preferences on smell and texture have just changed.\n\nChanges in skin are hyperpigmentation and some dark spots under my chin from picking at these few random hairs I’ve been getting that drive me crazy. (I need to stop this, going to see a derm about it soon) My skin feels less oily than when I was younger, a bit less vibrant, and I feel like I see more texture under makeup. But I’ve also kind of unintentionally stopped using makeup mostly for the last few years so I think that could be a technique issue too. I have some no makeup pictures of my skin - no makeup.\n\nRoutine is cleanser, serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen. The specific products vary but my staples in these photos lately have been:\n- Tatcha rice wash cleanser \n- Glow Recipe Glow Drops\n- Fenty Watcha Ya Tone niacinamide serum\n- DE Protini Moisturizer \n- Supergoop sunscreens - mostly Unseen Sunscreen but shifting into the Mineral Unseen Sunscreen lately\n\nI think I have makeup on in the second picture. Possibly just mascara and brow gel/light pencil, but I may also have Fenty skin tint on. \n\nRarely exfoliate and probably need to do more of it more regularly \n\nWhat’s the best advice/routine suggestions for this period of life? Combination skin that gets lightly or mildly oily but not very oily.\n\n",
