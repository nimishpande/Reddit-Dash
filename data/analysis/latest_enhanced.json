      "content": "1st pic: shampoo + conditioner + air dried hair on a very good hair day. Air drying usually takes 2-3 hours which is strangely long for short hair with shaved sides and back.\n \n2nd pic: shampoo, conditioner, curl cream, diffused on medium heat medium intensity.\n\n3rd pic: I decided to add gel to the previous routine before diffusing, and what on earth did I just do? I tried to diffuse it, took me half an hour and it was still soggy in some places. It took me over 12 hours to air dry after that, then I scrunched it and it looked like this.\n\nBefore that (undocumented attempt) I tried using less gel and it did absolutely nothing except for make hair feel icky, no amount of scrunching helped.\n\nI applied gel the same way that I apply conditioner, kind of rake it through my hair with my fingers and then scrunch.\n\nProducts I use:\n\nShampoo: Redken All Soft Mega Curls, although I sometimes use Pirolam when my scalp condition flares up.\nConditioner: Novex Deep Conditioning Hair Mask (the instructions on the jar say it can be used as a conditioner, I tried keeping it on longer like a mask but there's no difference). I rake it through my hair and that's when I also use my fingers to gently detangle it (although it hardly ever gets tangled). Then I scrunch.\nCream: Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream,  applied to wet hair in the same way as conditioner.\n\nMonstrous gel: WS Academy Gel For Waves And Curls (Polish brand that's being marketed as kinda fancy). Applied in the same way as above.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the gel just has too much stuff in it and I would probably get better results with a simpler formulation. Or maybe I should ditch the curl cream and just try the gel alone. Honestly I'm losing my mind and feeling I'm throwing money into a black hole of pointless experimentation, please help me make the experimenting less pointless üòä\n\nBonus 4th pic: random cute pic of the \"protective\" topknot  I wear when cooking, painting, DIY, or when it's hot outside. I also sleep in it sometimes (the scrunchie is silk) . I generally do my best to sleep in a silk headscarf, it's life-changing because without it my head looks like an exploded pot of pasta on the next day.\n\nFun Fact: I also have a jar of Inebrya Ice Cream Keratin Restructuring Mask but it also does the opposite of what it's supposed to do, turns hair into straw. I guess my hair already has enough protein.",

I've tried a few things, this is my current best, and wow it's an improvement. I'm low-key shocked that my hair is this curly??\n\nI'm trying my best to take care of my hair while also navigating what's bullshit or just OTT. I also don't actually know if I like how this looks? I feel like it looks straggely? Am I just not used to it yet or am I right that it's not as fluffy natural hair looking as I would expect?\n\nThis is about 5 mins after finishing my *new* routine:\nShampoo (kerastase oily roots dry ends) just roots X2\nConditioner (just used tresemme this time but ordinarily kerastase colour protect) mids to ends, let sit 5 mins.\nOnce a month I skip conditioner and do k18 leave in conditioner (sometimes I do it more rarely, p.s. it says on the bottle to skip conditioner)\nI then added Umberto Giannini curl jelly raked through my hair and then scrunched and diffused (high heat, low speed)\nThat's it. I usually spray a little hair oil (nix?) on the ends but this curl jelly has made all my hair look almost too shiny? Is that just me?? So I skipped the oil this time.\n\nThat's it. I struggle with hygiene so this is about my max for how much effort I can put in. I use a detangler/tangle teaser rip off hairbrush. And I get my colour done professional by a colour specialist. \n\nDoes this look good and I need to just adjust or am I right that something I can't put my finger on looks off?\n\nAlso hair cut advice please! Bangs looked BAD on me, so maybe don't suggest that (also too much maintenance), I recently got a shag cut which I think I love! But any advice on a cut for my curl type and face shape would be much appreciated!!\n\nThanks so much!!",

This is my first time tracking my hair progress, and I decided to share it with you.\nI‚Äôm currently 24 . I first noticed I was balding at 22, but I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to it at the time. I‚Äôm not sure why . I visited a dermatologist, and she recommended minoxidil, saying I‚Äôd likely lose my hair anyway within five years.\n\nInstead of immediately addressing it, I decided to grow my hair long one last time and let it grow for a year. The first photo shows what my hair looked like during that time.\nHaving long hair made it easier to ignore the balding, but I noticed my hairline receding significantly. So, I spent two months researching extensively and finally decided to fully shave my head on June 30, 2025. I also started the following routine:\nFinasteride 1.25 mg/day\nKetoconazole 2% shampoo twice a week\nRosemary oil with a dermaroller once a week\nSupplements (biotin, zinc, magnesium)\nI haven‚Äôt experienced any shedding phase so far. Do you think this is good progress for almost four months, or does it look the same? If you have any advice about my routine, please tell me and thanks. ",

      "content": "After some intense **hormonal influctuations**, I started **breaking out** so bad for a couple of months. In a panic, I tried everything that were recommended by friends/family (worked for them!) Clinique's Salylic acid acne treatment (my skin was screaming and super irritated so I stopped), tried this organic mushroom serum (didn't do anything), and a bunch of other creams. My esthetician told me to stop everything, my skin didn't really improve from that either but at least it wasn't irritated.\n\nThen another esthetician recommended me to use **10% Azelaic Acid**, I did my research and found that Cos De Baha was the best but I only have **Naturium** available in my area. To my surprise,  after using it for probably 6 months I see massssssive improvements, next level! Not just fading my hyperpigmentation but also deep acne scars. It also makes my skin look dewy, plump, and evened out. The holy grail. I use it every night with **arencia holy hyssop serum**. My routine remains super basic. Just vit C serum then mineral Goop sunscreen in the AM and at night with a generic cleanser and the two i just mentioned.\n\n**For all of you, what‚Äôs the most challenging part about finding the right products for your skin? What works for others and was recommended to me, usually does not work at ALL. Like, where do you usually look, how do you decide if something works, and what do you do if it doesn‚Äôt? Also, do you stick to a routine, or do you change it up often? Feel free to share whatever comes to mind üòä** \n\n  \n\n\n",

Also lotion helped a ton.\n\nBut last couple days I've been getting like full body pins and needles, that won't go away till I scratch, but if I scratch, I break out in hives, which then itch even more. Lotion now isn't helping, only thing that has slightly calmed it is sitting in a cold bath for a good hour or two.\n\nI don't have insurance otherwise I'd have already been to a Dr. And tbh at this point I might go just to the walk in or er cause holy FUCK im losing it.

I finished school this year and since then I feel my skin dropping to darker shades.\n\nThe possible reasons might be that the only time I wash my face in the day is when I bath and that is around 2 to 3 pm.\n\nAnother one could be less sun exposure as I didn't join college this year and I study in my room only in front of laptop all day so maybe that.\n\nWhat could be the reason according to y'all and please tell me how to get back to normal It's not my obsession with light skin but I want the older shade back.\n\nThank you all please help",

I tried so many anti-aging products, serums with peptides, retinoids, you name it, but I never saw the results I was hoping for, and sometimes it just irritated my skin.\n\nAbout three months ago, I decided to really focus on hydration and gentle anti-aging instead of constantly switching products. I wanted to keep things simple, no harsh actives, just soothing, repairing, and plumping ingredients.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been using:\n\n* La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser  \n* The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 (morning)  \n* Dr. Dennis Gross C+ Collagen Brighten &amp; Firm Vitamin C Serum (PM)  \n* First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Hydrating Serum  \n* Paula‚Äôs Choice Omega+ Complex Moisturizer (AM/PM)  \n* Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream (for extra hydration at night)  \n* EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 (AM)  \n\nIt‚Äôs been about three months, and I‚Äôve noticed my skin feels so much more plump, smooth, and radiant. Fine lines are definitely less noticeable and my skin feels deeply hydrated and healthy. I tracked everything with an app, mainly for photos and routine logs. Helped a lot when my own eyes got used to my face lol. \n\nAnyone else tried layering vitamin C with hyaluronic acid or peptides for extra anti-aging?

They are not visible but can be felt if I touch my face. \nI have tons of whiteheads on my nose too :( \nAnd lastly I have dark circles but I genuinely don't wanna use eye creams as I heard they're mainly for adults (?). So can someone just clear my doubt if I can leave my dark circles alone or should do something about it.\nI have combination skin btw. \nAn imp note, I'll prefer affordable recommendations as my dependent self doesn't have tons of money. \n\nMy main concerns are : \ntanning - a sunscreen \ndullness - a good cleanser/face wash\nwhiteheads and bumps - a serum perhaps?\nmoisturizer \n",
