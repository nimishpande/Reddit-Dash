      "content": "Hi! I'm a 26 M and I just started using Anua's AA serum about a month and a half ago. Since then I noticed way more acne production (some cystic some regular) than before. I've been getting them mostly in the T zone (forehead and upper lip area) with the occasional ones on my upper cheekbones. This is where I would usually get acne before too. I'm wondering if this is just regular purging from using AA or if it's something else like a damaged skin barrier.\n\nMy routine has been:\n\nAM\n\n* Cleanse\n   * ROUND AROUND Comfort Green Tea Purifying Cleansing Foam\n* Shave\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Shaving Cleansing Foam\n* Treatment/Actives\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Toner\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Ampoule\n   * Anua 10% AA\n* Moisturize\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Sunscreen\n\nPM\n\n* Double cleanse\n   * Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil\n   * MEDI-PEEL Red Lacto Collagen Clear Cleanser\n* Treatment/Actives\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Toner\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Ampoule\n   * Paula's Choice 2% BHA (alternating days)\n   * Cerave Resurfacing Retinol Serum (alternating days)\n* Moisturize\n   * Round Lab Dokdo 1025 Lotion\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream\n\nMisc.\n\n* Try to change sheets and pillow cover every other week if not every week\n* Change out bath towel every few days\n* Separate towel for drying face\n\nAs you can tell I'm a big fan of Round Lab products üòÜ is there anything in my routine that sticks out as problematic? These breakouts really only began once I started using the AA product so I'm wondering if it's just purging and I should stick it out for longer but the acne only seems to be getting worse which is concerning... Should I focus on just cleansing and moisturizing for a week to let my skin recover and then try to reintroduce actives again?\n\nI've also been suspicious of my shaving routine since a lot of my breakouts seem to be happening in that area but that wouldn't explain the forehead stuff.\n\nWould love any insight/advice. Thanks!",

DO NOT DO IT, I DID IT SO YALL DONT HAVE TO.\n\nI‚Äôm starting to realize I didn‚Äôt even know what a real shed is I‚Äôm genuinely losing like 200 hairs a day now almost diffuse thinning. The worst part is my scalp environment has harshly shifted to extreme dandruff and inflammation. I‚Äôve been using selsun blue once a week which has helped a lot but I‚Äôm also hesitant to consistently use it because I hear it can cause hairloss. Not to mention the side effects from getting off of dutastride are INSANE I‚Äôve never had sides from any hairloss meds until getting of dut. Luckily I‚Äôm level headed because the depression, ED and brain fog are so real be careful with this stuff guys.\n\nSo now I must ask where to do from here? Do I gun it back to dutastride daily asap or slowly get back on it? Sorry for doubting the dutastride fan club it was always dutastride. Feel free to ask me any questions about switching. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I‚Äôm hoping to get some advice about my hair routine because I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm using the right products or if my routine needs to change. I started with separate products like the Mark Anthony Strictly Curls leave-in, curl cream, and mousse. Recently, I decided to try something new, so I bought the yellow Skala product to see if it would work better.\n\nMy hair type is 2C/3A and very long, but every routine I try ends up with frizz and barely lasts two days. All I want is definition and absolutely no volume. Here‚Äôs my current routine: I start by wetting my hair completely and brushing it through. I then separate my hair into sections. I start with the crown because I want it to stay gelled down. The two front pieces are separated into about three smaller sections each since that‚Äôs how I usually wear my hair. The back is separated into just two horizontal sections because it‚Äôs very heavy and hard to manage.\n\nFor each section, I apply the yellow Skala product and brush it out, then I add Eco Styler gel and use a bounce curl brush. I‚Äôve been thinking about maybe trying gel first, then mousse, then brushing, but I‚Äôm not sure if that would help. After finishing the front sections, I move to the back sections, which are harder to style and don‚Äôt hold curls well. Finally, I put my hair into a bonnet till I go out.\n\nDespite all of this, my hair always ends up frizzy, and the curls barely hold. I‚Äôm not sure what to do differently. Does anyone have suggestions for products, routines, or techniques for long 2C/3A hair that would give definition without adding volume? Any help would be really appreciated!",

Over the past year or so it has gotten flat, oily, and frizzy.\n\nI'm concerned I'm just taking care of my hair wrong and trying to treat it like thicker/fuller hair which is causing it to go flat. I went to a dermatologist to ask if it was something else and they just told me to start paying them (or buy their hair supplements /roll eyes ). I'm only 27 so not yet ready to start paying a subscription service for my hair, lol. Any tips are welcome!!\n\nRoutine: function of beauty wavy hair shampoo and conditioner, either their curl cream or mousse depending if I'm at home or not, and ouai hair oil just on the lengths of my hair (to try to combat the frizz). I use Maui Moisture Scalp Care Clarifying Shampoo irregularly, but occasionally. I wash it 2-3 times/wk (couple months ago increased this from every \\~4 days).

Current routine (super simple):\n\n‚Ä¢  AM:‚Äì Glytone Mild Cream Cleanser‚Äì Purito B5 Panthenol Re-Barrier Cream (started 3 days ago)\n\n‚Ä¢  PM:‚Äì Glytone Mild Cream Cleanser‚Äì Purito B5 Panthenol Re-Barrier Cream\n\nLifestyle changes: ‚Ä¢  Pantothenic acid (B5) to control oil(been taking this for like 3 weeks now) ‚Ä¢  1 gallon water/day ‚Ä¢  Eating more whole foods, less processed junk\n\nI know results take time, but the breakouts look angrier. Not sure if its hormonal. I have Oily skin, so I skipped moisturizer for years thinking it would make things worse‚Äînow trying this because I learned if you don‚Äôt moisturize oily skin it gets worse.\n\nhere are some close up pictures, Any gentle suggestions? Should I give the moisturizer more time? Patch test anything? Thanks",

I originally wanted to grow it out because short hair felt too normative for me?

I‚Äôm also worried about my hairline which has been receding. And also I worry I look a bit girly ? Which is fine generally but I‚Äôm not a huge fan of being mistaken for a girl and I‚Äôm already quite feminine looking.\n\nAny advice on whether I should would be appreciated. And if I should cut it, what sort of styles would actually suit me facially and work with my hair texture \n\n(Hair is roughly the same length in all pictures it just sits weirdly a lot of the time)",
