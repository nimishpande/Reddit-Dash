      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n**I'm a male in mind 20s.** I struggle with oily skin (especially on my nose) and persistent acne, which has left both old scars (red and brown) and ongoing redness on my cheeks and forehead. I also have pimples on my shoulders, upper back, and sometimes in the hair at the back of my neck.\n\nI mostly stay indoors, though I sometimes go out for work or errands. Currently, I don’t use any face washes or creams because I want a routine that’s affordable, simple, and doesn’t take too much time.\n\n**Photos:**\n\n\\- I’ll be sharing pics of both cheeks and my forehead (not my full face). The images are taken in bright light, but in indoor lighting the scars, marks, and tanning look more noticeable.\n\n**My goals:**\n\n* Reduce or remove red areas, dark spots, and pigmentation\n* Fade both old and newer acne scars\n* Prevent new breakouts (face, shoulders, neck)\n* Keep my routine basic and on a low budget\n\n**Extra info:**\n\n* Skin is oily, especially forehead and nose\n* New pimples appear less often now\n* Not sensitive, but avoid products that burn\n* Pimples also on shoulders, upper back, around neck/hairline\n* I have used benzoyl and tretinoin. Both works, but acne keep coming back. benzoyl did peel of skin, it's irritating, but I didn't monitor much, so don't know if it removed acne scars.\n\n**Product questions:**\n\n* I’m planning to buy the beminimalist Niacinamide 10% Face Serum (10ml to try first). Would it suit oily, acne-prone skin like mine? How should I use it, and how often?\n* And also thinking of buying a vitamin C serum for dark spots.\n* If you notice pigmentation or uneven tone in the images, which cream or serum should I use for that (and for tanning/dullness)?\n* I don’t want to go for brands or creams with a shady background or too much marketing hype. Please suggest genuinely good options.\n\n**What I need:**\n\n* Daily routine, max 2-3 steps (just cleanser, serum, moisturizer or SPF is ideal)\n* Affordable, India available options\n* Quick tips to reduce redness before events\n* **How to tackle pigmentation, dark spots, acne scars with budget products (if OTC works, or when to see a dermatologist)**\n* Suggestions for pigmentation/tan and dark spots (please mention 2-3 product options in different price ranges so I can pick based on my budget)\n\n**Thanks a lot for reading!**\n\nAny honest, practical advice, routines, or product suggestions are appreciated. I hope I’ve covered all details. Ask if you need more context.",

      "content": "Hi everyone, \n\nHope you are well! After a bad waxing incident 2ish years ago, I have since had dark spots and scarring marks on my upper thighs. I'm of south asian ethnicity, and my skin type is between 4 to 5 on the Fitzpatrick scale.I've tried a few treatments, but I'm looking for something that may be more effective. Another thing to note -- it seems like when I used to push out my ingrown hairs, a scar forms (bad habit, haven't really done it since).\n\nI talked to a derm a few months ago, and she said that waxing is no longer a viable option for me on my legs due to the scarring, so I should either switch over to shaving or laser. I'm currently doing laser treatments (third session is upcoming). \n\nI'm looking for advice on how to reduce my dark spots and hyperpigmentation. I have tried the following:\n\n\\* AmLactin for 8 weeks (did nothing) \n\n\\* Foliculitis medication (did nothing, was misdiagnosed earlier by my derm) \n\n\\* Naturium The Smoother Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Body Wash - 16.9 fl oz ( been doing for roughly 2 months, everyday, seems to have reduced dark spots slightly)\n\n\\* SkinMedica Even and Correct Brightening Treatment Pads - 60 Pads (did in summer for \\~3 weeks, every morning, was told to stop because of foliculitis medication, but restarted last week, a few weeks after finding out I was misdiagnosed -- doesn't seem to have done anything yet, may be too early to tell)\n\nAs for the rest, I usually moisturize myself with Aveeno Lavender body lotion right after I step out of the shower on my wet skin. I feel like it feels good on my upper body, but I'm wondering if I should be doing something else for my legs. \n\nI saw that Gold Bond Retinol Overnight Unscented Face and Body Lotion was recommended in this sub in a few threads, but I'm curious to know if there are other options I should consider and how effective it might be on medium-darker skin tones? \n\n  \nAnother note -- I had a habit of pushing up ingrown hairs, which often left a red-circular spot in the area it came out of (bad habit, mainly broke it), so I'm wondering if this may be an indication of a broken skin barrier? \n\n  \n**TL;DR:** Type 4-5 Skin. Looking for evening / night after-shower creams to fade hyperpigmentation and scarring marks from a bad waxing incident twoish years ago.   \n\n\nThank you! :) \n\n\n\n",

Please be kind. \n\nI wanted to ask for some advice on routines or products that could help reduce my keratosis pilaris on my arms and back. I’ve had KP since I was around 11–12 (currently 26) and honestly never paid much attention to it, but lately I’ve been wanting to know what smooth skin even feels like because I don’t think I’ve ever experienced that (at least not in my conscious memory). My skin tone on the arms are also a bit patchy and I am not sure why. \n\nI have attached from photos here, forgive my very weird angles I was trying to do this on my own. \n\nWhat I’m currently doing:\n-I use a regular body wash.\n-I exfoliate with a basic coffee scrub once or twice a week, been doing it for a while now, maybe a year? \n-I shower at night because I wake up way too late to do anything but run to work.\n-I’m not consistent with sunscreen on my arms since they’re usually covered.\n-I was gifted the Paula’s Choice salicylic acid body lotion (purple tube) and the small SA toner. I use them, but the lotion feels greasy on my skin. I live in a very humid climate so I sweat easily and it sometimes causes small pimples under clothing. You can see the scars of a couple in the later photos where I sort of scratched my arms. Before that, I wouldn’t get pimples on my arms often unless I use some sort of greasy/heavy lotion. \n-To moisturise I currently use a light Nacific AHA/BHA toner because I read people with sweaty/oily skin may benefit from that if lotions or moisturizers are making you sweat. \n\nI haven’t really explored much skin care for KP yet so that’s why I would like to request if y’all have some suggestions or what worked for you. \n\nCan you recommend any non-greasy and effective alternatives to SA/AHA lotions/bodywashes/whatever else is there for KP, or other ingredients I could try? Also open to routine suggestions. I don’t have access to a derm where I live currently. ",

I then usually let it air dry while I commute and once I get to work I 'shake it out' (don't know if there's a more technical term for it but just loosen everything with my hands and tussle around the scalp so it has some volume and isn't stuck flat down)\n\nHowever, I recently moved to a new country and leaving home with wet hair is giving me a cold in this weather so I am wondering if there is a diffuser dryer I could buy to use to dry it partly/wholly but I don't have the time or patience to do it for more than 5/10 minutes at most.\n\nMy hair is usually about this length, it's thin and not dense.\n\nThank you for your help!",

      "content": "Okay so, it wasn't until I was 15 that my hair began to curl out of nowhere. I'm 26 now and I still haven't figured out what is it that my hair needs. I have a LOT of hair, and it has different textures. It curls a lot at the neck and also the texture in that section is drastically different from the rest, frizzier and dryer. Then the top layers always want to curl after I wash it but they become very subtle waves by the next day. Here the hair feels frizzy but not as much as the neck. Lastly, the crown area and the layers in between refuse to curl (I'm guessing that my hair is too heavy).\n\nWhen it comes to my hair routine, I've tried a lot of things since I discovered the curly girl method. I used to be more experimental at first: no shampoo for months (very bad idea), plopping, trying shampoos without sulfates nor silicones, extending the days between washes... I definitely saw some results at some point but I came to the conclusion that it was all too much effort and nowadays I don't have the time to do all that. As of now, I wash my hair every 3-4 days and I mainly use shampoo and conditioner, nothing else. I never use any heat, I let my hair air dry and I remove the excess water with a tshirt instead of a normal towel. In between washes, refresh my hair with water and comb it with a wide comb. And most nights I braid my hair but I doubt that does much since my hair is layered and isn't long enough to stay in the braid (I also move a lot when I sleep), and I sleep with a silk pillowcase.\n\nOn top of that, I don't even know what's the porosity of my hair and if whether it's thin or thick (I just know I have a lot of it so I always thought I had what people call \"thick hair\"). I'm trying not to comb my hair so much which I find challenging bc I feel like I need to comb it. It does get tangled a lot tbf, more than it used to. And lastly, I feel like my hair rejects any styling product, if I use more than usual I gets this stiff texture and it just looks bar, but if I try to use the recommended amount it either makes my hair flat or it's as if I haven't used anything. I feel like the less I do to it the more it curls but then, said curls don't hold and my hair ends up looking like a frizzy mess. \n\nAnyways, I think that's all the information I can provide in order to receive some proper advice. Pleaseeee I'm quite literally desperate!!!! \n\n(The first two attached pictures are from last year when it curled more easily and was longer and the last two are from this year after I cut my hair quite short and tends to dry flatter)\n",

First 2 pics is closed comedones, last 2 are the acne they create. I tried tret twice: over a year ago (4 months, inconsistent) but noticed closed comedones all over my cheeks that I didn't have before. This year (6 months, consistent) but stopped 3 months ago, my already sensitive skin was always red and irritated, I couldn't handle it, got obsessive and started picking bad (ocd) my comedones never budged. More keep appearing, and the ones already there keep growing. 1-3× a month I get a big nodule, takes weeks to go down and leaves a really dark spot, sometimes they get a small head, look stupid red, and hurt, I give it a few days, pop it when it feels like it's gonna burst cause I figure it's better than on my pillow when I sleep, they don't come back, thick pus, sometimes lowkey smell like fish/wet cat food?? Not long ago I had 3 huge pimples that came from 3 comedones bugging me for over a YEAR (came from that red spot on my cheek in 1st pic won't stop being clogged and inflammed) I have a my 1st derm appointment in 2 months, if anyone has recommendations until then. Routine:\nMorning:\nUnscented dove bar \nGold bond pure moisture lotion \nNight: 2% SA cleanser up&amp;up \nSame lotion, sometimes vaseline",
