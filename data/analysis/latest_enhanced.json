      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Please ignore my face in them. I took these just to track my hair and never thought I’d be posting them 😬\n\nI only found out I had curly/semi-curly hair a couple months ago after literally years of blow-drying it straight. So I’m still figuring everything out and honestly I feel like half the time I have no clue what I’m doing. I get some decent results but it’s inconsistent and I know the routine probably needs work. I really like the look and I feel like it could be way better.\n\nHere’s my routine right now:\n\n**Right after shower (still dripping):**\n\n1. Quick rake-through\n2. Distilled water mist\n3. Light rake and shake for clumps\n4. SheaMoisture Curl and Shine spray\n5. Another light rake and shake\n6. 50/50 mix of Hairstory Hair Balm + OUAI Curl Cream\n7. Final rake and shake\n8. Scrunch\n\n*I do almost all the rake-and-shake/scrunching upside down so gravity helps the curls form.*\n\n**Drying:**\n\n* Diffuse about 80-90 percent dry, moving around to avoid overheating anything\n* Let the last little bit air dry\n\n**Finishing:**\n* Very gentle lift at the roots to break the cast without ruining the curls\n* Small amount of Based Styling Powder for volume/hold\n* Tiny bit of hairspray (Kenra 25 or 35)\n\n\n\nStuff I’m confused on and hoping for advice about:\n\n* Am I doing the rake and shake too early?\n* When should styling powder actually be used? Before scrunching, after, only when dry?\n* Does my product order make sense or am I mixing things wrong?\n* Any tips to get bigger clumps?\n* Better diffusing tips for hair that’s around 6-7 inches long?\n* Anything in the pics that jumps out as an obvious fix?\n* Any reference or inspo photos with similar hair is greatly appreciated  \n\nI appreciate any help. Just trying to go from “decent” to “actually good” and not screw this up lol",

It tends to be itchy half the time, and it’s inflamed and some look like there’s balls of blood underneath the surface of my skin. I’m not fully sure what the cause is, at first I thought it was my medication, but after I lowered the dosage, my acne still got worse. Could be my diet? Unsure. \nMy dermatologist canceled on me so I have to wait a whole month and I’m pretty upset about it. My face makes me insanely insecure and I’m not sure how to fix it. Googling just says this type of acne needs professional help. \nMy current routine is using 10% BPO Cerave day and night. Was using differin as well but I recently stopped a few days ago. Not sure if that was a good idea cause I can’t tell if it was helping or not. I also use the lightweight cerave daily moisturizer. I also saw that washing my face with a cleanser at night and then only rinsing with water in the mornings is good.\nA few years ago when I went to the dermatologist, they recommended me tretinoin and that seemed to work but eventually I ran out and didn’t need it after 2 years. Unfortunately my acne came back unexpectedly. Might go on that again but just wondering what steps can I do myself to better my acne cause I’m so tired and I get so insecure making eye contact with others cause of it.\n\nWhat can I do to clear this up? \nThank you!",

      "content": "\nokay this is gonna be a super long explanation-  i want to get to the bottom of this because ive tried so many things and i cant find a solution!!!!! my hair used to be way more curly than now, it has become SIGNIFICANTLY less curly and i really loved the curls and i want that texture back. im just going to go chronologically and explain how the texture has changed.\n\n- this is WAY BACK but just in case it has significance i wanted to mention it. when i was born up until i was like 5 by hair was very curly, big fat ringlets, curlier than any pictures shown here.\n- around 5 it slowly started to become more and more straight. my hair was super super straight with little to no waviness- straighter than any of these pictures!\n- at 12 i cut my hair very short (like \"boy hair cut\" short) and it became curly again! i had big fatttt ringlets every single day- when it grew to a stage where i could do pigtails, if i put them in while my hair was still a little damp, each pigtail would form a single perfect, fat ringlet. never used any product and wouldnt even scrunch it or anything!!\n- i continued to let it grow and got trims every once and a while, it was still really  really curly!!! (pics 1-4) never used ANY product, i let my hair air dry and would sometimes scrunch it but most of the time i would just let it be\n- i had colored hair for a while and i bleached all of my hair a SINGLE time and only did root touch ups about 2 times total. i only ever used conditioner based dyes when dying my hair. the damage caused it to become SLIGHTLY less curly, i had less ringlets than before, BUT it was still very curly and i really like how it looked at this point! (pics 5-8) never used ANY product, i let my hair air dry and would sometimes scrunch it but most of the time i would just let it be\n- i decided to get my hair cut short. this caused it to be way way way less curly and i still am so perplexed by why this happened because i thought my curls would thrive in short layers since they had previously??? (pic 9)\n- now im jumping like 2-3 years from then to now because i have just been struggling with trying everything i could to bring my curls back. when my hair is completely wet and i scrunch it with no product, it is decently curly, and getting my hair to stay that curly when it is dry would satisfy me even if its not as ideal as my old curl pattern (photos 10-11) \n- after my hair looks like it does in those photos, if i let it air dry it becomes mostly straight with a slight wave. if i dont use any product, but diffuse it, it does the same. if i use foam mousse and let it air dry, it is SLIGHTLY more wavy, but never super curly. if i use my foam mousse and plop it into a t shirt to dry, its a good bit more wavy. if i use the foam mousse and diffuse it, its wavy but curly in some spots, but never close to the amount of curl i used to have, and not even as curly as it is when i scrunch my wet hair now with no product. (photos 12-15)\n- i know this part might not be able to be helped, but i honestly really hate having to do any sort of hair routine because it takes a lot of time out of my day, and i have to wash my hair every other day because my roots get super oily super fast(yes i have tried training it or whatever, it hasnt worked, its just my genes that cause this.) when i do do more than just scrunching it with no product, i most often use mousse and plop my hair in a t shirt- i almost never have time for diffusing it. i dont understand how a routine is required to get my curls to show now, and it wasnt a few years ago. i really just want that back☹️ but if that's not possible, im open to other low maintenance recommendations \n\nother details that have a possibility of being relevant???:\n\n- ive tried a lot of other curl products aside from foam mousse, like curl creams, sprays leave in conditioners, etc, and nothing has worked as well as it\n- when i go on vacation by the ocean, my hair tends to be more curly, but i have tried sea salt spray and it does something but the effect isnt very significant \n- my hair responds horribly to gels and stuff like that- i think it's because it gets weighed down. even when it was at its most curly i tried gel a few times and it made it a lot less curly.\n- for all of the haircuts ive gotten since my hair stopped being curly, i have specifically asked for a layered haircut that would take weight off and engance my curls, ive been to a fee different hairdressers and idk if they are like not doing something that needs to be done, dont know how to help me, are doing as much as they can, or what??\n- im most successful with scrunching my hair when it is dripping wet. i scrunch it until it stops dripping and then scrunch it once lightly with a t shirt. if my hair is damp and not wet, it does not curl a lot when i scrunch it.\n- i have tried to look for hairdressers that have good reviews about curly hair specifically, but they are really hard for me to find in the area and even those ones have resulted the same. i dont have the money to be paying someone who specializes in curly hair because theyre always like 50+ dollars over what i am comfortable spending\n- the mousse that has worked for me is the pattern brands foam mousse\n\nthis is all i can think of, i hope someone out there can help me because ive been struggling to figure this out for SO LONG..",

Since I only have access to a limited number of options, I figured asking here might help in my search.\n\nI’m especially touch-sensitive, and the feeling of oil on my skin—whether it’s lotion, sunscreen, concealer, or otherwise—drives me up a wall. I genuinely can’t stand it. This wouldn’t be such a big issue if I didn’t work in the marine science field, but because I do, finding a sunscreen that works for me is critical. I work long hours in the sun and in wet environments, so wearing sunscreen is necessary for safety.\n\nI’ve considered powder sunscreen in the past, but since I’m in frequent contact with water, I’m unsure how effective it would be. It would likely wash off and be impossible to reapply while wet. On top of that, it’s pretty expensive for the amount you get, and I need close to full-body coverage since I work in a fishing shirt and shorts. I’ve also used a number of “dry touch” and “non-greasy” sunscreens from big box stores, but I haven’t found a single one that lives up to their claims. \n\nIf possible, I’d also like to find one that’s reef-safe since many of the chemicals in sunscreen are really bad for aquatic life, but I’d take something that won’t trigger my touch-sensitivity, since I’d be less likely to just not apply it.",

      "content": "Hi y’all! I was going through my products for my end of the year what worked and what didn’t work. I have some faithfuls that just get better every year and some new things I’ve been loving! Here is the list: \n\nOld faithfuls: \nPaul Mitchell Skinny Serum: new look but just as good! This makes me hair so shiny and smooth and smells like watermelon lip smackers 👄 🍉 \n\nPhisoderm: introduced to me by my mother, really helped cleared cystic acne on my back 🫧 \n\nHair,Skin, and Nails Heart and Soil Supplements: THIS! basically helped me get rid of all my hormonal and fungal cystic acne. I didn’t take the full dosage about 3 instead of 6 capsules and omg, I really dedicate this to helping my skin. I only took this and washed my face with a simple non irritate cleanser for 3 months. I would really recommend this if you’ve tried everything or want to avoid Accutane. 💅🏼 \n\n Prequel: kinda still, been solid in this for a little over a year or so. But their gleanser facial cleanser is a big win and I love their moisturizer, filled with lots of good stuff. I’ve also heard they have good sunscreen but cannot testify to that. 🧼 \n\nLa Roche Posay: any of their sunscreens, great stuff ☀️\n\nHomemade Hairmask: I stand by this! It’s weird but I stand by it… equal portions coconut oil, olive oil, Avacado oil, and YES beef tallow (cooking kind, don’t get the crappy cheap stuff), then add rosemary oil maybe a teaspoon not too much. I sometimes will leave it on over night or at least 15 minutes. I love it, I will never stop using it. It makes my hair so shiny, soft, and strong. 👩🏽\n\nNew Faves: \nAfrican Sponge Net: just started using this recently but this gets every inch of your body! The first time I used it, I had my whole body squeaky clean in 5 minutes. I didn’t know what to do with myself. And the SUDS, a little goes a long way with this bad boy. No more twisting and turning the get spots on your back. Def would recommend, I got two on Amazon for  $8! Worth a shot!  🧽 \n\nNon-Tox Perfume: DIME, 7 summers. \nnot 110% if it’s non toxic or not but it was recommended to me and I loved the smell so much I didn’t care. Very citrus, floral?, definitely some vanilla. I have some men in my life that cannot stand some smells and every single one of them complimented and said it was a very nice and subtle scent that didn’t take over so I’d say that’s a win. 👃🏻 \n\nMouth Tape: I have been great restful night sleep with this. I feel like it almost forces my body to shut down in a way, in a calming effect. I haven’t been waking up as groggy and I’ve noticed since using it for the past 8 months, I haven’t had a sore throat or sniffles in the morning, I probably snore and never knew it. 👄 \n\nMorning Workouts: physical health is beauty! I’ve always worked out after worked but half assed it but now in the mornings I’ll work out and I get such a good pump and I feel more focused throughout the day. This has also helped me so much mentally as well, I start my day on a good note instead of taking my frustrations out on something that is beneficial to me. 💪🏽 🧠 \n\nLoop Earbuds: very cheap option for those who need quiet when they work or want to protect their ears at concerts. I really have been enjoying them and they fit so effortlessly in my ears. 👂🏼 \n\nComment some of yalls faves, I’m always open to trying new products! ",
