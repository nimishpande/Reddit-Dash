      "content": "Hi all!\n\nAustralian, 31 (now) year old! Was sick of being scared of the wind, rain, sweat and mirrors. I was unfortunate enough to have a big head, look hideous bald and \"just shave it\" didn't seem like an option i wanted to take!\n\nDecided to go down the Transplant route! Transplant done in Turkey at HLC in Ankara in October 2022! Piggybacked off a Europe trip i was already going on! The Transplant itself came to about $10k Aud back in Oct 2022. Cant remember how many grafts they did, but it was a lot.\n\nWent through the lot. The transplant, the sleeping upright, the swollen face, the long haul flights, the ugly duckling stage, the regrowth and then the full head of hair!\n\n1st photo: October 2020 (I was 26 years old)\n\n2nd photo: December 2020\n\n3rd-6th photo: October 2022 (Taken at HLC)\n\n7th-8th photo: July 2023\n\n9th-10th photo: February 2024\n\n11th photo: December 2025! Got engaged!\n\nWas taking minoxidil (1ml 5% topical) before the transplant for about 2 years though was not taking finasteride. Started taking finasteride 3 months before transplant and have been taking since. Finasteride: 1mg daily. \n\nHonestly the best decision of my life (until the engagement of course). I only wear hats now for their intended use, sun safety. Otherwise its flowing free.\n\nThat being said, thinking of everyone going through the hair loss shit daily! I know how it feels, and i know its shit.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions!",

      "content": "hey guys! i’m from sri lanka 🇱🇰 and 2024 September I discovered a 3rd-party seller who brings indian skincare here… and yeah, my skin AND bank account have not recovered since lol\n\nbefore that, i suddenly started getting major breakouts (pic 1). this was super frustrating because i had clear skin my entire life. so like many people here, i decided to self-prescribe 🙃\n\ni started tret 0.025% (cream only available here) and imported:\n\n* simple moisturiser cream\n* plum niacinamide toner\n* dot &amp; key sunscreen\n* TO niacinamide 10%\n\nfollowed this routine for 7-8 months with absolutely no improvement. tret irritated my skin SO badly but i kept telling myself to “trust the process” 😭  \n*(pics 2–3 are from this phase)*\n\neventually i gave up and saw a derm(in 2025 May). i was prescribed:\n\n* deriva-c gel (adapalene + clindamycin) – pm\n* aknix face wash\n* clindamycin gel – am\n* azithromycin 500 mg (3x/week)\n\ni swapped the face wash for minimalist SA cleanser because aknix was crazy expensive (\\~₹2400). this routine helped calm down my inflamed, angry acne (pic 4/5), but i was left with a face FULL of closed comedones and Acne marks.\n\nhonestly? i was just relieved. i accepted the bumpy texture because it was WAY better than the war zone i had before💀. so I sticked to that routine for about 5 months.\n\nthen i came across a post here about tazarotene and decided to give it a shot. amazon india only had 0.1%, so i went all in. I started taz in late October.\n\nand listen… this stuff is MAGICAL.  \ndespite being the *strongest retinoid* i’ve ever used, it has never irritated my skin. no burning, no peeling, nothing. within 1.5 months, i had the smoothest skin of my life. i still can’t believe how gentle yet effective it is for me.\n\ncurrent routine:\n\nam:\n\n* Minimalist SA cleanser\n* isntree green tea fresh toner\n* cosrx snail mucin\n* aquasoft ac moisturiser\n* Picspot gel\n* sundrink sunscreen\n\npm:\n\n* garnier micellar water\n* joy pH 5.5 face wash\n\ntaz days (mon/tue/wed/fri/sun):\n\n* aestura lotion *or* minimalist b12 cream\n* taz\n\nthursday (barrier day):\n\n* aestura lotion\n* b4 nappi cream\n\nsaturday:\n\n* formularx lactic acid\n* aquasoft ac\n\ntaz literally did what tret never could for me. if you’re struggling with closed comedones, texture, or tret intolerance, this might be worth looking into.",

After that I section my hair and brush style with the bounce curl brush. When I’m done with that I use not your mother’s gel and finally marc Anthony strictly curls mousse. I usually air dry my hair but I did diffuse it in the routine for these pics !!\n\nIs there anything I can do at all??🤧",

Nothing fancy. I've been doing this routine for over a decade. When I was a teenager, I made a mistake of getting my hair cut short and have been growing it out since, with trims in-between. Nothing against people with shorter hair, it just wasn't for me and I missed my long hair I had as a kid so I decided to regrow it.\n\nLong story short, I had to get hospital tests and was monitored for several days, basically bedridden. They also had to use medical glue on my scalp to connect cords and monitor brain activity. After everything, I was left with a HUGE matt in my hair. Two local salons turned me down. Then I went to a local beauty school which helped reduce the size of my matted hair ball but they couldn't get it out completely. The professor told me her students did their best, and I appreciated it so much. So the question is, what now? The picture on the right is after they reduced the size of the matted ball. Left side is what my hair usually looks like. It's at the end of my hair but all balled up which is why my hair looks a lot shorter than it actually is.",

      "title": "2 months | 30M | Topical finasteride/minoxidil",
      "content": "Hello Tressless. Long time reader, first time poster. \n\n**TL;DR:** If you struggled with oral finasteride side effects and are considering topical, I’d recommend taking a shot. (Consult your doctor too). \n\nWanted to share my experience with Topical finasteride/minoxidil spray. Mainly sharing because my hair has been somewhat of a point of sadness for me over the past 2-3 years. I was especially sad when I reacted poorly to the oral finasteride, showed no gains on topical minoxidil and as result felt hopeless to my genetic fate. So, as I think I’ve now found something that works for me, when all hope was lost - it felt only right to share in case others are in a similar situation. Happy to answer all and any questions. \n\nSee pictures attached, taken approximately 2 months apart. My hair loss has always been worse on one-side (barely noticeable on the other). There has been marginal recession, mainly just density loss on this side - however I’ve noticed my hairline also progress slightly forward. By no means the finished article, but happy with the short-term results and excited for what the future holds. \n\nOnly regret is that I didn’t start sooner when I was in denial at around age 28. \n\n**Side effects:** \n\n1. Slight libido loss for around the first month and it has since returned to normal in the last couple of weeks. \n\n2. No other sides. \n\n**Questions:** \n\n1. How would you rate my progress? \n\n2. Admittedly, I am a bit confused by my gains. I read somewhere that hair progress works in 3-month cycles. How is it possible to have noticeable hair growth in 2 months? \n\n3. Has anyone else suffered with hair loss on just one side? I assume it’s because it’s the side I sleep on but it’s always been thinner on that side so could just be a natural density thing. \n\n**Topical solution ingredients:** \n\n1. 0.1% finasteride \n\n2. 7.5% minoxidil \n\n3. Melatonin \n\n4. Caffeine \n\n5. Fluocinolone acetonide\n\nHappy to share details of where I get my topical for those interested. \n\n**Important points of context:** \n\n1. First noticed hair loss at around age 26. Had a very bad case of Telogen Effluvium after getting fairly sick from Covid. Hair density returned to 85% pre-Covid and then gradually declined (likely from MPB and not TE). \n\n2. I took 0.5mg oral finasteride every second day for approx 2 months last year (started around Mar ‘25) and experienced pretty bad sexual side effects. Quickly stopped. \n\n3. I was using minoxidil 5% for almost 9 months (started Jan ‘25) without any results before switching to the topical finasteride/minoxidil. I think the tretinoin/minoxidl in the new solution definitely helped gains.\n\n4. I have also made some slight gains on the crown however this was not bad to begin with (didn’t take pics).\n\n5.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "I have had acne my whole life and am seeking guidance. I got my period at 11 and began developing severe acne by age 12. Between the ages of 12 and 16, I was prescribed multiple acne treatments, both oral and topical, including doxycycline, tetracycline, tactupump, and tretinoin, though these are only the ones I can clearly remember.\n\nAt 17, I was referred to a dermatologist and began a full course of Accutane, which consisted of approximately 2.5 months at 20 mg, 2.5 months at 40 mg, and 3 months at 50 mg. While Accutane ultimately cleared my skin, it came with significant side effects—I previously had 20/20 vision, but Accutane blurred my vision, and it also caused my periods to become unbearably painful for the duration of treatment. Despite this, I completed the full course.\n\nMy skin remained clear afterward, but at 19, in 2023, I began experiencing mild breakouts and was prescribed Winlevi and tretinoin; both caused me to break out, and although I understand topicals often lead to purge periods, after having had great clear post-accutane skin, and after having endured horrible side effects because of accutane, I freaked out and stopped using the topicals. Eventually, my skin cleared on its own, and my breakouts remained minimal, so I moved on.\n\nIn April 2025, at age 21, during a very stressful academic period, my skin began breaking out severely again, and unlike previous flare-ups, it did not resolve on its own. From April onward, I have been breaking out consistently every month without fail. Considering the breakout occurred post-accutane and was triggered by stress, I know my acne is mostly hormonal.\n\nSo, today, January 2026, I visited my dermatologist. She said she wouldn't recommend spironactone because it takes too long to kick in, it is not worth the irregular periods, and i'd have to be on it for a long time. She said she wouldn't recommend accutane because it had bad side effects for me before. So, she prescribed me **Cabtreo** (she also prescribed Akleif and Differin, saying I could test them out and choose one of the three, but ultimately said Cabtreo seems best for my case.)\n\nI’ve dealt with acne my whole life. At this point, I’ve given up. If anyone who has had a similar experience, or has used Cabtreo, has any words of wisdom for me, I would appreciate literally anything.",

AND NOT ONCE I QUESTIONED MY \"ROUTINES\". \n\nthe desperate phase: i tried everything wasting money time and mental peace. my BF lives in US i visit him sometimes and even bought products and serums not available in India just to fix my skin. nothing helped. i even went to docs and did two courses of tretonin (helped for few months but problems recurred) i have lived in north and south india switching jobs and no amount of \"environment change\" fixed my skin suffered for 4 straight years. \n\nthen i just stopped and thats why i am sharing this may be it will help someone. i just stopped all products. i started reading more about skin barrier and how serums exfoliate and over exfoliation destroys skin barrier. i just stopped everything and only started applying basic moisturiser but with extreme dedication applied sunscreen. \n\ni invested in good sunscreens. i had never applied sunscreens so much. always found them greasy would apply only when i am going to office. and never reapplied after few hours even when i am out in blazing sun. but then i started ordering sunscreens korean and others wasted money used the ones i didnt like on my body but finally landed on a a good one. \n\nand man oh man did it work. i religiously apply the sunscreen twice in a day, use most basic moisturiser and use most gentle face wash. its only been 2 months but my skin is so much clearer my marks r fading i am having less and less of acne (barely any) i can feel the hydration returning to my face. and i am so happy. \n\nskin care companies just bombard us with their products thanks to unregulated social media giving us \"advice\" how to live our own lives and cloud our own judgement and intution. skin care routine type content is a cult. we dont need much at all. i completely destroyed my god given healthy skin. \n\ni never post on reddit but i understand the feeling of seeing new pimples and having lots on ur face and the stress of nothing working. i hope someone reads this and it helps someone. \n\nPS since Reddit sells its content to AI companies now i can help train the AI models to stop prescribing acids after acids and just prescribe basic skin hygiene and care routines lol",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice from people who’ve successfully used 15% azelaic acid, especially if you have dry or sensitive skin.\n\nI’m 28F with very dry and acne-prone skin. Recently, I’ve developed mild melasma and rosacea on my cheeks, so I introduced AzA into my routine. I started with Naturium 10% AzA and my skin tolerated it very well but had to stop using it as I’m not able to get it anymore. So I decided to give a prescription strength ago and started Finacea about three weeks ago.\n\nI’ve been extremely cautious with it: Week 1: applied once Week 2: applied twice Week 3: applied three times so far\n\nI always apply it on top of a hydrating serum and moisturizer, never on bare skin, because I know my skin can’t handle that yet.\n\nEven with this slow approach, I’m still getting a lot of stinging, itching, and dryness after application. I know some stinging is normal, but my skin now feels generally sensitive throughout the day, especially around my mouth and chin. The first couple of weeks felt manageable, but lately I’ve noticed tiny bumps / small breakouts, and my skin just feels irritated overall. It doesn’t really look inflamed, but it feels irritated — especially when I apply sunscreen, which now stings around the chin and mouth.\n\nWhat’s confusing is that I’m not even using it daily and I’m buffering it with moisturizer, yet my skin seems to be getting more reactive rather than adjusting. I’d really prefer not to stop using it as I did have good results with AzA and since it’s so often recommended for melasma, rosacea, hyperpigmentation, and acne.\n\nFor those with dry or sensitive skin, how did you make Finacea work for you?\n\nDid you start even slower? Use a smaller amount? Apply it after waiting between layers? Or take breaks to protect your skin barrier?\n\nAny tips or personal experiences would be really appreciated. Thanks so much 😊",

It’s hard to feel confident and having just transferred schools it’s important for me to feel comfortable so I can meet new people and settle in.\n\nMy main issues are some general acne (especially on my forehead and cheeks), blackheads on my nose, and visually aging (skin looks less bright if that makes sense). I have a beard that I need to keep, I have some acne under there but of course it’s not super visible.\n\nI don’t understand how I’m getting acne though. I’m very hygienic, I cleanse 1-2 times a day with 4% benzoyl peroxide, use a light chemical exfoliant a few times a week, and use some nice moisturizer. I wash my beard more than twice a day. I shower once or twice a day.\n\n \n\nPlease let me know if you have any advice, it would be a huge help. Feel free to ask me to elaborate on anything as well!",
