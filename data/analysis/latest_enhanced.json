      "content": "I was SHOCKED to learn this, but apparently the Ordinary has a new product (not yet available for purchase): Volufiline 92% + Pal-Isoleucine 1% (link [here](https://theordinary.com/en-us/volufiline-92-pal-isoleucine-1pct-plumping-serum-100724.html))\n\nNow, normally I would think this is some sort of April 1st trolling, because a smart skincare nerd amongst us put in some rigorous research and detailed exactly why volufiline seems like a BAD IDEA to put around your hollow tear troughs (post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1gz3h4x/i_think_volufiline_is_a_dropshipping_scam_research/)).\n\nFor context: People claimed Volufiline is a topical that can increase plumpness/volume/hollows in hollow tear troughs. By hollow tear troughs, I am referring to actual volume-deficient deepset hollows (aka the hereditary stuff south asians like myself have). I am not referring to eye bags. I am not referring to eye puffiness.\n\nFriends, has there been any research or update on the safety or efficacy of Volufiline use right over the eyelids? I don't know about you, but any eye serum I use is placed all over my eyelids, all the way up to the lashline because of my severe hereditary volume deficiency and the fact that I have super thin skin in my undereyes that results in tissue-darkening/show through)\n\nOr is the ordinary jeopardizing our safety now and selling snake oil?\n\n  \n",

Keeping length is really important to me as my curls are so tight, it takes a while to get any length. I feel like the hair dresser took off more than needed and my hair is shorter than when I first had it cut 6 months ago. \nI've uploaded two videos for reference, sorry if they're not that good, I barely take photos or videos 😭  the one posted is the current cut. I feel like it's very short and round. I'll post the other vid in the comments. It was from last week.

Conditioner is Aussie curly conditioner, perfect and lightweight for my hair.\n\nI do all of my styling routine with my head upside down. Starting with the Noughty Curl spray on hair that is dripping but not smoking wet. I brush that through and then cup and scrunch with my hands, and then again with a microfiber towel. Then the Bed Head Foxy Curls Mousse, I usually do a blob with about 2 inch diameter. I have alot of hair but the strands are thin. Then the Noughty Jelly, just a bit distrubuted over my hair as thin and even as possible. Then the heat protection and after that I diffuse, usually takes me around 30mins for complete dry hair on low heat and low speed. I hover diffuse and then cup diffuse.\n\nIm really pleased with my hair and I think I finally have my perfect product match up for my hair 😁",

I know looks aren’t everything, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m aging in fast forward while everyone else gets to look young a little longer. The vanity part stings, but honestly the confidence hit is worse\n\nDating apps made it very clear how much people care about hair. My matches dropped like 90% as soon as it started thinning. It’s depressing to realize how quickly you become “less attractive” over something you can’t control.\n\nI play battlefield with friends most nights and even in the chat, jokes get tossed around about my hairline like it’s just harmless fun. Maybe for them it is. For me it’s a constant reminder.\n\nSo I’m asking guys who’ve been through this:  \nDo I just shave it and move on?  \nDoes confidence really make that much of a difference?  \nHow do you accept a change you never wanted?\n\nI don’t want to feel embarrassed about something that’s just genetics but right now I do.",

      "content": "Hello! I’m here looking for advice on what products I should use to help clear my back. For some background: I was on Accutane a few years ago for 8 months which cleared the acne on my face (and has remained clear) and back, but recently I feel like I’ve been starting to breakout on my back again. I also have dark spots that seem a bit difficult to get rid of (not sure if they’re acne scars?) I also have tiny white spots on my back which I think could be KP, since I do have KP on my arms as well, although they’re more red/skin-tone color on my arms. In the shower I always rinse my conditioner out before washing my body and I don’t let any of my hair/hair products touch my back until I have a shirt on. The products I’m currently using are: Naturium “The Perfector Salicylic Acid Body Wash,” and then after the shower Naturium “Salacylic Acid Body Spray 2%,” and then I alternate between using Naturium’s “The Glow Getter Multi-Oil Body Butter,” and Miami Beach Bum’s “Bum + Body Cream Mint.” On days I use the Beach Bum lotion, I don’t use The salicylic acid body spray. Any information/input would help. Would love to find a solution now so I can feel confident with tops I wear during the summer. Thanks!",

Prone to comedones.\n\nSkin care Routine:\nAM: \n1. Simple Refreshing Facewash\n2. Reequil Ultra Matte Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n1. Garnier Micellar Water\n2a. Simple Refreshing Facewash\n2b. Minimalist 2% SA cleanser which I mix with Simple Cleanser on Sundays and Thursdays.\n3. Minimalist Tranexamic Acid Serum that I use on days I don't use SA Cleanser. \n4. Simple Hydrating Moisturiser mixed with pure aloe vera gel.\n5. Reequil 0.1% Retinol which I'm currently not using but planning on reintroducing on days without actives after my skin adjusts to the current routine.\n\nSunscreens I've used before:\n1. Lakme a canon event 😭\n2. Dot &amp; Key pink - not good fliters\n3. Dr Sheth - not good filters again\n4. Deconstruct gel sunscreen - liked the texture and matte finish but they changed the formulation and it started pilling\n5. Minimalist fluid sunscreen - really good protection as per this sub but looks really oily on my skin, for this weather, makes it look very dull and oily (would work out well for people in dry weather), stings my eyes.\nI don't prefer sunscreen that has a very dewy effect.\n\n6. Current - Reequil ultra matte sunscreen, I like this sunscreen, primer like texture, doesn't make my skin look greasy, doesn't sting, good protection, claims to be water resistant,  does break me out if I don't cleanse my skin well.\nI started reading from this sub that few people started experiencing darkening skintone and white dry patches, I did not notice much in my skin but I did feel like my skintone had changed slightly, not sure if it's tanning or the product or if I didn't apply it well. And I also read that this is a common issue with any silicone based sunscreen.\nI still like this sunscreen but wondering if it's good enough.\n\nI was looking at \n1. BOJ Aqua one - but many claimed it's not worth as they wouldn't spend that much on a sunscreen that is not water resistant.\n\n2. UV Doux - really hyped in this sub, but it is also a silicone based sunscreen, and I fear it is same as Reequil.\n\nWhat's your thoughts about this??\nSorry for the long post, I do yap a lot.",

      "content": "I've recently been getting more into makeup and skincare and have since been thinking I should probably look into what skincare products I'm using. \n\nI have combination to oily skin that's prone to drying out when I agitate my skin too much (by regularly wearing foundation, removing makeup, etc) creating some rough dry spots. I always have quite a bit of redness on my cheeks, chin and forehead, which temporarily gets worse when rubbing over it, for example when washing my face or applying products. My skin is very sensitive, which causes a lot of products to sting a bit. The more often I use makeup, the more products will sting, even the ones that are usually fine.\n\nThe past few years I have been washing my face with La Roche-Posay effaclar purifying foaming gel, followed by LRP effaclar H iso-biome and Isdin fusion water magic SPF50. This does often leave most of my face feeling very greasy, except for my cheeks which often feel very dry (this is also where the worst of my redness and irritation usually is).\n\nIf I wear makeup I usually remove waterproof makeup with Louis Widmer waterproof eye makeup remover by soaking a cotton pad in it and gently holding it on my eyes for at least a minute to soften my mascara before carefully wiping it off. Then I usually wash my face with my effaclar foaming gel, and afterwards I go back in with a micellar water to remove any remaining makeup. Once my face is clean I apply my effaclar H iso-biome again and Louis Widmer proderm eye contour cream. The least bit my skin is irritated will make the eye cream sting a bit though.\n\nNow that I've been playing around with makeup a lot my skin is super red and irritated, to the point that I can feel the inflamation on the top of my cheeks even hours after my skincare routine. I never fully thought that much about the redness and sensitivity on my face until my recent search for a great foundation shade. I now realize it's not normal for skin to look this red and be this irritated and inflamed, so I now would like to combat this. \n\nI'm pretty inexperienced with skincare in general, so any tips on how to improve my skincare routine are more than welcome! I'm also looking for suggestions on skincare products that might be better suited for me than the ones I currently use, and any ideas on a good color corrector to make my face less red while wearing makeup are greatly appreciated as well!",

      "content": "So I straightened my hair last week and decided to wash it yesterday since it’s been a week, when I washed it I took a while for it to fully get curly which I expected since every time i straighten it it takes like 2 days to fully revert back. My routine before I washed it I made a flaxseed hair mask at home and applied it with a heat cap on since I have low porosity hair, then I shampooed and that’s it. I have to admit that the salon didnt apply heat protectant before blow drying it. Today I did a hot oil treatment and reshampooed. So now I’m devastated cuz my hair which is usually 3B/3C and very very curly at the bottom literally struggles to curl now a lot  parts look straight and now my whole hair looks like it’s 2a/2c with ends that barely curl. I actually crashed out at this can anyone pls give me a solution im panicking !!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
