      "content": "I’m reaching out for some advice. Lately, I’ve noticed that my hair isn’t curling as well as it used to, even though I’m using the same products and have the same routine (gel or foam). I go to a hairdresser who specializes in curly hair.\n\nNow I’m confused because I’m not sure whether my hair just doesn’t curl the same way anymore, or if it’s simply too long (although I’ve had long hair before, and it used to curl better) or it’s not cut correctly. \n\nI’ve always had the issue that the bottom layer of my hair hardly curls at all – it’s more wavy than curly. When I get a layered haircut, that bottom part tends to stick out, making the difference between the curly and wavy sections even more noticeable. This is why I don't like very layered cuts. When my hair is shorter, the curls are more defined, but the bottom layer still stays wavier.\n\nI don’t know what would be best – to change my hairdresser, cut my hair shorter, change my routine or just accept that my hair doesn’t curl the way it used to or something else?\n\nEdit: my routine: I change shampoo and conditioner a lot, I brush my hair in the shower and then apply Tootilab Styling gel and then in between drying it with a diffuser a spray PoulMitchell Sculpting Spray. As somebody mentioned - I indeed started with new medication (oral contraceptive) two years ago. I was also thinking this could be a reason why my hair curls less (when I was a kid I had completely straight hair, they started curlying in puberty- so maybe hormonal changes does affect my hair a lot).

Should I change my skincare routine?\n\nI’m at my wits end!!\n\nContext:\n\n-15+ years dealing w acne -Haven’t used harsh actives for years -3 accutane courses. Worked wonders but acne always came back although not as severe. Last course was micro dose long term. I had to stop last December bc my mucosals/glands were destroyed (still are…) -Trying to work on the “root cause” but I don’t find practitioners I can work with from Europe -My skin was always dehydrated but now is just SO DRY no matter what I do (my whole body is in and out. Trying to fix it but nothing working) -Skin feels dry and sometimes tingly/itchy/reactive on random spots. Since I was a kid I flush easily but no extreme reactions to food or weather… -I don’t touch my face (neither does my hair), change pillow cases often, eat really clean (no gluten/dairy etc), and don’t wear makeup. -Skincare routine: AM: water wash, purito oat moisturizer PM: haruharu rice cleanser, anua azelaic acid 10% on alternate nights, purito oat moisturizer.\n\nDesperate at this point, not being able to have the accutane option anymore is after all these years one of my personal fears…\n\nI figured as my acne is not so severe anymore I could try a derm again (after so many years I don’t trust derms to do anything other than throw spironolactone or accutane at me -which I can’t have). Buuut had an appointment w this extremely expensive “acne guru derm” which surprise recommended spironolactone (even before asking about my hormones?). Also she’s also a rosacea specialist and… surprise she said I had rosacea (a first for me) and she could see(???) the mites. With the naked eye. No coming close to my face no nothing. What?\n\nI did not trust that but now I’m wondering about rosacea. I have some redness but I also wonder whether my skin barrier is not ok? Specially if the rest of my mucosals/glands aren’t and I seem to be DRY.\n\nObviously I understand the internet cannot diagnose me and I will keep trying. Just want unbiased opinions as derms seem to be increasingly clueless and subjective.\n\nCould it be a broken skin barrier? my skincare routine? Rosacea?\n\nAre there any skincare recommendations (or non skincare) that you believe might help my case? Should I try actives? Will they make it worse? YMMV obviously…\n\nAny feedback or comment or just consideration is extremely appreciated at this point 🥺🥺🥺",

Should I change my skincare routine?\n\nI’m at my wits end!!\n\nContext:\n\n-15+ years dealing w acne -Haven’t used harsh actives for years -3 accutane courses. Worked wonders but acne always came back although not as severe. Last course was micro dose long term. I had to stop last December bc my mucosals/glands were destroyed (still are…) -Trying to work on the “root cause” but I don’t find practitioners I can work with from Europe -My skin was always dehydrated but now is just SO DRY no matter what I do (my whole body is in and out. Trying to fix it but nothing working) -Skin feels dry and sometimes tingly/itchy/reactive on random spots. Since I was a kid I flush easily but no extreme reactions to food or weather… -I don’t touch my face (neither does my hair), change pillow cases often, eat really clean (no gluten/dairy etc), and don’t wear makeup. -Skincare routine: AM: water wash, purito oat moisturizer PM: haruharu rice cleanser, anua azelaic acid 10% on alternate nights, purito oat moisturizer.\n\nDesperate at this point, not being able to have the accutane option anymore is after all these years one of my personal fears…\n\nI figured as my acne is not so severe anymore I could try a derm again (after so many years I don’t trust derms to do anything other than throw spironolactone or accutane at me -which I can’t have). Buuut had an appointment w this extremely expensive “acne guru derm” which surprise recommended spironolactone (even before asking about my hormones?). Also she’s also a rosacea specialist and… surprise she said I had rosacea (a first for me) and she could see(???) the mites. With the naked eye. No coming close to my face no nothing. What?\n\nI did not trust that but now I’m wondering about rosacea. I have some redness but I also wonder whether my skin barrier is not ok? Specially if the rest of my mucosals/glands aren’t and I seem to be DRY.\n\nObviously I understand the internet cannot diagnose me and I will keep trying. Just want unbiased opinions as derms seem to be increasingly clueless and subjective.\n\nCould it be a broken skin barrier? my skincare routine? Rosacea?\n\nAre there any skincare recommendations (or non skincare) that you believe might help my case? Should I try actives? Will they make it worse? YMMV obviously…\n\nAny feedback or comment or just consideration is extremely appreciated at this point 🥺🥺🥺",

I didn't visit any dermatologist for this; I knew what they would prescribe me and the expensive products. Being a teenager, not only do I not earn much (and that too is sometimes I do, sometimes I don't), but also I didn't want my parents to spend a luxury for my skincare. So I did my research, or whatever you'd like to call it, and started using my savings to purchase all these products one by one from a generic pharmacy. \n\n**Slide 1: Prior to May 17, 2025**  \nAM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra\n\n**Slide 2: Prior to August 26, 2025, till Sept 2, 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: AcMist  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nActive: Adapalene 0.1%\n\n**Slide 3: From Sep 3 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC (Using this as a moisturiser base provides better sun protection.)  \nActive: Azelskin - Azelaic Acid 10%  \nSunscreen: FixDerma Shadow SPF 30 (cheap and gets the job done for me)\n\nIn-between AM/PM (occasionally only if I am at home):  \nCleanser: Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC  \nActive: HQ 4%\n\nElse not at home:  \nSunscreen reapplication\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Minimalist B5 10% Moisturiser  \nActive: Melapik (0.0125% tretinoin, 2% HQ, 1% allantoin) **// Not a steroid cream**\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\nYes, I am aware of the ochronosis risk using HQ. But cycling it, 2 months use (alternative) and then stopping for a few weeks and then starting again will keep the melanocytes sensitive. So I will not encounter any of it, as most side effects happen due to long-term abuse without any protection and carelessness, and I am not at all careless.\n\nAll of the supplements I take are within the safe limits; I will mention the dosage and the frequency in the comments.\n\nI am looking forward to starting microdose isotretinoin. \\~7 mg / day.  \nEven weeks: 20 mg Thrice  \nOdd weeks: 20 mg twice\n\nAvg weekly intake: 50 mg\n\nWill be monitoring my lipid and liver panels every 3-4 months and ensuring they are within the ideal range.\n\nAny review and insights would be helpful.\n\nThank You",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m hoping to get some advice about my hair routine because I’m not sure if I’m using the right products or if my routine needs to change. I started with separate products like the Mark Anthony Strictly Curls leave-in, curl cream, and mousse. Recently, I decided to try something new, so I bought the yellow Skala product to see if it would work better.\n\nMy hair type is 2C/3A and very long, but every routine I try ends up with frizz and barely lasts two days. All I want is definition and absolutely no volume. Here’s my current routine: I start by wetting my hair completely and brushing it through. I then separate my hair into sections. I start with the crown because I want it to stay gelled down. The two front pieces are separated into about three smaller sections each since that’s how I usually wear my hair. The back is separated into just two horizontal sections because it’s very heavy and hard to manage.\n\nFor each section, I apply the yellow Skala product and brush it out, then I add Eco Styler gel and use a bounce curl brush. I’ve been thinking about maybe trying gel first, then mousse, then brushing, but I’m not sure if that would help. After finishing the front sections, I move to the back sections, which are harder to style and don’t hold curls well. Finally, I put my hair into a bonnet till I go out.\n\nDespite all of this, my hair always ends up frizzy, and the curls barely hold. I’m not sure what to do differently. Does anyone have suggestions for products, routines, or techniques for long 2C/3A hair that would give definition without adding volume? Any help would be really appreciated!",

Over the past year or so it has gotten flat, oily, and frizzy.\n\nI'm concerned I'm just taking care of my hair wrong and trying to treat it like thicker/fuller hair which is causing it to go flat. I went to a dermatologist to ask if it was something else and they just told me to start paying them (or buy their hair supplements /roll eyes ). I'm only 27 so not yet ready to start paying a subscription service for my hair, lol. Any tips are welcome!!\n\nRoutine: function of beauty wavy hair shampoo and conditioner, either their curl cream or mousse depending if I'm at home or not, and ouai hair oil just on the lengths of my hair (to try to combat the frizz). I use Maui Moisture Scalp Care Clarifying Shampoo irregularly, but occasionally. I wash it 2-3 times/wk (couple months ago increased this from every \\~4 days). I use a silky pillowcase to sleep, considering starting to wear a bonnet.",

I am white (English/German genes) but I do have a slight olive tone to my skin and otherwise red undertones. \n\nI’ve tried Bondi Sands self tanning foam and felt like it was way too orange, but I can’t recall what the name or shade of the product was. I also didn’t like that it was immediately a very severe tan, I want a somewhat natural looking, brown glow. So I decided to go simple and I’ve been using Jergens Natural Glow Gradual Tanner in fair to medium, and I like that it’s a build-up tan but have found that it doesn’t stay for longer than a few days if I stop daily application and it gets splotchy. I also liked that it was a clear/cream liquid rather than a colored liquid. I think I should be using something different for my face too, but I don’t know where to start with that. \n\nWhat do I try next? How do I know what to try? What do you recommend?",
