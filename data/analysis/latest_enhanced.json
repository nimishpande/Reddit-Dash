DHT tanked, low libido, dick was still functional, could still spray my shit like a sub machine gun. \n\nBut then around week 3 I started hearing weird clicks and squeaks in my brain. Thought nothing of it. Around week 4 I went to the aquarium to cope and I could hear could hear someone talking with an extremely high pitched noise and the words sounded like human. I kid you not it was the dolphins talking to me. I freaked out and left. \n\nTurns out finasteride has a secret side effect that allows us to communicate with sea mammals.",

I’m not joking, I ditched 2.5mg dut, stopped 5mg oral minox, stopped listening to dermatologists who are clearly paid actors, and just went upside down every morning. Blood finally reached my scalp the way nature intended and boom, temples filling in, crown closing, even my barber asking me what I’m on. This confirms my initial belief that the reason why we lose hair isn't DHT. It's the fact gravity is pulling our follicles back in, until they suffocate and explode. Doctors won’t tell you this because none of them can even hold a handstand for 10 seconds, so studies are limited for now. Might update in 6 months to see if this is permanent.",

She used hard wax and complained that she didn’t care for the wax and has been trying to talk the owners into changing wax brands. She went over the areas multiple times burning me in the process but not even removing all the hair. Half the time she couldn’t even rip the wax off and had to just disintegrate it using wax off.  So now I’m heading to the beach with straggler hairs everywhere and not a finished job. What should I do? Shave the rest? Or go to a different waxing salon before I leave? How do I heal the already irritated kitty?! ",

My neck looked completely different from my face and chest, and it made me feel very insecure.  Recently, I consulted a dermatologist, who suggested some creams like Glyco 6 and Epilite hydroquinone, and also recommended a test for insulin resistance, as I have mild acanthosis on the one side of my neck but test came normal. I was so happy that I didn't have diabetes . I had a glimmer of hope that the pigmentation might improve significantly with these creams. But I tried them for three months, and I didn't see much difference. I saw posts from some people who had seen results with brightening creams, so I tried Fix Derma's Skar Fix cream, but I haven't seen much improvement with that either. And now I'm following this current skincare routine👇🏽\n\nAm routine \nCera ve sa cleanser &amp; dove soap on alternate days\nDeconstruct 10% niacinamide &amp; 0.3% alpha arbutin acid \nMoiz lmf 48 face &amp; body lotion\nSunscoop brightening sunscreen\n\n Pm routine \ncleanser \nMoisturizer \nAqurea 20% cream &amp; skarfix tx cream on alternate days\n Has anyone been able to fix their pigmentation? please share your experience.

      "content": "I know, I know.. if I decide to cut my own hair, then I should be willing to accept that there is a large chance that it’s not going to turn out well. And yea, it happened but I think I’m just frustrated with my hair as a whole and not just because of this cut. My hair looks and feels healthy after the cut, which is why I did it. I spent 2years of growing it out cuz I couldn’t afford the $$$ haircuts and was finally fed up with how bad my ends looked. Bought hair cutting shears this weekend and cut it 2 days ago. Pics are my hair this morning. It’s looks extra raggedy now lol\n\nI think the culmination of seeing my hair look so chopped made me snap this morning lol. I’m just so exhausted by my hair with the amount of $$ I’ve thrown at it before (styling products, tools, hair cut $). And when I talked to my friend about it and how I was looking ‘choppy’ she had to say ‘well I wish I had your hair!’ 🤪… I’m pretty upset to say the least. I understand why she says that cuz curly hair can be so beautiful, but for some reason mine has never cooperated with me for the last 32 years. Doesn’t help that I have parents who think I should just brush it out and it will solve all my problems. SIGH! \n\nI guess to end this, does it look like there is anything I can do to fix my hair or should I accept my loss and keep it tied up for the next year or drop $300 for a stylist to look at it? Maybe I need to look up more hairstyles and see if that’ll save me..\n\nRoutine:\n1. I double cleanse with a clarifying shampoo (raw sugar the deep cleanse) and moisturizing shampoo (dove deep cleanse) then condition with dove intensive repair.\n2. After shower I use miss jessies leave in conditioner. After I section and comb out my hair with a touch of combing cream from Lola from rio. \n3. After brushing out, I use ouidad vitalcurl+ mousse and scrunch it in.\n5. Diffuse and pray",

There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine?

With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful.

      "content": "Hello all, like title says, I've tried to take care of my skin but never really used more than face wash and then face lotion after. I don't really have oily or dry skin, but if I had to choose, I'd go with dry. Goals would be improve and prevent fine lines, and do something with the bags under my eyes (I know those are just pretty much there). So, here's what I have now:\n\n**AM**  \n\\-eye cream (I really like ole henriksen banana bright. Got some for Xmas. For back up I have \"the ordinary caffeine solution + EGCG\" and I got a sample of CosRx Snail peptide eye cream)  \n\\-CeraVe Vitamin C  \n\\-Face lotion w/ SPF (using jack black face moisturizer SPF 20)\n\n**OLD PM**  \n\\-Cleanser (I like the CosRx mucin gel cleanser)  \n\\-Face Lotion (I love the ole henriksen peptide boost moisturizer. Have a CeraVe one as back up)\n\n**NEW PM**  \n\\-Cleanser (I like the CosRx mucin gel cleanser)  \n\\-2% salicylic acid (using jack black bump fix)  \n\\-CosRx Snail 96 Mucin power essence (got a sample of it for Xmas. What is this? What does power essence do?)  \n\\-Face lotion. Either CosRx Snail 92 All in One Cream or if I need a harder hitting moisturizer then the ole henriksen one I said in the old PM section)\n\nThe salicylic acid dries my skin so I'm thinking of doing that every other day, and probably doing the ole henriksen moisturizer on days I do it. Oh, and would there be any benefit in like... doing the banana bright eye cream in the AM and in the PM using a different eye cream (like the CosRx snail one) not so focused on coloration and more focused on longitudinal benefits?\n\nThank you for the help. I really appreciate it!\n\n\n\nEDIT:   \nI forgot about Vitamin C! My wife has CeraVe Vitamin C that she doesn't mind if I steal. I used to use that in the AM but I just forgot about it. I'll add that to my AM routine. AM updated (also changed the order per jasminekitten's recommendation)",

      "content": "I hope this is an okay place to post, if not please recommend others. \n\nAbout me: 32, ex military, very masculine living etc. lots of tattoos, muscular build (previous bodybuilder), and most all of my hobbies are what most would consider “manly”.\n\nThat said, for most of my life I’ve had curiousity and interests in the things women mostly did/used.\n\nAs I’ve gotten older and dealt with much of my childhood and career traumas, I’ve identified lots of overlap with the concept of lacking a nurtured feminine side, and progressed to create friction and distance in my marriage. \n\nThese 2 things seem to link together well, so I’ve started to learn and purchase things for activities like skin care, body hair trimming/removal, and a few pairs of seamless, soft female underwear. I want to specify this isn’t about sexual desires at all or fulfillment, but rather learning and accepting my true self, and wanting to feel beautiful in my own skin, not valued for my actions only.\n\nSo far my wife has been very supportive of skin care items, and knows about some softer female (grey) pj pants I bought.\n\nSo some of my biggest questions/insecurities are as follows:\n\n I feel very alone in this, as I don’t want to make it a big constant discussion with my wife. She doesn’t think it’s a big deal so I would benefit from a friend to discuss it, But yet there’s no friends I have that I’d go to\n\nI want to progress to more feminine articles (non sexually) because the feel, weight, and fabric feel very grounding for me. Not sure how to bring that up to her though.\n\nI don’t know enough about all the products out there, and my wife isn’t particularly knowledgeable or ‘girly girl’ type\n\nIf anyone is open to be a mentor/guide I’d be very appreciative. \n\nThank you 😊 \n\n\\\\-D",

I started trying oral medication and it worked but only slightly and always came back. Got on accutane and it completely cleared up my skin. Four months after being off it my acne came back so I had to go back in for another 6 months round of accutane. Yet again cleared it up then started breaking out again. I got on minocycline and tretinoin to try to help with the acne and it’s doing a good job at keeping it at bay but now I have a bunch of hyperpigmentation, sun spots and texture that I want to get rid of. What would be the best bang for my buck to get rid of it? I heard laser and chemical peels are good for all of that but I don’t know if one is better than the other, I want cheapest but best option. If laser is 100x better then a chemical peel, even though a chemical peel is cheaper I’ll go and get laser done. I just want a nice fresh base again.",

I’m only about 3 days into actually introducing these products into my skincare and I’m already seeing small breakouts in places I don’t typically break out. Obviously this could be due to typical crazy season stress or the fact that I began ovulating a few days ago. \n\nBut, I still wanted to ask about the right way to introduce new products to the skin, as I’d really like to become more understanding of my skin type and what I can do to improve it! \n\nI’ve added pictures of my old routine, which was literally just washing my face every night with the LRP medicated wash, and maybe twice a week using the COSRX soft peeling gel. Then finishing with ponds after the shower. In the mornings I’d just splash water on my face and use the ponds. \n\nI also added the “new routine” that I’ve been doing with the new products (place a close up image of the new products specific to my routine). I do the same cleansing process, but now I use COSRX hyaluronic acid serum, then the Pacifica retinoid serum, then FAB intense hydration moisturizer. \n\nDo I need to only add one product every couple days, every week? I’ve just been going in with all of them so I feel like with the breakouts maybe it’s all too much on my skin. Or does this simply mean the products just don’t work for me? ",

I was using the same product for over 4 years until it felt like my hair was not soaking in anymore and since then I’ve been trying to find product that is actually beneficial and make my curls do their thing rather than this frizzy, lack of defined curl situation. Current hair care routine includes: not your mothers shampoo/conditioner, as I am co wash for non wash days as I only shampoo 1x a week, I use shea moisture leave in conditioner, jaboba oil, noodle head curl cream, and texture ID mousse. I don’t feel like this routine is giving the healthy coils I’m looking for and would love honest feedback and advice! Curly nation unite!! ",

I comb the conditioner through my hair while showering.   \nWhile my hair is still wet, I use my hands to run Argan Oil (penetrating) through my hair.   \nI very very rarely dry my hair. I just leave it down to air dry or braid it to air dry. I prefer the braid method, it cuts down on my frizz by a lot, and my hair tends to not feel \"crispy\" once it is dried out.   \nI sleep with a bonnet on. I only finger brush it when dry. I either use clips to get it back or 3 hair ties (look, it is a lot of hair!)   \nI want to keep my care and routine very, very low maintenance.

      "content": "Lost my big curls\n\n\nHi there\n\nI used to have big curls but over the years my hair changed and it turned into smaller curls and now it’s stringy. I’m at a point where it’s hard to even get them defined. \nA few weeks ago my hair was so bad/dry that it could just stay in a 90 angle position after I removed my scrunchie.\n\nSince I dye it I thought Olaplex could help.\nSo I did a round of n°1 and n°2 and I’m now using n° 3 as maintenance. I did help a bit.\nBut since it seems I was lacking moisture itches wasn’t enough.\n\nI’m overdue for an haircut and I’m going next week so it might help but I still thinking something is missing to have better looking/healthier hair.\n\nI have to use a special shampoo for now for something I can’t mention here because of the rules of this sub.\nWhich of course affects my routine as I had to look for products that would not make the situation worse so my options are limited. \nOnce it’s under control I can reintroduce some products (I have a bunch from Shea Moisture, Giovinni, Olaplex…).\n\nSo right now my routine is:\n- Double shampoo with the special shampoo (otherwise I was using Smooth as Silk deep moisture shampoo from Giovanni) \n- I stoped using hair mask at the moment but before I either used Nutrafix hair reconstructor or Smooth as Silk deep conditioning hair mask both by Giovanni)\n- then I use an AA Keratin &amp; Peptide Hair Serum, a French local brand to squish to condish on wet hair. Before I used the Direct leave in Weightless conditioner from Giovanni which I loooove to squish to condish but I have to hold back right now. That’s when I try to form big clumps. I tried brush styling with a Denman but I was not really good at it I have to do so many sections that I was kinda discouraged. \n- at this step I would use a mousse (from Giovanni again) before gel but I couldn’t find one compatible with my situation now (I found some references that I could try to find online though but I’m hopeful I can soon come back to my usual products) \n- then I use gel with hyaluronic acid and flax seeds, same French local brand. It doesn’t have a strong hold. I have a better one from Kerasoin that again I can’t use at the moment. \n- then I diffuse on cold setting. \n- I sleep on a satin pillowcase and I’m waiting for a silk bonnet that I ordered.\n\nSo I know my routine is impacted by my situation right now but I’m hopefull I could use regular products soon. And even with regular products my hair doesn’t look much better.\nI wish I could have those big curls again that I like better than small curls but now it’s not even curly at all anymore it’s just stringy. \n\nAs for the haircut I’m going to go for a shag even though I don’t have much length to work with. For some reason it’s shorter behind, I think because I lost so much hair detangling as it was so dry. \n\nSo if you have any recommendations whether styling, products (even I can only use them once my situation is under control) or if you see what the problem could be (moisture, protein…?) I would be grateful.\n\n",
