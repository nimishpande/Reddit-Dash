      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Then the second I turned 20, I few months ago, I broke out and my skin has never bounced back. It gets worse around my period,  I get deep under the skin pustular pimples, and it’s only ever on my chin and cheeks. This is a big change for my skin as I’d to never get spots on my cheeks. This is it currently looking its best as my period recently finished.\n\nSo far I’ve only tried, benzoyl peroxide and cleaning up my diet but neither of which has shown much affects so far. Whoever there are a few things I am planning on trying very soon. I’m planning on taking supplements of these:\n\nZinc \nBorage oil \nSpearmint (or the tea) \nvitamin a (maybe) \nAmino NAC \nPro biotic\n\nIn a couple days I’m getting a blood test to see if I have any thyroid issues (I lost a stone a year ago and have not been able to put it back on for the life of me) or hormonal imbalances. But then once bloods have been taken I’m starting with these.\n\nI will keep this updated if any of these things work for me.\n\nIf you read all this I really appreciate it ❤️ I know it is seem mild in comparison to others but it has been greatly affecting me so people listening means a lot :) I just really want to get to the bottom of it.",

Consistenly, without any breaks, maybe missing 2-4 days through this whole period.\n My hair before starting was reaally thick and curly but I had widow peaks that were getting bigger.\n After 10 months of usage, my hair is still shedding everyday with more than appx. 70 hairs on my pillow every morning (terifying). Hair has just became a lot thinner. My widow peaks are somewhat the same, with tiny hairs popping out, but overall the density is just getting worse, especially on the top and middle. \nI have tested my DHT levels and I have very low DHT levels with a normal to high TEST levels, also don't have any other blood issues that could cause hairloss. I have seen a lot of black, dog like hairs on my head in past few months, now a lot less.. I am not really sure what to do, I really liked my thick hair and could probably have hidden my peaks by a different hairstyle, but now can't really do anything.\n I'm not depressed by this anymore, just fairly dissapointed.. \nMy question is, how often does dutasteride make a difference in people's cases and HOW should i implement it? Do i put it in a weekly rotation in the beginning? Any advice would be helpful.",

It varies lol\n\nHere's my typical routine when I style: \n\n1. Wet hair, brush through with a wet brush and bounce curl conditioner\n2. Rinse\n3. Follow with leave in conditioner (ends only)\n4. Head flipped over I coat and rake finger through with bounce curl defining creme\n5. Section and use bounce curl defining brush, and scrunching. \n6. Follow with Curlsmith gel 8 hold (I add a bit of water), coat and scrunch with prayer hands. \n7. Air dry without touching\n8. If crunchy I usually break the cast with bonding oil by olaplex. \n\nAdvice? ",

It’s always got this crazy frizzy texture no matter the climate or time of year, obv rain makes it frizzier.\n\nI don’t have split ends and get it cut regularly. I also don’t use any heat on it and don’t want to start either. My hair is pretty soft on the first day, and then after I get home on day 1 it’s already frizzy and the ends are feeling dry as seen in the pictures. \n\nThere’s also loads of little baby hairs, which I think is new growth from when I used scalp oil for 6 months straight (have just stopped)\n\nI use the L’Oréal Elvira dream lengths shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner and also a hair oil. \n\nI’d just like to know what I can do to make my hair soft and sleeker, and keeping my curls without using heat. I feel like my hair makes me look really unprofessional at work too. \n",

Between the wind and humidity you can see how that turned out. \n#3 &amp; 4 is post wash using Mielle (not for my hair type but so far it’s about the only thing that doesn’t leave my hair tangled and feeling dry) and then Briogeo superfoods mask, I rinsed most of it out but not all. While it was wet I added some garnier curl sculpt gel and plopped it in a t shirt for about 30 minutes, then scrunched in some NYM’s curl cream and let it air dry\n#5 is the next day after adding some NYM’s curl refresh foam and vegamour hydr-8 oil \n#6 is my hair a year ago. Still not its best but much more manageable. \n\nI don’t use heat tools on my hair or color it, but it obviously has quite a bit of sun bleaching going on. I had dark blonde hair until my mid twenties so that may be why it lightens so easily in the sun. My hair started thinning back in 2020 so I have less than half the amount of hair that I used to which doesn’t help. I have pretty fine hair with low porosity. When it’s healthy I get cute little ringlets, but even in its current state I get them without doing anything. I just don’t know how to encourage them lol I know my hair needs a pretty big chop but I haven’t worked up the nerve to do it yet so I trim every few months and snip off split ends as I find them. I am open to any and all advice. I just want to have pretty hair again. ",

Unfortunately, this means no thyroid meds right now, and I've gained some weight. I usually fluctuate between 180-220, and have never gotten severe stretch marks. I think this time was different because I went from 180 to 225 in less than a year + really bad bloating lately + getting older.\n\nThis was taken a couple of months ago, but the marks are still pink for the most part. I've been told it's harder to reduce the appearance of stretch marks after they turn white, so I'm wondering what should I be doing before that happens?\n\nI'm not opposed to minimally invasive measures (e.g. injections, micro needling, etc), but want to avoid surgery and don't want to spend more than ~$1000 if possible 😅",

My arms and upper body are much darker compared to my legs and inner areas. It is starting to make me feel insecure, especially because I want to start a fitness Instagram page, but this uneven skin tone is holding me back.\n\nI cannot visit a dermatologist right now. To be honest, I have never done any skincare before. I have only ever used a simple soap. No face wash, no sunscreen, nothing. I know it is my fault for being ignorant and not taking care earlier, but I am ready to learn and stay consistent now.\n\nI am not expecting overnight results. I am not looking for how to get \"fair\", I just want to get my original skin tone back. I am okay with working on my skin for months or even years if needed. I just want to start properly and stay committed.\n\nPlease help me with:\n\n- A beginner skincare routine (AM and PM) that actually works to reduce tanning and even out skin tone\n\n- I need help with getting rid of tan from both face and upper body\n\n- What ingredients or habits to avoid\n\n-What helped you personally reduce tanning and regain your natural tone \n\n(Excuse me if the picture is inappropriate.

      "content": "Hello! For the past few years I have had shoulder length curls (cannot describe them to you very well, but perhaps 3b?) but only in the past one have I begun to take good care of them. I am still very disappointed with my routine, though, so I would appreciate your advice on what I should do to improve it. \n\nTo start, I wash my hair twice a week, and only then will I touch my hair at all.\nIn the shower...\n&gt;I rinse my hair, then shampoo it (Dove intensive repair). \n&gt;I rinse it again, then condition it (Suave keratin infused smoothing conditioner, though I have used VO5 and Dove historically). \n&gt;I comb it through, then wait a few minutes before rinsing it again. \n\nOnce out of the shower...\n&gt; I ensure my hair is fairly wet before applying both a leave in conditioner (Cantu shea butter) and a curl keeper spray (literally just Curl Keeper Spray Gel). \n&gt;I comb the products above through my hair, first with my actual comb, then with my fingers (I now try to go strand by strand these days.), before scrunching up the strands. \n&gt;Sometimes, I rough up my hair a bit, but not always. \n\nThe results of the above are generally quite good; my hair after the roots is strandy, until the ends, where it coils a bit. Most of the volume is around or below my ears (which is where I want it to be), and overall it looks very healthy. \n\nThis hardly lasts a day, though; I often wear a loc cap, but even then my hair degrades into a dry, messy, mass of nonsense very quickly. Most of it is just frizz at that point, aside from a few strands and coils which look odd next to it. I think the climate I live in (tropical; hot and humid) contributes to that, but I must be doing many other things wrong for it to lose its appearance so rapidly. \n\nHenceforth, I am asking for your assistance on improving my routine. I obviously asked my mum and sister, but I do not completely trust anyone's advice, and prefer opinions from as wide as range of people as possible.\n\nA few things to note:\n&gt;I thought about styling it in the morning with water and conditioner, but I worry about both a buildup of conditioner, and hygral fatigue. Unless it is safe for me to do otherwise, I will only do this on some occasions. \n&gt;Until recently, I have chickened out and used warm to hot water in my hair. Now , I am trying to use lukewarm water instead.\n&gt;I plan to get a trim soon (last was 3 months ago), which should hopefully both help me reduce the amount of dry and damaged hair I have at present, and also get me advice from someone who does this sort of thing for a living. \n&gt;I will replace the loc cap with a bonnet, which should hopefully not be as tight on my hair. \n",
