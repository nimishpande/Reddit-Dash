I go in with the condish, then the cream and gel, then diffuse, then clap out with oil. \n\nI sleep in a satin bonnet, and haven't found a refresh routine yet that works. \n\nSituation:\n\nDuring covid, I watched too many tiktoks and decided to try bangs. It was a mistake. I am growing them out, but now I am super thick around my head and it gets noticeably thinner towards the ends. \n\nI am weirdly attached to the length. It is down past my waist. BUT, I think it might look better if I cut it maybe at the level I suggested in the pic. My hair is healthy to the ends. I just had a cut 3 weeks ago. \n\nMy husband just tells me it looks fine, but the more I look at it, the more I think this needs to happen. \n\nIf this were your hair, would you cut it? If so, around the same location I indicated?\n\nAlso please forgive the frizz. I'll figure that part out at some point, I hope. \n\nThank you for any/all advice!",

Decided to give it a try. And ngl, with 2 days I could see drastic changes in my skin. The comedones have drastically reduced on my forehead. Micellar also helped me with acne. If there's any acne flaring up, I just use micellar on it and the next day the acne is gone pretty much.\n\nI used Garnier pink cap.\n\nHow do I use it:\nNight: I clean my face with micellar water using cotton pads or any clean smooth cotton cloth. Then I wash my face with a cleanser. Then proceed with my night routine. (Which is basically just applying moisturizer. I use ponds super light moisturizer as I hv oily acne prone skin)\n\nMorning: I clean my face with micellar water (my face gets all super oily in the morning) and then I wash with a cleanser. Apply moisturizer and sunscreen (I use solasafe sunscreen)\n\nPs: I still hv some comedones on my skin. But micellar has made a huge difference.

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I grew up in a family that didn’t put an emphasis on beauty, and while I’m thankful for the other lessons I learned in place of “beauty lessons”, I didn’t have much knowledge on how to care for my specific skin and hair type. \n\nI’ve finally found a good collection of products that work for me personally, but now I have an even larger collection of products that just didn’t end up working- hair oil that’s too heavy, hair mousse that makes my hair greasy, conditioner that doesn’t condition, lotion that leaves my skin oily, cleansers that make me break out, skin serums that do… nothing? I try to be a thoughtful consumer, so I really hate to have all of these products just lying around, but I don’t know what to do with them! \n\nThe women in my family have near-identical skin and hair types to me, so I can’t pawn these products off to them; the men in my family are 12-in-1 guys (yikes), so no interest there. I just really don’t know what to do with all this crap. If anyone has any advice on how to reuse or repurpose unused/barely used beauty products, I would love to hear it! Thanks so much! 😊",

I have a super minimal current routine:\n\nPM: CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser &amp; CeraVe Lotion\n\nMy skin is really sensitive. The wrong cleanser will make me super dry, but the wrong moisturizer will make me oily/shiny for the rest of the day. I also have bumps on my chin/around my mouth area and on my forehead, but they don't have this pinkish shade around them.\n\nAny advice here?
