      "content": "My son has beautiful curly hair but it’s very fine and gets frizzy and tangly so easily. Is there any way to keep his curls mostly intact overnight? I’ve tried a bonnet, but they typically slip off his head while he’s sleeping so now I do a loose bun on top of his head. Sometimes in the morning, I can take out the bun, wet the hair that gets frizzy around his face and it’ll do in a pinch. If I want the curls to look nice again though, I completely wet it with water and leave in conditioner and comb it out. This definitely works, but I feel bad sending him to school with damp hair, especially in the colder months. Are there any other options to keep his curls overnight or to refresh them in the morning without getting his hair completely wet? Any suggestions would be so appreciated!\n\nI have straight hair and my husband has much thicker curly hair so these types of curls are new to him too so we’re both trying our best to learn as we go.\n\n(The first picture is of his hair still a little damp and freshly washed and the second picture shows his hair let down from sleeping in a bun and fixed up as much as I could without starting from scratch)\n\nOur wash routine: We wash with Honest shampoo and conditioner, then use finger comb through a bit of Alaffia leave in conditioner and let air dry. \n",

      "content": "hi everyone, I am a long time lurker but I’m finally at my wits end so am posting here hoping to get some help! \n\nI’m going to book a haircut tomorrow but I don’t know what to ask for. These pics are what I’m currently working with and it’s been 6+ months since my last cut. My hair is quite thick and doesn’t look good just hanging down around my face so I wear it half-up pretty much every day just to keep it somewhat controlled, but I don’t like it that much. \n\nI want to go get a haircut that will give it a nice shape when down and complement the waves! Does anyone have any advice for what kind of cut would suit me? I have quite a square face so a style that softens that would be better.\n\nLast time I got my hair cut I asked for long layers and face framing but it turned out horribly - the guy cut these big chunks around my face that didn’t blend into my hair at all, imagine a set of stairs, that’s what it looked like. My fault for getting enticed by a £25 cut. You can still see it a bit in pic 2. The hairdresser I’m going to this time comes recommended by my friend who has an absolutely stunning head of red ringlets so fingers crossed. \n\nMy current routine is Tesco citrus shampoo and coconut conditioner (don’t judge, I’m poor) but I just ordered the Aveeno rose water shampoo and conditioner as I want to see if sulfate free anti-frizz products work for me. I use Umberto giannini curl foam and then a small bit of Umberto giannini curl jelly to hold down the frizz, then let it air dry. Hairdryers / diffusing makes the puffiness/frizz a million times worse. I’ve tried scrunching in my products vs smoothing them over my hair but I haven’t noticed a difference in the end result, the waves still appear in their usual pattern. I’ve tried so many different methods and products over the last 2 years and this is the best I have found so far.\n\nSorry for the long post, I really really want to sort my hair out! My main question would be what kind of cut should I go for but if anyone has more general advice I welcome that too! Thank you in advance !",

It’s like no matter how much I moisturize, the dryness always creeps back as soon as autumn hits. My skin barrier also seems super reactive, sometimes even gentle products make me flush or sting.\n\nHere’s my current routine (open to suggestions!):\n\nAM:\n\n\\- La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser\n\n\\- Klairs Supple Preparation Unscented Toner (I pat it in with my hands - I stopped using cotton pads because they made my skin worse)\n\n\\- The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5\n\n\\- CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (the big tub, my holy grail for locking in moisture)\n\n\\- Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics SPF50+\n\nPM:\n\n\\- La Roche-Posay Toleriane Cleanser again\n\n\\- Ulike Reglow LED Mask (mostly use the yellow, red and infrared for soothing)\n\n\\- La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5\n\n\\- Squalane oil (just 2 drops pressed into my cheeks and forehead as the last step)\n\nThis combo has definitely made my skin feel calmer, but the flakiness still sneaks in, especially on the sides of my nose and around my mouth. Sometimes I’ll wake up and my skin looks dull and tight no matter how much I layer the night before.\n\nI don’t exfoliate much anymore because most acids wreck my barrier, but I’ve been considering a super gentle PHA toner again.\n\nSo I guess my questions are:\n\n\\- Should I be layering my products differently to trap more moisture?\n\n\\- Would adding something like a humidifier or occlusive balm at night help more than oils?\n\nAny advice for dry, redness-prone skin in fall/winterwould be super appreciated - thank you!",

I saw that the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Eye Cream was a great product to combat this, but I can only find it online, as it seems to be an EU-based product. Usually, I wouldn't mind paying the extra shipping and handling to get the product imported; however, the tariffs that are being imposed are ridiculous... like $150 on a $30 product.\n\nThat being said, are there any products similar to this one on the US market? Do you guys have any recommendations for products to help itchy eyelids in general?\n\nI've been putting Aquaphor on my eyes and using CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream. I don't wear makeup on a daily basis, but I bought new mascara, eyebrow gel, and concealer. I use micellar water to take my makeup off, sometimes wash my face with Tula Cult Classic Purifying Cleanser in the shower, and intermittently use the Ordinary Retinol 2%.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",

I have no idea why it started and no idea why it stopped. Before that I had strong nails (always natural, never used nail polish, don't wear any sort of fake nails, never used oils or anything).\nFor two years I couldn't even touch stuff without breaking something.\nAnd now it's returned.\n\nSince I've been \"blessed\" with cystic fibrosis I'm getting a giant blood panel every 3 months so I know that my iron/ferritin, B12 and vitamin d as well as my thyroid are fine. My other values are good too.\nBtw: I have the actual numbers and not just a dismissive \"it's fine\" from a doctor so I know my values are on the higher end for what's normal for the vitamins and iron.\n\nI have used various types of nail hardeners like sililevo, SI nails, Opi repair mode vs. nail polishes like OPI nail envy or Miro cell that you reapply every day for a week - except despite the nail polish the upper layer of my nail excuses itself long before I'm even able to reach a week.\nI use acetone free nail removers.\n\nI also supplement biotin and basically all vitamins (no drug store products but actual medication, again due to my cystic fibrosis and doctors orders).\nThe CF also isn't the reason why this happens. At  least my doctor's know of no other patient with this issue.\n\nMy toenails don't have this issue, they keep slicing through my socks like it's what they've been born to do. My hair is fine but strong enough to build bridges from.\n\nI use a glass nail file. I try to protect my hands with gloves when cleaning and washing dishes. I don't think I wash my hands too often.l because o only wash when I have a reason (cooking, coming in from outside, toilet).\n\nMy nails used to be so strong but ever since the first time I had this issue they have been weak no matter how much nail oil I use. And now the plague is back and parts of my nails keep chipping off during the day (mostly thumb, pointer and middle finger). Please help!\n\nIf you can recommend helpful products that would be great, especially if they were available in Germany where I live.",

However this is an issue no matter what the routine is. \n\nSol de Janiero shampoo, Garnier Fructis Sleek conditioner in the shower.

      "content": "Hello! I need help, please. \n\nThe first picture is my natural hair before this frigging disaster. All natural, virgin hair. I'd done highlights in the past, and I'd always an ashy/smokey color. \n\nI didn't want much color this time. I'd done nothing to my hair for 2 years. The second picture is what I originally wanted and the hairdresser said she could do it. I clearly said I wanted cool tones. \nI saw the red flags and I didn't pay attention. She didn't want to do a consultation or a strand test. She simply said I should come and sit on her chair. \n\nI got there 2 days ago, and she is telling me she is not going to be able to lift my color that much. So, I showed her the third pic and said that was my second option. I clearly told her I wanted some face framing too. I also had for a hair gloss. My main thing was covering my greys. \n\nThe rest of the pictures show the horrible job she did 😭. It's nothing like what I'd asked for. She did way too many highlights than I desired. The color is HORRIBLE!!! It's orange, and she calls it chocolate. It's brassy, and she says it's not. \n\nI asked for a refund yesterday, and she said she doesn't do refunds because she already used products. She'd offered another toner, but a toner won't fix this. She just did the one thing I feared. I am going to have someone fix this, and idk how much it will cost me. \n\nI feel like a clown, honestly 😭. It is embarrassing to be walking around with my hair like this. \nShe did not do what I asked for. Isn't it only fair to get a refund? Even if it is 50%? I'd never had this kind of issue, so I don't know my rights and I don't know what to do.\n\nThis was supposed to be a balayage with face framing and a nice haircut. \n\nShe told me to wash my hair and maybe I will like it ..I think she is out of her mind. She is playing me and gaslighting me. I am not letting her touch my hair again. The last thing she said is that she can always dye my hair back to my original color. \n\nWhat's also upsetting is that she used a permanent color to do my roots. Please, HELP!!! What do I do?\n\nThanks 😑",

Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

I have Multi-racial hair and have struggled on how to take care of it for years and I dont have anyone close to me with that sort of hair anymore :(\nI have Caucasian, African American, and Hawaiian hair and its been hard trying to figure out the right products/care routine to really bring the curls out and enjoy them for long periods of time (plus the amount of tangles throughout the day is insane).\nThe products i use for shampoo and conditioner is Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Shine. Only problem is it causes quite a bit of my hair to fall out during the washing process. I let my hair air dry itself out since I've had bad experience with Towel and blow drying (the tangles were awful). Im also unsure how often I should be washing my hair in general, I wash it every other day and sometimes after 2-3 days and I cant tell a difference between both.\nSide products I am currently using are Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Ultra Moisture and Nourish Oil. Have not had a bad experience from it but it doesn't seem to be doing much either.\nI have also started using Curls Aloe and Blueberry Juice Curl moisturizer and it has caused a lot of tangles a few hours after using it. \nI usually spray the products into my hair and then finger comb it through it.\n i had once tried using a pick on my hair but it seemed to fluff out the curls and caused it to get all frizzy so I've stuck with just finger combing through it and the tangles are horrendous! :(\nI try to finger comb it twice a day but im unsure if I need to do it more than that or not.\nI also sleep with a satin bonnet every night but I dont use it for any other occasion.\nI would really appreciate any sort of help for dealing with my hair type, I had gotten frustrated and got it cut short per the photo above after a really bad day at work and figured it would be a bit easier to take care of as well (i used to have it midway through my back and it wasnt very fun to take care of).\nThank you all in advance and I greatly appreciate it! 🙏 😊 ",
