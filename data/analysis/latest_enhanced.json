Last 2 pics are after washing yesterday, and this morning)\n\nMy hair is usually so thick and juicy, light frizz comes naturally I don’t mind that. My problem is that these last couple of months, my hair has been so… stringy?? They’re not getting juicy anymore. And the curls are very lackluster, like waves. Then when I wake up the day after washing them a lot of the underneath is just straight. It’s almost as if my hair has changed texture, it’s looser and softer. \n\nAny advice to get my juicy thick curls back please comment! I have high porosity hair, I usually do use a bonnet.\n\nMy routine:\n\nI do my hair every 3-4 days. I shampoo with off brand head and shoulders every other time (I think this might be part of the issue, I know I need new shampoo. Recommendations would be helpful.) Then I use OGX coconut miracle oil conditioner every time. Usually use a little herbal essences mousse, then diffuse, then when It’s dry I oil it with jojoba. \n\nIn the past I never used mousse, &amp; was using shea moisture power green shampoo (seldomly) &amp; love beauty and planet conditioner but it has become too expensive for me.

      "content": "Hello! I’m pretty new to all of this, so bear with me. Over the past two weeks, I’ve been trying to figure out my hair as part of a general  effort to improve myself. I’m about 70% sure I have curly hair. If that’s wrong, feel free to tell me straight up.\n\nRight now, I’ve been using Not Your Mother’s shampoo and conditioner. I also picked up VO5 shampoo for the co-wash, though I’m still not entirely sure how to use that properly. I’ve only used it once. I bought Eco hair gel and tried it yesterday by using two finger dabs and working it through my hair. I’ve been reading the beginner guides and trying basics like scrunching, but after showering I usually just let my hair air dry.Also, I was told to get curly mousse, can anyone explain how exactly this is different from a hair gel,(I'm an idiot cut me some slack). The order I apply is that typically I do conditioner  wash shampoo wash conditioner again wash then I dry my hair with a towel by patting my head then on non wash days I only apply conditioner.\n\nI’ve heard a lot about leave-in conditioner, and I’m wondering if I’m messing up by rinsing all the conditioner out instead of leaving some in. If I was to leave some in how much should I leave in or is leave in conditioner another different type of conditioner you are meant to apply only after the shower.\n\nMy main concern is that I’m planning to get a haircut in the next two weeks, and I’d really appreciate advice from people who know more about hair than I do. I don’t know much about it. Throughout high school I mostly got buzz cuts because my hair grew fast and my dad wanted to keep it simple.\n\nI’m in college now and want to try something that actually suits me. I don’t want it super long because I do not want frequently get a haircut, but I also really dislike extremely short hair. Buzz cuts especially. I always felt like I looked like an egg. In the past, I usually preferred my hair a bit longer than shorter for that reason because I didn't really feel insecure about it.\n\nOne friend suggested a fade, but he also said he is not really an authority on what to do here since he has wavy hair himself.If it helps after talking to same friend I've determined that my hair is 3A/3B in quality(correct me if I am wrong as always) and I have a rounded face type.\n\nAny suggestions for haircuts, routine changes, or things I’m doing wrong would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nTLDR Newbie to hair care, looked at curly girl, not sure about difference between stuff like curl mousse and hair gel. Plan on getting a haircut that is not a buzz cut for once and wanted some advice on what to do,how to cut it, what kid of looks/cuts to pursue, and look for.",

So since tomorrow is a very important day I figured id reach out for help today. For context I am a puerto rican male with short, 3c-4a i think, hair and according to the water cup test I have EXTREMELY low porosity hair. i do not have anyone at all to talk to about my hair so im kinda in this on my own. My dad is the only one who has kinda my hair type but he don’t know what he doing any more then me lol! (he literally uses relaxers as hair cream every day). I am also gonna try to put images below to give whoever is reading this a visual. So basically right now im tryna use the SKALA mais crespinhos (i think thats what its called) hair cream for leave in. the thing is i want my hair to be kinda defined and i honestly have no idea how to use it. I tried to search for so many videos of people using it but all of them either 1.dont have my hair type or 2. have long hair that they can section easily to get good curls. I also noticed though that when i kinda add regular conditioner when washing my hair and pick at it like a afro pick but with my hands, instead of like raking it, it looks not too bad. anyways latley I’ve been trying to follow this video i found with the SKALA.https://www.youtube.com/shorts/\\_6QTIT1jYsk ,But his hair is longer so he can section it and also whenever i try to finger curl my hair like that i can never seem to find my curls that easily since my hair is SUPER thick. anyways im sorry for rambling so much hopefully someone can understand this message, but what I mean to ask is if anyone has a routine i can do for tomorrow using the products I have which are the SKALA cream. echo styler gel and water ig. I don’t mind anyone recommending other products but again since I have to have my hair ready tomorrow I would appreciate a routine i can use with the stuff i have. \n\n\n\nOk so I just realized while reading this over that I didn’t really explain clearly what I need but im to lazy to edit all that so basically i just need someone to explain how I can use the products I have to actually make good defined nice curls (not wet curls). If anyone can reach out to me here i would appreciate it so much. Sorry for the long message too lol.",

I've tried the Curly Girl routine and this is the result. I've used Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus products for both the shampoo, conditioner, and the gel. I'm kind of clueless about what to try at this point. My goal is really to just wear my hair down to show off the curls like in 99% of the posts on this sub, but my hair doesn't seem to want to do that at all, it'll always rise in a weird way after brushing it down and it'll look very awkward and unnatural. I also think my hair has a lot of trouble retaining moisture; only an hour or so after the last two photos, my hair was looking dry and similar to the first 3 photos again.\n\n\n\nI would really appreciate help to figure out a better routine I could use for healthier hair, as well as even recommendations for what a more flattering hairstyle would be for this kind of hair. I'm too scared to do some irreversible change and mess it all up, so I just play it safe and get a tiny bit off the sides every couple of weeks (although I've missed that since November..).\n\n \n\nI've really struggled to find people with my kind of hair (thin, somewhere between coily/curly, and very prone to damage) so hopefully this post could also help someone down the line. Any advice on my exact hair type would also be very helpful.",

      "content": "I honestly don’t know what’s wrong with my skin and it’s gotten worse recently. From reading other posts, I have guessed that I have a damaged skin barrier. With that, for the past month I have only been using the products on the last photo (plus hyaluronic acid serum I forgot to include) . I went to a dermatologist a while back who told me I have rosacea so I have also been using Azelaic Acid &amp; Metronidazole. These products do seem to help with overall redness but my face is still very red and spotty.\n\nIs this a damaged skin barrier? Could it be something else? Is there anything wrong with my routine?\n\nMy forehead is mostly fine and the redness and spotty mess always seem to happen around my cheeks and sometimes going up the sides of my nose. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nRoutine:\n\nMorning:\n\n\\- Wash face with water\n\n\\- Hyaluronic acid serum\n\n\\- Moisture with Aestura Atobarrier 365 lotion\n\n\\- Azelaic Acid &amp; Metronidazole\n\n\\- Another mild layer of Aestura Atobarrier 365 lotion (if face still feels dry)\n\n\\- Birch Juice Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n\\- Wash face with Hyaluronic acid cleanser\n\n\\- Hyaluronic acid serum\n\n\\- Moisture with Aestura Atobarrier 365 lotion\n\n\\- Azelaic Acid &amp; Metronidazole\n\n\\- Another mild layer of Aestura Atobarrier 365 lotion",
