I like having short hair. And it does feel a lot healthier and thicker. All I can hope is that in a month or two it will grow out nicer. \n\nBut this is way too short. I showed my hair dresser the photos OF ME with my short bob and the choppy layers, and specifically told her i wanted to avoid my hair looking like a big ball. She seemed like she really understood and was even saying comments about how we are gonna bring out my curl, avoid flatness, add plenty of choppy layers… but i feel like it came out like a big shapeless ball anyway. It wont curl at all like how it did. Its shorter than I ever wanted. I feel like its an old lady haircut and i know its dramatic but i’ve been crying nonstop. This has completely tanked my self esteem and self image. I can’t even recognize myself, and itll take MONTHS to get to where I’m happy with it. I’m so so devastated that it isnt curling like it did before. I feel so sick and upset and like i cant even go outside. ",

I also have in the past had them tinted darker, more ashy but dark brown is not a good idea for me either.\n\nI currently tint the transparent hairs with just for men beard dye in blonde (which isn’t mean to be warm) and use fenty light blonde brow pencil (love how light it is but too yellow).\n\nWould appreciate hearing ideas - I’ve heard there are Asian brow gels that lighten? Or maybe there’s another lightening product?\n\nThanks everyone 🙏",

I don't know what to do to make it better. I've looked up makeup plots and how to make facial features look more masculine, but it always turns out I'm looking like drag or barely noticeable.\n\nIn the first picture is my most recent attempt using a contour/concealer stick (palladio cinnamon) where I feel it's too soft/not very noticable. The next set is me using eyeshadow (LA colors cool) The final set I feel looks good, it was done by a drag king though a few years ago, and I've been trying to replicate it.\n\nSo anyone have any tips or suggestions so it doesn't look like drag but isn't light enough so it's not noticable?

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I’ve been dealing with persistent redness and what seem like clogged pores around my nose for years. I used to extract them with a tool, but I stopped because I didn’t want to risk damaging my skin.\n\nI saw a dermatologist a while back who thought it might be fungal and prescribed a cream, but it didn’t help. Hydrocortisone provides some temporary relief, but it never fully goes away. The skin in that area is very sensitive — retinol and most active ingredients tend to dry it out or irritate it even more.\n\nDoes anyone have ideas about what this could be or suggestions on how to treat it?",

      "content": "Hi, Im 26 male. Have been on oral minoxidil 2.5mg once a day for past 6 months. And finasteride 1mg every other day for 4ish months- gonna up finasteride to daily now.\n\nI saw a dermatologist and they recommended the above treatments. Initial shed for minoxidil did occur- sometimes on shampoo days id lose 100ish in the shower, some even when drying with a towel. On non shampoo days, maybe id lose 20ish and 10 while styling\n\nNOW: On non shampoo days- I lose maybe around 10 in shower and 10 styling with a brush.\n\nWith shampoo, I lose 70 in shower, and 10-20 styling.\n\nIm just wondering why this shedding is going on for so long, despite reaching now the 6 month mark. I take collagen and multivits too and all my blood work is fine. Not stressed atm.\n\nBy now, expected shedding to drop (some people say their shedding is like 20 only by this time in other threads ive seen) for 6 months on oral minox.\n\nMy main concern was crown and temples. Crown doesnt look any different tbh, still quite bad, and after starting minoxidil, temples look a bit worse. I do see baby hairs, but temples look lighter than last year for example.\n\nI know people stay to stick with it but im struggling. Any advice, is this normal to shed this much still? I still see couple of strands of hair on my bed, on my bathroom floor etc- so even without shampoo i shed here and there!",

It’s happened in the same spot on both big toes, my left one just goes down a lot further than my right one. I googled it and it said it could be from having your nails too long (they weren’t ridiculously long, but were a bit longer than usual). So I trimmed them a lot shorter and hoped they would go back to normal. It’s been several months now and there’s been no change. I’ve kept them short ever since, but it hasn’t helped. Am I able to fix them so they grow normally or am I stuck with weird nails now?\n\n*marked as nsfw as I don’t want to scare people with my ugly toes haha*",

I went and got a facial done and the esthetician recommended that I use a gel based moisturizer (I’m using Neutrogena hydroboost gel cream for oily skin)  because when I use a cream one (Cera ve daily moisturizer) it makes my skin very oily. I still get oily when I use a gel moisturizer though. \n\nMy question is this- I have large pores and oily skin. Out of curiosity to see what would happen, I washed my face and didn’t moisturize, my face felt tight and dry. But when I use a heavier moisturizer to try and counteract this, it makes me oily almost instantly. And the light gel one makes me oily too. Any ideas as to why this is happening? ",

I can’t seem to fix my skin texture and get rid of my inflammation — if I get a pimple, it’s there for weeks and doesn’t seem to go away. \n\nMy skin also has bumps everywhere — I think closed comedones. With the cold, my skin has been drying up and getting flaky. I also experience burning sometimes after I put on my skincare. I was wondering if anyone has any good products to recommend or knows what I could change. \n\nMy skin is dry. It doesn’t really like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid (I have very sensitive skin). This is my current skincare routine — I am also on Yaz (birth control) for my acne. (NOTE: I recently switched from Cerave’s hydrating facial cleanser &amp; daily moisturizing lotion to vanicream.. the cerave seemed to be giving me a lot of texture. \n\nAM:\n\n1. Wash with vanicream gentle facial cleanser for sensitive skin\n\n2. Apply dapsone 5% gel\n\n3. Use vanicream daily facial moisturizer \n\nFor sunscreen, I use the live tinted mineral sunscreen but haven’t applied that in a while.\n\nPM:\n\n1. Wash with vanicream gentle facial cleanser for sensitive skin\n\n2. Apply tretinoin 0.025% cream\n\n3. Use vanicream daily facial moisturizer, sandwich method\n\nI am open to any and all product suggestions including toners or different face washes or anything! Thank you so so so so much",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",
