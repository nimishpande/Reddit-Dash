In a 90-day use of peptide-based hair loss treatment candidates by 120 participants, 95% experienced visual improvement in hair density, and the average number of hairs per square centimeter increased by 62%. »\n\nAfter some research, this seems to be a well-known and reliable business-oriented newspaper in South Korea. However, I can’t find any other source confirming these claims.\n\nCan anyone confirm the accuracy of this article or comment on the reliability of this journal in general?\n\nThe english article was translated through AI. I checked the original Korean version and used several translators, they all gave the same result.\n\nOriginal (non-translated) article: [https://www.mk.co.kr/news/it/11451566](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/it/11451566)\n\nSo take these claims with a grain of salt. I can’t confirm their accuracy yet, but if true… that’s huge!",

      "content": "Heyy everyone,\nso I have curly-ish hair with some tighter curls in the front and waves near the nape of my neck. I also have fine hair, that's prone to breakage and being weighted down by products. \nIm starting to feel like its not worth the effort to do my hair routine since the curls usually end up looking terrible and it's easier just to brush and let it air dry where it usually ends up being half straight half wavy.\nI'm also afraid that I'm forcing my curls and I've deluded myself into thinking I have curly hair since everyone else in my family has curls.\n\nI use Pantene Curly shampoo and conditioner, and suave clarifying shampoo once a week. I section my hair into three sections (bottom to top) and use 1 pump of Umberto Giannini Curl Whip per section. Then I go in with Umberto Giannini Curl Jelly. First I scrunch with my hands, and then scrunch with a cotton T-shirt. \nTo dry my hair I hover dry with the diffuser and then when it's about 80% dry, I diffuse each side of my head while at a 90° angle. \n\nI've tried curl balms and creams but in my experience they just weighed my hair down and made it greasy. \n\nI just really don't know what to do anymore. It always looks stringy and frizzy and I usually end up brushing it out and putting it in a bun.\n\nI would be so thankful for any advice or suggestions!!\n",

The problem is I popped this pimple 4 days ago (my fault I know) and it created a sort of bruise, pink-red in colour. The actual blood giving part of it is very small it’s mostly just like skin around it that’s slightly pink. I’ve been using aloe vera and Cetaphil moisturisers on it, but it won’t go. The bruise is sort of big and catches attention and I just can’t have it on my photo which is gonna appear on my exam results, my Student Government election voting photo, and a lot other places.\n\nHow do I get a fast fix for photo day? Foundation or concealer won’t work since makeup isn’t allowed in my school and in general it appears very very cakey since I’m not allowed to shave my face and naturally it sticks to the minuscule facial hairs.\n\nRight now I have products like a niacinamide serum but chatGPT told me not to use it.

Has anyone had a similar white mark or pigment loss after a cold sore?\n\n\n2. Did it ever regain color naturally?\n\n\n3.

Where’s a good place to start to try and revitalise the curl? Is it even possible? \n\nMy current routine is:\n1.  Homemade hair mask of an egg, natural yogurt and coconut or olive oil roughly every two weeks.\n2. Dove intense repair shampoo and conditioner, once a week I let the conditioner sit for 10 minutes before rinsing. \n3. Air dry as I don’t have a diffuser and want to avoid heat.\n\n\n I think a part of the problem is my hair is quite long (mid-butt length) so it’s weighed down too. Any advice is appreciated.:) TIA!",

I currently use Redken mega curls (shampoo and conditioner) just because Redken used to work well for me when I had straight but I’m not super sure now.\n\nI after the wash I normally use a leave in conditioner (some australian brand my curl specialist salon had) on the ends and a Ouidad gel that I scrunch in and diffuse.\n\nThe results really do vary wildly sometimes it’s fine but if I get the timing wrong it can get a bit frizzy. I seem to have better results when I’m generous with the gel and get the inital scrunch and water content just right before diffusing.\n\nIn between washes I use a spray bottle with some water and just do a little spritz and scrunch and that mostly works but it’s definitely more frizzy then. Oh and the climate here is super damp pretty much all year round.\n\nNow for the questions: Is frizzy hair damaged or dry hair? As I mentioned I’m not quite sure about the shampoo and conditioner because I think maybe my hair is a bit dry but I find it hard to tell cause I’m not used to the texture. How do you guys know when your hair is dry? Any suggestions on shampoo and conditioner are welcome. I’ve seen a lot of mentions of clarifying shampoo, is that something that works for everyone? How often do you recommend? Last but not least are replenishing treatments like olaplex ok for curly hair? Are there other brands that work better for curly hair? I used to do this once a month for straight hair, is that ok for curly hair too?",

      "content": "Hi all! I never struggled with pimples much, even as a teenager. All my life it’s been 1-2 small pimples a month, if even that, and they would go away and barely leave a mark. I have always had dehydrated skin, especially around my chin and nose. \n\nSince this summer, I started getting bigger pimples that would last and end up leaving marks on my cheek. I picked up some cerave retinol because that’s helped me fade dark spots in the past, but it hasn’t done a thing this time.\n\nEvery time one pimple goes down, another comes up. And they don’t seem to fully disappear. Possible causes are my new puppy who has a habit of licking my face but i always wash it, and i had a dog in the past but he wasn’t much of a licker. I also shave my cheeks with jojoba oil and a razor that i clean with alcohol almost every day - I assume this is the main cause but I don’t know what else to do. Maybe hormones too? I started a few random products in September and used them for a few weeks until I decided to stop as to not aggravate my skin further. I havent dealt with this before and I’m so frustrated. I don’t know any spot treatments that work for me either, so please suggest.\n\nAM routine:\n- I don’t wash my face, just water\n- CEO glow\n- Forest essentials sunscreen\n- Makeup\nPM routine:\n- Tatcha rice wash, or innisfree volcanic bha face wash 2x a week. Sometimes i’ll mix in microderm crystals as an exfoliant\n- the ordinary milky toner\n- cerave retinol serum 2x a week\n- cosrx snail mucin\n- sometimes cosrx blackhead eraser on my nose only\n- i alternate between face creams depending on if i want something light or heavier that night. Cosrx snail mucin face moisturizer or illiyoon ceramide cream\n- sometimes jojoba oil if i want extra hydration\n\nAny suggestions would be really helpful. I assume some products may be promoting comodones but I don’t know which ones. I wear super light makeup, but only under my eyes. Only blush goes on my high cheekbones.",

      "content": "I suffered from a year-long acne mainly on my cheeks, which is now gone, but left acne scars. I went to a dermatologist and she prescribed me meds and an acne ointment. Used it for the time she recommended I use it, but there was no progress; instead, pimples kept coming, and they were a bit painful.  \nAt that time, I used to use Hadalabo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion, Shirojyun Premium Whitening Lotion, and Sana Namereka Anti-Aging wrinkle night cream.\n\nInitially I loved Sana Namereka since the texture of that cream was so buttery,but after 2-3days pimples started appearing and it made me stop. Even though I stopped using it, my acne kept coming and became worse, and this continued for a year. I don't even know if it was because of Sana Namereka, but I can't help but think that it might have caused it since I had no acne before that.\n\nSo, after I stopped Sana, I still kept using the two Hada Labo lotions not thinking that those could have been triggering my acne because my patch test results were good. No acne.\n\nI was also using the Melano CC essence before I started Sana Namereka but after using for 6-8 months I didn't see any improvement.\n\nAfter a frustating year,I used tret 0.5% and then only my acne subsided. Some acne comes through now and then before and during my periods,but they go away soon.\n\nFrom then on, I discontinued all Hada Labo lotion and the Sana cream I was using.\n\nTo get rid of acne scars,I bought 10 APLB Glutathione Niacinamide Sheet Masks, and after using one mask, I got two pimples on my face the next morning. I didn't think much about it because again the test patch came fine. The second time I used it, a few pimples popped up, and then I stopped using it.\n\nNow, I am using only COSRX snail mucin cream, Mary and may's eye cream, and my face is showing no major acne flare-ups.  \nI wanted to add in the anua Azelaic Acid 10 Hyaluron Redness Soothing Serum, and Dr Althea's vit c serum to help me fade stubborn acne scars. BUT I AM SCARED BECAUSE OF THE NIACINAMIDE IN BOTH PRODUCTS.  \nI do not know what caused me to have stubborn acne for a year that meds and isotretinoin could not stop. The patch tests do not give me any indication that I might get acne, so I don't really know how I can even help myself",

      "content": "I have extremely oily skin (it’s definitely the root cause of my acne) but also dehydrated skin. Every time I try to fix the dehydration, I end up breaking out with cystic, nodular, and regular acne. It’s weird because no product breaks me out until my skin actually becomes hydrated and plump.\n\nI’ve tried many different hydrating products (CeraVe, Tiam B5 toner, etc.) and it’s always the same pattern. My skin is fine for weeks, then once it finally feels nourished, the breakouts start. It’s like my acne thrives when my skin is hydrated. So i'm unsure if the product is breaking me out or being at a hydrated state does. I've tried to figure out the ingredients that may cause this but can't figure it out.\n\nI’ve seen multiple derms and they always suggest adding more actives, but I really want to solve the hydration issue first. Could it be that when my skin gets hydrated, it traps oil underneath or that the plumpness closes the pores and causes the cystic acne? Or maybe I just need something more lightweight but HYDRATING/MOISTURIZING?\n\nThe problem is that I haven't found a lightweight toner or moisturizer that actually hydrate my skin enough. Any recommendations for super-light hydrating toners or essences that can hydrate my very oily skin.\n\n**For reference, the core routine I use:**\n\n* Marcelle Ultra Gentle Cleanser\n* Cosrx Propolis Toner (not hydrating enough, no breakouts)\n* Neutrogena Hydroboost (not hydrating enough, no breakouts)",

I’ve always had clear, normal-to-dry skin, but over the past few months, I’ve started noticing acne-like marks and small breakouts, especially around my chin and sometimes on my cheeks. I also have quite a bit of facial hair, and since waxing doesn’t suit my skin and laser is too expensive, I started using a razor to remove the hair. I don’t get immediate breakouts after shaving, but ever since I started, my skin feels different — like it’s constantly irritated or not as smooth as before. Recently, I began using The Ordinary Glycolic Acid hoping for clearer, glass-like skin, but it seems to have made things worse. I used it carefully, once a week, followed with sunscreen, and only used it about three or four times, but still ended up with more irritation and small bumps. I’m not sure if the problem is from shaving, the glycolic acid, or something else entirely. I’d really appreciate any advice or suggestions from anyone who’s faced something similar or knows how to fix this.",
