Bali Curls Moisturizing Conditioner\n\n3. Bali Curls Hydrating Curl Cream\n\n4. Bali Curls Curl Defining Gel \n\n5. Bali Curls Bonding Oil for scrunch out the gelcast.\n\nI never had long hair and had to find out just after my early 40s that i have curly hair (i would say 2c-3a). It is very fine but it seems i still have a lot strands. I was going to cut that dry and frizzy mess short again until i learned how to maintain it after watching videos, search the internet and finally got a \"curlsys\" cut from a hair stylist knowing how to handle curly hair and teach me how to maintain and style it. I also learned that some things makes night and day like avoid friction and sleeping only on a silk pillowcase with a loose bun (also silk scrunchie here). It can get really on my nerves to maintain that mane but i just feel so much better now at my age with my longer hair and while in the beginning people said it looks terrible, now it is more the opposite and it is a great conservation starter to women and man.\n\nI am still searching for maybe some better products for my special hair type and try other things. I just bought the \"Lockenbox\" Christmas calendar with 24 tools and products to try for next year ;) My journey just began (even i am already a 47 years old man) and hope to grow the curls much longer and maintain them better. I still have some bad hair days with a frizzball on my head but now i know how to \"repair\" it. One thing for sure, even if some people try to talk me into a shorter hairstyle i am done with shorter hair.....at least until it might get thinner as an aging man. So far i think i still have some years to go. ",

      "content": "Edit: please don’t dm me weird stuff im not interested i came here to ask for help with my skin! 😢\n\nI’ve had clear skin for most of my life (I’m 16) but June this year I began to get acne a week before my period. It was disappointing but manageable I guess, they were just tiny whiteheads that wouldn’t leave a mark. I used 10% panoxyl and it worked really well. \n\nIn October the pimples began to get really huge. Not painful. But just really big fat noticeable pimples that left dark spots that take ages to fade. It’s still happening now. The pimples take weeks to go and the dark spots take even longer. I can’t even get the pimples to go before my next period comes and the new ones grow. I had to use panoxyl day and night or I’d wake up with a new big one. One day last month I only applied it in the morning and went to sleep early, skipping the night one. I woke up with three huge pimples that hadn’t been there that night. I still have the dark spots from those.\n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations or anything that worked for them? My acne isn’t awful but I just miss my skin from this year. I never noticed I had clear skin until this year since people would comment on it. The very moment I realized what a blessing I had and started appreciating it, I began to get acne which is crazy.. Sorry for ranting, I’m really just not sure what to do. I’m panicking because why am I suddenly getting acne now after all these years? I know it can persist into 20s-40s but it still feels so strange and weird.. I have no idea how to navigate my own skin. I have no idea why this started and how to fix it. I’m scared it won’t go away and I really miss when I didn’t have to worry about all of this. Anyways sorry again for ranting I really appreciate you for reading all of this and I’d appreciate and love any advice. Please don’t be mean to me!! 🥲🩷",

In the past two years or so I’ve realized my hair actually is wavy and I’ve been looking into caring for my hair more. I have dyed my hair often since I was 16 (~10 years) but I am trying to grow out my natural hair, recently cutting 5 inches off, and seeing how I feel about my natural color since I haven’t barely seen it in a decade as well as trying to let my hair get healthier. \n\nMy current routine is CHI Luxary black seed oil shampoo and unwash conditioner but these were for vivid hair color care. Are either of theses still okay to use? I used a moisturizing cream for like two months which did help but it was super expensive for very little product. I then dry with a cotton towel and wrap it as I dry off then free my hair and let it air dry. I would love any advice anyone has for me. \n\nI have read through the beginner guide but do have some thoughts and questions. For example, I live at a very high altitude (~8500 ft) and it is super dry up here. Does anyone have any advice to keep moisture in my hair? I am also autistic and the thought of the crunchy gel sounds awful to me sensory wise. Is it needed or can I use just stay in cream or something else? \n\nThere was a brief few months where my hairdresser gave me a moisturizer that is not recommended here but that is some of the best waves I have had. Just any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\nPhotos:\n1) me at 12\n2) natural hair 3 years ago (only shampoo and conditioner)\n3 + 4) my hair with the same shampoo, conditioner, and a moisturizing leave in cream",

I’ve tried niacinamide and adapalene but feel like it doesn’t get better! I’m also struggling with dry skin (very different from my pre-accutane skin, which used to be oily and combination). On a normal day, it doesn’t look too bad but if I get too hot or rub my face in any way or literally just step outside all those red marks get 10x worse and it looks like I have rosacea?! Does anybody have any recommendations of products I could use to get rid of this?? Or is it just not possible? Current routine is oil cleanser, toner, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide serum, ampoule (pore minimizing) and moisturizer/sunscreen. HELP!",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI (27F) am at my wit's end with my acne and I really don't know what else to do. Ever since I was 10, I've had acne, and different types have come and gone with age, which makes me thing this one isn't the usual teenage acne. But one type has persisted.\n\n**The Issue:** Without having to send a pic, they can basically be described as hardish lumps of almost translucent slightly yellow \"pus.\" The outside doesn't look bad unless touched, but can be scratched off. They don't look like any acne I've seen on charts defining the types, so I'm not sure how to tackle them. **I get them everywhere: my back, front, stomach, legs sometimes, and arms.** The can be gently squeezed out too, but they're never liquidy.\n\n**Skin type:** I would say normal. Not too oily, not too dry.\n\n**Current routine:** I have literally tried everything, but right now I am washing with a cleanser with eucalyptus oil in it (not an acne specific one), and moisturize with CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion. On my face I use Azelaic acid, retinol, and the same moisturizer, but **my face is fine**. It's my body that's the issue.\n\n**Things I have tried in the past (please read):**\n\n* Niacinamide + zinc (the ordinary)\n* Many salicylic acid cleaners, body spray, moisturizer, you name it.\n* Retinol\n* Benzyl Peroxide\n* Sodium Sulfacetamide (prescribed by derma)\n* Metronidazole gel\n* Loose clothing, natural fibers, changing bed sheets often, silk pillowcases, showering after sweating, changing shirts often, etc.\n* Going to the dermatologist. Basically wasn't taken seriously and prescribed above prescriptions that didn't work. Going back is not an option case yay US healthcare system.\n* Moisturizing every day with various moisturizers. Non-clogging mainly.\n* Not fungal acne but tried products for it\n* Antibiotics didn't work\n* Birth control didn't work. Neither worse nor better on and off bc.\n* I have tried different exfoliating schedules: Once a week, every day, 2-3 times a week, etc. Right now I'm at 2-3 times a week.\n* I was my body last (after shampoo and conditioner)\n* Used gentle laundry detergent on clothes and no fabric softener\n* Edit: Adding that I also have dried no dairy and a \"sugar free\" lifestyle. \n\n**Things to consider:**\n\n* I am blonde and have thin, soft, light hair on my body.\n* Waxing doesn't change anything\n* I keep out of the sun and always use sunscreen.\n* I did go see a professional, but didn't feel like I was taken seriously. I was in there a total of 10 minutes, probably less. He basically just said acne vulgaris and gave me prescriptions that cost $$$$ so I can't get them again, nor can I go to another derma just yet.\n\nHas anyone else had this problem? Did you ever find a solution or do I just have to deal with this? Thanks in advance! Although I know my acne is not nearly as bad as others, it has been a great source of depression and self-consciousness my whole life. I am also a chronic picker so I know that doesn't help but it's been an addiction I've struggled to stop my whole life.",

And it seemed like I took it for granted.\n\nI came across this brand called Skalli Essentials. I found their content convincing and bought their acne bundle which included: Sulfur soap, rosewater, and black seed orange blossom moisturizer. At first my acne cleared up a bit due to finally cleaning my face. Now I keep getting breakouts randomly.\n\nI went to Sephora for a makeup appointment. The artist asked what I used for skincare and I told her my routine. She said the sufur soap is too drying and then recommended products $30-50 dollars each. I can't really afford those atm. Some of those were Exfoliants which I had ordered from Yesstyle for cheaper and had yet to come.\n\nI looked on Google and it said sulfur soaps don't cause acne? I'm a bit puzzled. I really want clear skin... Tbh the reason why I'm getting into makeup is part due to my acne insecurity. Any insight would be appreciated. I also use Cyperus Rotundus oil to prevent hair growth on my chin and neck, Green Tea and Rice PDRN serum, and Retinol every 3 days+ Cetaphil SPF 50 (tbh it does make my skin a bit oily) everyday. I use a clean skin club towel to wash the cleanser off.",

Back acne for: \\~2 years\n\nTreatments (past + current): • Lots of oral antibiotics as a teenager • Currently on oral antibiotics again from my GP for the back acne • Adapalene gel at the moment • Previously used tretinoin (helped a bit but didn’t clear it) • Was on isotretinoin (Accutane) about 10 years ago for facial acne – I didn’t have back acne back then. My derm is now suggesting Accutane again.\n\nLifestyle / hygiene: • Eat fairly clean, exercise regularly • Shower straight after workouts • Change into clean clothes after sweating • Wash bed sheets 1–2x per week • Use a gentle cleanser on my back (no scrubs) • Not using moisturiser on my back at the moment – some moisturisers seemed to break me out • Sometimes my back feels itchy after washing, so I’m worried I might be irritating my skin barrier\n\nExtra context: • I sweat a lot – even when I’m sitting still and not hot, my armpits/back/chest get sweaty • My recent blood tests showed higher oestradiol (E2) • I take finasteride for hair loss (DHT blocker)\n\nWhat I’m looking for: • Has anyone had similar back acne + sweating + hormones/finasteride, and what actually helped you long-term? • For those who went on Accutane for body/back acne, did it help the back specifically? • Any body washes/moisturisers you’ve found that don’t make things worse, especially if your skin is easily irritated/itchy? For the scars and dark marks, did anything help on the back or was it mainly time + stopping new breakouts?\n\nI’ll attach pictures of my back in different lighting.\n\nI know nobody can diagnose me here – I’m just trying to get real experiences and see what’s worth discussing further with my derm.\n\nThanks in advance.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

I’ve been bleaching since 2018 regularly. At first, I thought, maybe i just didn’t see it because my hair was so light. However, i think i would have noticed how dry and splotchy my scalp was if it looked like it did now.\n\nI’ve been doing a very light brown dye over my highlights, trying to heal my hair without major changes, and I do live in an area where the temperature drastically dropped what seems like overnight. Could the combination of the two send my scalp out of wack? Just the dye? It’s really bad tonight after washing and blow drying, and i just don’t know what to do to fix it without harming my hair further or using a shampoo that could harm the color, texture, etc.\n\nMy mom deals with terrible dandruff, but she says it only started after she had children (sorry mom &amp; only mentioning if that could be helpful).\n\nJust looking for advice because i’m extremely self conscious, and i don’t know what to do.",
