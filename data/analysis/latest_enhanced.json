I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "Hello dear curly heads!\n\nI have grown my hair long for about 4 years now and I think it suits me way better than the very short hair I had all the years before. I didn't use conditioner back than, so they were very dry.\n\nBUT: Sometimes it really gets on my nerves. If they are open, they tend to hang in my face. I cannot see anything left and right of me and it is annoying in my opinion. It also is not good in my job (videographer, I have to often change my head position, put on headphones etc.). That's why I have them to a half bun like seen in the pictures most of the time. This was also my main goal a while ago: The Jon Snow style. And I think I wear it pretty well. They are just way too long in the back, right? I also think the top might be too long, because the bun is very big (but that could be because of the curls?). \n\nMy problem is, that I tend to look too female with longer hair. I am thin and also big. With long hair, I often get the feeling of not beeing looked at as a man and that's making me feel uncomfortable (especially with open hair).\n\nMy routine:\n\n\\- Wash 2x per week\n\n\\- I use shampoo 2x (Alverde, a cheap one from DM in Germany without any bad things in it)\n\n\\- Conditioner (also the same company) and brush my hair with it in\n\n\\- Dry it a bit with a t-shirt or microfibre\n\n\\- Put in Aloe Vera leave in conditioner (Herbal Essences)\n\n\\- Put in gel and scrunch (I now have one of Rossmann, Isana)\n\n\\- Dry with a diffusor and I try to keep my hair not in the face but back. I sometimes put in a hair band)\n\n\\- I don't dry it completely because I tend to get frizz that way. So I let it air dry the rest.\n\n\\- I sleep with not fully dry hai and I do not use a satin pillow, but I don't think that makes any big problems here.\n\n\\- Sometimes I make them wet and use a product like leave in in the morning.\n\nSo here comes my question:\n\nDo these long hair suit me better than the short ones? Are they TOO long? Should I just cut those in the back a bit more? \n\nOr should I shorten them even more? \n\nThank you everyone!",

      "content": "South Korea’s president, **Lee Jae Myung**, recently sparked national debate by suggesting that [hair-loss treatments should be considered for public health insurance coverage](https://www.chosun.com/english/world-en/2025/12/21/ZXPATQA5WFB3TCR45K5XWWTDQE/).\n\nAt a policy briefing, he pointed out that young people are paying into a universal healthcare system while receiving no support for a condition that directly affects confidence, employability, and mental wellbeing in one of the most competitive societies on earth.\n\nSome context matters here.\n\nIn South Korea, nearly [**98% of young people believe physical attractiveness provides social advantages**](https://gonggam.korea.kr/newsContentView.es?mid=a12603000000&amp;section_id=NCCD_PUBLISH&amp;content=NC002&amp;news_id=c0ff52fc-312e-4a35-9353-edee5796e8d3), and estimates suggest **around 10 million people experience hair loss**. The domestic treatment market is already worth roughly **₩188 billion**, which means people are paying anyway; just privately, unevenly, and often late.\n\nFor me what’s interesting is not whether hair loss *should* be covered but what this debate reveals about how we still frame hair loss.\n\nMost healthcare systems treat hair loss as “cosmetic,” even though:\n\n* stress-induced shedding is linked to systemic illness and inflammation  \n* [autoimmune hair loss is, by definition, a medical condition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430848/)\n* [androgenetic alopecia correlates with mental health burden](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10084176/), especially in younger men  \n\nWhen hair loss is ignored, people don’t stop suffering. They just self-medicate, delay diagnosis, or seek care only after damage is harder to reverse.\n\nOf course, South Korea isn’t saying hair loss is fatal but at the same tinme it’s acknowledging that in real life, **biology and social pressure interact**, and pretending otherwise doesn’t make the problem disappear.\n\nWhether public coverage is the right solution is debatable. But the fact that a head of state is even framing [hair loss as a quality-of-life and mental health issue](https://www.washingtontimes.com/sponsored/bullying-acceptance-hair-transplant-changed-life/) is a signal worth paying attention to.\n\nCurious how people here feel:  \n*Is hair loss still “cosmetic,” or are we overdue for a more honest medical classification?*\n\n***References:*** \n\n* *Telogen Effluvium – StatPearls (NIH) — reactive hair shedding after physical or metabolic stress.* \n* *Aukerman EL &amp; Jafferany M.

      "content": "Hey! I am seeking advice regarding my skincare routine, I am new to skincare.\n\n(I don't post a lot, apologies in advance if this isn't reddit worthy!)\n\nI'm a 21 F, I've got a relatively healthy skin, can be a bit dry during winter and during summer/spring it can get a bit oily. I am looking to get products that will help me with getting a smooth, vibrant and healthier face with no bumps if possible\n\nI essentially got 2 full sized products, and The Littles 6.0 as I heard it's a good starter pack to get.\n\nI am open to any recommendations, my skin can be quite sensitive so I need products that will work for all skin types as I get breakouts depending on product.\n\n\\* My current setup is all drunk elephant as I am aware you can use it safely to create ''skincare cocktails''.\n\nCurrently I am using:\n\nDrunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Cleanser  \nC FIRMA (From drunk elephant)  \nAmino Rain Glasswater Serum  \nProtini Polypeptide Cream (from Littles)  \nLala Retro whipped cream moisturiser\n\nAnd the bundle Littles 6.0 so I use whatever the bundle has.\n\nI do exfoliation nights as well, so I use the TLC framboos.\n\nI will write down my routine at the moment.\n\nAM ROUTINE (EVERY DAY)\n\n1. Cleanse\n\nDrunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Cleanser Use a small amount Lukewarm water only 2.C FIRMA treatment: 1 pump of C-Firma to the skin\n\n1. Hydrate / Glow\n\nAmino Rain Glasswater Serum 1–2 pumps Apply on slightly damp skin\n\n1. Moisturize\n\nProtini Polypeptide Cream (from Littles) / Lala Retro | OR BOTH Peptides help smooth texture over time\n\n1. (Optional glow)\n\nMix 1 drop D-Bronzi into Protini if you want warmth/glow\n\n1. Sunscreen (MANDATORY)\n\nNot optional if you want smooth skin (any SPF you like)\n\nNON-EXFOLIATION NIGHTS (5× per week)\n\n1. Cleanse\n\nBeste No. 9\n\n1. Hydrate\n\nAmino Rain Glasswater Serum\n\n1. Moisturize\n\nLala Retro Whipped Cream\n\n1. OPTIONAL (2–3 nights/week only)\n\nVirgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil 1 drop Mix into Lala Retro OR press on top This helps barrier repair + glow, but don’t overuse. Non-Exfoliation Nights (5× per week) Nights 1 &amp; 2 — with Virgin Marula Oil Cleanse → Beste No. 9 Treatment → C-Firma Fresh Hydration → Amino Rain Glasswater Serum Moisturize → Lala Retro Whipped Cream Oil (optional) → Virgin Marula Oil, 1 drop, press on top Nights 3, 4 &amp; 5 — without oil Cleanse → Beste No. 9 Treatment → C-Firma Fresh Hydration → Amino Rain Glasswater Serum Moisturize → Lala Retro Whipped Cream\n\nPM ROUTINE — ROTATE NIGHTS EXFOLIATION NIGHTS (2× per week ONLY) First-Time TLC Night — Step-by-Step\n\n1. Cleanse\n\nUse Beste No. 9 Lukewarm water, gentle, no scrubbing Pat skin slightly damp or fully dry depending on instructions: TLC works on dry skin\n\n1. Apply TLC Framboos\n\nShake bottle (if needed) Use 1 pump for your whole face Apply thin, even layer Avoid eye area\n\n1. Moisturize Immediately\n\nApply Lala Retro Whipped Cream (thin layer) Do not mix with Glasswater serum or Marula oil tonight — keep it simple This seals hydration and protects the barrier\n\n1. Avoid Morning Products Tonight\n\nSkip serum + oil tonight Do not apply sunscreen tonight (obviously), but use SPF tomorrow morning\n\nTLDR :\n\n* 21F, new to skincare, skin is mostly healthy (dry in winter, oily in summer)\n* Current routine: Drunk Elephant products + Littles 6.0 bundle\n* AM: Cleanse &gt; C-Firma &gt; Serum &gt; Moisturizer &gt; SPF\n* PM: Cleanse &gt; Serum &gt; Moisturizer, plus TLC Framboos 2×/week for exfoliation\n* Goals: Smooth, healthy, vibrant skin with no bumps\n* Looking for advice: Is my routine balanced? Am I overcomplicating? Missing anything?",

I grew out half of my hair, so I had a nice dark \"background\". I wanted to keep it mostly dark, with some touches of blonde with ombre effect. I said I do not want many foils and thin highlights, but a few chunky, asymmetrical ones. I gave the attached picture as reference. What I got was many thin highlights or a regular balyage,  but starting pretty low in the back. Minimal dimensions and no ombre effect.  This is especially disappointing because it took me so long to grow out my darker hair. Why do hairdressers have a hard time using less foils? \nI am attaching a few pics from different lighting, i also tried to see if it looks better with curls. (It is a bit) \nDo you think I am overreacting? Can this be fixed? How could I communicate this?\nThank you in advance. ",

      "content": "Hey guys! Just a little rant about my hair journey. Advice is appreciated! Also I just wanted to put this one product out there because I have NEVER seen anyone talk about it!!!!\n\nI have been straightening my hair, or at least neglecting my curly hair almost all my life. I used to be a 3A pattern. There was a very short period of time when I was 12 where I tried to take care of it naturally, and as far as growing up, I was always in braids because my mom didn’t really know what to do with it. In the last 2 years, I have lost a substantial amount of hair due to health reasons—and I lost a a significant amount particularly at the nape/neck area bottom of my hair and following up to my ears. and on top of this I bleached it, so the thought of trying to wear my hair curly scared me even more because its so thin I thought I would look like a scraggly old dog (I kinda do lol).\n\nFor 5 weeks now, I am heat free and trying to get my natural hair back. Ive made good progress! I would say I currently have 2C hair (on a good day where it behaves) when at the start it barely held a curl. Ive changed alot of my habits, I no longer sleep with it down, I oil my hair, dermaroll, braid it, have a silk scarf, silk pillowcase + bonnet, rosemary water, scalp massages, and taking Omega 3 supplements, prenatals (Im serious, they help! Look it up haha), and pumpkin seed + saw palmetto oil. Ive started to only brush my hair in the shower with conditioner in it. I wash my hair with Marc anthony shampoo and condition with marc anthony light volume conditioner, and love your curls deep conditioner once in a while, and i bought a buuuuuunch of hairmasks im cycling through. I have cut my ends and gave myself some face framing layers.\n\nBecause my hair is thin AND fine, it gets weighed down easily. I bought an insane amount of new products to cycle through and figure out what my hair likes. My current Routine and products is as follows:\n\n\\-Pea sized Marc anthony leave in (if i feel that my hair is dry, otherwise the conditioner in the shower will do because my hair is quite soft/soft finish)\n\n\\-Alberto European extra hold styling gel (NOT ALBERTO BALSAM! THIS IS THE PRODUCT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT!)\n\n\\-Love your curls mousse in my roots, and marc anthony mousse for lengths. Yes I do gel before mousse.\n\nI section the crown of my head and brush style, while the rest of my hair i just simply rake and scrunch, then i flip over all sides and just scrunch scrunch scrunch, microfiber towel, and then straight to cup diffusing upside down and then flipping side to side, then finally upright (I find hover diffusing doesnt work out too well for me).\n\nThese are the products that I find work for me out of the other ones I have cycled through and by the way spent so much money on.\n\nI tried A LOT of popular gels. All of them. And then I found the Alberto european one at the bottom of one of my vanity drawers. I must have picked it up 6 years ago when I was trying to take care of my hair and just took the first gel I saw off the shelves.\n\nWhen I tell you, this gel does NOT weigh my hair down (Which, by the way, is INCREDIBLE, because my hair gets weighed down even just by the lightest leave ins ?!) AND it gives me such an amazing hold AND a gel cast if I wish to have one !!!! Wow. Like, I promise, this is a gel thats unheard of and you cant find a single search result for it, but trust me! I love it. It may work for you if you have fine thin hair like me, and it worked well even at the beginning when my hair barely wanted to hold a damn thing. Ill provide a picture.\n\nAnyways, I’m still trying to figure my hair out and I definitely still have a long way to recovering it. Any advice for repairing damaged curls would be soososososo greatly appreciated, and tips for fine/thin curly hair haha still not super mastered at that.\n\n ",

      "content": "so I've just started threading my forehead and eyebrows, and waxing my upper lips since November. I've kind of thick hair even on my skin. My mom says my thick hair is because I shaved my face with my father's razor when I was a kid. But I guess it's mostly genetic, anyway.\n\nI go to this local parlour in my mohalla. All the while she is threading my eyebrows she always complain about how thick my hair is. I mean girl that is why I'm here! \n\nThen she'll suggest I just thread my upper lips also. But I tell her to wax it only. Guess what she did today. She was melting the wax for half an hour. Without waiting for the wax to cool down or anything she applied the hot boiling wax on my face. Oh my god it hurt and stung like crazy. And because the wax was too liquid-y, it slipped and fell on my chest. I'm so annoyed rn. I was not crying but tears kept falling out of my eyes. \n\nMY SKIN PEELED OFF BECAUSE OF HOW HOT THE WAX WAS!! \n\nI'm never going back again. I'm going to learn how to take care of my face myself. I hate her. I hate her. I hate her.\n\nAnd just for the context I'm not insecure about my facial hair but because I've thick and dense hair on my face. My face becomes really itchy and i hate it. \n\nI can't wait to earn and get everything lasered. ",

I’m not totally sure but I’ll input a picture of my hair. I do have very mixed curls, in the front my curls are really curly and then in the back they look almost wavy. I would love it if anyone could help me find some cheap shampoo and conditioners that could be beneficial for my hair. Thank you all!! Sorry if the photo isn’t very clear\n\nFor my routine, I use Marc Anthony’s Strictly Curls 3x Moisture shampoo and I use Skala Mais Cachos as my conditioner. I wash my hair around 2-3 times a week. After showering, I apply Skala Maracuja as a leave-in and let it air dry. I don’t use any oils, but sometimes if my hair gets too frizzy, I apply some random argan oil I found at the drug store.\n\n(Also don’t mind my grey hair, I have a birth mark) ",
