My hair loss treatment journey is kinda funny because I only noticed I was thinning considerably because I had just gotten a buzzcut due to my best friend passing away April this year and one of the things he wanted me to do the most was getting a buzz cut. \n\nAfter buzzing I noticed how bad it was and hopped initially on both topical 5% minoxidil and finasteride, I got pretty good results within 2 months but I ditched minoxidil because it was just too inconvenient to use, y’all know that. While I was afraid I was going to lose all the ground I had gained back, I didn’t! So luckily I was able to maintain everything. As far as side effects is concerned, I haven’t experienced much difference, however during the first 2-3 weeks my sex drive was through the roof, I was horny all the time, but that decreased back to what I consider a normal level. 0 changes. Thank God lol\n\nPlan on taking it for life as I look much better with a full head of hair. I’m grateful for my best friend Lucas, if it wasn’t because of the buzzcut I’d probably never realize how important hair is to me. Hair all day every day!!!!\n\nSorry for the long text! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me anything!",

      "content": "This might be a stupid post to make but I don’t know who else to ask. Whenever I go to the hairdresser I ask for rounded layers and lots of them. Recently I went to get a proper curly cut (only person in town who does it) after searching once again. I cannot for the life of me see layers except at the very bottom. My mom keeps telling me I need to get more layers than what I have right now. It’s just not round in the back the way I wanted it. On YouTube there’s a woman (Marina Ann - two of her videos showing what I mean: https://youtube.com/shorts/irIaGDE11MU?si=YV3Jr3KhkTdLAjx0\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/2fafQ4UEKlA?si=Gs_Tr6Cq0tXpPfXM) cutting her own hair with lots of layers and I always show her video and tons of pictures at every hair appointment but it just never translates. \n\nCan anyone help me out if these are lots of decent layers? The hairdresser took off so much of my hair last time and I feel like she gave me a cut she gives everyone else. I asked for curtain bangs and had to cut those myself afterwards essentially because she didn’t cut them short enough like the old picture of my curtain bangs I once had which I showed to her. From some angles the bottom looks a bit sparse. I was thinking I might just try and cut it myself next time considering that these cuts are expensive. I’m just a bit wary since I tried a Wayne Tuggle haircut on my own and the bottom was super uneven. First few pictures attached show my hair after the cut once I’ve been styling it myself and the last couple (where it’s more defined) show right at my hair appointment. \n\nRoutine (new one - I’m still figuring out how to use all of these but my hair does look better):\n\nShampoo: innersense pure radiance or clarity hairbath\nConditioner: innersense color radiance conditioner\nStylers: innersense quiet calm curl control, innersense I create volume and I create hold, sometimes I create finish as well. \n\nThese are all very concentrated so I only need to use a tiny amount. I usually just rake the products through with tons of water and then scrunch a bit and get the excess water out with a towel. I switch between air drying and diffusing. Now that it’s cold, I diffuse (definitely not as neat or methodically as others though). \n\nI’d really appreciate someone’s thoughts! \n\n",

      "content": "I (26F) had been a sufferer of “adult acne” for years and I got really into skincare about 5 years ago. It took me a long time to get it “right”, it seems like everything I used made me break out more until I found a pretty solid routine, which I used morning and night.\n\nBut no matter what I did, I was still getting pimples and breaking out regularly. I was vigilant about my skincare routine, which was a gentle, high moisture routine and I exfoliated once a week. I kept my towels and pillowcases incredibly clean. I tried new products, pimple patches, face masks, no matter what I did I couldn’t get my skin to clear up and my pores to get smaller. I thought, maybe I’m just not wealthy enough to have good skin?\n\nThen I got my wisdom teeth removed this July. I wasn’t able to do my usual skincare routine, and I was super stressed about breaking out like crazy!! But…. I didn’t. The pimples went away, even though I was only washing my face every two days or so. Out of stress and curiosity, I stopped doing my routine morning and night. First I only did it in the morning…. But then it gradually shifted to once every 2-3 days when I realized that I wasn’t harming my skin at all.\n\n4 months in to this, I do my usual routine once every 2-3 days. I don’t put anything on my skin between washes, not even sunscreen (yada yada skin cancer, wrinkles, I don’t care). I don’t wear makeup except for special occasions, so my skin is clear and free most of the time. And my face has never been healthier. I barely get pimples at all, like maybe one every week and it’s tiny. The pores that I thought were massive are starting to close up. My skin doesn’t feel overly greasy or dry or tight— it feels nice and healthy.\n\nI’m realizing now that the capitalism was doing what it was supposed to— make me buy more products. Like highkey I don’t even trust dermatologists anymore, because they still advertise products and daily skincare routines, which I trusted for years until I made this change. I’m realizing I wasted years of my life, time, and money stressing about my skin for nothing. Less is more. I know this now, and I guess that’s what matters. I hope this helps someone break out of the cycle like I did… truly.",

Not Your Mother's Activating Curl Talk Mousse — Apply (lots) using prayer hands, brush through, scrunch, then microplop until hair is no longer sopping.\n4. Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Sculpting Gel — Lightly glaze over hair upside down, then each side. Microplop until hair is damp.\n5.

I do have decent density, and when my hair is light and fluffy there looks like I have a TON of it, but it can easily become very flat. When I air dry and let my natural waves come through, I get pretty good volume, but I’ve gotten blowouts in the salon and my hair was very sleek and shiny but had lost all volume and looked very flat/thin. \n\nI was instructed to come to the salon with clean, dry hair. \n\nI am a complete rookie when it comes to hair styling and only ever air dry my hair. \n\nI’m looking for the suggestions on techniques on how to dry my hair prior to the styling appointment, to set my hair up for success in having the most volume possible. \n\nShould I just rough dry it upside down, brush it and call it a day? \n\nShould I try to smooth it out with a round brush? Or will that be counter intuitive if they are trying to curl it? \n\nShould I just air dry it as usual? \n\nThank you for your help! ",

I'm struggling to find a happy medium between weighted down curls and too frizzy curls. \n\nFor some background: \nmy hair is on the finer side, I do have a lot of hair on my head, just thin strands. My curls are also 100% white lol, they are not multicultural. \n\nWhat I've tried: \nPicture #1 in the grey shirt, is day 3 curls only refreshed with a steamer, no additional product. \nPicture #2 is day 1 curls with the following products on: pillow soft curls cream custard, the doux moose def texture foam, and not your mother's hair gel. The product was put on in sections, with a curl brush, diffused with a diffuser. (my usual routine). \n\nMy problem:\nI noticed that when using the products I mentioned, I feel that my curls are weighed down and I can't get any volume and they become frizzy by the end of the day. When I wear no products, I like the volume and softness, but it goes frizzy too fast. I also cannot pinpoint my hair type (2a, 2b, ect), which may help me. \n\nAre there any product recommendations out there that fix this issue? If you had this issue, what are you doing to stop it? Any tips for me and my journey? Keep in mind ive only been wearing it curly out the house for a few months now. \n\nThank you in advance! 💗\n\n\n",

      "title": "Why is my hair still breaking?",
      "content": "Let me begin by saying that I’ve done a lot of research, invested in a ton of products and changed my routine, including supplements/diet. \n\nChief complaints:\n-Hair thinning/fallout (not hair loss. No patches of hair loss)\n-Breakage \n\n*by October 1, I had implemented serious changes in my routine and started documenting. \n\nHistory: \n\nI have very fine, wavy hair. I have always had to treat it as damaged just in order to maintain its health as much as possible. \n\nI have noticed that my hair has thinned over the years. The hair thinning seems to be correlated with bouts of stress. The problem is that it just seems to get worse because the hair never comes back. I lift weights, so I pay attention to diet, prioritizing protein, taking collagen and supplements. \n\nI stopped fasting. That could have been adding to the problem. \n\nI believe that my stress levels are normal now. I’m not having any symptoms of high stress that I’ve had in the past. \n\nI suspected that I may have low iron, so I started on iron pills (made from organ meat) every other day for better absorption. I feel better, but have not noticed a difference in my hair yet. \n\nI also take high amounts of biotin, even copper and other minerals, amino acids and vitamins that are said to improve hair quality/growth. I have been tracking and did notice that biotin makes my hair grow much faster. \n\n*Are there any supplements you tested that worked that I may be missing?\n\nHabit changes:\nHair washing:\n-Growing up, all the “master stylists” recommended that when it comes to hair, the less you wash, the better. I washed my hair about twice a week for many years and noticed the health of my hair was obviously declining. \n-After much research, I found that oily scalp/not washing your hair can cause DHT accumulation in scalp and hair fallout. I also began to see women sharing their hair journey who said that they too did not wash their hair every day and switching to washing every day changed their hair for the better. \nSo, I made the switch and started washing my hair daily. \n-I get plenty of sleep most days\n\nHeat: I stopped using the hot iron. I use the new Dyson hair dryer and I do use the smoothing attachment instead of the iron. I think the investment in Dyson is worth it but I’m wondering if the smoothing attachment is just as bad as the iron? \n-I let my hair dry a little before drying it upside down and then finishing up in sections. \n\nProducts:\nI almost always use high-end products. I look at brand, ingredients, functionality and reviews. I’ve had success finding good products that have seemed to improve my hair. \n\n-I have found that regardless how great a product may be on your hair, even if it made a big difference, hair seems to always need different things to keep it super healthy. So, I find good products and rotate them. Giving my hair a well-rounded arsenal to work with. I do especially see a difference when using bond-building technology. Keratin has also made a difference when used correctly. \n\n-Heat protection- I always use leave-in conditioner after I towel dry and heat protection \n\n-I add oil to my hair most days and nights for extra hydration. My hair definitely breaks more if I don’t but my hair also can’t handle much product without getting greasy, so sometimes I just use oil at night. \n\n-Keratin- I added keratin products to my routine. Using a keratin shampoo/conditioner every 3rd wash. I know that using too little or too much keratin product can cause breakage. \n-I also try to leave conditioner in my hair for as long as I can before I rinse.  It seems to really improve my hair. Especially leaving overnight seems to always improve my hair. Usually I leave it in for 20 minutes to 1 hour. \n\n-I started scalp massage with product every day. It’s been about 2 months and I see no difference or new hair growth as of yet. Saw no difference with 1 month of nutrafol massaged into scalp. Now using Kerastase. \n\nBreakage: \nTo my surprise, my hair still seems to be breaking and I just cannot imagine what my hair needs in order to prevent this. I bought the Olaplex shampoo, pre-shampoo treatment and leave-in conditioner to see if that helps. I have heard good things regarding their treatment. \n\nSplit ends- \nMy hair doesn’t seem to have split ends. Maybe a few when I look, but it actually seems healthy upon examination. \n\nCut: Do I still need to trim my hair to prevent split ends? \n\nTime: is it possible that I just need to give it a couple more months to see changes? \n\nSuggestions: Is it possible that I am missing something? What has worked for you to grow more hair/thicker hair and prevent breakage? \n\nHelpful comments please! \nThank you! ",

The texture is a bit sticky at first, kind of like a gel, but it spreads easily and absorbs after a minute or two. I started using it because my skin was getting red and flaky from the weather, and I noticed it really helped calm things down. My skin feels softer, looks smoother, and some of my old acne marks have started to fade. Makeup also goes on a lot better now.\n\nThe main pros are how gentle and hydrating it is. It helps repair irritation without stinging and works well even when my skin feels sensitive. The ingredient list is simple, and it layers nicely with other products. The downsides are that it takes time to see real results. It’s not a quick fix, and it can feel a little tacky, especially if you have oily skin or live in a humid climate. Overall, it’s a great option if you want to focus on hydration and barrier repair rather than aggressive acne treatment.",

Over time, I've had more and more pigmentation, as you can see, and I've tried things like tretinoin cream, but it only seemed to help remove pimples after they formed; it's not a permanent treatment, and it never helped with the pigmentation. On the underside of my nose, there's a pigmented area that looks like a burn, and pimples often appear there. I went to 3 doctors. The first 2 recommended doxycycline 100mg, but I didn't want to use it because of its side effects and because I saw many people say that acne comes back after you stop treatment. Then I went to a third one, and he told me to get Accutane. He then told me to get a blood sample from the lab so he could analyze it and give me confirmation on whether to use it or not Results came out good and he told me to use it. Two pills after dinner, moisturizer, sunscreen, and lip balm. Should I start it? I tried to make the pigmentation visible in the photo, but it's not very clear. Usually, I see Accutane being prescribed for cases that look much more severe than mine, which is why I'm hesitant. It apparently causes Aneamia too.",

The first pic is my hair after the high lift before toning. The second image is my hair after toning with 1/2 Wella T14 1/2 Wella T11 and 10 volume developer. I want to avoid as much damage as possible which is why I used the high lift instead of bleach, but my hair is definitely still too warm for my liking. What should I do: more toner, lighten with bleach, semi permanent dye? The last image is more of the tone I want to achieve in the end. Any help is appreciated!!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

I used to remove make up/cleanse by using makeup wipes and then micellar water, but I later learned that makeup wipes are bad for your skin. Now I either use only micellar water that removes makeup, or sometimes I’ll use water and cleansing balm beforehand (but I don’t like it). I don’t have acne or major skin issues — just dry skin.
