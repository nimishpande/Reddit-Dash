I use it after showering and I’m good for the entire day. \n\nEasily a 10/10 WRP!!\n\nNivea Pearl &amp; Beauty Roll On:\n\nVery average. It was the first one i used (canon event). formula feels slightly sticky for the first few minutes. No sweat control, it just mixes the smell with the deo’s. And no visible brightening. \n\n6/10 WNRP because there are better options now.\n\nRexona Shower Fresh Roll On:\n\ndecent for odour control but way too strong for sensitive skin gave me a slight burning sensation especially on freshly shaved days. works if you need something heavy, but it’s definitely not gentle. \n\n7.5/10 WNRP for me personally cause i have too sensitive skin.",

After that I use not your mothers curl cream, gel and mousse with some random hair oil I bought at some random beauty store. I then let it air dry. \n\nHello, I started my hair journey about a month ago. I have straightened my hair probably everyday for the past 3 years as well as dyed and bleached it for about a decade now. I always hated my hair due to it getting puffy. I recently found out it gets puffy because I have wavy hair and my hair is dead so it can't hold its \"wave\" pattern.\n\nI did some research and found so many people saying to use not your mothers products, so I bought them. I got the curl cream, gel and mousse. I started to use it but noticed it made my hair hard and crunchy. It also made my hair look wet all the time which I hate. I looked online and it said I was using too much product, so l used less; but it still happen. I did some more research and it said it was cause of the mousse so I stopped using it but It would still happen so I stopped using the gel.... and it stilled happened. Another thing I hate is how stringy it looks....\n\nI just came here for some advice. Am i still using too much product? Am I not using the right products for my hair? Is my hair just not naturally wavy and i'm forcing a pattern that's why it gets like this?",

      "content": "I am an adult but I'm living at home with my parents right now (gap year before grad school/figuring out wtf to do with my life). As any good skincare enthusiast I care about sun protection and wear sunscreen whenever I go out. Problem is that my mom believes that sunscreen isn't necessary and is more likely to cause cancer then no sunscreen. Not sure why she believes this, she's not anti vax, she believes in science (literally encouraged me to pursue bio), and holds otherwise very normal beliefs. She's not fully anti sunscreen, she thinks it's only necessary if you're going to the beach/pool but only if you're prone to getting sunburned. She usually makes a comment if she sees me putting on sunscreen and often expressed concern about it interfering with vitamin D production. But it's not like I'm getting zero sun exposure and sunscreen doesn't interfere with vitamin D production anyways.   \nShe does also think like 90% of my skincare is unnecessary because she has skin of absolute fucking steel and does fine with DOUBLE WASHING her face with bar soap and using just a lightweight moisturizer 😭. My poor sensitive and dry skin cannot handle it. Washing my face with bar soap for a few months absolutely wrecked my skin and turned me from just being acne prone to having moderate acne that needed treatment.    \nI'm also a little concerned about her views on sunscreen in regards to her behavior. She likes to garden and will be outside for upwards of 6 hours a day. Granted our yard is pretty shaded and she usually avoids going out midday because it's too hot. She does wear a mask so most of her face is covered but I'm trying to get her to add in a hat. I've been stressing the effects sun exposure has on skin aging and that has seemed to gotten through to her a little bit. She's not concerned about anti aging but me pointing out skin damage that could be attributed to the sun (in pictures not on her) has seemed to help. Still not enough for her to believe in sunscreen though 🫠\n\n\nEdit 1/2: I don't make comments about her skincare. Anytime I've suggested something to her has been in response to something she's said (I think telling her to wear a hat in the summer when she complains about the sun is reasonable). I don't tell her to wear sunscreen. Any comments she makes about me wearing sunscreen have been out of nowhere. For the most part she leaves me alone. I'm just complaining and want to wear my sunscreen in peace but she won't let me be if she sees me put it on.\n\n\nEdit 2/2: I am now aware that sunscreen can interfere with vitamin D production but I still think me wearing sunscreen on just my face and neck isn't gonna change much. Also why is this post getting so much interaction I was just airing out my thoughts and complaints 😭",

      "content": "Hey y’all,\n\nI’m a 24yo struggling to understand what’s actually wrong with my skin and how to fix it. I seem to have a mix of dry and oily skin, but it kind of behaves in a really confusing way.\n\nIssues that I have observed:\n\n• Right after I step out of the shower, my face feels tight and very dry and if I don’t apply anything, it dries out badly and I break out.\n\n• But if I apply moisturizer and sunscreen, my skin gets oily quickly, pores on my cheeks look very large, and acne scars, sebaceous filaments on my nose look much more visible (it even makes my nose look swollen lol)\n\nMy current routine:\n\nAM: • CeraVe 2% salicylic acid cleanser • CeraVe light moisturizer • Neutrogena SPF 50 sunscreen\n\nMidday: • Hyaluronic acid cleanser\n\nPM (rotating): • Neutrogena retinol cream • The Ordinary hyaluronic acid • The Ordinary salicylic acid serum\n\nI try to:\n\n• Drink 3-4L water daily • Eat clean, avoid greasy foods\n\nWhat I don’t seem to understand are:\n\n1)Is this dehydrated skin, damaged barrier, or true combination skin? 2)Why do moisturizer and sunscreen make my skin look oilier and pores more visible? Am I over-exfoliating or using too many actives? 3)How can I hydrate my skin without making it greasy or emphasizing texture?\n\nI’d really appreciate any guidance on what I should simplify, remove, or add.\n\nThank you!",

I am debating between a thermal brush vs a blow dryer brush to blow out/style my hair and bangs. I am looking for recommendations for something okay for beginners that ideally is minimally damaging. \n\nIn the photo are a few from Sephora that I am considering.

Pretty nice, but the white cast is pretty bad sometimes, especially with a little stubble.\n\nI randomly used a sunscreen I had in my travel bag one day, and I really liked it on my face after my morning routine (Cleanser, serum, then Moisturizer with SPF).\n\n**Is this bad to use daily as my morning moisturizer? Reason I ask is because it looks like its just purely a suncreen, and no moisturizing qualities.**\n\nSince I still know very little about skincare, I would like to ask you pro's if this is ok?\n\nAt night I cleanse, Retinol, and CeraVe Night cream.

      "content": "\nHi guys, need some advice here. This is how my nose looks after my morning hydrating cream (KTW birch water mild facial cream, it has been discontinued so I need something else soon) and when I apply BB cream to it (it's from a local company called Nuoderm, it's very pigmented and otherwise very good on the rest of my face). It peels right off, and it's very hard to bring it to a stable state to accept coverage over it, obviously it gets red when I try to remove the skin that peels off.\nI tried Nyx glue primer, again it was flaky. Tried 2 primers from catrice, oil control and poreless blur, it behaved similarly. I don't know what to do to keep this under control for good. I usually apply vitamin C serum + niacinamide serum from the ordinary in the morning but I didn't have them with me this morning so I didn't apply them. I have to mention that very often it reacts like this with other products (concealer for example). Any advice, please? Can any primer help with this? The other primers I used were generally ok on the rest of my face and prevented the makeup from going cakey but not on my nose and on the sides of my nose. Thanks a lot in advance!",

      "content": "So i bought the ordinary peeling solution in November 2025 first week and when I used for the first time.....I was like, yes I found the one product which i can use of I want a instant glow, because it made my skin very clean. For context, I have normal skin with oily t zone and didn't have any pimples that time, but my face wasn't clear either. It had some small acne marks, and pores. I'm not saying peeling solution removed any of that, but for that week after using it, my face was brighter and it had that healthy glow. It was like an upper layer of skin of dead cells got removed (I know peeling solution is supposed to do that),I was so happy with it. And I used it after 10 days, the same thing happened, it gave me a glow. \n\nFast forward to the next time I used, nothing happened after I used it. I still got that tingling sensation the first time I used it, but there was no glow in my face. So i thought maybe it's because I was over exfoliating. So the next time I used was more than 2 weeks later. But still the same, there was no visible glow or any change at all. \n\nSo i want to know, what is actually happening here? Now all that peeling solution does is it kinda kills my one or two pimples which comes during periods. \nI searched in the internet for similar experiences, but found none. So if anyone have any idea regarding this please do share🥹\nI'm also attaching my skin right after I used the peeling solution for reference.",

I'm just a bit confused and was hoping people wouldn't mind me asking a similar question.\n\nI have had eye bags and dark circles forever. There are factors like night shifts, poor sleep, poor diet etc that have and do contribute. Assume I am doing by best currently to manage those areas.\n\nThere are so many buzzwords, Caffeine, vitamin c, retinol etc.\n\n**What I really want is a clear skincare routine with actual recommendations**. For example use these 5 products in this order at this time. I'd be really grateful for any advice.\n\nPosting from UK if people wish to link Amazon etc. Uploading a bad photo I just took as an example, but it's always an issue to some degree. For 30 years I had no routine. I currently use a facewash (sometimes) in shower if I remember. A moisturizer afterwards before going out (sometimes).\n\nI really would like to have a routine and have been upgrading my lifestyle/health routines from all angles and sticking with them. Hopefully you can make my skin routine the next success.\n\nTl;dr\n\n.Clear skincare routine with directions and timing  \n.Ideally the entire routine, not just 1 product you like  \n.Budget friendly but all recommendations welcome and appreciated.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi guys, \n\nI'll start off by saying I have 3C curly hair and my hair is quite thick, but manageable. I can usually braid it easily without too much effort and brush through it while wet. I've dyed my hair once a year ago and today, I went to a head spa. \n\n  \nThe spa involved shampoo, conditioner and this head oil as well as a massage and it lasted 60 minutes. After the treatment, I sat up from the basin and felt the back of my head which was all a huge lump. I couldn't even part any of it with my fingers. I have never felt my hair like this in my life, so at this point I started getting nervous, and the massage ladies couldn't speak english so we were desperately trying to communicate through translate. \n\nI was so overwhelmed I didn't want to be there any longer, so I went to another salon to ask them if they could fix it. (I still paid the price of the treatment). The other salon said that it was so matted and tangled that they'd have to cut it all off!!!!! At this point I was terrified. \n\nThe new salon employees told me to go back to the original head spa place and complain, so I returned with someone who could speak their language, and I was given a refund. They also told me to return tomorrow and her hairdresser friend would attempt to fix it, or she would pay for another to fix it. \n\nI just want to know is this fixable, my hair is half the length as usual and I cant even slightly part it. Its just the ends, not the roots? Or is the best option to really chop it all off.\n\nAny advice appreciated!!",

      "title": "At my wits end with my hair",
      "content": "This is a repost since I used incorrect terminology. \n\nHi so i'm at my wits end with my hair. Its velcroey most of the time and it dries very inconsistently, sometimes it will have great 2C-3A curls but most of the time it just looks like this stringy clumpy mess. Testing products is very overwhelming for me because everything i've tried in the past has given me inconsistent results if any. I really don't know what my hair wants. This week I straightened it and felt so jealous of people with straight hair cause it was so manageable but I don't have time to do that often.\n\nI recently got a pretty big haircut after having layered hair for a long time because layers just weren't working either, my hair would get suuuper tangled. Here are some routines and products I use/have used in the past:\n\nThrough 2024 I did this about once every 5 days:\n\nShea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine shampoo\n\nShea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine conditioner (leave in 3 minutes)\n\nShea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie (scrunching)\n\nPlopping for about 30 mins\n\nAir dry or (if I had time) diffusing\n\nThe first 2 times my hair looked amazing, I had an old tester of these products and my hair looked so good that I decided to buy them. After using them a few times it started to become clear that this was too heavy on my hair, particularly the Smoothie. The Smoothie would usually (though not always, as I said my hair does whatever it wants) leave my hair clumpy and almost sticky. If I slept on it it would just become this huge clump or mass even if I used an extremely (and I mean extremely) small amount. So I stopped using it. Then I continued using the same products but started using the Garnier Fructis Pistachio Cream as a leave in instead. The same thing happened to a lesser extent. It wasn't so much that my curls were weighed down, it was more so that they would stick to each other.\n\nI stopped using that too after trying to apply it on wet, damp and dry hair with no success.\n\nAfter this I became sorta apathetic, I bought a shampoo and some conditioner in bar format from an artisanal soap maker due to environmental concerns about plastic. I just use the shampoo twice and the conditioner for 3 minutes and that's it. I started doing this in hopes that a more simple routine would be better for my hair, I even tried co washing to no avail. As with the shea moisture products, my hair looked great the first day and then started looking bad again. I can post the ingredients of these products here cause they aren't from a big brand:\n\nThe shampoo contains:\n\nCoconut surfactants, silk protein, peruvian ginseng, castor oil, indian gooseberry, moringa, bhringaraj, vegetable inulin, pink clay, cosgard, d-panthenol and salvia and rosemary essential oils.\n\nThe conditioner contains:\n\nCocoa and coconut butter, jojoba oil, cetylic alcohol, vitamin E, d-panthenol, silk protein and lavender and lemon essential oils.\n\nIt's also important to mention that in the past, I have tried oiling my hair for about 2 hours before showering, using olive oil and castor oil. It didn't make much of a difference.\n\nI've also tried sleeping with a silk bonnet but my hair still looks super deformed and squished the next day, if I use a curl cream and sleep with the bonnet it looks even worse because it just becomes a huge mass as i mentioned before. It's also worth mentioning that diffusing, even in low heat and low power still makes my hair very frizzy.\n\nAfter the shea moisture issue I'm scared of buying expensive products that don't work for me and since I live in Europe some of the products recommended here are unavailable. I'm also boycotting amazon so I have a smaller window of affordable options.\n\nI struggle a lot with sensory issues pertaining washing my hair so I hate having too many products in it. I'm seriously at my wits end, I know I haven't done everything I can but I've had days where I spend so long on my hair just for it to look like this that t I just can't be bothered.\n\nI want some advice or success stories since finding products feels overwhelming, I don't know what to use or what my hair needs and everyone talks about so many things like amino acids and proteins and butters and oils that I just don't know where to even begin.\n\nSorry for the wall of text and for the rant I just wanted some advice.\n\n",

Currently I use a light cleanser, vitamin c serum, some oils, moisturizer, and SPF. Unfortunately I can't use retinol because I'm one of the rare few that gets migraines from it :/\n\nI've been doing a lot of research on acids (mostly lactic and glycolic), but a little overwhelmed by all the info! I'd love something that isn't too intense to start, and mostly to work on pores, texture, and hyperpigmentation. Does anyone have any holy grails??\n\nThanks so much!!",
