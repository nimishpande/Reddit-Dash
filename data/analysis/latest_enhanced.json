Its been 10 months since I started growing it. Discovered I have a pretty wavy/curly hair and started a curly hair routine. It was very difficult to maintain it and had to learn how to take care of it. I'm planning to grow it out for another 1-2 years and see how it goes. \n\nRoutine: Normal Shampoo, Dove Conditioner/Mask, Leave-in Conditioner while damp, Coconut Oil also to keep the make the hair weigh down. Otherwise it would get frizzy and reach for the ceiling lol.",

She doesn’t understand curly hair at ALL but she’s constantly making comments about my appearance. My hair being a point of contention whenever I visit.\n\nSo I was recently with family for my sisters graduation. While we’re waiting, a woman a few rows below us goes to sit down. My moms pokes me, leans over and says “wow! She has beautiful hair!” I stare at this woman’s hair (which is beautiful) and see all of the flaws my mom points out for my hair: dusts of halo frizz, wayward curls, etc… nothing wrong with it, but things people like my mother shame me over. Her hair type is JUST like mine, but her hair goes down mid back rather than my shoulder length. I say “Seriously? My hair is just like that and you insult it all the time!” She goes quiet for a moment, thinking, and then says “well, idk. It’s longer and it looks better on her.”\n\nJust can’t win.\n\nRoutine, since I still need to put one down I guess? Shampoo and conditioner is whatever, denman brush for styling, Aluram curl cream and air drying for finish.",

I'm envisioning an app that has a scanning option where you can scan you face for example and have any concerns identified ie. specific pimples, specific patches of hyperpigmentation, eczema etc. If anything is out of the ordinary, you will be ref'd to a dermatologist immediately; it could potentially even help with early serious skincare detections. It would then give you tailored treatments / how to apply them to treat those specific breakouts and accelerate your healing timeline. All of your scans are tracked and you can see pasts scans and get advice on what products, diet, lifestyle factors may be affecting your skin. You can also create a custom skincare budget and have products recommended to you that fit that budget. You can buy products directly through the app (maybe a discount?) and can also scan your existing products to see what works for you, how to use them and if anything is hazardous. There would also be a specialized ChatGPT for skincare in the app that you can ask any questions about your skin / general skincare. \n\nIt would be free to use with maybe a premium tier? Or completely free with monetization from in-app product purchases.\n\nWould you use it? Got any ideas? If I build an app like this, I wouldn’t want to do it without the input of the community.",

I’ve got autism and the social dynamics of the hairdressers confuses me and gives me a lot of anxiety.\n\nSo I’m trying to prepare myself and I have a question.\n\nThe hairdressers I choose is kinda small very accepting of different ppl and kinda laid back. The lady who owns it is always there and does the nails and is really nice. I’ll possibly be the only hair client in there. I’ve been there for nails before.\n\nWhen the staff are talking out loud across the room about stuff that peaks my interest is it rude to join in? Am I joining in on a private convo or not? Sometimes I think they’re trying to include me but I’m not sure so I stay silent but then I worry that’s being rude. \n\nIm getting a cut and ombré balayage with a mixture of bright colours needing bleached so feel I’m gonna be there for a few hours and it’s stressing me out!\n\n \n\n\n",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I would love recommendations to best remove them naturally if anyone has any knowledge or best products to cover them up. I already am using CeraVe skin renewing eye cream but haven’t seen much/any improvement in two months.\n\n.There’s also those red marks at the side of my eyes and a paler skin on the other sides.\n\n.I’m also conscious about my skin’s appearance in general. I’m quite pale and get a redness around my face.\n\nAt the moment my routine is:\n.wake up and have shower\n.use face wash, then put on eye cream and CeraVe moisturising cream (also Nivea tinted day cream and some concealer for my eyes if I’m meeting someone, shown in pic 4 and a less intense amount in 8 and 9 which were taken on the same day)\n.use face wash then eye cream, spot cream and moisturiser before bed\n\nThanks for reading, could really use some advice ",

Hardly eating anything nutitional mixed with immense stress I believe caused hair loss around my hair line and thinning. I also noticed when I shower I lose quite a lot of hair. My diet is almost back to normal so I'm able to absorb a lot more nutrients thankfully. There is some growth (I have a lot of baby hairs naturally but it seems to be even more lately)\n\nAfter becoming so sick all my vitamin levels went out of wack. I'm now taking: vitamin B50, C(1,000mg), D(3,000 IU, on the advice of a doctor), iron(100mg, every other day) and multiple pro and prebiotics. I also just placed an order for Jamieson hair skin nails vitamins. Just wondering if anyone else could help recommend me some good hair oils/masks that will help strengthen my hair and aid in the regrowth process :) I was looking at the ordinary multi-peptide oil but haven't purchased it yet! My hair leans on the oilier side. I also don't use heat on my hair, except for the occasional blowdry. Thanks!",

Now if i look up a video or routine or something for multi textured hair, the girl in the video will put some products in her hair, do a typical CG routine and all of a sudden it’s all the same texture all around. Like ummm…. This is just not the reality for me and makes me feel like my hair is not represented in this community. I know this is sort of a me problem but i just never know what to do with my hair, i know that it’s taken a lot for curly hair to be seen as acceptable in the workplace and whatnot, but i fear that will never be possible for me. I literally look like a mess all the time even if i put it in a low ponytail all the different textures stick out. Even if i try to straighten it it just doesn’t work for some reason, idk if im dumb or something but i can run the straightener over it over and over until it fries but my hair won’t be straight (i haven’t actually fried my hair dw) \n\ni mean does anyone have hair like this? What do you do with this to look presentable? The only thing that has sorta worked for me is growing it out to my hips so that the curlier textures were like stretched out if that makes sense but it’s not that long anymore\n\nMy routine is wash my hair and cry about it idk (i had to put a routine to post)",
