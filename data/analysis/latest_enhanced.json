      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Tried posting this in the wavy hair subreddit as my hair texture varies from a lose curl to a sad wave, but they keep removing my posts/ wouldn’t allow new ones to go through. Im hoping that someone knows how to deal with this.\n\nThis is my natural hair with the waves and everything, just a small amount of product. About 2a-2c on a good day? Why is it that no matter what I do the top of my head refuses to have any texture? I have the same issue with some other parts of my hair and then the mid section is incredibly wavy/curly. No matter what I do my hair ends up like this and im not confident wearing it like this in public — it looks greasy. I already have layers cut into my hair to try to reduce weight and use very minimal product. It gets actually greasy fast so I usually have to wash my hair every day or every other day. I have used so many different products and I get the same results no matter what I do. Am i just screwed to have hair that doesn’t work with me?\n\nMy routine: shampoo with either raw sugar’s moisture smoothie shampoo or the truly unruly shampoo (all over, my hair hates product buildup and I need a clean canvas). Then run either raw sugar’s the grow pro conditioner or the sensitive one conditioner (i get raw/itchy spots on two sections on my scalp) through all of my hair as if i avoid my roots they get greasy faster or my hair is too dry there and i get breakage. Then squish the conditioner out under hot or slightly cold water (depending on how i feel, a chemist was able to prove water temp does not matter in hair that much), and rinse almost all of the conditioner out. Squish being’s major no-free leave in for 2a-2c into my ends to prevent dryness, and squish hairitage’s play it cool heat protectant all over as I usually have to use heat products to make me look presentable. Lastly, squish in miss jessie’s jelly soft curls soft gel to try to get some definition. I usually just let it air dry as diffusing sometimes makes it worse, but my hair is still bad when I let it air dry. If its too wet (as it gives me sensory issues) i might scrunch the ends with a hair towel (i think its microfiber?).",

Right the only thing I’m doing is using La Roche- Posay double repair face moisturizer in the AM and PM, with the ordinary argon oil in the morning (hate this product tbh), and Kiehls midnight recovery concentrate at night. I have a newborn and a 2 year old so it just hasn’t been a priority, but I want to change that! \n\nI have really clear skin, not acne prone, not super sensitive, and again super dry. I just want to be doing more and having my skin look and feel it’s best. Money isn’t really an object, but I also don’t want to buy super expensive stuff just for the sake of it. But if there is a super bougie, must have, this will change your life, item- I’m there lol \n\nThis is roughly what I’m thinking- but would *love* advice or suggestions for products. Again I feel like I have no clue what I’m doing. \n\nAM: \n- **Cleanser**- cetaphil gentle skin cleanser (I currently use this but do not ever wash my face unless in the shower. But maybe I should start? Please don’t yell at me lol)  \n- **Toner**- first aid beauty hydrating toner (is there a better one? I have a sample of the Laneige one that came with a purchase, it also seems fine but obviously more expensive. Worth it? Better suggestions?) \n- **Vitamin c serum**- no clue what brand. I’ve heard mixed reviews on if it does anything or not because it deteriorates quickly. Thoughts? Suggestions? \n- **moisturizer and SPF**- La Roche-Posay Double Repair with SPF \n\nPM: (this is where I’m like wtf am I supposed to be doing)\n- **Cleanser**- cetaphil gentle skin cleanser\n- **toner again?**\n- **hyaluronic acid serum?** vichey mineral 89\n- **moisturizer**- need suggestions! I want something meant for PM instead of just using the same la roche-posay without the spf \n- my keihls midnight recovery concentrate (I have been using this for years and just got a giant bottle of it so this one has to stay lol) \n\nShould probably start a retnoid but haven’t been able to with recently being pregnant- but done with kids so ready to start. I do worry because my skin is already so dry. ",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I need hydration, but not pore clogging. My acne is around my mouth, on my cheeks, and a few spots on my forehead occasionally. I’ve tried the recommended actives (Salicylic acid, glycolic acid, hypochlorous acid, benzoyl peroxide) and they WRECK my skin. \n\nCurrent routine-\n- 1st cleanse (only if I’m wearing makeup)- MadHippie cleansing oil\n- 2nd cleanse (only cleanse in AM &amp; PM if wearing no makeup)- dermae pure biome balancing cleanser \n- If I’m going to apply makeup- topicals clearly clarifying and calming mist \n- Moisturizer- vanicream\n- SPF - eltamd uv clear\n\n\n1. Makeup remover//first cleanse- the wipes burn my face VERY badly. Im trying an oil cleanser but it’s a lot of work and I think it’s clogging my pores. I’m not opposed to an oil cleanser, but what brands/types of makeup removers won’t leave my pores clogged?\n\n2. Something to calm the acne- the topicals spray works great for temporary calming, but I’ve seen no long term results. It also dries my face out so bad it’s almost not even worth using. What can I use to manage my breakouts that won’t wreck my barrier or irritate my skin?\n\n 3. Moisturizer- I’ve been using vanicream for years but lately it hasn’t felt the same. my skin soaks the vanicream up in about 45 seconds &amp; it burns SO BAD. it also smells like alcohol (as of recently, I’ve never noticed it before). What is an acne friendly moisturizer I can use that won’t clog my pores/break me out, but that can also fix my skin barrier because clearly it’s messed up😂\n\nThank u in advance!!!!",

      "content": "Hi, I have 3a-3b hair and almost a month ago I decided I needed to start taking care of it properly and stop only using one product every single morning. I was excited to start taking care of my hair, but I’ve had the hardest time managing it. I have a horrible problem with frizz and I’m truly at a loss on how to handle it. I feel like I’ve tried everything and I have a million bajillion product attempts, but nothing has given me any sort of progress. I’ve followed hair routines that are similar to my hair type and porosity type, I’ve bought Camille Rose shampoo and conditioner that are supposed to mend frizz, I tried Not Your Mothers Sculpting gel and after that didn’t work I tried the same brands Flash Freeze gel. I’ve also tried using Not Your Mothers mousse- that didn’t work so I tried Doux’s mousse, but I still had frizz. I have tried SO. MANY. CURL. CREAMS. I’ve tried Rizo’s, Not Your Mothers, LUS, everything I could find; the only one that showed clear signs of decreased frizz was Rizo’s, but there’s still frizz galore. I’ve even been spending a good 3 hours after wash and routine day diffusing my hair with cold air. I’m not sure if it’s the way I’m applying products or the order I rake them in?\n\nMy routine right now consists of:\n\nSoaking wet hair washed by Camille Rose shampoo and conditioner, then I section and spray Not Your Mothers leave conditioner. I then rake in Rizo’s curl defining cream followed by Doux’s texture foam enhancer. After that I take a styling brush and brush out each section. Finally, I use Not Your Mothers flash freeze gel and I scrunch each section and then I diffuse on the coldest setting and allow a gel cast to form. (I’m not sure if this helps, but I have a medium hair strand, it’s not super think, but a strand is noticeable between my fingers and is far from thin.)\n\nAfter the routine, sometimes my curls with separate from each other and I’ll have really small strings of curls that look super weird. The shape and frizz-less curls will usually last the day, but once I’m home from school, my hair is ridiculously frizzy and it won’t last make it another day. I am truly at a loss and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Any advice is super welcomed. I’ve never dyed my hair or had any treatments done, my hair is completely virgin- not sure if that information makes a difference.\n\nI never realized how difficult curly hair can be.",

      "content": "Hi! I’m 22F and have a few problem areas I’m looking to address with a red light therapy mask and a sculpting device (or any other recommendations you may have).\n\nMy skin tone is uneven, has minor pitted/discolored acne scars, redness, and dull skin overall. Skin is also sensitive and acne prone. I am starting to get some sagging in my lower cheeks and one side of my face is drooping more than the other. I have chubby cheeks and want definition in my jaw, chin, neck, and cheekbones. I’ve seen so many options online, and just don’t know what to choose! A lot of them are way too expensive for me too, but I am willing to spend a few hundred on each device, if the results are promising.\n\nI’m just struggling pretty badly with my self-confidence due to this and would appreciate any recommendations y’all have.\n\nRecommendations for skincare, supplement, techniques, etc. are also welcome!! Thank you so much!",

I was and condition with the Generic Value Moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.\n\nWhile I usually keep my hair naturally curly about 80% of the time. I do occasionally straighten it. When it’s curly and wet I use the Pillow Soft Curl Leave in by Miss Jessie and the Kinky Curly custard afterwards.\n\nThese products are great for my hair type. However since my hair is thick, curly, and has a low porosity I haven’t found a good routine to flat iron my hair. I know I can’t just use my curly hair products but I also haven’t found a product that works on curly hair that also gives a silky pin straight look. It always has the frizz at the bottom.\n\nAny suggestions on products?",

It originally looked good but I felt after a month it wasn’t holding up the color / looked off to me and I started to hate it. I naturally have a very cool toned dark brown hair FYI!\n\nAnyways that hairdresser I usually see is now out on maternity leave so I decided to go somewhere else to get the balayage color to be more neutral/light brown instead of the blondish color.\n\nI specifically told her I wanted the highlights in my hair to just be more neutral / light brown and keep that dimension. She said it will fade out slowly over 3 months time and and I said okay great and then she dyed my hair….\n\nUnfortunately my hair didn’t turn out light brown like I asked and it’s as if my hair is now black with no dimension…. I feel like crying and I was so disappointed but just said thanks it looks good and left. I know she did a “gloss”, then hair dye, then another “gloss” to lock it in. It was $215 before tip which was also super surprising as I thought we were just toning the hair?\n\nI’m so mad / sad and hate my hair now as it all looks just one color and even darker than my natural root ???? Idk what to do but I feel so ugly. PLEASE HELP.",
