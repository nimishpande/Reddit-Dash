That’s a no.\n\nIt’s like applying successively smaller layers of chalk.\n\nBut hey, it’s one of the few that actually controls sweat.\n\nVerdict: Good for Athletes. Functional, not romantic.\n\n\n\n5. Dot &amp; Key Watermelon Cooling Sunscreen\n\nSmells great, feels cute, and then proceeds to melt faster than your patience in Delhi summer.\n\nGood for “I’m-just-running-to-the-café” days, not for actual sun exposure.\n\nVerdict: Influencer energy, not athlete energy.",

      "content": "I (27f) have always had pretty good skin other than the occasional ‘period spot’. Back in May/June I started using a sensitive Retinol oil (attempting to tackle those fine lines etc) twice a week (bottle advises twice a DAY) - after 4 uses in 2 weeks I started to get a really sore patch by my nose suddenly. Stopped using it and pharmacist recommended hydrocortisone. Used this maybe 3 times- sore patch cleared up and all was fine.\n\nEarlier this year, I developed an annoying cough that after months of going to the GPs about, they diagnosed as likely asthma and in June gave me a blue and a pink (steroid) inhaler. With clear skin I used the inhaler as advised twice daily and after in around August that pesky sore skin around my nose came back. The skin was a little blistery and really flaky. Spoke to GP who advised I continue with inhaler but try the hydrocortisone again.\nSore patch spread and bumpy raw patches developed further out from my nose and the skin around and under my nose and nostrils was scaly af.\nAfter researching and finding out about POD I instantly stopped using the inhaler and Hydrocortisone. Continued to use my barrier repair Byoma moisturiser as my skin was unbelievable dry and flaky- skin got worse and worse. \nThen decided to stop using literally everything other than a mild Liz Earle cleanser in the evening and just let the scalyness sort itself out.\nAfter about a month of this I got sick of no progress and contacted GP again saying I believed it was POD. They asked to send a photo and then prescribed me Fucidin (NOT fucidin H) and said if does not work then will prescribe anti virals. \nThat was around 3 weeks ago and the scalyness has cleared a little but the little areas of blisters continue to be red and daily change from ‘just a bit red’ to ‘these bumps are burning’. Currently they’re sore and itchy and burning.\n\nCan anyone help PLEASE!? Do I continue with the Fucidin- do I try the anti virals? My GP seems to have no idea what they’re doing and have only done appointments over the phone and it’s IMPOSSIBLE to get hold of them. I’ve attached photo from today as well as one from 3 weeks ago to show lack of progress.\nHas anyone got any skincare recommendations that might help reduce the soreness?\n\nI get married in 6 months and I’m desperate to try and get it clear. I miss my skin care routine 😭",

Leave in oil\n8. Dry(but not really)\n9. Put in a pineapple looking way and sleep with it cuz I don't have time to dry it\n\nTo be honest, I am just really new to curly hair in general. Since I was young I've been told my hair is wavy in some way, but I was never taught how to even care for wavy hair, so obviously, I don't know how to deal with curly hair either. You can imagine how my hair, which was treated as straight hair would react to that, getting so frizzy and looking terrible. \n\n I've started learning about curly hair this summer. Started following routines and all: Tried just shampooing with normal shampoo I used before and defusing and hair looked like (picture 1), then I tried finger coiling it, which gave it texture but didn't give me what I wanted (picture 2). Over time, I got a new shampoo, a curl cream and a conditioner. So far, that's all I have. It would probably be enough, though I need a gel too, but it's getting better. \n\nThe biggest problem I have right now is learning how to style it cuz scrunching doesn't work perfectly for me, learning how to dry it without a diffuser(cuz the one I had dissapeared= was thrown out by someone who didn't know what it's used for) and learning how to sleep with it. \n\nI've tried hair plopping and that went terrible. For the past few weeks I've been using the pineapple sth method(T shirt and my hair is tied on the top of my head with a scrunchy). It's not great, but, better than most stuff I've tried. Help me out girlies. \n\nSome times my hair kind of coils up. I wish it did that in all the hair but it usually is happening only in the backside of my hair. They're cute though. I wish all of my hair looked like that, all of it.\n\nEven if you don't help I'll still have curly hair, I just won't know what to do with it. Btw, been trying to grow my hair in years. It never reached past my shoulders, but now after using hair oil and some scalp massage it reached past them 🫡 ",

I do not get a lot of breakouts at once (2-3 at a time), and they are not always in the same spot. While my skin can be “sensitive” to active ingredients, it is more likely to get dry/irritated from a product than to break out a lot. Not sure if that makes sense - I guess what I’m trying to say that I don’t think the products I use add to/create my acne, but I don’t think they’re fixing my problem and I would like to find something that can help. I don’t think it’s at the level where I need to get a derm involved.\n\nMy current AM routine consists of:\n\n  1. Cleanser\n  2. Vitamin C Serum\n  3. Hydrating Serum\n  4. Moisturizer\n  5. SPF\n\nI occasionally use a Paula’s Choice toner at least 5 min before my Vitamin C, but regular use can be too irritating. I use Differin gel ~3 nights a week and do mild exfoliation 1 night a week.\n\nAny suggestions as to what I can use after my Vitamin C in the morning? Bonus points if it layers well under makeup.

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
