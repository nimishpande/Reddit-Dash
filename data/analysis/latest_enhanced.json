This is my first post and I want to say \"hey\" and thank everyone for making this such a great curlmunity🎉🫶!!  \n\nA while back someone on this thread recommended Boulceme Curl Cream. I decided to go for it (REALLY go for it - I bought the 1L size!!!) Luckily it works great with my hair (which has interesting curl patterns and textures due to being varying shades of gray and white). Thanks, curl community!🙌\n\nNote: if you are confused by what my hair style is, I am, too 😅. I've been cutting it myself for years and I guess I would call it an asymmetrical bob (???)\n\nHere is my (very basic) routine:\n-Shampoo and condition with Not Your Mother's Curl Talk.\n-Comb with wide tooth comb\n-Apply Boulceme Curl Cream to lightly towel-dried hair\n-Air dry\n\n ",

I asked for bangs the same as usual (and they didn’t come out quite how I like them but they aren’t my main concern) and I asks for weight to be removed from the rest of my hair and shorter layers, a little shaggy but too much.\n\nI’ve washed and tried letting it air dry like usual over the past week and it just looks and feels off. I asked for other opinions and they think I’m crazy. I feel like it’s mushrooming/triangle shaped on top and it’s too bulky and long on the right side and it isn’t shaped right for my natural texture. I wish I had a picture of how she did it last time, it had a slight shag vibe without being too much for me. The right side isn’t usually this straight looking on top and I can’t get it to hold a curl now. \n\nAm I going crazy? Would it be rude to ask if I could come back in to try and fix it some? I feel like the top layer is too long and not blended in well. It is widening my lower face instead of drawling eyes up.\n\nThoughts? Opinions?? How do I explain what isn’t sitting right for me?\n\nLast photo is what I should maybe show for inspo? I have very thick hair that is curlier at roots and on bottom layers so I know it can’t look quite like hers. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m looking for genuine advice for underarm hyperpigmentation and hair-removal options. I’ve attached photos for context. I really want to take care of my underarms. \n\nBackground:\n\n\t•\tI used razors only for several years (stopped \\~2 years ago)\n\n\t•\tAround a year ago, I had a wax burn from Rica wax\n\n\t•\tSince then, I switched to hard Brazilian wax, but I feel my underarm skin keeps getting worse\n\n\t•\tI have thick, coarse hair\n\n\t•\tMy skin is PIH-prone — even mosquito bites leave dark marks for months before fading\n\n\t•\tCurrently using Chemist at Play underarm roll-on\n\n\t•\tOccasionally used alum for odor\n\n\t•\tRarely used The Ordinary Glycolic Acid with a cotton pad\n\n\t•\tRecently exfoliated gently with Dove body polish (pink variant)\n\nCurrent issues:\n\n\t•\tPersistent dark pigmentation\n\n\t•\tUneven tone\n\n\t•\tBumps after waxing (they go away, but darkness doesn’t)\n\n\t•\tSkin gets irritated easily after hair removal\n\nWhat I’m confused about:\n\n\t•\tIs epilator better or worse than hard/Brazilian wax for someone like me?\n\n\t•\tShould I completely avoid root hair removal?\n\n\t•\tWould switching to a trimmer actually help pigmentation fade?\n\n\t•\tAny routines/products that helped you personally?\n\nLaser is not an option for me right now, so I’m looking for realistic, affordable solutions.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with similar underarm pigmentation or sensitive skin, I’d really appreciate your experience or advice 🙏\n\nPlease be kind — this is something I’m genuinely trying to fix.",

      "content": "\n\nI’m in the process of growing out old dyed hair (from a year ago and i used permanent dye) now a good amount is virgin, but what’s left of the lighter/warmer part annoys me every time I look at it. I don’t want to commit to permanent dye because my goal is still to fully grow it out, but I’m debating whether it’s worth using semi-permanent or demi-permanent dye just on the ends to blend it better or if I should just leave it alone. The issue is that I wash my hair every day (very oily scalp), so I’m worried semi-permanent will wash out super fast and be a waste of money or demi-permanent will last longer but might dry out or damage my already-dyed ends. \n\nHas anyone been in this situation?\nWould you recommend:\n• semi-permanent (diluted / ends only)?\n\n• demi-permanent (short processing, ends only)?\n\n• or just leaving the color alone and dealing with it until it grows out?\n\nI’m really torn because I want it to look more even, but I also don’t want to make my ends worse or spend money on something that’ll be gone in a week. Also i’ve tried using the loreal le colour gloss in cool brunette and i didn’t like it. \n\nMy current routine: \n\n• I use pre wash oils before each wash i alternate around with jojoba, coconut and indian brand vatika oils. \n\n• Dove cucumber moisture shampoo (h&amp;s tea tree 1x week for scalp health) \n\n• Pantene miracle rescue deep conditoner (Dove intensive repair mask with h&amp;s) \n\n• Tresemme lameller gloss cream serum + Loreal extraordinary oil \n\nAny advice or personal experiences would help a lot 🙏",

      "content": "Hi everyone! Please remove if this isn’t in the right place!!\n\nRecently I’ve become so tired of everything to do with shaving, and I’m interested in some other options. I’ve been seeing a lot of different opinions on waxing versus sugaring, hair removal creams, and laser hair removal, but waxing seems the most appealing to me as of now. I’m not in the place financially to be able to afford professional waxing/sugaring. Therefore, at home waxing seems like the best option, so here are some of my questions. Sorry in advance for all of the writing, new things like this make me anxious, and I had some specific questions that I couldn’t find answers to elsewhere!\n\n1 What products are recommended? I’ve been seeing a lot of recommendations for roll on wax, accompanied by wax strips, as opposed to the melting wax (or whatever it’s called!) but I can’t seem to find a constant opinion on which one to use, and I’m really scared of damaging my skin!\n\n2 How much does it hurt, and are there any recommendations to help with the pain? I would think I have a pretty okay pain tolerance, I tweeze a lot and don’t really have a problem.\n\n3 How long should my hair be? I’m mainly interested in waxing my lower legs, and my underarms. The hair on my thighs grows a lot thinner so I’m not super worried about that, but if the pain isn’t terrible I might try waxing them as well. If I were to guess, I would say that the hair on my lower legs is about one centimetre right now.\n\n4 When should I exfoliate? I’ve heard that it is a bad idea to exfoliate the day of, and that gentle exfoliation is recommended a few days before hand. Also, when I do exfoliate I usually use sensitive skin soap and one of those exfoliating mittens, so would that be considered gentle?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The products I use daily are shown in the photo.\n\nAM\n\n• Round Lab face wash\n\n• Nivea Soft moisturizer\n\n• Revuele Aloe Daily Sun Barrier SPF 50+\n\nPM\n\n• Garnier Micellar Water (oil version) if I wore makeup\n\n• Round Lab face wash\n\n• Nivea Soothing Night Cream\n\nOverall my skin feels fine and not irritated, but I notice persistent congestion and visible texture on my nose area, which you can see in the photo. I’m not experiencing active acne, just clogged-looking pores.\n\nI’m looking for general routine advice on how to improve the appearance of nose congestion while keeping things simple. Would gentle exfoliation or a specific ingredient be reasonable to introduce at my age, or is this something best left alone?",

For about 10 years it was straight not pin straight but if I got out of the shower and brushed it would dry straight. So my haircut is still coming off being cut for straight hair. Lots of razoring in there. Well perimenopause has decided to remodel and the curls are BACK! 🤗 Buuut… products and procedures have changed a lot in 10 years. I need help with finding a gel that doesn’t flake when I break the cast. I love the way Paul Mitchell’s Super Clean Sculpting Gel forms my curls. It controls frizz and gives me volume but it’s so flaky. The curl creams I’ve tried just make my hair a frizzy mess even when paired with gel. I’ve tried NYM spray gel and it doesn’t have enough hold for my hair. \n\nRoutine:\n\nShampoo and conditioner: Pacifica Scalp Love\n\n1st Mousse: NYM Curl Talk \n\n2nd Gel: Paul Mitchell Super Clean Sculpting \n\nI break the cast with Kristin Ess Air Dry Crème (I ONLY use this once my hair is dry). \n\nI occasionally use aerosol hair spray at the roots. \n\nI have a pixie cut and my hair doesn’t tangle easily so I don’t brush it often but when I do it’s between applying conditioner and rinsing it. Brush recommendations appreciated as well. \n\nTYSM",

I’ve already undergone Dermapen (microneedling), laser treatments, and chemical peels, but my scars are still visible.\n\nI also have uneven texture on my forehead, which makes my skin look rough and bumpy, especially in certain lighting.\n\nI wanted to ask what actually worked for you in treating deep acne scars and uneven skin texture? Are there any advanced treatments, skincare routines, or lifestyle changes that genuinely made a difference?\n\nAny advice, personal experiences, or dermatologist-recommended options would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI have been battling whiteheads on my chest for 2 years now and I'm at my end. I have tried (almost) EVERYTHING and nothing helps. For some background: I'm 36 and I eat well, I'm active and don't have any health issues other than migraines. Sometimes the flare up is way worse and sometimes better than the picture.  I have a solid skincare routine. I'm on birth control pills (Yaz) and have been for 3 years (and previously my teens/20's). Yaz has stopped my periods completely. This seems to pop up the second week after the placebo pills. I've also been tested for any sensitivities and allergies and nothing. I've tried all the skincare including Hypochlorous sprays, specialty bacteria soaps, all the acids etc. I've also tried not using anything! I've tried elimination diets, fixing my gut flora, teas and herbs. Cutting sugar out has helped a little but not by much. I don't sweat alot, I usually wear loose clothing and tank tops. I drink a ton of water! So I'm at a loss. The only thing I haven't tried is going off BC and it's not really an option for now. I know I'm at the age for my hormones to be outta whack and I'll have to be changing the type of BC I'm on soon and all those good things that come with age, so I have a feeling that might be a part of this!\n\nIf anyone out there has any info or advice, I would love to hear it!",

      "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m starting a healthcare job in a pediatric hospital and am wanting to hear how y’all are styling your hair at work. I know it differs from person to person, but I wanted to hear it all. \n\nFor reference, I have thick, layered 3a curls that go to my mid-back. My usual go-to styles are a ponytail or bun. Recently, I’ve noticed an increase in tangling, breakage, and damage with these two styles, so I’m looking for healthier alternatives. I don’t think “protective style” is the right term here, but I’m looking for styles that I can rotate, will keep my hair healthy during long work hours, and will help minimize breakage long-term.\n\nIn a perfect world, I would love to wear my hair down, but it gets overwhelming and I always pull it out of my face. I will be in and out of PPE with my hair tucked into a disposable scrub cap, so I don’t want to constantly be worrying about how it looks. I also won’t be able to wear a normal scrub cap regularly, or else I absolutely would! \n\nRecently, I’ve started twisting my hair up into a giant claw clip, which has helped some but causes headaches. I feel like there’s no winning lol. The crown of my hair has a lot of frizzies/fly aways, and I’m not sure if it’s further damaging my hair to keep gelling them down. I’ve read on here that braids/twists can be a great option, but I really struggle doing them on myself. My hair tangles, they never look quite right due to the frizziness of my crown, I get frustrated, and give up. But regardless, I will keep trying!\n\nI know this is a lot…but if anyone has any thoughts or advice, I would love to hear it!\n\nI appreciate y’all and thank you so much in advance! ☺️💜\n\n*TLDR*: Healthcare girly with thick, mid-back length, 3a hair looking for styling ideas that are not ponytails/buns (due to damage). Frizzy crown, has continuously failed at learning to braid/twist but willing to persist, any advice or words of wisdom are appreciated! \n\nCurrent routine (recently changed to help with damage from tangling and highlights):\n\n-Detangle with Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Curls Detangling Deep Conditioner\n\n-Wash with K18 Detox Shampoo\n\n-Lightly dry with a microfiber towel\n\n-Apply K18 Leave-In Molecular Repair Hair Mask (leave for 4+ minutes, no rinsing)\n\n-Apply Not Your Mother’s Leave-In Conditioner Spray\n\n-Apply Aussie Instant Freeze Maximum Hold Gel\n\n-Comb through hair with a wide-tooth comb and scrunch with gel\n\n-Clip roots with alligator clips for volume\n\n-Diffuse on warm heat, high speed\n\n-I sleep on a satin pillow case with my hair down (bonnets slide off of my head in the night and flatten my hair, pineappling causes irritation and build-up, willing to hear any advice on this as well!)

I’m so mad about it every day since getting it ($107 down the drain) that I am trying to find ways to hide it until it grows back out. I am beginning to realize I need to just cut it myself (as I have been for the last four years) or if I want anything more than trimming ends I need to be extremely specific and not even bother going to a premium priced “curly” salon.\n\n I told the stylist what I didn’t like about my hair and what I think I needed to fix it but ultimately left it to her (being a professional) to make the call. I wanted more lift at the roots and it to be layered. She added ONE layer at the top making for some wispy hair that sits oddly at the crown and then seemingly cut it straight across at the bottom leaving a weird shape almost squared. It’s essentially one length and looks absolutely ridiculous when I do my usual routine of washing with V&amp;Co. Wave shampoo &amp; conditioner, style soaking wet with Ouidad humidity defense strong hold gel and let it air dry. \n\nI know what works for my hair and this cut isn’t that. I’ve been living with this bad cut for two weeks and thought maybe time would help but I’m about to just take scissors to it myself to “fix” the heaviness. The only thing stopping me is knowing I already have more length off than what I want and it takes FOREVER to grow and show length. Should I just wait it out and let it grow or go to some generic salon (not specialty curl stylists) and tell them give me layers in hopes they understand and fix it..? \n\nWhen looking from front it sits just as flat and lifeless. It has nothing to do with the way I style it, it’s 100% the cut. I tried on day 2 to cut some layers randomly but that did nothing to fix the horrible one length curtain of hair. ",
