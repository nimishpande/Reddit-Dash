Need help with frizz and longer-lasting hold without weighing hair down.\n\nHello!\nI only discovered my true hair texture about 1.5 years ago, and it’s definitely been a journey. I’m still trying to find the best styling routine for my hair and struggling a bit with consistency.\n\nSo far, my favourite results come from using Sebastian Professional Potion 9 as a leave-in and the L’Oréal Curl Expression mousse. I love how soft my hair feels with this combo, but as you can probably tell from the pictures, I still get some frizz, and the curls don’t really hold well past day 2.\n\nI’ve tried Olaplex No.10 gel before, but even after scrunching out the cast, I never seem to get it right and I don’t love the final result.\n\nI was wondering if anyone has recommendations for gel products that improve hold without weighing hair down, or\nany other tweaks/products that could help with frizz and longevity. My hair is thick, and I believe it’s medium porosity.\n\nCurrent routine (2x per week):\n- Double wash with Wella Nutricurls shampoo\n- Wella Nutricurls mask\n- Out of the shower, I detangle with a Denman brush while hair is very wet\n- I don’t towel-dry at all, just scrunch out excess water with my hands\n- Sebastian Professional Potion 9 (scrunched in)\n- L’Oréal Curl Expression mousse (scrunched in)\n- Diffuse\n- Finish with a tiny bit of Wella Oil Reflections\n\nRefresh:\n- Re-wet hair with a spray bottle\n- Small amount of leave-in\n- Diffuse\n\nI usually sleep with a lose pineapple bun with a lose scrunchie.\n\nThanks so much in advance! 😊",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I havent used any other product or done anything differentlly (despite moving to another country 4 weeks ago with worse tap water quality, but the problem only just happened now).\n\nIt looks very greasy but feels more like hard and a bit sticky but i can brush through without problem, so its not really sticking together?! It feels like i put hairspray in it somehow. Its only the top hair that is like this, my roots and my lower lengths feel very clean \n\nSince then i washed my hair daily with the  shampoos i used before (head and shoulders and loreal elvive restoring shampoo) but its not getting better.. i got a shower filter, shampooed twice, that didnt change anything and today i did an apple cider rinse, which didnt help either. \n\nPlease if you have any suggestions ill appreaciate it!! My hair never did anything like this ever. Thank you!!",

They only last me like 3 months max. \n\nLately though it’s often out of stock online and I’m looking for a less expensive alternative with similar or better performance. I’ve done a lot of research and I see this sub swears by Minimalist Vitamin C. I’m thinking of switching to Minimalist 16% Vitamin C (E &amp; Ferulic) since it’s about half the price of Agelite‑X. \n\nAlso I’ve also seen a lot of good reviews about Melano CC (though it seems pricey), but recommendations on that too would be great.\n\nWhat I am asking is it worth switching to Minimalist 16%? Or should I try Melano CC instead or should I just continue with Agelite-X?\n\nWould love to hear user thoughts on results and overall value. Thank you!",

I am wondering if anyone can explain to me scientifically the discussion and recommendation of not washing the hair until 48-72 hours after a color service due to the cuticle not being “completely closed”. I know cuticles dont work like blinds that just open and close. In my experience, washing 24 hours after color shouldn’t affect the longevity because the color doesn’t continue processing &amp; the conditioner seals with an acidic pH. I’m confusedddd",

I, unfortunately, attempted to reach silver at home(I have learned my lesson).\n\nMeaning, I put platinum colored semi-perm \"Adore Me\" on top of the fresh bleach. First photo is after I touched up my hair with bleach, second is the semi-perm color, and the last is my hair currently. Last photo is the bleach and dye in question. \n\nI did not like the result of this so to remedy, I bleached again.\n\nMy hair is now bubblegum pink\n\nI don't know enough about color theory to fix this so please help me. Do I need to bleach again? Is there a color I can use to cancel out the pink and get to blonde again?? Or at least not such a bright color? Please please any and all suggestions are much appreciated.

      "content": "hi:)\n\nI‘d love some help regarding what to do about the current state of my hair- I lost a lot of hair due to health issues, and it’s texture has changed as well. I think I need to take care of it differently\n\nthe current routine:\n\n\\- vichy dercos sensitive shampoo\n\n\\- the ordinary behentrionium chloride 2% conditioner\n\n\\- harologi rebuild spray, every third wash for 5 min\n\n\\- hask curl defining cream, scrunched in\n\n\\- air dry or dry with diffuser\n\nthe pictures have been taken on wash day after diffuser drying and brushing once completely dry\n\nI suspect that this routine is drying out my hair a bit too much and I think the curl cream is too heavy. I‘m not sure whether the uneven curl pattern is due to my products not being ideal (the top layer is quite dry) or if that‘s just naturally what my hair does now\n\nI‘d like to try new products and techniques but am having a hard time navigating the sea of options. Any advice I can start researching from is appreciated :) I kind of don‘t know where to begin, that curl cream belonged to my ex and I just stuck with it lol\n\nalso… please be very honest, I feel like the back of my hair looks tragic ;-; do you think I should cut it shorter? I love the way it curls in the front at this lenght but whenever I see a picture of me at a slight angle or from the back I feel pain\n\nthank you!",

The last time I tried to get into skincare, I just broke out -- more so than the initial skin purging phase -- so I was left a little disillusioned with constructing a routine, especially because it's so pricey.\n\nFor quite some time now, I've been using the CeraVe foaming cleanser as it's the only thing I have found that has consistently made my skin feel good. However, a cleanser can only do so much. With the cleanser, I also gua sha to de-puff my face which works quite well for me. I moisturize with the CeraVe moisturizing cream here and there as it is the only thing that doesn't clog my pores or make me feel greasy.\n\nI experience a lot of textural difficulties so anything that makes my skin feel greasy, filmy, overly tight, or heavy is a no-go for me. I suppose that's why I've stuck to just a simple routine.\n\nAbout my skin: I have sensitive, combination skin - oily in my t-zone and dry near my lips and cheeks. The blackheads on my nose, the acne on my cheeks, and the general appearance of my skin (pores and shape), are the things I am looking to target. I am 21. My break-outs are generally hormonal, happening mostly during PMS.\n\nThe products I've been looking to add are: CosRX Blackhead Power Liquid BHA 4% with Niacinamide, Numbuzin No. 3 toner, Medik8 Liquid Peptides.\n\n  \nPhotos from a very hungover morning:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bsqhu5ivx2hg1.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32ffc552718051d088f49384b7aaba009084b243\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqzdu5ivx2hg1.png?width=1706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=152c85b0d4d1c2b1f95af9e608e74b9766ad4a11\n\n",
