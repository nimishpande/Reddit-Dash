      "content": "Hi everyone,\nI'm asking this on behalf of my bf, 28 (M).\n\"I’ve been dealing with a sudden acne breakout over the past month. Before this, my skin was mostly clear with only the occasional pimple, but now I’m getting clusters of breakouts, mostly on my forehead, and few on the cheek area.\nI hadn’t really changed anything in my routine, diet, or products when the breakout first started. After the breakout started, I changed my facewash to TheDermaCo Sali-Cinamide anti acne face wash but it did not make any difference. I've also been getting enough sleep.\nI’m not sure if I should be changing something in my skincare/lifestyle. For now, I’m just using the facewash and re quil moisturizer and aj screenshot \nAny advice on what might be causing it or how to manage it would be really appreciated.\nThanks!\"\n",

The skin is clearer than it's been in a long time.\n\n**The Unresolved Problem:** My dermatologist (rightfully) told me not to apply the topicals on the very sensitive skin in the creases of my nose and around my mouth. The problem is, the pustules I've always had in those specific spots are still there, and they're incredibly painful. Now that the rest of my face has cleared up, they feel more prominent and frustrating than ever. It's gotten so bad that it hurts to move my mouth.\n\n  \nFor those who also can't use strong topicals everywhere, how did you and your doctor address the stubborn spots in sensitive areas?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/89b20hygj5rf1.png?width=291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d08f424bc5860e1c566cedf6c29666f93f97112\n\n",
