      "content": "\nHi everyone,\nI’m a 26-year-old male and work in acting. I had early hairline recession but no major thinning or crown loss. Because of my profession, hairline design was extremely important to me. Almost every successful lead actor in India has a strong, well-designed hairline, and I wanted something similar—customised and slightly aggressive, while still looking natural.\nFirst surgery (top celebrity clinic in India):\nI initially went to one of the most reputed clinics in India that operates on many celebrities. The plan was hairline enhancement. However, the team mainly worked on the fronto-temporal angles and didn’t significantly improve the central hairline or peaks. The result was okay, but not what I had envisioned. It lacked personalisation and refinement.\nTo be fair, I fully understood their concern about keeping the hairline conservative in case future baldness progressed. Still, I felt the execution didn’t match my expectations, especially considering my case was mild recession and not active baldness.\nAfter around 6 months, once growth became visible, I decided to restart my research.\nSecond surgery:\nThrough Quora, I came across Dr Abhinav Kumar (Patna), an ex-Eugenix surgeon, repeatedly praised by patients for customised hairline design and attention to detail. After detailed discussions, we went ahead with a second surgery focusing purely on hairline aesthetics.\nCurrent results (5 months post-op):\nI’m sharing my current results—a Shubman Gill–style hairline (inspiration only, not replication).\nWhat I’m genuinely happy with:\nStrong but natural peaks\nFlat, well-blended temporal points\nVery fine, single-hair grafts in the hairline\nSmooth transition between hairline and temporal zones\nI’m honestly in love with the hairline. It looks natural, age-appropriate, and camera-friendly.\nFinal thoughts:\nThis is not an endorsement or advertisement. I’m simply sharing my experience to highlight that:\nAll hair transplants don’t have to look unnatural\nCustomisation matters a lot, especially for hairline work\nSurgeon’s aesthetic sense and attention to micro-details make a huge difference",

      "content": "I’m looking for impartial advice about my curly hair.\n\nI grew up never being taught how to care for curls (I was always told to brush it), so I kept my hair very short most of my life. A stylist recently told me I have strong natural curls and recommended growing it out for \\~6 months. I’m about 4 months in.\n\nI’m having a hard time telling whether what I’m seeing now is a normal curly grow-out phase that just needs shaping—or whether my curl pattern/head shape genuinely works better with short hair. I’ve gotten mixed feedback in real life, which makes it difficult for me to evaluate clearly.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n1. Is this current length/shape a normal curly grow-out phase that will pay off if I keep going?\n\n\\- Or does my curl pattern/head shape honestly suit short hair better?\n\n2. If the answer is “keep growing”, should I be doing maintenance shaping (sides, neckline, around the ears) to keep it looking intentional?\n\n3. If the answer is “cut it”, is there a shorter curly style that still works with my natural texture rather than against it?\n\nPhotos are anonymized. I’m genuinely open to either outcome—I’m just looking for curl-informed, impartial feedback.\n\n**Routine**:\n\nI shampoo and condition daily using Paul Mitchell Shampoo Two and Paul Mitchell Detangler conditioner.\n\nAfter showering, I do not towel dry. I let my hair air dry.\n\nWhile my hair is still damp, I apply a light Moroccan oil and DevaCurl cream using my hands. I apply both by scrunching the hair upward while my head is upright, letting the curls form naturally as they hang.\n\nI live in a humid area, so the products are mainly to control frizz.\n\nI do not currently use any protection while sleeping (no bonnet, scarf, or satin pillowcase), and I do not have a refresh routine on non-wash days.\n\nIf there’s anything else I should include for routine context, let me know.",

They are very evenly distributed and don’t really behave like pimples.\n\nI asked ChatGPT about this and it suggested that these might be sebaceous filaments rather than true blackheads. From what I understand, they are normal but can be minimized, not completely removed.\n\nBefore fully trusting that assessment, I wanted to ask people here with real skincare experience:\nDoes this look like sebaceous filaments to you, or could it be something else?\nAnd if it is sebaceous filaments, what helped you the most to make them less visible?\n\nSide note: yes, the nose hairs are visible in the photo. I noticed after taking it😂😂\n\nSkin type: Normal to combination\nCurrent routine:\n– Morning: rinse with water only, then apply Neutrogena Hydro Boost Aqua Gel\n– Evening: rinse with water only, then apply Neutrogena Hydro Boost Aqua Gel\n\nThanks in advance for your input.\n",

Small pimples keep coming back, and even when they heal, they leave dark marks that take forever to fade.\nI’ve been using tretinoin 0.05% for about a month now (3x a week), along with benzoyl peroxide (spot treatment), a niacinamide + salicylic acid face wash, and a basic hyaluronic moisturizer. I recently started taking Evion 400 as well. I trim my beard (don’t shave).\nI know tretinoin takes time, but honestly, it’s hard to stay patient when your skin looks worse before it looks better. Some days I feel like I’m doing everything right and still not seeing “clear” skin. The marks, uneven texture, and occasional breakouts really mess with my mental state.I’m not looking for miracle cures — just realistic expectations and advice from people who’ve been through this:\nHow long did it actually take for your skin to clear on tret?\nWhen did the “glow” start showing up?\nAny mistakes you wish you hadn’t made early on?\nWould really appreciate hearing real experiences.\n\nThanks for reading 🙏🏻 ",

That was on the 18th, but since then (24th, 26th, 29th), and across two or three washes, I have not managed to reproduce that; it feels that I either end up with hair which is less defined (curls are more frizz than anything) or less \"moist\"-looking, or even both. Perhaps I am overanalysing this, but if anyone could perhaps suggest what is wrong specifically with my hair, I would appreciate it!\n\n  \nRoutine (Has not changed much since the 18th):  \n**(All products applied by raking)\\***  \n**WASH**   \n\\- Aunt Jackie's Moisturising or Clarifying Shampoo  \n\\- SheaMoisture Moisturising Shampoo or Sleeek Argan Smoothing Conditioner (only used the latter once)  \n\\* I used to use a Cantu moisturising masque, but fears about too much moisture led me to discontinue its use shortly before the 18th.  \n\\- Comb: \"Bounce brush\"  \n\\- Rinse out (I have been trying using the \"squish to condish\" method, with mixed results)  \n  \n\\- Out of the shower: Lottabody Leave-in conditioner, followed by Curl Keeper Styling Gel, then the curl brush, with occasional use of a spray bottle to keep my hair wet. I finish by scrunching it.\n\n**STYLING (morning)**  \n\\- Curl Keeper Styling Gel only; I get my hair decently wet using the spray bottle, then apply the gel, using it to detangle and redefine my curls. Once done, I do not touch it until it is dry, when I scrunch it out. On the latter, I actually tried olive oil two times before the 24th, and after the 18th, but did not find it was useful at all, and so these days I scrunch it with my dry hands only.\n\n**\\*On raking:** I attempted the \"praying hands\" technique a few times, but did not find it worked. I might try it again for morning styling, where I find a lot of gel is needed to hold my hair together. However, the last time I tried this method, the results were supbar, unless I was mistaken about what I saw. ",
