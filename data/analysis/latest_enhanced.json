      "content": "I feel like people still think anti-aging skincare is only for people in their 40s or 50s, but honestly starting early has been one of the best decisions for my skin. I started taking skincare seriously in my mid-20s, and the difference now is very noticeable.\n\nUsing a simple routine with an anti-aging serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen has helped keep my skin smoother, more hydrated, and way more even in tone. It is less about fixing wrinkles and more about preventing damage before it becomes permanent.\n\nIngredients like niacinamide, peptides, ceramides, snail mucin, and hyaluronic acid focus on barrier repair and collagen support. When your barrier is healthy, your skin automatically looks younger and brighter.\n\nThe biggest change I noticed was texture. My skin feels bouncier and less dull, even when I am tired or stressed. Consistency matters more than using ten different products.\n\nIf you are in your 20s and think anti-aging skincare is not for you yet, trust me, future you will be very thankful you started early.\n\nCurious to know, when did you all start using anti-aging products and what made you begin?",

He prescribed me the following treatment (he only asked whether I go outside or not, and I told him that I don’t. He didn’t mention applying sunscreen) :\n\n1. Benzoyl peroxide gel – He told me to apply it daily in the morning on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer.\n(He didn’t suggest any moisturizer; I’m using the Minimalist Vitamin B5 moisturizer)\n\n2. Tretinoin gel 0.025% – He told me to apply this in the evening around 6–7 pm on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer.\n\n3. Vitamin C serum – He told me to apply this at night after washing my face (he didn’t mention applying a moisturizer after it)\n\n4. He also gave me tablets, which I have to take once daily for 30 days\n\nToday is my second day of following this routine, and my skin feels itchy, looks reddish and I’m noticing more acne/bumps.\n\nIs this normal? I did read that tretinoin can cause this, but it usually happens after 2–3 weeks and it’s just the second day for me.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Thanks in advance to all you beautiful people reading this. Been growing my hair out recently and trying a variety of different things to help establish a curl pattern. I have super tight curls in the back/ very bottom of my hair line so I know it can happen! But I’m getting discouraged as even when trying products and methods my hair rarely looks good.\n\n**I swim 3x a week and use a shampoo that removes chlorine in addition to the pictured products. I know some people don’t wash their hair as often, that is not an option for me since I need to get that chlorine out! I live in the Midwest so it’s cold and dry out right now as well but tbh my hair is always frizzy no matter the weather.\n\nFirst pic is minimal maintiance- I use the chlorine shampoo, pictured shampoo(focus on roots) conditioner (focus on non-roots), barely rinse that out after a few minutes and then spay pictured leave-in and wrap in microfiber towel for 10-15 minutes then hair dry. I usually shower at night (I swim after work then hop in the shower right after) so to preserve my hair I have tried using a silk bonnet. I don’t use it every time right now maybe 1-2/week. \n\nSecond pic is adding in more steps- same shampoo/conditioner routine in the shower and using a wet brush to get the leave in (and adding in hair milk- little black botttle) evenly distributed in my hair. After taking out of the towel I put some mousse (not pictured but it’s Aussie brand) and scrunch that in, then use a dryer with diffuser to form curls (which always seems to result in a MESS) with warm heat low power. I don’t aim to get it fully dry with that, but after it’s like 90% dry I see the frizz is coming back and use some oil (clear bottle) on top\nof my head where the frizz is the worst. Of course that doesn’t really seem to help after 10 minutes the frizz returns.\n\nI know this shampoo/conditioner is not really helping but at this point I think I am needing help with the technique/ putting the steps in the right order. This is the first time I have really tried putting effort into my hair so very new, thanks again to anyone willing to give some advice and help me turn this around! ",

      "content": "hello!! \n\nas the title says, I’m trying to figure why my curls seem to better on 2nd / 3rd day and beyond… this seems to be an anomaly within the curly community! It’s almost like my hair is too silky, it doesn’t have much hold at all despite lots of product. Maybe grease gives my hair hold 🤣 I think I have medium everything hair, eg porosity. \n\nRoutine: \nShampoo: currently Aussie Bouncy curls (Not Your Mother etc seem to flatten my curls - too heavy - but not set on the Aussie yet as it has sulfates)\nConditioner: Aussie 3 minute miracle (love love love this)\nLeave In (on the ends): A random aussie one again \nCurl crème: Only Curls hydrating curl cream \nGel (followed up with bounce brush): Eco style olive oil \nEither air dry / hover diffuse with a dyson after a quick plop. I will scrunch some V05 high volume mousse in once it is a little more dry. \nI tend to clip up my roots in a claw clip and then use some volumising hair spray for szush. \n\nI refresh with water, then the Only Curls curl crème and strong hold gel (trying to use everything up). I sleep with a silk bonnet and a pineapple underneath with a silk scrunchie).\n\nPicture is day 5 curls I think with multiple refreshes. First day is way poofier frizz and zero hold - despite all the product :( Do I just need more product from the start? Maybe different shampoo?  \n",

My hair doesn’t feel dry per say but it definitely makes my breakage more prominent and the mask did zero for my hair once inly made it look extremely damaged so not sold on it either.\n\nI have thin hair now, majorly due to pcos and so it gets oily within hours, have to wash and blow dry/straighten it every day. i used pantene anti hair fall for a couple of months prior to dove and actually liked how my hair looked with it, also appeared slightly longer in years but stopped using it after a lot of people told me to in my last post. \n\nmy major concern now is to get my hair to grow back and to reduce/reverse breakage.\n\nI’d really appreciate suggestions and advice, thanks!",

After the training, I have really loved them (first picture) Except I have this hairline that goes way in on the sides of my forehead, making bald spots on each side when I have my hair up, which I have to do for work. So when I went in for my trim I asked her to maybe pull some hair over those spots and add into the bangs. The other pics is what I ended up with. It’s a way heavier bang and I don’t have any face framing. Should I do some framing, or will that just look weird?  Should I just wait for it to grow out?  I think it’s too heavy for my face and I don’t know what to do… Ahhh, please help a girl out!!",

Rake in curl cream and scrunch then prayer hands glaze the gel on and scrunch more. I either plop or leave my hair to air dry maybe halfway then I diffuse till dry and scrunch out the crunch.

But my hair is very fine and gets oily pretty fast. I'm currently washing between 2-3 times a week. I'm curious if any of my products are contributing to my hair getting oily fast or weighing it down. I feel like the first day my hair looks great and then second and third day it just looks weighed down and stringy. \n\nAny product changes or advice would be greatly appreciated.
