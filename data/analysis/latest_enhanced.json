      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

When I was a kid I had really REALLY defined curls, but they just kind of got messy with time.\n\nThere was a point where I didn't care much about my hair and I pretty much neglected it, but for a couple of years now I have tried to take care of it and have used some advice I hear a lot.\n\n\n\nI don't know if the problem is my hair, my routine or products, my haircut or the way I style my hair (which honestly I have no idea how to do it)\n\nI'll put some pictures of my hair, products that I use and images of what I'm kinda going for.\n\n\n\nI generally don't dislike that much the way it looks from the front, but when I look at pictures or videos of me from the side I really hate it, it looks so puffy, big and round.\n\nI feel that the problem is how is cut or maybe how I style it, but when I go to the barber and say that I want less volume on the back and sides I end up with very short hair or looking exactly the same.\n\nI also should probably let it grow more, for it to look more similar to how I want it, but instead of growing down it grows to the sides lol.\n\n\n\nAbout my routine, I usually only wash my hair with shampoo twice a week, sometimes three times a week, and I use conditioner every day.\n\nThe only thing I use on my hair besides shampoo and conditioner is some gel, which is not too harsh on my hair but just prevents it from getting too frizzy and big.\n\nI don't brush or comb my hair (I mean, it's likely too short for that) I only use my fingers when I wash it and then I dry it with an old t-shirt, a cotton one I think, and I avoid rubbing, I kind of just press the shirt against my hair. Then I'll use some gel to sort of style it and let it finish drying with the air, naturally (?\n\nNormally it doesn't look too puffy when it's a little wet, but then it dries and it just ends up looking like a ball lol. Sometimes if I'm at home or at a restroom, I put some water on it, from time to time during the day.\n\nI don't use any special pillowcase when sleeping but funnily my hair doesn't look that bad when waking up, I also normally shower in the morning so I don't really pay too much attention at night.\n\n\n\nThat was a lot of text haha, sorry if there are any mistakes, English isn't my first language.\n\nBut anyway, I could really use some advice",

      "content": "Like everyone here, I’m attempting to perfect a routine that results in the hair I want. I’d like for all my waves to be soft and possibly even glossy, but it usually just ends up puffy and frizzy. Usually, I do get some waves at the end of my hair that are as soft as I want them to be, but the top and outer layer is generally the frizziest and rough.\n\nMy hair is quite thick, I have a lot of it, and it’s low porosity.\n\nI wash every other day (scalp gets oily) with L’Oreal Paris frizz-defy shampoo followed by Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk conditioner. I used NYM shampoo up until recently but I didn’t see a change when I switched. Right out of the shower, I use the Kristen Ess leave-in conditioner (someone recommended it to me months ago, I don’t know if it’s good for my hair type or not) and then Miss Jessie’s Pillow Soft Curls. I scrunch with a microfiber towel. Occasionally I add the olaplex hair oil, but I don’t like the feeling of oil on my hands and therefore don’t always get to that. I also sometimes spray the Cantu curl revitalizer in my hair and put it in a loose bun to sleep in. When I wake up, the ends of my hair are how I like them, but then the issue lies in the craziness atop my head.\n\nMaybe part of the issue is that I haven’t had a haircut in 5 months, but I’d like some opinions if you have any! Thanks in advance.\n\n(this is my hair ~5 hours post-wash, still a teensy bit damp underneath. also, I’m only able to upload one photo)",

      "content": "This will probably be a chaotic read. I really don't know how to phrase all of this in the best way, or even what info is needed here so I'll just throw everything in here in the hopes that something will be useful. \n\nI have very dry skin and eyes and I really need to find something for the eye area to moisturize the hell out of it without leaving me with a ton of milia and breakouts. And idk if it's in any way even related but I have what I think are some skin tags on my lower eye lids and I'd like to not promote the growth of more of those if possible.\n\n  \nI am currently using a Swedish brand of eye cream (ACO) because I don't know where to start and it felt like it could be simple but effective. It is sold at my pharmacy so I think it's very basic. It does help a tiiiny bit but not nearly enough for me to call it effective. \n\nHere is the ingredient list of the ACO eye cream I'm using: Aqua, Glycerin, Canola Oil, AlphaGlucan Oligosaccharide, Diethylhexyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Xylitylglucoside, Cetearyl Olivate, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter Extract, Stearyl Dimethicone, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Anhydroxylitol, Sorbitan Olivate, Polymnia Sonchifolia Root Juice, Tocopheryl Acetate, Allantoin, Sucrose Stearate, Xylitol, Maltodextrin, Glucose, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Lactobacillus, Acetyl Tetrapeptide5, Palmitoyl Tripeptide1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide7, NHydroxysuccinimide, Chrysin, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Acrylates/C1030 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum, Steareth20, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate\n\n  \nSorry that was super long but I felt it might help. I hope it's somewhat readable. \n\n  \nI also have a condition that makes my skin hurt, so idk if it's because of that but just adding eye cream to the area hurts, not like stinging but like my finger prints are sand paper, and that has made me think that maybe there is some type of thick lotion or cream I can put on there for my PM routine (or AM too)? I have used aquaphor a few times but if I understand correctly that doesn't really add moisture, just lock the moisture in that's already there? The aquaphor does not give me the \"sand paper fingers\" feeling, so I was thinking that based off of that, some type of really thick cream could be a good thing. \n\n  \nI am using the LRP Cicaplast baume on my face at night right now for PM, but it does seem to break me out a little (but still worth it for the effect atm) so I'm unsure if that is the best choice for my under eyes or if there is something better that hopefully won't cause milia or breakouts. \n\n  \nI have a habit of skin picking and right now it is really really bad so I'm doing an extremely basic skin care routine for now. I used to have a lot of actives and stuff but I never really paid attention to what actually worked, I just listened to influencers which was a bad move. I am planning on incorporating actives again in the future, I just want the base to be good first.\n\nRoutine right now: \n\nAM: water or nivea soothing micellar water, ACO eye cream, BoJ Relief sun rice &amp; probiotics. \n\nPM: Nivea soothing micellar water or CeraVe hydrating cleanser, the same eye cream and then the cicaplast baume. \n\nI do have a few mornings and nights per week where I forget the skin care entirely though. Working on it! \n\n  \nUnfortunately my budget is very low as I'm on disability, so that probably limits the options a lot. \n\n  \nIf you have read this far, thank you, and please, let me know if you have any suggestions.\n\n  \n",

Somehow also manages to be frizzy and dry too. Even when i just try to wet it and let it air dry again it gets frizzy unless i get it fully soaked. I got cantu revitalize curls next day spray which i think might help(it was cheap lol). Also diffusing just makes my hair stringy or the curls get crazy, which i think is user error. \n\nAny suggestions? i have to wash my hair so often even when its not greasy because of how ugly it looks but that just makes my hair drier ☹️my hair is pretty fine i wish it would just look presentable i feel like i have a frizzy broom on my head",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "I started using retinal (beauty of joseon retinal eye cream) on my smile lines, forehead creases, and eyes and its been great so far for anti aging purposes but with a catch. My skin no longer looks dull and dehydrated and my fine lines have disappeared, but my problem is now I get these super deep, almost cystic pimples on my forehead. I never had forehead acne before and I havent changed any other part of my skincare routine other than adding this retinal. This is my routine: \n\nMorning: splash of cold water, skin aqua sunscreen\n\nNight: oil cleanse with jojoba oil, wash that off with arencia rosehip cleanser, Dickenson's witch hazel toner (with hylauronic acid) let dry, apply the BOJ eye cream, let it sink in for a minute before moisturizing with straight jojoba oil (if I'm really dry I will add some castor oil too just to thicken it up) \n\nI'm aware of the possibility that this is a hair issue rather than a skincare issue because I do have blunt bangs but I have a few reasons that disprove that theory somewhat. \n\nI use mane and tail shampoo and olaplex rosemary and mint conditioner but my hair still feels horrible and dry after a shower so I put a little jojoba oil in it as well. I genuinely cannot see how this would cause sudden acne, I have had these bangs for more than 7 years now and only recently started getting forehead breakouts. I use jojoba in my hair because I know it doesnt break my skin out.\n\nDid anyone else get acne in a very specific area after starting retinal? I have been using it since october 20th so more than the recommended 6 weeks trial period. I figured if this was \"purging\" it would be finished by now. I appreciate any and all advice!",

Terrible haircut, terribly highlights -- it looks and feels awful. I have used olaplex no 3, k18, deep conditioning masks, etc. etc., and it still feels dry as a bone and I can barely get a wide tooth comb through it even when it's sopping wet and full of conditioner. \n\nThe weird thing it is doing now that it has never done before, and I have gotten highlights for so many years and it never did this until now is -- it is almost not absorbing water. I can be in the shower for 10 minutes and get out and it almost looks partially dry directly out of the shower (I don't towel dry it or use heat styling ever)?? Nothing I am using makes it feel at all conditioned and it is frizzy and rough and poofy and dry as the desert. \n\nFrom everything online, I am getting more and more confused on what my hair needs to look and feel better. I understand the only true fix is to cut it off and start over, but I have done that so many times and I want to keep growing it so hopefully there is something I can do to make it look and feel at least a little better.\n\nDoes anyone out there have any recommendations or understand what is going on with my hair? It also takes hours upon hours to air dry (I only ever air dry it), but that is not new, only the it doesn't feel like it gets properly saturated is new this awful go round at the salon.\n\nAny and all help is much appreciated! \n\nMy routine is: \n\n1. Cowash in shower, and very sporadically use a chelating shampoo (we have awful city water). Then I use curlsmith or similar conditioner in the shower and comb it through and let it sit until the shower is done and then rinse it out. \n\n2. Leave in conditioner - both cream and spray (it's a 10 and whatever else I am experimenting with). \n\n3. Every couple of days since being bleached, I alternate olaplex and k18 or a deep conditioning treatment. \n\n3. Then I put in curl cream/gel/and or mousse (not your mother's line) when my hair is sopping wet, and plop with a tshirt and let air dry. \n\n4. Once it is fully dry, I fluff it out with some oil at the ends and that's that! ",

      "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI’m kind of a newbie to skincare. I have a minimal routine, which I’ll share, but it took me a long time to settle on a product line that doesn’t irritate my skin. I have rosacea and dry, very sensitive skin. \n\nProducts: La Roche Posay gentle foaming moisturizing wash, LRP double repair moisturizer, LRP triple repair cream (if I’m feeling extra dry) , Good Molecules hyaluronic acid serum, Elta MD UV Skin Recovery SPF 50\n\nMorning: cleanse, moisturize, sunscreen \n\nNight: cleanse, serum, moisturizer \n\nOnce a month or so I dermaplane, followed by a hydrating mask, serum, and moisturizer. \n\nOk, now on to the purpose of this post. On a whim this week I booked for a professional hydrafacial and dermaplaning appointment. \n\nShe dermaplaned first, and I immediately noticed that my skin felt much better than when I do it at home. Probably because she had some lightweight oil and better tools, but I did like it. \n\nThe hydrafacial felt…gimmicky? It was kind of just a slathering of products that left my face feeling sticky for hours and I washed off in the evening. My face was really burning during the facial too, but she said to expect that since she just dermaplaned. The next day (today) my skin does feel bouncy and smooth though. \n\nSo my question is- what’s the consensus on paying for these professional services? My gut is leaning towards dermaplaning only, because I do really feel like that was a better and safer process than when I do it at home. It’s leaning away from regular hydrafacials, but maybe 1-2x a year just because I did enjoy the process. If hydrafacials aren’t worth it, do y’all have something else you recommend for my skin type?",

      "content": "First things first. Lets talk about reset wash day. Saturday night or Sunday morning I do a total reset. I double shampoo using a regular moisturizing shampoo (amika for now) followed by mark anthonys daily bond and repair shampoo, then lay down a thick moisturizing mask conditioner. I do not do anything with my hair. I brush with a wide tooth comb and let it air dry. This is a rest day for my hair. No product, no styling, let it breath! (twice a month ill do the curl smith bond salve treatment and twice a month i do the maui cleansing shampoo on these days too.)\n\nMonday-shampoo with marc Anthonys daily bond and repair to get the oil of the deep conditioner off. Next is not your mothers (NYM) leave in conditioner and a light heat protectant. I let that sit and soak in while I do my other shower routine duties. I might mention I do all my styling in the shower. Get a mirror and shower organizer and bring all your products in there with you! Next ill apply a little bit of curl cream and rake that through with my fingers. I use cake beauty but I think any curl cream will be fine. Next, i section off my hair and ultimately do three sections, lower middle, and crown. Rake in NYMs defining medium hold gel. Brush through with the bounce curl brush. Repeat for the next two sections. The crown area is done with the \"no part\" technique and when I get to my bangs, I brush those forward. Now flip your head upside down and scrunch in the NYMs freeze 5 hold gel. Lots of gel! Gel is your friend!\n\nNow we are stepping out of the shower. Hair is dripping wet. Take a t-shirt, flip your head upside down, and scrunch out the excess water and product. \n\nThis next step has been whats the game changer for me: go in and scrunch with a gel to mousse/foam-the extra hold on not dripping wet hair has given me the definition dreams are made of. I use the AG gel to mousse.\n\nDiffuse with head completely upside down. Start with hover diffusing to get the cast going then start to cup dry and form the curls. 50% dry ill flip my head right side up (you're gonna look like you got electrocuted and this is a good sign! Trust the process.) and continue. This is the time to kinda lay down clumps in their spots so you dont have any wonky guys sticking out all sorts of ways. I dry to about 90% dry, break the cast JUST A BIT, continue cup diffusing to about 98% dry. I let them air dry the rest of the way to work and scrunch the crunch out and fluff at work, no oil, it weighs my the down. Voila. \n\nRefresh days: Even with all this work, these hardly last because I sleep in a loose pony tail on a silk pillow case. Refresh days are a lot easier as far as dry time and I get the same look. Dampen with a spray bottle, scrunch in NYMs curl cream (this prevents frizz!! I SWEAR BY IT!!), scrunch in the gel to mousse/foam, cup diffuse. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!!",

      "title": "Reviewing everything I own as a 20y college student",
      "content": "It's 1 am, I am not sleepy so thought why not take out my entire stash of products and review everything \n\n\nBodycare \n\nFoxtale Exfoliating bodywash (2% SA and Zn PCA) : Doesn't smell as good as you would expect from the packaging. 8/10, definitely helped with skin smoothening, but nothing extraordinary.\n\nLasts about a month and half \n\nIf you are in a budget, feel free to skip this and get an ordinary bodywash\n\nDove Exfoliating Body Polish (Lavender Variant) :\nLiteral game changer. I use this every 3 days + shaving, my skin has never been smoother\n\n and honestly the inside of my arms and outside are pretty close in complexion now. For context, my outer exposed to the sun side of arm used to be really tanned for years. Feels amazing on skin too\n\n10/10\n\nVaseline body lotion : Been using this for like a couple of weeks now, in the morning on body, since it's winter. Pretty good as a lotion, moisturizes well, smells good. Nothing extraordinary \n\n9/10\n\n\n\n\nFoxtale brightening body lotion : Used up 3 bottles by now. Use this at night time. No visible difference. As I started using the scrub and this pretty much at the same time, not sure if the brightening in the skin was due to this or due to the scrub. Doesn’t have a heavenly smell or anything. Good consistency. Lasts approx a month if used regularly.\n\nNo rating as I am pretty neutral on this.\n\n\nGlycolic Acid (08%) (Minimalist) : Helps greatly with body odour, apply this regularly at night on armpits, and even when you sweat you won’t stink. \n\n10/10 \n\nConscious Chemist Rapid Repair : Bought this for stretch marks on my butt. Unsure if helped or not as I stopped using it after a month or so and again resumed after a week or so. Smells awful. No other review, but honestly, the consistency is good and moisturizes well. \n\nWishCare Sunscreen Body Lotion : Get kinda too lazy to apply this on the whole body before going out, so haven’t used enough to give a proper review. But so far so good based on applying it on hands before going out in the sun. \n\n\nSkincare\n\nMy TDR Gold Face wash (Korea red ginseng) : Idk where tf my mom got this from (she told me she got this imported from some online supplier online, and cost about 1.5k), but a heavenly product. S tier. Lasted me for 3 years or more, atp I don’t even remember. Now about to run out of this. Skin feels squeaky clean after using this. Consistency is kinda like rice paste, and feels grainy and comfy. Ik this is available on alibaba but you can’t really get it exported unless you are a business person importing in large volume, but if you do, it’s only around $1-$2 per packaging. \n\n100/10, anyone if you have this product please let me know, willing to buy. I won’t have any more once I run out of this one I have\n\nGlycolic Acid (08%) (Minimalist) : Used to use this on face for a long time for hyperpigmentation (I had very subtle ones, so not a stark difference), eventually felt like I don’t really have any more. Plus these products increase photosensitivity and as I have to stay out in the sun due to college I stopped applying this one face. But definitely effective. Go for this when you are on vacation or if you stay inside out of sun. Don’t risk it even if you apply sunscreen regularly.  \n\nLasts 6-7 months or more, even when used regularly (both on body and face, I used to at times even apply this on knees, and elbows when I wasn’t too lazy and still it lasts this long). Great investment even on budget. \n\n9/10\n\nAlps Aloevera Gel: Mom got me this , again idk from where. Use this as a humectant before applying moisturiser, so far so good. Watery texture, so most prolly authentic aloevera\n\n7-8/10, nothing out of ordinary\n\nDot &amp; Key Hydrating Gel Moisturiser: This is my first purchase. The consistency is really really good. Use this at both morning and night time. Will buy again. Not sure how well it works, but skin feels well hydrated. (could be a lot of more factors, but do think this works)\n\nLasts at most a month if used regularly\n\n8/10\n\nJenna Essence Cocoberr Strawberry Face Pack : Made in thailand, Mom got this imported, again unsure where to get this, if someone does know let me know. Cause not S tier, but A+ product. I use this like once every 2 months maybe, really dries your face out. But you get that instant brightness that actually stays and feels so clean and refreshed. \n\n10/10, would buy again if I knew where to get this from. \n\nLasts over a year or two if used occasionally like I do. Net weight - 400g\n\nAqualogica sunscreen : Heard that it doesn’t work that well for sun protection so after 5-6 purchases of this, got the deconstruct one, but yet to use this since I am home for vacation and didn’t go out in the sun. \n\nBut my personal experience has been really good. Could also be because I also cover my face physically alongside the sunscreen, so I thought that the lack of face tan was due to this. But feels very non-sticky. And affordable ofc. Lasts a month or two. For me more since I don’t reapply my sunscreen. \n\nMinimalist SA Acid : Been using this consistently for a good while and no result. Just waiting to run out of it. Didn’t work at all for me, and atp my only skin concern on my face is the blackheads. \n\n0/10\n\nThe ordinary AHA BHA peeling solution (30% AHA, BHA 2 %): Unsure if it works, but then again I have been using this tiny bottle for a year and a bit more since after using you are not supposed to have any sun exposure for a whole week. So I only apply this when I am back home for vacations. Didn’t work on my blackheads though. But guess slightly improved with complexion.\n\nNo rating, feel weirdly neutral\n\nMinimalist Undereye Cream : Second purchase, also use the dot and key under eye cream when I am in my college town. So left that in my pg. Can’t rate yet as ig it’s more of preventive skin care so will only know after years. \n\nBorolips (Purple variant): Mom got me this, first time trying it. The tint looks great. Doesn’t last that long. Doesn’t help with moisturizing lips really, and smells awful. Just use it at home for now.\n\n5/10\n\nOG vaseline lip balm : Works so so good for lip moisturization. Only downside no tint. But love love it as a lip care product.\n\n10/10\n\nHaircare:\n\nKetoconazole Shampoo BP (2% W/V) : Helped greatly with the dandruffs. First purchase. Dad got this from drugstore. I used other ketoconazole shampoos before on my dermat’s suggestion since due to my dandruff I had to go see one, but nothing worked or felt as good as this one. But usually though, I mean except this time, (not sure if i will continue buying this after winter, cause kinda expensive for me) I just use regular 1 or 2rs dove shampoo sachets. Personally I think unless there’s any medical condition any shampoo works. \n\n11/10\n\nUse once every 3 days\n\nDove Deep Moisturizer : Game changer. I struggled extremely with my hair frizz and nothing helped as much as this. First purchase, but love it so far. Looks like it will last long too. I personally use this after shampooing and then leave it for 2 minutes or so while I apply the body wash and then rinse it off.\n\n10/10\n\nUse once every 3 days\n\nLoreal hair repair : That tiny without label bottle. Got this for free from nykaa. Didn’t work at all for me personally. Just used it as handwash after a few tries\n\n0/10\n\nStreax Hair Serum : Got this before getting the hair mask and changing my hair care routine, cause I hated how unkempt I looked despite so much effort in college, all cause of the frizz. But honestly I don't think I am gonna need it anymore.\n\nDon’t buy, not a good investment. Was first purchase, so might use it occasionally to run out of this. \n\n0/10\n\nDove conditioner : Used to use this before the mask. First or second purchase I think. Didn’t use regularly enough to see any noticeable result. Will use till runs out but won’t buy again. Mask was more worth it. \n\n6/10\n\nArata Curly hair cream : Got this like a couple of years back thinking I would style my hair to get the curly hair girly look, but then gave up. Started reusing it a month ago. The day after shampoo + mask, and so far so good. Would buy again. I bought the gel too, but I think I like the cream more and won’t repurchase the gel. \n\nParachute hair oil : The og. Only apply this across length, as my dermat told me to not apply oil on my scalp after seeing my dandruff. I use this the day after applying the cream, (after showering once the cream is rinsed of). Works good for a hair oil, affordable, lasts long\n\nHonestly 8/10, nothing extraordinary but great.",
