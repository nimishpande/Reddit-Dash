      "content": "Finally sharing my progress here! I take 1.25mg every day. My hair loss treatment journey is kinda funny because I only noticed I was thinning considerably because I had just gotten a buzzcut due to my best friend passing away April this year and one of the things he wanted me to do the most was getting a buzz cut. \n\nAfter buzzing I noticed how bad it was and hopped initially on both topical 5% minoxidil and finasteride, I got pretty good results within 2 months but I ditched minoxidil because it was just too inconvenient to use, y’all know that. While I was afraid I was going to lose all the ground I had gained back, I didn’t! So luckily I was able to maintain everything. As far as side effects is concerned, I haven’t experienced much difference, however during the first 2-3 weeks my sex drive was through the roof, I was horny all the time, but that decreased back to what I consider a normal level. 0 changes. Thank God lol\n\nPlan on taking it for life as I look much better with a full head of hair. I’m grateful for my best friend Lucas, if it wasn’t because of the buzzcut I’d probably never realize how important hair is to me. Hair all day every day!!!!\n\nSorry for the long text! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me anything!",

Now I work a blue collar job, I've got my head next to running car's tail pipes for like a quarter of the day and I end up smelling like exhaust by the end of the day, so I feel like I have to wash my hair every day! I know it's not great for my hair, but I don't really know what else to do. I'd try dry shampoo but then I'd have to brush it out and brushing my hair while it's dry always makes it so much more frizzy. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nPer the rules of the sub, I must include my routine (thought I don't know that it's really relevant to the post) so here's what I use.\n\n- As I am Cowash most days\n- Kristin Ess Clarifying Shampoo once a week, immediately followed by Mielle Rosemary Mint Hair Masque\n- Kristin Ess Curl Shampoo and Conditioner on days that I don't use anything that hasn't already been listed. (This is a new addition to the routine, and still kinda in the experimental phase. I had been trying a few different products from Shea Moisture but none of them were really working out for me)\n- A customer at work today recommended As I Am leave in conditioner because we've got basically the same hair except his is in much better health, so that's going in the routine starting today\n- I've been using a microfiber towel to get my hair from \"wet\" to \"damp\" before brushing, but the previously mentioned customer recommended switching to using an old t-shirt (and I'm gonna switch back because I used to use old t-shirts and my hair was in much better shape back then)\n- After Brushing I apply Kristin Ess softening oil to the ends of my hair at the suggestion of my gf to reduce frizz.\n\nIf anything I've mentioned in my routine raises some eyebrows, please say something! I'm at my wit's end trying to get my hair back to how it used to be!",

      "content": "# \n\nOkay this is gonna be a long one but I would really love some input. I'm 28 years old with normal-combo skin and have had roughly the same skincare routine for years which kept my skin youthful, hydrated, and mostly blemish-free other than occasional hormonal acne. That routine is as follows:\n\nMorning: Micellar water, toner (last year or 2 that has been Byoma Brightening Toner), hyaluronic acid serum (Good Molecules), niacinamide serum (also GM), CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion for moisturizer, then sunscreen (last year or 2 that has been La Roche Posay Toleriane Face Sunscreen.\n\nNight: Oil clenaser (Mixsoon Bean Cleansing Oil), CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser, both GM serums again, then a heavier La Roche Posay moisturizer for night time (I believe it's the Lipikar one). I would occasionally do the Good Molecules Overnight Exfoliating Treatment as well.\n\nWithin the last 6 months or so I noticed that I was breaking out a lot more often and nothing I was doing was keeping it under control. I decided to start Differin 0.1% at night (after my other serums) because I was seriously over it. It has been almost full month of that and I've definitely been going through the purging period but I believe I'm very nearly on the other side of that. But even worse than the acne purging which I fully expected was the dryness and irritation that came with using differin. My face was so uncomfortable and itchy all the time so I read up on ways to combat that and started incorporating the GM Ultra-Hydrating Oil and the La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm at night about a week or 2 ago. Both of which helped IMMENSELY with restoring my skin barrier and getting rid of a lot of the irritation/dryness.\n\nSo now we're caught up to the present and my actual request for help lol. I'm feeling a lot better about my routine but still really feel like I have room for improvement. Even though the extra steps I added to combat the differin side effects have helped, I still feel like my skin is getting patches of dryness and irritation in the day time, and the cicaplast is way too heavy and greasy for me to use during the day. I have been using the CeraVe cleanser and moisturizer for years but am wondering if there are better options for me that aren't insanely expensive? I'm okay to spend up to $30-$35 for certain products if they're really worth it, but ideally not more than that. I also would like to find a new sunscreen that doesn't pill on top of my other products. I make sure to allow for plenty of absorption time between products but still find that every sunscreen I've ever used pills. I have also been really curious about azelaic acid which I've been hearing a lot about lately. I find most exfoliants to be too harsh to use regularly enough to see good results so I'm wondering if that would be a good one to try and if I should just add it or swap out any of my current products for it?\n\nI'm sorry y'all, I know this has been extremely long-winded, thank you so much to anyone who has read this far. I am open to absolutely any and all input! If you notice any important steps that are missing, or any steps I'm currently doing that are unnecessary, have specific product recommendations for the ones I'm considering replacing, etc. Thank you all in advance!!!&lt;3",

Now that my wedding is over, I'm ready to change things up a bit. \n\nAs you can see, my natural hair is frizzy, dry, and has some wave to it. I'm petite with a small head, so I feel like the super long hair only looks good on me when it's curled to give it some volume. \n\n When it's shorter like in photo 10, I feel I look older (I'm 29 there, 32 now - photos 1-8 are from this year.) I'm thinking maybe just a tiny bit shorter than it is in 11-12 may be ideal?\n\nI've always wanted to try some kind of bang but I'm worried about it working with my wavy hair and cowlicks. Last photo is me as a little kid with straight bangs but my hair was naturally straighter before puberty lol. \n\nAny ideas on styles I could try? And yeah I want to stick with a wide part unless maybe I have bangs because my face I think is too diamond shaped and asymmetrical for a middle part otherwise. And my widows peak doesn't help, either.  \n\n(I have chin filler and chin Botox now in photos 1-8 if you notice my face shape is a bit different. No other work done yet.)\n",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I've stopped using heat on my hair and been following CGM and variations for a year now. I am so miserable with my hair that I'm thinking of hitting the hair tools again.\n\nI believe my hair is a mix of 2a - 2c waves as sometimes it goes wavier than this image. I have dense hair, and it is mostly high porosity and mixed medium to thick strands, they don't feel super coarse but they are definitely not fine. It has been just over 1 year without heat and I get it trimmed regularly. I don't have any chemical/dye in my hair.\n\nWhatever variation of CGM or wavy girl method I try, I don't get even close to shiny and soft hair. It just seems to love being pouffy and frizzy. I live in a hard water area but have a water filter, it is not a humid climate.\n\nMy routine/some info:\n\n* Low poo Johnson Baby OR Cantu co wash OR Tresemme clarifying shampoo to cleanse the roots (only clarifying once in a while as I don't seem to get build up, I'm almost wishing for build up at this point as it would weigh the hair down).\n* Garnier Hair Food Papaya or Banana OR Olaplex Rich Hydrating Mask to condition and also as a leave in.\n* Argan oil as part of LOG method.\n* Giannini Curl Jelly OR Ecostyler Argan OR Ecostyler Olive OR Boots Curl Creme.\n* I never dry brush, I use a wide tooth comb from the ends to roots gently when wet.\n* Have tried S2C, plopping, finger coiling etc etc. I now just scrunch and air dry as it's easier and none of them made a difference.\n* I always sleep on a silk pillow with a silk eyemask. Sometimes I use a silk cap but it seems to be hit and miss, some mornings my hair is flat and shiny and others its a frizz bomb. Sometimes I use a silk scruncy to pineapple, again hit and miss.\n* I attempt to refresh on non wash days by wetting my ends and putting more oil then gel or creme on, but it doesn't seem to work.\n* I only wash my hair once a week, this photo is hair that hasn't been washed for 5 days and has been refreshed everyday.\n* I use cool water rather than hot.\n* Protein treatments seem to make it more straw like, so I don't use them. I'm not sure if this is protein build up or something else, seems to be conflicting theories on this!\n\nI seem to either have hair like the attached photo, where it's pouffy, not defined, looks in terrible condition and no products or refreshing seem to help. Or it's wavier and more defined (thankfully) but then the minute I go outside it pouffs up and becomes frizzier. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason to which it decides to do.\n\nI see other people's straight, wavy, curly, or coily hair walking down the street staying roughly how they styled it and feel utterly at a loss as to where I'm going wrong. I really don't want to pick up the straighteners again but my hair was shinier, softer and stayed how I styled it back then!\n\nI would love some advice, tips, tricks, any products you think I'm missing or shouldn't be using from what I've mentioned. Anyone with similar hair who've achieved shiny, soft, silky waves? I have all my fingers and toes crossed for some renewed hope.",

I'm struggling to find a happy medium between weighted down curls and too frizzy curls. \n\nFor some background: \nmy hair is on the finer side, I do have a lot of hair on my head, just thin strands. My curls are also 100% white lol, they are not multicultural. \n\nWhat I've tried: \nPicture #1 in the grey shirt, is day 3 curls only refreshed with a steamer, no additional product. \nPicture #2 is day 1 curls with the following products on: pillow soft curls cream custard, the doux moose def texture foam, and not your mother's hair gel. The product was put on in sections, with a curl brush, diffused with a diffuser. (my usual routine). \n\nMy problem:\nI noticed that when using the products I mentioned, I feel that my curls are weighed down and I can't get any volume and they become frizzy by the end of the day. When I wear no products, I like the volume and softness, but it goes frizzy too fast. I also cannot pinpoint my hair type (2a, 2b, ect), which may help me. \n\nAre there any product recommendations out there that fix this issue? If you had this issue, what are you doing to stop it? Any tips for me and my journey? Keep in mind ive only been wearing it curly out the house for a few months now. \n\nThank you in advance! 💗\n\n\n",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
