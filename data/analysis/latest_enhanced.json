      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "\n\nHi everyone, I really need some quick recommendations because I have to place my orders in the next two days and I’m completely overwhelmed.\n\nA bit of background so you understand my situation: I’m an Indian tan–brown skin girly, and due to personal struggles I stopped using makeup and even basic skincare for over a year. I’m finally getting back into it and basically restarting from zero. I want to rebuild a simple but effective makeup, skincare, and haircare routine, and a friend coming from the US has offered to bring things for me.\n\nI’ll mainly be shopping from NYX, LA Girl, Wet n Wild, and other drugstore brands, but I’m also placing a few orders on Ulta and other US websites if the products are worth it. My budget is around 20 USD per product, but I can stretch a little for something genuinely good.\n\nI would be incredibly grateful for recommendations for:\n• Blushes (cream or powder) that work well on tan/brown skin  \n• Lipsticks or lip products that flatter deeper tones  \n• Face products: concealers, foundations, tinted moisturizers, primers  \n• Drugstore must-haves from NYX, LA Girl, Wet n Wild, etc.  \n• Ulta exclusives or US-only products worth picking up  \n• Skincare or haircare items that are worth bringing from the US  \n\nHaircare part:  \nI recently got the Dyson Airwrap ID because my hair has suffered heat damage. I have shoulder-length hair and I’m learning how to use the attachments properly. The same friend coming from the US has agreed to bring extra attachments for me.\n\nI’m looking for:\n• Third-party Dyson Airwrap attachments (like AirStrap, round brush dupes, curl barrels) that you have personally tried, that fit well, and don’t damage the Dyson  \n• Trusted brands that ship online or are available in the US  \n• Any sales on official Dyson attachments on Dyson, Ulta, Sephora, or Best Buy  \n• Hairstyling products (heat protectants, volume sprays, hold sprays) that work well with the Airwrap, especially for short shoulder-length hair  \n\nSince I’m rebuilding everything from scratch and the order is urgent, I’d truly appreciate any advice, reviews, or product suggestions. Thank you so much to anyone who takes the time to help me.\n",

I’ve unfortunately never had anyone in my life to be able to show me what to do with curly hair, let alone my own. Now I know people say “oh just watch YouTube!” But I’ve tried and I never feel like I’m doing it right, and I give up (I know I shouldn’t). \n\nI’ve thought about trying another curly hair salon/cut but the prices are insane and I just quite simply can’t afford it, especially considering the last time someone told me they knew how to cut curly hair, I ended up with a “jellyfish cut” according to the next hair dresser who saw my hair. \n\nBut anyways here’s the info about my hair:\n\nWhen it first starts drying, it immediately is super frizzy and is in very loose very thin curls which I’m not too keen on. (not the type of curl youll see in the last photos, those are cute, but they only happen towards my scalp at the bottom of my head).\n\nIf I let my hair dry, and then brush it, obviously it is a massive frizzy mess, but once settled the bottom of my hair will curl, but that’s it and the top layer of my hair is ALWAYS so frizzy and has no curls no matter what I do, even when I just let it air dry without brushing, or even scrunching, and I HATE it!\n\nFor my routine: I’m currently using the “Kirsten ess the one” signature shampoo and conditioner however I feel like my hair is so dry and almost sticky after using it (sticky might not be the right word), but it’s like there’s left over stuff in my hair no matter how much I rinse it. After that I use a renewing argon oil of Morocco oil, and I use this almost daily too on my lengths and ends if needed. I have silk pillowcases, but no bonnet or anything since I see no point if my hair is just straight and frizzy \n\nPhotos attached:\nThe photos where I have blonde hair are from a couple years ago, and I’ve never seen my hair like this again since, I truly have NO idea what I did to get my hair like this, but I know I did something.. but I absolutely love how my hair looks curl wise and I wish I could replicate it.\n\nThe other photos is what my hair is like now/pretty much all of the time.\n\nIf anyone has any tips or advice, I’d love to know. I don’t know what my curl pattern is or anything so I feel pretty lost. I’m the only one in my family with curly hair and unfortunately don’t have any curly haired friends. \n",

You know how that goes they give you medication and etc. I know this is a bit off topic I’m sorry.. anyways.. I got on accutane bc my dermatologist told me it was the only way to help with my hormonal acne and I did. Wasn’t even on a high dosage and I ended up getting kp on my chest and face… it’s ruining my life and i personally don’t know what to do. I know people will say “don’t let it affect your life”, but it’s hard. The texture everywhere makes my skin crawl. I don’t know what to do.. I avoid places and going out because I feel so ugly. I’m just wondering if anyone that sees this and has had kp.. well someone with kp as severe as mine were you able to get rid of it?.. like through laser or something. I need some reassurance that it can get better bc I cannot personally handle this anymore.. it kills me and sorry if I seem dramatic, but it just hurts me.

All I have in my hair in this picture is Trader Joe's leave in conditioner. It was air dried. I have tried gels and mousse but it usually leaves my hair looking dirty, weighed down, or stringy.

Why?  The wayit glides on, feels on, smells?  Is it the packaging? Does it remind you of something? Spark your imagination? Relax you? Make you feel special?\n\nMine aren’t particularly fancy. One is Avene’s Revitalizing Nourishing Creme; it comes in regular and riche, and I alternate according to the season.  It’s cheap enough for me to always buy it consistently, the scent is very light, and I love the way it glides on and delivers a surge of moisture.\n\nThe others ones that are memorable unfortunately are not as easily available.  One was Dr. Jart’s Body Oil, discontinued years ago.  It had this soft emollient quality that I have not been able to find in any other body oil since then.  My skin just soaked it up and felt smooth and soft, not just slippery the way dry body oils feel.\n\nThe other was this shea butter, mango butter, and jojoba oil balm that I bought from a vendor at an art fair.  It’s called Pharoanic Healing Butter Balm from Egyptian Botanicals and though the scent is sharp and medicinal, it smells the way I imagined Ancient Egypt smelling when I was a little kid.  I use it on my cuticles nightly and dream of ancient lands every time.\n\nWhat are your most pleasurable skincare products (or routines?)",

Because they cut it while the hair was in these clumps, the face framing pieces were kind of specific to the way my hair was styled at the time… but now that I’ve washed it, the shorter pieces have clumped with longer pieces and it’s all generally the same length. \n\nI don’t know what to do, especially since I have my senior graduation pictures coming up soon, and I kind of care that they turn out nice.

      "content": "I recently bought a tube of Differin for the  main reason being the issues Ive had with my skin for a while.\n\nAnyways, Im trying to see if there is a recommended cleanser or moisturizer to use when using Adapalene because I’ve used other exfoliants / serums before, AHA’s, BHA’s, Ghk - cu. I used all of them for at minimum 4 weeks and see no results good or bad really. It’s like my skin doesn’t react to it at all.\n\nI currently just use a daily gentle cleanser and moisturizer from cerave but I am wondering if I will need more high quality products or if it’s recommended because I see a lot people using La roche posay. \nMoney isn’t the issue but I’m trying to be as safe as possible\n\nAlso if there is any recommendations on how to possibly reduce or help the purging stage if my skin purges.\n\nBTW - My skin type is mixed but more oily than anything. Although my skin gets dry around my nose and chin sometimes.",
