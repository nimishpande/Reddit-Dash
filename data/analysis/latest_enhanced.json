Then it started happening to me in my early 20s, and my perspective completely changed.\nYou start checking mirrors differently without even realizing it. You become aware of lighting everywhere you go. You avoid overhead lights. You wear caps even when it feels awkward, even during workouts. You keep telling yourself it is not that bad while knowing deep down that the density is slowly disappearing.\nWhat really gets to you is not the hair itself. It is the constant mental noise. The awareness never shuts off, and it quietly starts dictating how you move through daily life.\nWhat eventually helped me was not a miracle product or some overnight fix. It was learning what actually makes things worse and what is just noise on the internet that keeps you stuck and anxious.\nI am curious how many people here went through the same mental cycle before things finally started to make sense.\n\n",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Your skin doesn’t understand the concept of “indoors.”  \nIt only responds to radiation exposure.\n\nFrom a biological standpoint na, the skin’s pigment cells and collagen fibres react to UVA radiation, not to whether you’re sitting at a beach or like under office AC. Unlike UVB (which causes visible sunburn), UVA rays remain constant throughout the day and penetrate glass effortlessly. This means your skin can be triggering melanin production and collagen degradation even when the temperature is cool and the light feels harmless. What makes this exposure deceptive is its low intensity but high frequency. A few minutes near a window, daily commuting, or repeated indirect sunlight doesn’t cause immediate damage but research shows it leads to photoaging, pigmentation irregularities, and barrier weakening over time. Ik Ik big concepts but then yeah they exist. This is why sunscreen isn’t positioned as an outdoor only product in dermatology. It functions as a biological filter, reducing the amount of radiation that reaches deeper skin layers regardless of whether that radiation comes from a beach or behind a glass panel.\n\nIn other words, office AC doesn’t neutralize UV exposure. It just makes it easier to ignore. I’ve made plenty of skincare mistakes over the years, learnt a lot through trial, error, and listening to people who know better and I’m still learning. Sharing this so it helps you make a more informed choice, not because there’s only one “right\" way. ",

I can never get my hair wet enough to achieve the 'seaweed' texture that people talk about.

For reference, I've got dry, sensitive skin with post-inflammatory erythema from past acne. I've tried Good Molecules (still good) and The Ordinary, but the Ordinary seems like it's getting pricer to me these days. I am just exploring my options! I've seen two other affordable brands, The Minimalist and Geek &amp; Gorgeous, on Amazon. Has anyone tried these? Are they at all worth it? What other affordable brands have you tried that you enjoy? By \"affordable\", I mean products between $5 and $15.\n\nThanks so much for the help! ❤️",

Over the years, I tried multiple ayurvedic and herbal products, but none of them gave lasting results.\n\nAround 2020, I started experiencing noticeable hair loss.

This includes:\n\nDaily use of minoxidil\n\nOral medication prescribed by the clinic\n\nProducts suggested by Oliva\n\nShampooing around 4 days a week\n\n While the dandruff is somewhat manageable now, the hair growth has been quite slow and the overall density hasn’t improved as much as I had hoped.\n\nAt this point, I’m confused about whether I should continue with the same routine or explore other options. I’d really appreciate advice from people who’ve dealt with long-term dandruff and hair loss.\n\nWhat worked for you?\n\nShould I tweak my routine, get a second opinion, or just be more patient?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I have CeraVe AM, trader Joe's ultra hydrating gel moisturizer, nopalera's sugar scrub, and CeraVe from the tub and I just bought tretinoin, the ordinary AHA 30%+BHA 2%, Azelaic acid suspension 10%, and ilso Super Melting Sebum Softener.\n\n  \nI am now overwhelmed. \n\nWhat should I do in the morning? Which should I do first? Which should I let dry and then layer, which should I layer immediately? What should I do everyday? How often should I do everything else?

My topical was .025% finasteride and I was applying about 1 ml, by my calculations that’s about .25 mg applied. \n\nI have heard about the birth defects caused from pregnant women exposed to finasteride, and am worried sick I have accidentally harmed my child. \n\nI would apply it at my job in the parking lot around 6:30-7 am, I’d then wash my hands after applying it. I’d also wear a hard hat  so maybe that rubbed off some of the topical throughout the day.\n\nI’d return home at around 3:30-4:15 pm depending on the day. I would not shower immediately when I got home and would hug my wife and even lay down in bed with her, I’m worried the residue got on the pillows and sheets and she might have been exposed that way or maybe by touching my hair (although I always have told her not to touch my crown and temples before I’d shower around 7 pm) \n\nThe positives are she hasn’t been in my car since she was pregnant and hasn’t been in the same room of where I’d apply my topical. Does anyone have a similar story? How’d it turn out? Our first OB appointment is in a week and I will make them aware of this, but in the meantime I am worried sick about this ",

(Like do this every morning&amp;evening, do this only 1 time a week etc\ni have alot of things i want to try/do, but some of them are every day type of things, and some things are weekly etc and my mind is just so messy to write down exactly what i should do each day 🥺\n\nthings i want to incorporate;\n\nmorning and evening skincare(i know the steps to do already)(how often to do face mask\n\nbrushing teeth 2 times a day\n\nwhitening teeth\n\nUsing gua sha/massage\n\nshowering more/better (not sure how often i should, and when to do quick shower and when to everything shower/washing hair)\n\noiling hair/scalp massage etc (should i do more to my hair like braiding/putting oil etc? i have frizzy wavy hair, but i straighten it)\n\nshaving\n\n wearing makeup/doing my hair every time i leave the house\n\ni'm sorry if this is a big ask(and ofcourse you dont have to help), but i just want to put more effort into how i look and how people percieve me, but i've been in survival mode for years 🥺 i want to not feel so messy/dirty/sloppy anymore and just feel like i always look my best, and actually start making myself feel better in my skin. \n\n\n if anyone is willing to help even a little, i would be so grateful ❤️\n\n",
