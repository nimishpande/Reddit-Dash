Not sure if this is a reliable indicator of my actual hair porosity.\nThe area I live in has what is considered very soft water so i have not worried about it affecting my hair.\n\nI have tried no shampoo routines and curly friendly routines but my hair just always seems to look like the picture below. Lots of frizz and no definition.\n\nI have not used any heat or chemical treatments on my hair but i have started noticing that some parts of my hair that used to be tight ringlets have gone completely straight and limp (cant see it in the photo, thet are hiding at the bottom) and this has gotten me worried that the rest of my hair is set to follow.\n\nAny suggestions on how to fix my frizz and strange straight limp strands will be appreciated!\n\n",

It's one of the hardest things I've had to go through, being at home with family should be the safest place for you but instead it causes you the most pain. \n\nBut you can't control everyone so try your best to ignore it. And think about it in all other things of your life, never make fun of anyone about anything, especially about things that is out of their control. It should be something you shouldn't have to tell soemone but you'd be surprised. Sometimes in life you only learn lessons by going through it yourself. ",

      "content": "Until ~3 years ago I never had acne. Not in my teens, not in early adulthood. I washed my face with water, used nothing, and my skin was fine.\n\nAround 24, after some recommendations, I started using skincare products (cleansers, moisturizers, SPF, later “acne treatments”). Around the same time residency stress kicked in. That’s when acne started — mostly forehead / hairline, inflammatory but not severe.\n\nOver the past years I’ve tried everything:\ndifferent cleansers, moisturizers, SPF, azelaic acid, retinoids (including Aklief), simplified routines, “barrier repair”, diets, supplements, stress management. Nothing truly worked long-term. At best it fluctuated, at worst it got more persistent. Treatments never gave clear control — sometimes they even seemed to maintain the problem.\n\nWhat I’ve noticed looking back:\nwhenever my routine was chaotic or minimal (especially summers, fewer products), my skin was calmer. The more “correct” and consistent the routine became, the more constant the breakouts felt.\n\nI’ve recently stopped all actives, and now I’m doing a proper zero-therapy trial: washing only with water, no products, no treatments, nothing — just to see my real baseline again.\n\nI know this won’t magically cure everything, but at this point I want clarity more than constant intervention. If my skin was fine for years without products, I want to see what happens when I truly leave it alone again.\n\nNot looking for miracle advice — just sharing my experience and seeing if anyone else with late-onset, treatment-resistant acne has noticed something similar.\n",

I use leave in conditioner often and shampoo and condition every three to four days. Shower everyday though and wet my hair during but no product other than those days. I’m just wondering if I’m the kind of hair that needs a bonnet or something to prevent breakage or stuff. Also, everyone in my life says I look like I got electrocuted when my hair dries and I wake up. Very movable and moldable but definitely crazy. Thanks! Help and advice is appreciated!

No white cast \nBut one thing is noticed is after 30-45 mins of applying this makes my skin super dull, so much dull that my friends asked didn't I wash my face in the morning :( \nIn terms of tan protection I would give this 6.5/10. I did experience slight tanning after applying this (But not more than reequil matte sunscreen, coming to that in a bit) but this made my skin dull so I am using this as a body sunscreen now \n\n\n2) Isntree hyaluronic sunscreen \nThis has been my biggest regret :( \nThe finish is super oily and greasy (It's muchh more than dewy) It literally feels like I dipped my face in grease bucket. Although it didn't make my face dull, but it did make my face super oilyyy \nIn terms of tan protection I would give this 9/10. Did not experience tanning after applying this, but this did make my face look more of a \"Sweaty\" apperance.\n\n\n3) Reequil matte sunscreen - \nOkay this is exactly where I'm confused, the sunscreen itself is pretty neat. It gives that velvety kinda finish to my face. It surely blurs out all the open pores. It definitely gives a white cast, which eventually settles down after 15-20 mins. The white cast kinda gives a glow to my face lol. Overall after 1 week of usage I thought I found my HG sunscreen but here's the thing. \nIn terms of tan protection I would give this 0/10. Initially when I applied it gave me a glow on my face I thought it would definitely protect me from tanning too, but this is where I was sooo wrong, THIS gave me the WORST tanning ever. After 1 week of usage I noticed my skin got soo much tanned :( \nNow for getting rid of that tan I need a lot of time :(\nIt's a shame because this sunscreen was soo good for my oily skin, I loved the finish that it gave me. But sadly gonna throw this one out :( \n\n\nNow I need some recommendations from you guys for my next sunscreen \n\nUV doux - Heard the finish is similar to reequil matte, but please tell me how's the protection of that sunscreen \nLoreal invisible resist sunscreen - Heard a lot about this sunscreen, how's the overall finish and protection?\nRecommend something that has a matte finish and good tan protection.
