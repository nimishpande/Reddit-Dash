I also have in the past had them tinted darker, more ashy but dark brown is not a good idea for me either.\n\nI currently tint the transparent hairs with just for men beard dye in blonde (which isn’t mean to be warm) and use fenty light blonde brow pencil (love how light it is but too yellow).\n\nWould appreciate hearing ideas - I’ve heard there are Asian brow gels that lighten? Or maybe there’s another lightening product?\n\nThanks everyone 🙏",

I don't know what to do to make it better. I've looked up makeup plots and how to make facial features look more masculine, but it always turns out I'm looking like drag or barely noticeable.\n\nIn the first picture is my most recent attempt using a contour/concealer stick (palladio cinnamon) where I feel it's too soft/not very noticable. The next set is me using eyeshadow (LA colors cool) The final set I feel looks good, it was done by a drag king though a few years ago, and I've been trying to replicate it.\n\nSo anyone have any tips or suggestions so it doesn't look like drag but isn't light enough so it's not noticable?

I’ve been dealing with persistent redness and what seem like clogged pores around my nose for years. I used to extract them with a tool, but I stopped because I didn’t want to risk damaging my skin.\n\nI saw a dermatologist a while back who thought it might be fungal and prescribed a cream, but it didn’t help. Hydrocortisone provides some temporary relief, but it never fully goes away. The skin in that area is very sensitive — retinol and most active ingredients tend to dry it out or irritate it even more.\n\nDoes anyone have ideas about what this could be or suggestions on how to treat it?",

It has been a struggle her whole life and I just haven't figured it out. \n\nNeed serious help.. she HATES her hair getting combed. I feel like ive tried all the brushes, all the detangle spray but just can't figure it out. Right now I'm dealing with a matted side the worst I've seen. She acts like I'm torturing her and I feel so bad making her sit through it. \n\nAfter I'm through this, what's the best maintenance? When it's all combed out we like to braid it at night, and she has a satin pillow case. I use deep conditioning cream like once a week. \n\nWhat's the best regime for managing her hair?\n\nI have thin stick straight hair and just need to learn how to help her. \n\nThank you for any advice 🙏 ",

But several months ago, I removed nail polish off my toes and noticed my toenails had slightly separated from my skin on the top (larger white sections). It’s happened in the same spot on both big toes, my left one just goes down a lot further than my right one. I googled it and it said it could be from having your nails too long (they weren’t ridiculously long, but were a bit longer than usual). So I trimmed them a lot shorter and hoped they would go back to normal. It’s been several months now and there’s been no change. I’ve kept them short ever since, but it hasn’t helped. Am I able to fix them so they grow normally or am I stuck with weird nails now?\n\n*marked as nsfw as I don’t want to scare people with my ugly toes haha*",

I've never posted something like this and am unsure. Last pic is from earlier in the year, and first 3 are from today.\n\nI'm looking for advice and feedback to improve the appearance and styling of my hair.  I always treated my hair like straight hair, using sulfates &amp; silicones and all that.  Recently I started the beginner routine from the wiki here, co-washing then conditioning with Garnier fructis pure clean conditioner.  After showering I put some curl talk brand \"activating mousse\" in and \"plop\" my hair up in a t shirt for about 10 minutes, then take it out and let it air dry from there. I don't understand \"scrunch out the crunch\" or maybe I'm using too much mousse?? My hair takes a long time to dry and it still often looks kinda wet even once it is dry.\n\nWould love feedback and advice, and open to new styling advice (but looking to keep the length).\n\nMy hair is fine but dense I think, if that makes sense.  I still don't understand porosity.\n\nThanks for your patience and help :)",

I went and got a facial done and the esthetician recommended that I use a gel based moisturizer (I’m using Neutrogena hydroboost gel cream for oily skin)  because when I use a cream one (Cera ve daily moisturizer) it makes my skin very oily. I still get oily when I use a gel moisturizer though. \n\nMy question is this- I have large pores and oily skin. Out of curiosity to see what would happen, I washed my face and didn’t moisturize, my face felt tight and dry. But when I use a heavier moisturizer to try and counteract this, it makes me oily almost instantly. And the light gel one makes me oily too. Any ideas as to why this is happening? ",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI had an accident about 10 years ago when I was a kid. As you can see the skin repaired but now that leg is discoloured/hyper pigmented in comparison. For those wondering never did anything about it because I was 1 young when it happened so I didn’t have a say, 2 it wasn’t something I really thought about later on nor I had the knowledge or money to research any possible treatments to better the appearance.\n\nNow that I am a bit older I have been wondering if there is any options out there to help me? I looked into micro peeling and I’m considering going for a consultation. I would like to say that I’m happy with my body (duh) but sometimes I overthink and makes me feel insecure. I don’t wear short stuff nor show my leg at all.\n\nI have not met many people that have had hot water accidents (2nd burn degree burns to be specific) or specially of darker skin that have left a noticiable scar. Happy to listen to any advice in order to brighten the area as much as possible.\n\nI know that it might not all go away but maybe just a bit. And if it is impossible happy to come to terms with it too! I’ll be reading.\n\nPlease be kind, and thanks in advance!",

      "content": "Hi, Im 26 male. Have been on oral minoxidil 2.5mg once a day for past 6 months. And finasteride 1mg every other day for 4ish months- gonna up finasteride to daily now.\n\nI saw a dermatologist and they recommended the above treatments. Initial shed for minoxidil did occur- sometimes on shampoo days id lose 100ish in the shower, some even when drying with a towel. On non shampoo days, maybe id lose 20ish and 10 while styling\n\nNOW: On non shampoo days- I lose maybe around 10 in shower and 10 styling with a brush.\n\nWith shampoo, I lose 70 in shower, and 10-20 styling.\n\nIm just wondering why this shedding is going on for so long, despite reaching now the 6 month mark. I take collagen and multivits too and all my blood work is fine. Not stressed atm.\n\nBy now, expected shedding to drop (some people say their shedding is like 20 only by this time in other threads ive seen) for 6 months on oral minox.\n\nMy main concern was crown and temples. Crown doesnt look any different tbh, still quite bad, and after starting minoxidil, temples look a bit worse. I do see baby hairs, but temples look lighter than last year for example.\n\nI know people stay to stick with it but im struggling. Any advice, is this normal to shed this much still? I still see couple of strands of hair on my bed, on my bathroom floor etc- so even without shampoo i shed here and there!",
