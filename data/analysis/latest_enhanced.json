My curls feel way less frizzy in the morning now.\n\nPicture was taken 2 days after washing.\n\n**The Routine:**\n\n* **Wash:** Co-wash with **Hask Detangling Curl Care Conditioner**. I spend a good couple of minutes massaging the scalp to make sure it’s clean, then rinse.\n* Apply **Cantu Curl Cream** to soaking wet hair and scrunch them\n* **L**et it air dry\n* Once it’s completely bone-dry, I Scrunch Out The Crunch to get rid of the cast and make it soft.\n\nThanks to everyone in this community for the tips and the motivation to embrace the curls! I know it's a pretty basic routine and theres definitely space to improve but it works for me.",

I began treatment on September 8th, and as you can see, I’ve already had great results in just 3.5 months\n\nMy concern is the timeline: I’m getting married on September 2026, which is only seven months after the transplant. From what I know, seven months isn’t usually enough time to see the full results of an HT.\n\nRight now, I’m using hair fibers to cover the thinning areas, and it looks really good. So my question is - should I go ahead with the transplant in February, or postpone it and let the medications continue working (which would give me a full year of treatment by the time of the wedding)? Worst case, I could still use hair fibers for the wedding if needed.",

She also has a double crown so her hair on top grows in an awkward direction. \n\nI really want to do right by their curls but feel very out of my depth!\n\nHair routine is just child’s farm curly shampoo and conditioner and occasionally their leave-in conditioner too.

During the pandemic, my hair lost a lot of density, elasticity, and shine. It was no longer bouncy, just dead. Since that time, I have struggled to keep it as beautiful as it once was. I am literally desperate. I have tried it all: mousse, gel, cream, diffusing upside down, airdrying, ploppling, diffusing like Manes by Mel explains, conditioner, no conditioners, vegan/cruelty-free products, commercial products, Biotin, sleeping with a bonet... Sometimes my hair looks better than other times, depending on where I'm living (the water quality) and how humid it is. My hair looked like the first picture when I lived where I currently live now, too, but now it can’t stay that beautiful. No matter what, I can never achieve the level of perfection (in my view) that my hair had back then (first pictures). The worst thing is, I can't even remember my routine! I think I used whatever product I saw, and I didn't care too much about the process. Right now, my hair is unable to grow (not even nicely, just grow) past a certain length, especially in the face area (I don’t have equal hair lenght). It seems dry, but I am always told I overcondition, so I am very confused... I am tired and don't know what to do. My hair used to fall on my shoulders and bounce. Now, it seems to be straight out of the roots, but it does like a plateau, then curly. The curl pattern and texture of the hair are better on the back of my neck than on my scalp and ends, but in general it has no life. I do not have any deficiency, but I do have PCOs, which I treat with birth control (since 2023). I haven't been pregnant.\n\nCurrent routine: wash thrice a week, cold water, John Frieda Frizz Ease Dream Curls Shampoo, Giorgi Mousse (level 4), once a week Milk Goat conditioner. To refresh, John Frieda Refresh Curls. Rosemary oil on my scalp before washing, with a massage. Before, I was using Aussie products (shampoo and cream). I use a bonet to sleep and dry it following Manes by Mel. \n\nPlease, what can I do? Am I ever getting that hair back? I've seen a lot of miracles around here... Help a gal out.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Around 6 inches long on the top with a layered haircut. Pretty high density.   \n  \nAnd I realized I have a problem where my hair doesn't really start curling from the root but around 1 inch up from the root. And that often makes it flat at some parts. I have a routine that counters this, which is finger curling while it's wet and has product in it. This method manually lifts every square inch of my roots, so it definitely helps. But the method isn't sustainable due to how long it takes, it's just not very feasible on certain days (I style it every day because it gets messed up when I sleep even with silk pillow cases, I roll around too much apparently :( \n\nI try a method where I section it and scrunch each section, when I don't wanna go with the long finger curling routine. It doesn't work because I'm probably not sectioning it properly, I don't know if my hair density is making it harder. But when I do this method it just dries flat and doesn't curl at the root. I can't figure out how to use the curl defining brush to make things easier. It makes my hair stand up in some places and flat in others. \n\nRoutine that doesn't work:   \n\\- Wash hair with shampoo. Company: DesignMe Curly shampoo. Condition with the same company's \"volumizing conditioner\"   \n\\- Apply Miche gel-to-foam styling mousse, rake it through, and unsuccessfully try to form clumps with a curl defining brush. Then scrunch whatever I get as a result. I try to section my hair unsuccessfully and scrunch it in sections. Then I diffuse upside down. \n\n  \nWhats the best way to get curls to curl at the root when they tend to curl at mid lengths? \n\nThanks!",

I've been using Aveda Invati that I purchased on sale, and while it's clearly high quality, it's also incredibly expensive...especially now that it's no longer on sale. That being the case, I'm looking for another natural shampoo and conditioner that work well for people with thinning hair. I will add the disclaimer that I'm well aware no shampoo or conditioner actually treat hair loss. That's not what I'm asking here. I just need a good natural (i.e., no SLS, etc.) shampoo and conditioner that aren't egregiously expensive but that are specifically not problematic to those with thinning hair. If they add noticeable volume and fullness that's great, but most important are the ingredients and overall quality. I realize every scalp is different so opinions are subjective, but it would be great to have some recommendations. Yes, I have looked through the wiki and tried to do other research in this sub. There are just so many products out there, new ones come out all the time and old favorites are sadly prone to formula changes, so any recommendations to help narrow the field would be much appreciated!",

Still, my cheeks are red, covered in dark marks from old acne and some picking, and I’m feeling really low about how my skin looks.\n\nI’ve been using a gentle cleanser (CeraVe Hydrating facewash), minimalist HOCl spray, Foxtale ceramide moisturizer, sunscreen daily, and adapalene at night. I used to pick at my skin a lot, which made things worse, but I’m trying to stop.\n\nI just need some advice or reassurance:\n\nDid anyone else’s redness and scars look this bad before it got better?\n\nHow long did it take before your skin tone started evening out?\n\nIs there anything gentle I can add later to help fade these red/brown marks faster?\n\nI know it takes patience, but it’s hard to keep believing that it’ll get better when I feel like I’ve made my face worse. Any encouragement or similar stories would mean a lot.\nThank you 💛",

I also have pretty significant bags under my eyes and some pitted scarring (looks like boxcar/icepick scars) that I’d eventually like to deal with.\n\nMy goal right now is to clear the active breakouts and calm the redness before I look into professional treatments for the scars. I’ve put together a \"budget-friendly\" cart on Amazon (Belgium/Germany) and wanted to see if this looks like a solid routine or if I’m missing something.\n\nMy Skin Type: Oily/Combination, very prone to redness/inflammation, and some deep-set scarring.\n\nThe Proposed Routine:\n\n* Cleanser: CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (The 473ml big bottle)\n* Serums (AM/PM): The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% (for oil/acne) &amp; Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG (for the eye bags)\n* Redness Treatment: The Inkey List Azelaic Acid 10% Serum\n* Moisturizer: Simple Hydrating Light Moisturiser\n* Spot Treatment: Zemolo Hydrocolloid Acne Patches (300 pack)\n\nA few questions for the experts here:\n\n1. Is 10% Niacinamide too high to start with if my skin is already quite red?\n2. Should I use the Azelaic Acid in the morning or at night?\n3. I have some pitted scars—I know creams won't fix those, but will this routine at least help the overall texture while I clear the acne?\n4. Are these Zemolo patches as good as the more expensive ones like Hero?\n\nAny advice or swaps would be greatly appreciated! I'm trying to keep the whole set under €70. Thanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbk6wx15r19g1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb7d6794c16f4fd35dc1ff1aac371c1dfdce1d93\n\n",

I also have a lot of acne and you can see the resulting hyperpigmentation (?) on my forehead.\n\nMy current routine only consists of clearasil rapid action face wash. I'm too scared to use moisturiser in case it blocks my pores and causes a breakout but I know I should as my face is rather dry.\n\nI've been doing some research lately and have come up with some products I was thinking of getting but I'd rather take advice from you guys as you know much more than I do.\n\nSerum: the ordinary 10% niacinamide/garnier vitamin c brightening\nMoisturiser: cerave spf 50\nToner: ?\nExfoliant:?\n\nI'm looking for product and routine recommendations as I feel quite lost amongst the masses of products and ingredients out there.

Haven’t had bad acne in years (25 now). Well, February 2025 I started going to the gym heavily, in turn drinking energy drinks frequently. I also started using Tretinoin on my face around this time instead of my Adapalene. Fast forward to now my skin is wrecked and it began to get bad around March/April 2025, but is progressively getting worse. So I have tried EVERYTHING. Stripping back my routine to my old one that cleared my teenage acne. Using Adapalene again, stopping Tretinoin. Using Azaleic acid, Mandelic acid, BHA. I did read where energy drinks can cause acne and inflammation through cortisol and B12. So I laid off of those a lot. It seemed to help a little, but still hasn’t really been long enough. (About 2 weeks now) Is my skin barrier ruined? Do I stop everything and just repair my barrier? Like what is causing this to happen? I wash my sheets weekly, I am VERY CAREFUL of what goes on my skin because it is so sensitive. Is it hormones, do I need Accutane? I’m just so lost at this point as to what is going on. I don’t sweat in the gym, I wash my face twice a day with La Roche (have used it for years). Like nothing crazy has changed besides starting Tretinoin over 8 months ago now, gym, energy drinks, and that’s it. I still use Tretinoin about 2-3 times a week, but even Adapalene can’t seem to figure it out anymore. HELP.",

      "content": "Yo everyone, I’m making this post because 2026 is the year I finally stop hiding and get my life together.\nI’ve spent more than a decade being completely negligent with my skin. Years of constant sun exposure without a lick of sunscreen has turned my visible skin (face/arms) a deep, dark black. The contrast is crazy because my inner body is still naturally white. It’s a \"perma-tan\" that’s been baked in for ten years.\nI’m also dealing with oily skin and deep acne scars. To be honest, I’m way too introverted and under-confident to go see a dermatologist in person right now. I want to try and fix this myself at home first while I start my New Year's resolution of getting physically active.\nMy Planned \"Starter Pack\":\n * Glycolic Acid\n * Vitamin C Serum\n * Kojic Acid\n * Sunscreen &amp; Moisturizer\nCan you guys help a brown brother out with some guidance?\n * The Routine: How do I actually use these? I’m clueless about what goes first and what shouldn't be mixed.\n * The \"Decade\" Factor: Since this is 10+ years of neglect, how long should I realistically wait to see my natural skin tone start to peek through?\n * The Scars: Will these products help with deep scarring, or am I wasting my time without professional help?\n * The \"Gym\" Factor: Since I'm starting to work out, when should I do this routine? Before or after the gym?\nI’m tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. Any advice or encouragement would mean the world. Thanks, guys.",
