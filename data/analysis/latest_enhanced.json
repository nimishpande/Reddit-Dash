I wash my hair every other day with the following routine:\n\n1. Shampoo: Head and Shoulders\n2. Conditioner: A small amount of Maui Moisture's lightweight curls + flaxseed conditioner (only around 75% of the time, otherwise it starts to feel over-moisturized)\n3. Scrunch upside down with a towel and then air dry\n\nI'd like to start trying more products/a better routine, but it's been demoralizing to try that in the past and end up with mushy hair that's somehow even more frizzy and less curly than it is right now. I think it's also kind of a weird shape because I'm growing out a mullet, and the way my hair forms these spiral clumps when it gets long enough makes the cut look even more unbalanced. I want to love my hair - and I do, sometimes - but lately it just feels like it looks awful.\n\nI don't even know exactly what I'm looking for from this post. Maybe just insight or advice from other people who have dealt with similar issues? Or who have similar hair types? Thanks all &lt;3",

I never dry it with heat or diffuse it as it always makes my hair SUPER frizzy, also I have a terrible diffuser and dont have the money to invest in a better one​ \n\nolaplex bonding oil to break the gel cast once it's dry\n\nI've started sleeping w a silk bonnet and it always gives me super weird shapes and makes my hair look much shorter than it is?? like in the 3rd pic (yikes)\n\nidk what to do. if I don't use product, it's frizzy and undefined. if I use product, it's defined but super flat and still has halo frizz anyways\n\nI js need suggestions.

It is also a little dry in places and I get a lot of hairfall. Also my curls look really messy and unstructured after a couple of days.\n\nI just need some advice on what I can add to my routine to tackle these problems without using too many products. And also need help on identifying what's the root problem.\n\nI don't want to mess up things coz I'm satisfied with the volume, and the way my hair feels.. coz I recently tried a bonding spray which made me hair look terrible! I dont blow dry either coz I've tried many times even with cold air and it makes me look like a witch lol. So I just air dry now. I also dont brush my hair.. just use my hands.. I'm really not into using styling products either, it's too much stress and weighs my hair down and make it look greasy, just wanna nourish them from within.

Not necessarily great, not necessarily terrible, just always slightly above or below the middle line.\n\nThe title of this asks about the frizz but I'm also looking for some critiques and general advice. \n\nIs the pictured average day one as good as I can realistically ask for? \n\nIs it normal for curly hair to look pretty good from a few feet away but bad up close in the light?\n\nAre my routine's products (which I had lying around for months already, and did not find through any sort of research) too much together for my hair?\n\n  \n**ROUTINE:**\n\n\\- At night, wash hair with Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo (every two weeks substitute with QUAI Detox Shampoo), letting shampoo soak down my strands\n\n\\- Condition everything past my scalp with Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Conditioner via praying hands\n\n\\- Use wide tooth comb to gently detangle bottom to top, then squish my hair (feeble attempt at squish to condish)\n\n\\- Out of shower, keep hair wet with continuous spray bottle\n\n\\- Apply Love Ur Curls Step 3 and a liberal amount of LA Looks\n\n\\- Use Denman brush to gently brush some product through my hair, but otherwise praying hands it again and try and get it into big clumps myself\n\n\\- Scrunch hair and plop with a cotton t-shirt for 20-30 mins\n\n\\- Take it out, let it air dry into a gel cast\n\n\\- Tie up in pineapple and wear bonnet to sleep\n\n\\- No refreshing anymore, hair is left totally dry until next wash (felt like trying to refresh it always made it look greasy, stringy, and overall worse than it would if I just left it as is)\n\nI do this routine every 72 hours.\n\nAs it stands, my day one usually looks pretty good. Day two it's a coin toss between good again or barely average. Day three is almost always mediocre, though the routine, in my opinion, never gives me hair that is so bad I don't want to wear it down in public.\n\nAny critiques would be greatly appreciated.",

I think it looks decent in the mirror untill I take photos and realize how messy and disgusting one of the the sides are, and that it's overall really isemetrical. I also then look at it from different angles and I just think it looks nasty. I was wondering if anyone knows any hair styles that would go good or maybe even ways to style it? Even if you guys think it looks good I still don't think it suits me all that much and I'd wanna look into other styles. I don't really know what I want or how to figure out how to style and stuff, so that's why I'm asking. I know it might be a little farfetched but I don't like how flat and greasy some part of my hair look and was wondering if I could maybe cook something up that's a little curly like these photos from Pinterest. I was thinking maybe hair products like curl cream, texture powder, or maybe even a perm, but I just wanna know since I'm clueless. I'm really insecure about my hair so thanks a lot.",

I know I need it and I know losing some length will help my curls bounce up :) \n\nAfter spending all of 2025 trying this that and the other I am realizing that everything I have tried (curl creams, mousse, foam, leave -in, gel) weighs down my hair- even watered down versions of leave-in and gel in a spray bottle which was hardly any product. Did a clarifying shampoo the other day and removed all silicones and my hair feels light and bouncy like it used to. Now I know my hair doesn’t like silicones so much and everything I’ve tried has weighed it down so I’m back to where I started a year ago. Can anyone recommend silicone free styling products that are truly lightweight? The lightest of the light weight!! I’d love more definition of my waves/curls, but I do still need to detangle at night so I’m happy to refresh on day 2.\n\nHair type: low porosity, fine, low density, 2b/2c/3a waves and curls \n\nCurrent routine:\n\nOdele clarifying shampoo\n\nAussie waves shampoo (for second shampoo)\n\nMaui hibiscus conditioner (and combing through my hair wet in the shower)\n\nDrying with t shirt wrapped around my head (plopping has always made my curls weird somehow)\n\nAir dry with roots clipped up or diffusing on no heat low speed\n\nVery gentle detangle at night and morning (I must do this to avoid very stressful matting)\n\nJojoba oil on ends and lengths\n\nProtective style with satin bonnet\n\nAny advice is appreciated thank you thank you !!

Oh and sometimes I do forget to put sunscreen on, and working outside, and sitting in a cockpit facing the sun, I’m sure cannot be helping.\n\nLmk if I didn’t add enough details idrk a lot about any of this.\n\nEdit: my bad the picture is down below",

      "content": "For the last year or so I’ve been using the eco styling gel (argon oil one) with the the John freida mousse and the Aussie styling gel I’m pretty sure, but when I tell you I swear it’s doing nothing for my hair apart from making it slightly more wavy right. I have like 2b-2c hair and it’s almost to my waist but the inner bit (underneath like next to my neck) is always so frizzy and almost straight but the outside bits are really curly in comparison. I would really appreciate it if someone could possibly help me come up with a curly hair routine with some product recommendations and what I might be doing wrong.\n\nOh and also I have a hair drying with a diffuser end but I have no clue how to use it. And it’s like almost near my waist so I know it’s probably being weighed down but I would really not like to cut it off.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciate!!\n\nMy current routine is:  \n\\-Shower (elvive nourishing shampoo and conditioner) and I leave in conditioner for a while before detangling and washing out  \n\\-Use the John Freida mousse using prayer hands and then scrunch in after.  \n\\-Then I use the Eco style argon oil gel and scrunch it in (I don’t put my head upside down by the way. I don’t know if that help) and it just kind of stays curly for a few seconds like 30 seconds and then falls. I make sure my hairs wet whilst doing this.  \n\\-Then I use a cotton t-shirt to microplop and then I have to go to sleep so I put on a silk bonnet and hope for the best. I don’t have time to do it in the morning and stuff soooo…",

A week ago I re-started my birth control after being off it for 5 months (insurance issues). Before all this my skin was dry and riddled with eczema but it was clear of acne. I’m not sure exactly what caused it and I’m getting frustrated as it doesn’t seem to be going away. I’m going to try my best to outline my routine below:\n\nMornings:\n\n\\- Wash with cetaphil nourishing oil to foam cleanser OR prequel facial gleanser (only when feeling with outbreaks)\n\n\\- Moisturizing with cera ve moisturizing cream or prequel urea advanced relief moisturizing milk\n\nEvenings:\n\n\\- If I wore makeup I will use a damp makeup eraser towel\n\n\\- Wash with cetaphil sa cleanser\n\n\\- Same morning moisturizers\n\nIt’s important to note that I have very, very delicate\\* \\*skin. I did accutane in 2019, the results were great and I never had a “major” breakout until now.

The clear acne patches easily fall off and I tend to still pick them because I can feel the bump. The only solution I have found to prevent me from picking/popping pimples are bandaids. I cannot feel the bump on bandaids so I do not pick them when I use a bandaid.\n\nBandaids look like something happened to me and makes people question. I don't like being asked this nor do I want people do worry about me for no reason. I also read bandaids aren't really recommended for long term use for acne. As it can make scarring worse.\n\nI am wondering if there is any particular brand that \\\\\\*feel\\\\\\* like a rough bandaid. Where it is not clear or thin where I can see/feel it either.

My main questions are what is a good routine for my hair (in general and to prevent frizz) and how do I maintain it after shampoo days. \n\nFirst 2 pics were taken second day after shampoo. If anything, this is the least frizzy my hair gets. 3rd pic is an average day of frizz. My current hair stats are 2b/2c hair on top and 2c hair on the back (at least I think). Low Porosity all around. Thick to Medium Hair.  I have a satin pillowcase. shower at night. Use a widetooth comb. I like to air dry. Haven't had a hair cut since May 2025 which was a buzz. \n\nCurrent Wash routine (every 3 days):  \n\\-Necessaire Shampoo Hyaluronic Acid. I double shampoo.  \n\\-herbal essence argan oil conditioner  \n\\-Sheamoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Conditioner Treatment (Only use it on wash days. Don't really know what it does or if its even necessary)  \n\\- (Once a week) loreal bond repair pre shampoo. Been using it for a month but don't really know if its working.  \n\n\nIn between Washes:  \nIn the morning to detangle and style I only use Pantene 10 in 1 Miracle Rescue.  \nI don't do anything else. I dont even wet my hair till next wash. \n\nLike I said, I genuinely don't know what I'm doing but I'm here to learn. Some people have told me to get a curl gel and mousse combo as well as a hair oil but I wanted to consult this sub before making any purchases. And I'd like some tips on how to maintain my hair between washes. Thanks",
