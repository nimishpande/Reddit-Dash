If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

He prescribed me the following treatment (he only asked whether I go outside or not, and I told him that I don’t. He didn’t mention applying sunscreen) :\n\n1. Benzoyl peroxide gel – He told me to apply it daily in the morning on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer.\n(He didn’t suggest any moisturizer; I’m using the Minimalist Vitamin B5 moisturizer)\n\n2. Tretinoin gel 0.025% – He told me to apply this in the evening around 6–7 pm on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer.\n\n3. Vitamin C serum – He told me to apply this at night after washing my face (he didn’t mention applying a moisturizer after it)\n\n4. He also gave me tablets, which I have to take once daily for 30 days\n\nToday is my second day of following this routine, and my skin feels itchy, looks reddish and I’m noticing more acne/bumps.\n\nIs this normal?

Unlike the cleanser which I got from an actual store the moisturiser I ordered from Amazon and it was non-refundable so I've been using it for a month or two now. However, I've checked the ingredient list thoroughly and obviously although it doesn't have high concentration of good ingredients the normal Cosrx moisturiser would have, the ingredients aren't bad which is why I've just stuck with it and my skin has just stayed the same too\n\n**Concerns**\n\n* There are 2 areas where I get acne commonly which is my forehead and also that side of the cheek area you can see in the pics - **what do I do for that (I've just started with the adapalene+benzoyl peroxide gel)**\n* I also have alot of dark spots on my cheek sides from all those small comedones (might not be able to see in the pics) - **should I get a Vitamin C serum or a Niacinamide serum I gotta get one of those only.**\n* I also have a deep smile line on the right side of my cheek. I sleep on the left side so no idea how that's so deep other than because maybe when I smile, I smile to that side. **That cheek is sagging a bit (1st pic) - what do I do to firm the skin there?**",

Both of these products i just rake through my hair with my fingers. At the end of the day I will do wash everything out and pat dry once again before going to bed.

Sometimes I’ll add the Miss Jessie’s no shrink gel or amika curl corps gel along with a cut crème. I never use more than 2 products at once. Rarely diffuse to avoid extra heat. \n",

At first it wasn’t too bad, so I thought it was nothing, but later it became more and more itchy, and that’s when I realised the salicylic acid caused it. After that, the rash spread to my neck.\n\nI’ve honestly broken down over this. Even the medication prescribed by the doctor hasn’t helped. When I touch the itchy areas, I can feel rough bumps, and it’s extremely itchy. I really don’t know what to do anymore. I feel disgusted with myself and deeply distressed.

I scrunch in some John Frieda curling cream, jelly, and mousse.\n4. I comb it a bit with my fingers and slick the top back as tight as I can, since I want that part less wavy and with a little more lift when I push it forward.\n5. I let it air dry.\n\nI dont hate this right now, tho I really need a diffuser for my hair dryer since the waiting is soo painful. What I'm struggling with is the in-between days. Ive tried everything, but no matter what I do it turns out frizzy or greasy. I can't style it without getting it wet and I cant get it wet without it getting greasy. I'm thinking I rinse with conditioner only in my off days and styling again with the John Frieda stuff? ",

      "content": "Need skincare help!\n\nI’m looking for some help with figuring out what is wrong with my skin and what to do about it. As someone with a facial structure that I don’t love on the best of days, having red skin and breakouts on top of that leads to my self confidence being at an all time low. \n\nMy skin on my face is kind of just red all over, and the worst places for me are the areas around my mouth where if you look closely there seem to be a ton of tiny little bumps. The pores on my cheeks are huge and I occasionally just wake up with one of those deep swollen pimples brewing in a random location that acne patches do nothing for. My forehead is usually the most problem free area but of course today it is broken out as well. \n\nI drink nothing but water and the occasional coffee, my diet isn’t perfect but it’s pretty healthy overall and I’m vegetarian so I eat a lot of whole foods. I don’t touch my face during the day and sleep on silk pillow cases which I wash often. \n\nProducts I have and have used in different combinations:\n\n\\\\- Cerave foaming cleanser for normal to oily skin: I’ve been washing my face with this in the mornings daily for probably 2 years and it only seems to dry out my skin if anything \n\n\\\\- Cerave SA cleanser: I bought this recently and have been using it at night because Chat GPT told me to but haven’t seen any improvement \n\n\\\\- The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%: on days when I don’t use the retinol, I cleanse and then wipe the toner over my face with a cotton pad and then wait for it to dry and then apply the niacinamide. \n\n\\\\- The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner: paired with above\n\n\\\\- Cerave moisturizing cream: this is the only moisturizer I’ve ever used that prevents my skin from being visibly dry and flaky so I use it every night and have been for years\n\n\\\\-Cerave resurfacing retinol serum: I use this a few times a week after cleansing and then apply the moisturizer, on days where I don’t use the ordinary products\n\n\\\\- Hero acne stickers: these work well for pimples that have actually come to a head but never helps with the deep ones \n\n\\\\- Head and Shoulders Dry Scalp Care shampoo: I’ve even tried washing my face with this recently because I’ve seen some people on here saying some stubborn acne can be fungal but haven’t seen any change with that either \n\nI just feel like I’ve tried so many different angles and have been making no progress. Admittedly I haven’t solidified one single routine and stuck with it for months at a time, but it’s also because I feel totally lost and worried I may be doing the wrong things. \n\nI’m 28F and live in Canada, seeing a dermatologist isn’t in the cards for me rn for several reasons, so I’m just hoping anyone who may have similar skin to mine can even point me in the right direction? I’m so green when it comes to skincare and beauty in general but I’m so tired of feeling so down about myself. Literally any and all suggestions welcome. ",

My skin is dry and crepey, but when I put my moisturizer on it (either DAMDAM Mochi, Shiseido RNA cream, or even whipped tallow), my neck absorbs it but I break out… so then it’s covered in small red acne’s. And I don’t like how sticky my neck feels with the moisturizers… On top of that, my horizontal tech neck lines have become more prominent and visible (even in dark photos!!) and I really want to deal with it and I don’t know how since my neck breaks out when I put cream on it. Any tips??",
