Apply GENEROUS amounts of curling cream after every wash when still wet. Style by sectioning into small strands and detangle each separately by pulling between fingers until it runs smooth. Takes about 20 minutes. Air dry and never diffuse. Scrunch once dry.  \n\n\nMaintenance: Sleep with a bonnet. Loosely tie with a silk or fuzzy crunchy under the bonnet. Retie or style in the morning as needed with wetted hands. Trim ends every four months to keep curls healthy, hair doesn’t curl as nicely with damaged ends.  \n\n\nProducts: OGX argan oil of morocco shampoo and conditioner. Marc Anthony coconut and shea curling cream.  \n\n\nPictures taken at end of each day",

She told me she told her teacher and her teacher said, “Tell your mom to brush your hair.”\n\nI’m devastated we are the reason this happened . I worked last night (yay night shift) so my husband and mom got her ready for school. However, we all struggle with her hair. \n\nShe has long curly hair. When wet, it’s to her waist. Dry, probably mid back. We are okay with her having it long because she lets us brush and style it. We just suck at it.\n\nThe sections around her forehead are very short and frizzy regardless of what we try. \n\nRight now this is what we do. Bath twice a week using shea moisture shampoo and conditioner. When she gets out we put in leave in shea moisture leave in conditioner and brush out with a fine tooth comb due to knots. She’s a crazy sleeper. Let air dry. We try to keep in a basis at night when she sleeps.\n\nWhen I style her hair I usually just run my fingers through her hair or I’ll take a large brush and a spray bottle and completely wet her hair. My go-to hair styles are down, high pony, half up.\n\nMy husband and mom dry brush her hair (which I ask them not to do). Their go-to hair styles are singular braids.\n\nHere are pics.\n\nI just need advice. Products. Routine. Styling. My daughter is a girly girl who likes taking her time to look nice and we are failing her.\n\nThe front facing pic is from today when she got made fun of. The apple dress picture is air dried. The red dress is slept on hair no braid.\n\nI’m sorry for yapping so much. Thank you in advance for any advice. It is so, so, so appreciated.\n\nFrom,\n\nA mom with straight hair who has been crying all afternoon",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I tried the plopping in the morning after wetting it and applying Cantù curl cream. 1st picture is right after we got done plopping. Second is later in the day. So far I think it came out pretty good but still a touch frizzy. \n\nUsed Belliso shampoo/conditioner the night before. \n\nNew AM routine - Wet the hair, Used Cantù curl cream and Rihanna’s spray, hair was plopped then air dried. \n\nQuestions- \n\n1 - is there a different type of product I show apply in the am? If so, which would you recommend?\n\n2 - how do I reduce some of the frizz? Should I spray it with frizz ease?",

I have a few pictures to share for short, medium, and long to compare.\n\nFor years I have used something similar to the standard \"curly girl\" method (unless that has changed and I am not aware) so once a week I clarify with VO5 shampoo, otherwise I wash every 2 to 4 days with Shea moisture shampoo and conditioner, and once a week I started using some random L'Oreal hair mask but I think it might have silicones in it, not entirely sure. Then I put a handful of LA looks extreme sport gel (I haven't been putting that much lately, just enough to fill the center of my palm and I'm not sure its enough) and scrunch in the shower after detangling. Then I plop in a microfiber twist turban for maybe like 10 minutes and then I just let it down to air dry and blow dry my bangs. These are pictures throughout the last few years so I only have bangs in the long hair one.\n\nMy current hair is curlier towards the scalp for only some strands, other strands are pretty straight, some are curlier, and then some are straight in the scalp area and wavy as it goes down. It takes about 10 seconds for my hair to be fully saturated in the shower, and I would say its only about medium thickness.\n\nWhat should I do to get my hair more defined? TIA!!!",

This is definitely the longest I’ve ever had it, and I’m keen to keep growing it out but needing some advice on maintenance, if I should go for a trim to help it grow out better or just stick it out longer then go for a cut.\n\nMy hair is thick, and pretty curly, and although it’s long now it tends to “fro” out. I shower daily because I work in healthcare but condition only and shampoo maybe once or twice a week.\n\nThen I apply a leave in condition and some sea salt spray and comb it back and either lock it in place with a hat or hair band while it dries. Somedays if I’m going out, once it dries I apply some hair wax to keep it formed up more but the volume of hair is hard to keep down lol. I hate the feel of gel and stuff that makes your hair hard so that’s why opt for wax.\n\nDo yall think if I keep growing it out length wise, eventually the length and weight will keep it down more and prevent the “fro”ing out ?\n\nAlso to mention, when I did it keep it shorter, it was always shorter on the sides and back with length up top. Which obviously is affecting the way it’s been growing out. Normally rock it wit a middle party, but thinking about just tryna pull it back like in last pic.\n\nThanks any advice appreciated.\n\nRoutine is Dr Squatch Conditioner\n\nShampoo : Dr squatch and sometimes head and shoulders only shampoo 1-2 a week\n\nOdele Leave in Conditioner\n\nSuavecito Sea Salt Spray when going out and sometimes Suavecito Matte Pomade",

      "content": "SITUATION:  I might be going on vacation to Costa Rica in January. The weather will be 70-85/90 degrees F. I’m not sure what the exact climate is but I assume hot and humid.  I’m afraid it might activate my hyperpigmentation on my face, as I’ve experienced bad hyperpigmentation the past few years whenever I go to places or do activities in the sun that causes me to sweat. Has anyone ever been to Costa Rica and could give insight to the weather there as it relates to skincare?\n\nBACKGROUND:  Ever since I turned 30, idk what’s going on with my skin, but I started developing dark spots and moles so easily on my face and forehead especially if I’m sweating and exposed to sunlight and that’s WITH sunscreen.\n\nIt started when I was in Italy 2 years ago and got trapped in Italian heat without sunscreen for some time. Italian heat is unbearably scorching DRY and hot as hell. I had never experienced anything like that. I’m from the South of USA and I’m used to humid heat…not dry heat.  I developed patches of darkness under my eye and on my cheekbone.\n\nI partially repaired that bit of hyperpigmentation when I got back from Italy. This summer, however, I went to the beach in San Diego where the weather was 74-75, breezy, and soooooo nice.\n\nI put on sunscreen everyday. One day I went on a bike ride thinking I’ll be okay since it’s not hot.  But I overlooked the part where I had to pedal UPHILL in some areas, where I struggled and overexerted and in turn sweat all over my face.\n\nSure enough….that same day….dark patches came back on both side of my face and even another mole started popping up on the left side. \n\nI freaked out…flew home 2 days later and got started on a MUSELY prescription.\n\nMy face has since then cleared up so nicely these past 8 weeks since I’ve been on MUSELY.\n\nBut now this trip to Costa Rica is in discussion and I want to go SOOOOO bad because I’ve never been to the jungles before, but I’m afraid this will be a trip I’ll also regret if it’s one where I’ll be sweating the whole time.  😭\n\nQUESTION: Has anyone been to CR and can give advice and insight?  And also WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME? It’s not normal. Or IS it normal????",

Flash forward to a week ago, when my family and I, during my school's fall break, traveled to Romania, and even though the trip was really fun, my acne totally flared up. I was getting around three new whiteheads every day and getting cystic pimples on my cheeks. I have no idea why. It looks so much worse than at the beginning of the trip. I was doing my skincare routine the same, while I was there, and also applying sunscreen (The La-Roche-Posay one). I live in a very hot and humid place, so traveling to a cold place where it literally snows could impact my acne?? I honestly have no idea, so that's why im coming here. Has anyone else's skin broken out or flared up while on vacation? Why is that? When traveling in the future, is there any ways to avoid this? Its like I took 2 steps forward and now 50 steps back, I feel so hopeless. Any advice is appreciated. ",
