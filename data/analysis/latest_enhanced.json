      "content": "\nWhen I first became aware of all the ‚Äúdrugstore is bad‚Äù and ‚Äúsulfates and silicones ruin your hair‚Äù stuff, it was around 2016. I was 15, and honestly all the info being thrown around online back then confused me sooo much. From like 15‚Äì19, I was using natural or sulfate/silicone-free hair products because I thought that‚Äôs what I was supposed to do. My hair was always dry, frizzy, tangled, it was a mess. I figured ‚Äúwell, i guess this is just how my hair is.‚Äù Then around 2022, thanks to abbey yung and labmuffinbeautyscience I started actually learning more about hair science, ingredient functions, and how insanely misunderstood sulfates and silicones are. Now I‚Äôm 24, and after a ton of trial and error, I‚Äôve finally found what works best for my hair and it‚Äôs all drugstore stuff with silicones and sulfates. i use products from a few different brands (Garnier, Dove, Pantene,H&amp;S) and all the hair issues I struggled with for years are completely gone!! \n\nAll of this just makes me so mad because there was SO much fear mongering and misinformation floating around for years. Idk it makes me sad and mad thinking about younger me being so lost and confused when it came to my hair and what to use‚Ä¶ meanwhile all the products were right there the whole time but i avoided them like the plague üò≠!!! Tbh the fact that most of it is exaggerated, taken out of context, or totally depends on your hair type and routine‚Ä¶ is crazy to me. Anyone else have this same experience?! ",

Blood tests show no significant testosterone difference between hairy and bald men.\n* **Prolactin and Cortisol Drive Hair Loss**: He points to elevated prolactin (the ‚Äúmolting hormone‚Äù in animals) and cortisol (stress hormone) as key players in hair shedding, affecting both men and women.\n* **Testosterone Helps Hair Growth**: Contrary to popular belief, Peat says testosterone promotes thicker, faster-growing hair.\n* **Thyroid and Metabolism Matter**: Low thyroid function and poor energy production shift the body toward cortisol over hair-friendly hormones like progesterone and DHEA, worsening hair loss.\n* **Stress Links to Other Issues**: Peat connects baldness to heart disease and earlobe creases, suggesting stress hormones like prolactin and cortisol are the common thread.",

I've been making attempts to figure out what to do with my hair to get it more uniform, wavier/curlier, less frizzy etc. for years but I just can't seem to find something that actually works, it's very unpredictable whether something will look good or look like a mess. I used to have ringlet curls when I was a teenager, then got on birth control for 11 years which straightened my hair out, and got off of it 2 years ago, so I'm noticing some changes and i'm not sure how to handle it yet!\n\nThe picture is of my hair air dried with no product just shampoo and conditioner. I cowash my hair like, once a week, sometimes I put a hair oil with protein on it overnight before washing with a clarifying shampoo, but regardless it takes a pretty long time for it to get oily, and my friends have suggested i have low-ish porosity hair. \n\nI've tried the Aussie gel but the stickiness bothered me, I have liked miss Jessie's pillow soft curl cream and function of beauty mousse (have used these separately but not together) although they're still not getting me exactly where i want to be. \n\nI just was wondering if anyone out there's before pictures looked at all like mine? üòÖ What worked for you?\n\nCurrent routine:\nWash 1x per week with As I Am cowash, clarifying shampoo every 4-5 washes. V&amp;Co wavy hair conditioner. Scrunch in mousse and plop in a microfiber towel for a little while then let it air dry the rest of the way. Then I usually end up putting it in a ponytail anyway because it looks messy and frizzy üò≠",

I think my skin might be combination skin since it's pretty normal on the sides, but my nose gets oily and maybe my forehead too? I don't really mind having a bit of blackheads and what not, but i just wanted to see if there's anything i could do to improve my skin. :)) Maybe i started off with too many products? I want something simple to start off, but i'm looking for suggestions that won't dry out my skin, but also something to help with my acne, which i think might be hormonal. I'm thinking to start off with a simple routine of cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen and slowly add some acids as i've heard that is the smartest thing to do - what do you guys recommend/think?\n\nSorry for the really messy post ü•π",

      "content": "Hello! I have oily, combination, acne-prone skin. I notice that I've had constant problems with acne appearing around my hairline, specifically the sides of my forehead. I have barcode bangs and apply dry shampoo to my bangs almost everyday. Just to clarify, I have the type of hair that just greases up (especially around my bangs) in the morning even though I washed it the night before.\n\n  \nI've tried applying dry shampoo first and then washing my face and doing my morning skincare afterwards, but it hasn't been working since my bangs still end up touching my forehead throughout the day. The only kind of makeup I wear daily is Erborian CC Red Correct cream to cover redness around my nose and chin.\n\nOne thing that has been helping me manage the acne is applying a thick dot of diaper rash cream on the acne at night as a spot treatment of some kind. I'm not too sure how 40% zinc oxide helps alleviate acne, but it works for me!\n\nAny advise or product recommendation would be great. Below is my current routine:\n\nAM:\n\n1. Only water, no cleanser\n\n2. Mixing Beauty of Joseon Light On Serum: Centella + Vit C cream with CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 50\n\n3. COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence\n\n\n\nPM:\n\n1. Double cleanse with Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Cleansing Oil + CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser\n\n2. Clearasil Rapid Rescue Deep Treatment Pads\n\n3. Some kind of serum mixed with CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion. Sometimes it's Skintific Retinol Skin Renewal Serum, or The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + Hyaluronic Acid, or none.\n\n4. COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence\n\n5. Equate Diaper Rash Ointment with 40% Zinc Oxide as spot treatment on any active acne.\n\n  \nAnd yes, I always mix my moisturizer with serums or other creams on my hands before I apply them to my face. I don't know if that's an okay way to do it but my skin has been loving it.\n\n",

Tested different gels and moisturisers from local pharmacy. I‚Äôve tried them all. All of the cleaning all of the moisturisers. Always the same story ‚Äúoh this one is different because‚Äù. It‚Äôs not different. Never made any difference.\n\n2.\t‚Å†Got tired of the normal stuff. Called my doctor, which prescribed me with benzoylperoxide. ‚ÄúThis one will be different because‚Ä¶‚Äù. Didn‚Äôt make a single difference than that I got very dry around my mouth.\n\n3.\t‚Å†I stopped the medication on benzoylperoxide, as it didn‚Äôt give any results. Summer came around, and it got gradually better. Sunshine made it better.\n\n4.\t‚Å†Got back home from vacation and the acne came back in 2 days. Now I thought, okay the medication didn‚Äôt work, so let‚Äôs try myself. I did the craziest diet ever to human existence. No carbs, no sugar, no dairy. I ate meat and vegetables for a while.\n\n5.\t‚Å†No results from the diet. Called up my doctor again and he gave me prescription for Acnatac ‚Äútretinoin and antibiotics‚Äù in gel format. Told me to do it for 12 weeks but results after 2. Nothing. It got worse. After 7 weeks he told me to stop the medication.\n\n6.\t‚Å†Going on vacation now which will clear it up for a couple of days, but back just like that when I come back. Now my doctor prescribed me with Differin 1mg/g, just a little bit different than Acnatac. But I don‚Äôt know if I even should try that one based on my experience.\n\nIt‚Äôs always the same story ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs purging‚Äù, ‚Äúoh this one‚Äù.\n\nI do not take pills based on my own principle. What should I do? Look at my pictures and see if you have any tips. My acne is the type where I have deep acne in my cheeks. I get pimples every day new ones, both red and white. My face gets red as well. Also, sometimes my pimples get almost black like dark red, very weird.\n\nI need some good help now. The picture is from a week ago, it‚Äôs actually gradually worse now.\n",

The first time I styled my curly bangs I wanted it to be curly but FLAT and I used to curl every lock of hair trying to separate it from all the rest of the hair and so I did for two years. The curls werent always perfect, actually just a few times and than, the last year I stopped styling it. It was pretty good cuz it didnt look forced, but natural (not perfect curls but the good messy one). This year I wanted to stop having bangs but I have this two HUGE problems: 1 It dosent grow  2 my front lock of hair still separate for the rest of the hair wich means this lack of hair are in front of my face lol. I dont even get volume anymore... I used to have a middle line, wich I dont  really have anymore.\n\nMy routine is: two shampoo (Near and Sunsilk), one conditioner (Sunsilk), wash away the conditioner and brush my hair. Get out of the bath, separate my hair in two section (top section starting from my hairbrows and the bottom section is all the rest of my hair), brush the bottom section with a detangling hair brush and still wet I style the top sectionating it horizontaly with the same hair brush. After all of this I only use Schwarzkopf's curly mousse for lift and anti-flat system (not much and not on the route of my hair) and then I use a diffuser changing often my head pose.\n\nMy goal is to have volume, no bangs and NO lines.

I don't have an income so I get what I can. I only air dry, I don't have a diffuser. just a dryer with no attachments. if I gel I will put it up in a cheap bonnet for 10-15 so I'm not dripping water everywhere. I used to cowash but I can't anymore, my hair is way too greasy!\n\nmy hair is very greasy and when I gel, it's a grease bomb the next day. sometimes when I gel, it either looks nice or doesn't do much. I also seem to completely miss the back of my hair when I make extra sure I get gel back there... I wonder if I'm doing it wrong or if my bonnet is absorbing it? \n\nI also have autism and the feel of gel in my hair makes my skin crawl. so I don't usually gel. \n\nis there anything I can try doing different? my budget is insanely tight so I can't spend more than $15-$20 on products. \n\nthanks in advance.",
