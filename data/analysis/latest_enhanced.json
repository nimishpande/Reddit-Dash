      "content": "Straightening my hair and coloring it all the time was killing it. Switched to curly routine, spent 100's of dollars on products and tools, months of trial and error, still haven't figured it out. Takes hours every week plus dye every few weeks.\n\nFeet calluses for years. Bought so many versions of amope, callous remover products, creams, urea, you name it. Been at it for months. Out of sheer frustration, I now have bloody craters from overfiling and I'm limping around like an idiot. It's SO painful and didn't eradicate them.\n\nI don't do faux lashes or tans or anything \"extra\" - the only thing I did was get nail extensions for a couple of years. SO much money, and hours wasted at salons. Gave them up and nails have been absolute wreck for 6 months though l've been nurturing them with jojoba all day every day.\n\nConstant tweezing. Never ends and never looks clean. Waxed the eyebrows and peeled off half my lids. Did whitestrips and teeth are brutally sensitive.\n\nI don't even do skin care and luckily I am lasered. Hair removal was a whole other ordeal. Don't even get me started on weight loss/maintenance - that's a whole other post.\n\nI don't think I'm trying to do too much! I just do v want to feel like an ogre. How do women look so good from head to toe? I just want to break down and cry.\n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

About a month ago, I started going to the gym regularly, and ever since then, I’ve noticed my hair shedding more and getting thinner.\n\nAt first, I didn’t have any hair routine because I thought it was just a phase, but my hair kept getting thinner and I started seeing more of my scalp. Around the third week, I decided to start caring for it properly.\n\nHere’s what I’ve been doing lately:\nHair type: 3A curls, medium density (used to be thicker), normal-to-dry scalp, and low to medium porosity.\nRoutine:\n- Wash twice a week with a sulfate-free shampoo.\n- After the gym, I usually co-wash instead of shampooing.\n- I apply a leave-in conditioner after washing or co-washing.\n- The next morning, I use about 2 drops of argan oil on my ends to add moisture.\n- I avoid heat, don’t even tie my hair, and I try to be gentle when detangling.\n\nHowever, every time I wash or detangle, I still lose around 10–40 strands, and my hair feels noticeably thinner — I can actually see some scalp in certain areas now. It’s been making me really anxious because it feels like it’s not stopping.\n\nI’m wondering if this could be caused by:\n- Sweat and buildup from working out\n- Stress from gym or lifestyle changes\n- Nutrient changes or dehydration\n- Or maybe something I’m doing wrong with my routine\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this shedding or thinning after starting to work out? How did you handle it, and what helped you get your curls and density back?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would mean a lot.",

I’m happy to have less acne but it makes my skin look kinda dull. It is not red and doesn’t hurt: I don’t think it’s super irritated it just seems dehydrated. \n\nI use the la roche triple repair lotion which I like and in the mornings I spray the la roche mineral water, let it dry down, spray a rose water and let it dry down, and then use the anua 70 hydrating toner and follow with lotion and sunscreen. The problem is it still doesn’t seem like my skin is getting very hydrated despite this layering.\n\nWhat do y’all use or recommend for deep hydration? Can I top it off with some rose hip oil or egyptian magic or will that just make my acne bad again? Thanks for any help! :)",

My hair is just at slightly past my shoulders. i keep a wide tooth comb in the shower and run it through my hair roots to ends after the conditioner is applied and let that sit while I wash my body and shave my legs then rinse out the conditioner.  And after shower i use seen ff leave in conditioner to help with dry ends and frizz, i usually apply root to ends and run the wide tooth comb through roots to ends then scrunch my hair to help curls,but thinking im doing it wrong also bc while i have curls its so frizzy then next morning top of my head and roots are  so oily so i have to wash daily.

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

She was confused why I wanted it short and I explained my curls don't puff up right if my hair is too long. She had me facing away from the mirror until she was nearly done. I couldn't tell anything was wrong due to my hair having been pulled straight from me letting it grown too long until I slept on it and tried to puff my hair up this morning. She cut it way past what I showed and now my hair is all over the place with one side being jagged and one side being nearly completely flat.\n\nI don't know if I just play the waiting game if it will fix itself my hair is wrong. She didn't layer it correctly, she didn't blend my bangs, and cut several inches past where I showed.\n\nI have a new product I was going to use and I don't even know if there's a point anymore you can't see the curls my hair looks like a bunch of cowlicks.\n\nI've never had my hair cut this badly.

      "content": "Hello Curly Hair Community!\n\nI was today years old when I found out Reddit has a curly hair subreddit! I’m so excited to see lots of engagement and posts here and decided to share my hair story. \n\nApologies in advance as this post may get long…\n\nSo, rewind back to my childhood. I was born with and maintained 3a curls. Of course when I was a toddler and young child, my hair held that curl naturally. And with more age and time, I needed to start adding products to my routine.\n\nIn high school, I used products my mom bought me/we were able to afford. It was mainly Aussie or Herbal Essence mousses. They worked just fine and my hair was happy (and a bit frizzy) from what I can remember.\n\nFast forward a bit to when I was around 20/21 years of age. One day (using my usual mousse), I remember taking shower and doing my hair before work. Everything was fine, except my scalp just felt odd. Was it burning or itching? Maybe. But I was young and didn’t think much of it since it wasn’t that bad. Boy was I wrong. By the time I had done my hair and went to work (about an hour), my scalp was so red and had a crap ton of flakes appear out of nowhere. I was shocked and honesty traumatized.\n\nI instantly stopped using ANY products on my hair. I changed my entire routine. I went to a safe and basic shampoo (think hypoallergenic and gentle washes) and never followed up with styling products. In those times, I did start to use heat more from time to time (just so I would feel somewhat pretty on days I felt motivated to). \n\nThen at about 25 years old, I finally felt comfortable enough to explore SOME products again. There were some products that made my scalp unhappy and some that worked just fine… but nothing was helping my curls. \n\nBy this time already, I completely lost my beautiful curl pattern in my hair. Even now, I can’t get an even result unless I braid my hair (braiding my hair gives me that braid 2b/c wave). If I let it air dry WITH product, it falls to a 2a wave at best. If I let it air dry WITHOUT product, it’s varied everywhere. The pieces range from 2a to 2c. The only small glimpses of my old curl pattern I get to see are when a piece of my hair falls out of the shower and it’s a lone strand (not all the pieces are like this btw).\n\nSo here I am 4 or 5 years later in the situation. I don’t know where to even start seeing as there is SO MUCH information on curly hair. One day you hear xyz products are fine and the next they aren’t. So now I turn to you all who I hope can help me on my journey back to beautiful, shiny curls once again while making sure I don’t fry my skin.\n\nCurrent Products:\n\n- Kristin Ess or Redken Shampoo and Conditioner \n- Redken Leave in Conditioner \n- Moroccan Oil Leave in Hair Serum\n\nIf you’ve read this far, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. My ears are open to any and all suggestions given my circumstances.\n\nThank You ♥️ ",

I recently moved for college to a very humid climate from a very dry climate where I was able to straighten my hair and keep it straight so I don’t really know what I’m doing lol. I also change shampoos often, but I’m currently using a Pantene one with no parabens or sulfates and I use a kerastase conditioner. I don’t have a set hair wash routine so I just wash my hair when I feel like it and sometimes use conditioner without shampoo. I use a not your mother’s curl mousse and gel and scrunch those into my hair. Before today I used to scrunch my hair before the gel was set but then that made my hair look wet even when it was dry( first picture). So this morning I showered and tried waiting until it was dry but it didn’t stay curly very well, I feel like my hair gets weighted down easily(last two pictures). In general I feel like my hair is curlier when it’s wet and dries less curly. My bangs and roots also don’t curl and the back section of my hair doesn’t either but I think that’s because it’s longer(I have layers). My hair also doesn’t stay curly throughout the day and rarely into the next day even when I wear a bonnet to sleep.  I used to use a diffuser but mine broke so now I just air dry it. Last thing lol is I’m pretty sure I have high porosity hair so it dries really quickly. Any advice on products or how to do my routine would be super helpful 🙏🙏, sorry this post is so long.",

My girlfriend is trans (MTF) and doesn’t really have a routine right now except for using Neutrogena Hydro Boost make up wipes at night when she wears make up. Which is great! But she wants to work on signs of aging, skin texture and tone, as well as maybe some acne/facial hair scarring.\n\nBesides a gentle cleanser and moisturizer, what else should I incorporate into her routine? She does laser her face 1-2 times a week so I didn’t want to suggest a retinoid before consulting the gurus. If she spaces it out right, could she use a retinoid? She’s 36 so it would be time for her to incorporate a retinoid into her routine if possible. Any other suggestions for serums or anything else we should try to incorporate either right away or eventually?\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

I can't pull it back into a ponytail. Sometimes I'm able to do a half pony, but then my shorter layers fall out and into my face. I've tried incorporating a headband but then it flattens the curls at the front. I've even tried just wrapping it all up into a headscarf but then by the time I'm done, I've sweated so much it looks like I just came out of the shower.\n\nAny accessories or styles that you've found worked for you?\n\nMy hair wash routine is 2-3 shampoos a week with conditioning about 1-2 times a week. I use a microfiber towel, curl cream and diffuser.\n\nThank you!",

I haven’t been a big skincare person at all but have been starting to have a somewhat consistent routine since last year, and by that I mean I picked out a cleanser and moisturizer that has good reviews. I recently discovered I may have oily dehydrated skin and have no idea how to go about this. Below are pictures of my skin, and I have noticed that my skin has been increasingly oily especially my nose, it’s filled with blackheads and gets super oily even after washing it. I currently use La Roche Posay Toleraine Hydrating Cleanser and following it with the Toleraine Face Moisturizer both for AM/PM. I am willing to splurge on good products that would help! I also am eczema prone and have sensitive skin, specifically near the lip area and on my eyelids so any gentle stuff would help appreciated, though I will definitely patch test everything! My main concerns are my pores on my nose , as well as my chin area! And my eye bags are quite noticeable as well and I have been trying to work on getting my sleep but any product recommendations would be appreciated! ",

Open to similar alternatives in the same category. I’m also attaching some photos to give a better idea of what my hair looks like on day 2.

I’ve tried the wavy method and I hate it, my hair gets greasy super fast and the effort it’s to much since I have long and thick hair and it weighs down fast. What I feel works the best is blow dry, using tons of products :)), wear a bonnet and my hair looks and feels amazing the next day. A bit wavy and shiny. The problem is as soon as I step outside the door, my hair looks horrible, dry, It get’s tangled and if I brush it it gets even frizzier. I can’t find a product to help me keep the moisture locked in. I can keep it locked more if I straighten it, but I don’t want to damage it more since I’m dying my roots once a month.I was thinking in buying the shark flexstyle, is it less damaging? Should I put my money on kerastase products? Someone recommended me liquid protein but which one?\n\nProducts I use currently:\n- Wella shampoo - ultimate smooth\n- Tigi anti friz serum\n- milkshake leave in\n- olaplex no 6\n- wella ultimate repair heat protectant\n- a wella oil\n- oil mask once a week\n\nIf someone knows a miracle treatment, please share. In Bali I couldn’t even put my fingers through my hair, I had to keep it braided for 10 days😩",

I don’t have a diffuser but maybe I need one.\n\nThe problem is, even when I plop it for a long time, it dries a mess. My hair gets poofy, bent and all over the place.
