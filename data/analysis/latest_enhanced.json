Do you have some advice for taking care of hair like this, to make it curly all the time (even fuzzy curly)? Or, why is his hair perfect 360 degree ribbon on the bottom and slight flat beach wave at the top? \n\nCurrent routine: \n\n1. Shampoo, conditioner and mask he uses are from so!flow Let’s twist a hair series, used as said on the packaging. \n\n2. Mousse and curl activator were Anwen - Pina Lokada, but he doesn’t use them anymore since they need a lot of work, used as said on the packaging. \n\n3. He uses simple hair dryer but we just bought a dryer with a diffuser online. \n\n4. No bonnets, special pillowcases etc., just a physiotherapy memory foam pillow with a cotton pillowcase. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "I used to work a government job and my male manager would not let me wear eye makeup because I “looked like I was going to a nightclub, not the office”\n\nI recently switched jobs. My new manager is a woman, and she is very well dressed and does a full beat daily. She often makes comments about how important it is to “represent the business” or be “the face of the business” &amp;etc.  \n\nSoooooo I would like to start wearing more makeup to work again— but I cannot figure out how to wear mascara anymore 😅\n\nI feel like whenever I put on mascara, my eyes look droopy? Idk if it’s maybe because my eyelashes are too weak, and so they drop down despite curling them? Or if this is just an issue with my eye shape? Or maybe I need to try different mascara applicators? or formulas? Or abandon the mascara altogether and do something else to lift the eye?\n\nSoo If anyone has any mascara tips for weak lashes, be it product recommendations or application step recommendations— PLEASE help me out 😭😭\n\nMascaras I have tried:\n\n•Volume de chanel (waterproof and normal)\n\n•Maybelline great lash waterproof (actually not that bad looking but I would like more drama/volume)\n\n•Maybelline lash sensation \n\n•Maybelline scandal eyes (formula too wet for me)\n\n•Wet n wild mega lash waterproof \n\n•Diorshow (not enough drama but a surprisingly good formula if anyone is curious hehe)\n\n\\*\\*I have attached pictures of my eyes with Volume De Chanel waterproof Black. I feel like my eyelashes become droopy despite curling before AND after application. I feel like it’s especially noticeable when my face is resting (pic2) ☹️\n\nAny advice welcome 🤗 ",

It seems my hair will curl but then it seems extra fluffy at the bottom and I would rather have more volume towards the front of my face and I top and how do I get the back of my head to curl more like the front?? Also - how in thr world do people get their hair to last longer than a day without loads of hairspray??? I resisted the urge and did NOT use hairspray today but the last two photo are now hair after only 8 hours and I was forced to pull up the front cause it was losing volume at the frontz\n\n\nMy routine: I use a suave shampoo and conditioner. This was a morning wash and I used the suave clarifying shampoo and basic suave conditioner. Then I put it up with a cotton tshirt for a few minutes. Then I put in tresemme extra strength (number 6) gel. I did it section by section and then brushed it with a wide tooth comb. I diffused it upside down, on the roots, moved the diffuser. I diffused it till about 80-90 dry and let the rest air dry and then I did SOTC with a bit of oil in my hands. The front looks decent, though usually by mid day I feel the back will be extra frizzy or fluffy and lose some curl- it def doesn’t stay for days like some people.\n\nSo my question is - how do I get more volume and/or face shaping to my hair and the back so it actually looks curly all around? Do I need layers? What kind of cut? Change my routine any??  How do I make my back not too boxy?",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I have naturally wavy hair, and no matter what I do, it always ends up feeling extremely dry. I do take care of it and use products consistently, but nothing seems to help long term. I also do get my waves but they feel dry after the next day. Fyi I’m only 16.\n\nI rarely use heat maybe five times this entire year and even when I blow dry or air dry, my hair still feels dry and rough. I know it’s not just bad technique. Lately, my hair has gotten noticeably drier, and I’m also worried because I feel like I’m losing more hair than usual.\n\nI’ve been trying to eat a balanced diet and take my vitamins, but I still don’t know how to fix the dryness or promote healthier hair growth. Dry hair definitely runs in my family, so I know genetics play a role, but my hair didn’t used to be this bad.\n\nThe only time my hair looked truly healthy and moisturized was right after I cut it last year. It looked great for a short time, and then suddenly it went back to being dry again almost overnight. Now it looks dry every single day no matter what.I lived in Pakistan for a year and the humidity and water I'm not sure what made my hair thick and amazing as you can see in the last two images!\n\nFor reference my hair has never been dyed, I’ve never done chemical treatments, I use a regular shampoo for wavy hair sometimes Ouai shampoo, and I use the Ouai leave in conditioner. I’ve tried deep masks and fine hair products, but they haven’t really helped.\n\nI just want healthy moisturized hair again and tips on how to grow it without losing so much. If anyone has advice routines or product recommendations especially for genetically dry wavy hair I would really appreciate it. Thank you! also the pictures are my hair before a year back in fact when I was living in Pakistan for a year.",

I want to clean them all out and recycle them but I wanted to know if there were any rewards based recycling programs I could give them to. I plan to start collecting my empty products every month to recycle those too!\n\nI know I should recycle them even without the incentive but I’m not going to lie, it would still be nice. I plan to recycle them anyway even if I don’t find anything.\n\nThis is what I have found so far (just so people don’t suggest things I already found)\n\n• Pact - has a lot of locations, accepts a wide range of stuff, and seems reputable, but no rewards. (I think I will recycle here if I can’t find anything else)\n\n• Terracycle - Originally wanted to recycle with them because they said you can earn points towards charity which I really liked (I would rather donate to charity than get the points myself) BUT I heard it’s really scammy and does a lot of greenwashing\n\n• Credo - gives you store points for any empties but I don’t shop at Credo so that would be useless lol\n\n• Lush - only accepts lush products for points/a free mask I think? But I don’t shop at Lush either lol\n\n• Literally any store that only accepts their own products for points or rewards. - I don’t buy enough of one single brand to justify it\n\n• Boots - This seems like the kind of program I am looking for. They accept a wide range of empties for points BUT they’re UK based. I also found similar companies in Australia but nothing like this in the US.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Like I said, I’m still recycling them regardless, I just want to see if there’s any nice programs out there first.",

And just general advice on skincare products I should use/ any changes I can make.\n\nMy skin is usually oily, I have what I think are closed comodones and a LOT of clogged pores, it’s usually not very visible bumps but when I squeeze my skin, gunk comes out. Have acne prone skin that’s not sensetive.\n\nThe products I use are in the pictures,\n\n\\-night time: cleanse with either centella or cerave, centella serum, differin every second day and bha by anua once a week, moisturize\n\n\\-morning: cleanse, serum, moisturizer, sunscreen\n\n\\-makeup removed with micellar water\n\nAfter 5 months my clogged skin hasn’t changed but I think I get less active pimples.",

Anyway, I took a long hot shower with my bangs down one day and they ended up like photo 1 so I played around to see if I had an underlying pattern I’ve been oblivious to my entire life. Turns out I do. I’m not sure exactly what it is though.  \n\nPhoto 3: my second curly attempt ever. Looking back I am seeing the progress now. (I also chopped 4 inches of those scraggly ends not long after this)\n\nPhoto 4: they start out even more coiled than this, but after several weeks of a curl routine, my clumps went from ribbon waves to full on spirals. \n\nPhoto 5 is how photo 4 ended up (today)\n\nRoutine: regular biotin shampoo/kristen ess chelating shampoo every 3-4 washes (I used it for the second time ever today). Follow with Verb Ghost or Briogio superfoods conditioner. I think I’m dropping the briogio, i believe it’s too heavy for my hair. \n\nScrunch with not your mother’s foam (I tried shae moistures mousse once and my clumps disintegrated). Plop/scrunch with tshirt or microfiber towel a bunch of times, gel and diffuse. Today I used not your mothers gel instead of my usual Flexi Jelly\n\nLooking at photos I’m seeing now that I’ve made way more progress than I thought. I discovered two weeks ago I’ve been washing my hair with hard water for TEN YEARS. Add in thick conditioners and all kinds of oils; my hair was functionally low porosity but I don’t think it truly is. I’m seeing more spirals since chelating. My hair was forming a handful of massive clumps but they’re starting to separate more now, I’m not sure if that’s good or bad.  \n\nMy hair is having hard time holding shape. It’s extremely finicky and so easy to mess up leaving it mostly flat.  I know the length is a factor, but are there things that I am maybe missing or could/should be doing differently? Will it just take time and consistency? Can I achieve more defined curls with this length? \n\nAny and all advice welcome! ",

My hair is not as volumous as I would like it to be, mainly on the top of my head, where it just gets squished.\n\n2. I would like it to be even softer, but it tends to become fizzier if I do. I can't seem to find styling that makes my hair soft and not fizzy.\n\n3. Night routine/days after. I normally just wash my hair again when I want it nice, but it's getting tedious. I know there are recommendations in the wiki, but if you have some specific tips for my hair, I would appreciate it :).\n\nI also tried a gel, but it made my hair “harder”.\nI don't do/know any techniques, other than the scrunching when applying the styling. \nSo, what are your reccommendations?

I haven’t washed my face consistently like ever. Whenever I do wash my face, no matter what product I use, I get normal white heads and black heads as well as weird huge pimples that don’t have a head. Like big lumps on my face that don’t have a head, and I usually take a (sterilized) sewing needle to the so they can develop a head. These acne lumps vary in size but usually end up the size of a dime. They don’t leave scars, maybe just some short term discoloration when they finally go away.\n\nAt this point I’m desperate for any tips to fix this, because my face is super oily if I don’t wash it, but when I do I get these lumps and acne. I’ve used various face soaps,  cetafil (can’t figure out how to spell that right), some peach one with mountains on it, plain cvs soaps, even just body soaps, the list goes on.
