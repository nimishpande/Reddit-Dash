I applied a generous amount of mayonnaise in my hair as a protein mask which felt not as illegal as it sounds. I have a history of using acv for my hair so it might just be me lol \n\nI’m trying to add roughness to my hair as it falls flat so easily so I gave the hairspray method a chance. I applied the spray on wet hair after scrunching and after diffusing. I feel no difference in softness but my hopes are up that my hair will be as curly in the next days.\n\nalso, last pic is from 3 months ago. no trims in between. I’m trying to grow out my hair to at least mid back but it’s taking forever 😭 am I growth blind or is there literally no difference?\n\nroutine:\n\nwash with ogx biotin&amp;collagen shampoo, mayonnaise mask for 20mins, onlycurls moisturising conditioner\n\na little conditioner as leave in, neqi heat protector, moroccanoil curl foam, taft 14 gel one after another applied by raking and scrunching it upside down in the shower\n\nplop for a few minutes, apply loreal hairspray, cup diffusing and hairspray when it’s dry\n\nleave it a few minutes until the hair is cold and clap out the scrunch (without my beloved balea plex oil which felt so wrong)",

But I feel like my hair is too fine and thin for the amount of layering that would require. \n\nWhen I search for haircuts for thin hair, its mostly just blunt bobs and pixies, which I definitely don't want because it would take away my styling options without being interesting enough to make up for it. At least at its current length, I can put it up in pigtails with some bows. \n\nDoes anyone have suggestions?",

      "content": "Hello lovely curly hair subreddit. Not sure if you remember me but I posted a month ago with the most nightmarish knot in my hair that I had ever experienced in my life! I was convinced I would have to cut my hair down to a bob or shorter. \n\nHowever, luckily I didn’t have to. Thanks to you angels! Your advice on how to comb my hair and multiple product suggestions saved my hair. The many comments saying it was going to take awhile to undo the mess stood true but it helped. Before I posted I felt hopeless because I had already put in a day of slowly combing and working through the knot. I did not understand how long, it would actually take. Everyone who advised me to be patience with the process, THANK YOU! \n\nHowever, the experience did not come without a cost. I had to cut/trim 4-5 inches of length from my hair and lost a TON of original volume I had prior to this disaster. But, I am so grateful with the outcome I did receive, and have learned my lesson. I will never go to bed without wrapping my hair again and no matter how busy I am I will find the time to detangle my hair weekly. I vow to never let something like this happen again. \n\nHere is a picture when my hair freshly detangled. It was a mess no product in it. I will be taking these next months to focus on regrowth to bring it back to how I like it but I am so so so grateful for the hair I still have left on my head!\n\nThank you so much for your advice again. This community is amazing!!!\n\nMy Detangling Routine:\n\nI detangled my hair dry misting with water and warm coconut oil. When I got it wet in the shower it seemed to get worse.\n\nI enlisted the help of my boyfriend to help. We got comfortable on the couch and watched movies while he slowly picked away at with. Starting and mainly using a fine tooth thin comb but also a wide tooth comb to loosen things up when needed.\n\nWe used almost an entire bottle of native conditioner (it’s just what we had on hand).\n\nAlso used coconut oil in a spray bottle which I would warm up by setting in hot water for a bit. Also used Cowboy Magic Horse Detangler &amp; Shine. And also used water in a spray bottle just to dampen hair slightly before adding product. We didn’t really depend on wetting the hair to detangle.\n\nThe process so super slow and also painful! My scalp was red afterwards even though he was very gentle. I took Tylenol throughout the process and it definitely helped but the pain was still  present. Make sure to take lots of breaks throughout the process!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

It worked really well, but I developed some gut issue (I also have a past of chronic yeast infection - so long term antibiotic is not ideal for me). \n\nThen I suddenly developed these small pimples on my forehead and temples. They are almost never white heads. Sometimes not even red but I can feel them under my skin. \n\nCould this be fungal? Or bacterial? Could this be hormonal ?\n\nWent back to GP and now I’m taking Akleaf (trifarotene) twice a week. I only started 2 weeks ago so no improvement yet. \n\nAlso should I consider going on accutane ? \n\nMy routine is \n\nAM rinse with water, skin2004 centella ampoule, the ordinary natural moisturizer, beauty of joseon sun screen. \n\nPM the ordinary squalene cleanser, centella ampoule OR akleaf, the ordinary natural moisturizer \n\nThank you for any help/suggestion !!",

      "content": "Recently got a volume layer cut with curtain bangs. My hair used to be hip length but now it’s down to mid back. Kinda feel sad but it was a much needed cut. I was getting tired of detangling and using heaps of hair products only for it to get greasy and frizzy on day 2. Plus, I have a slim face and the long hair made my face look even more narrow (it had its own vibe though).\n\nThe stylist did warn me that curtain bangs need to be styled to look good. But I got it anyway since my front hair pieces were wavy and I thought they would be enough for a low maintenance curtain bangs. \n\nTurns out I was wrong, now I just look like Salman Khan from Tere Naam. I have a big event coming up in March, any tips on how to 'train' my bangs to sort fall into place naturally without excessive heat or product usage?",

      "content": "Recently, I started to pay much more attention on taking care of my hair, since in a couple of months I'll go and donate most of it after like growing it out for 5 years, but till then, I want to know what I am doing wrong with my routine and what I could improve to make my hair look much better and make my 2C/3A (down to mid-back) hair shine, plus with less frizz! I asked on r/haircare, but I didn't get much of a response so I'm going to try in here too!\n\n# My hair routine: \n\n1. I go to shower myself\n\n2. After a bit, I wet my hair and put shampoo on it, mainly doing the scalp\n\n3. Then I rinse out the shampoo and I scrunch my hair so that I can apply hair conditioner\n\n4. After it being applied, I go bottom to top with my wide tooth comb to untangle my hair (I only brush the hair when showering)\n\n5. I wait 5-6 minutes for the conditioner to sit on the hair and then I rinse it out with colder water.\n\n6. Then with a t-shirt, I scrunch my hair so that it's damp and I apply leave-in conditioner (spray) on hair ends and mids.\n\n7. Lastly, 30 minutes after leaving my hair to dry (air-dry method), I go and put some argan oil of morocco and some time later go to sleep, currently with cotton pillowcases (haven't tried it, but will probably replace pillowcases to satin ones)\n\n# Products/Ingredients:\n\n1. Shampoo - Bulgarian drugstore brand, which I use every other day on my scalp mainly, with ingredients like: \n\n* AQUA \n* SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE\n* COCAMIDOPROPIL BETAINE\n* ACRYLATES COPOLYMER\n* PARFUM\n* HEXYL CINNAMAL\n* LINALOOL\n* GERANIOL\n* CITRONELLOL\n* SODIUM CHLORIDE\n* PIROCTONE OLAMINE\n* C12-13 ALKYL LACTATE\n* PANTHENOL\n* LACTIC ACID\n* POLYQUATERNIUM-7\n* PEG-7 GLYCERYL COCOATE\n* PEG-12 DIMETHICONE\n* MELALEUCA ALTERNIFOLIA LEAF OIL\n* CITRIC ACID\n* SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n* TETRASODIUM GLUTAMATE DIACETATE\n* BENZYL ALCOHOL\n* METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE\n* METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE\n\n2. Conditioner: It's an head and shoulders \"Derma X Pro\" conditioner, which has: \n\n* Aqua\n* Stearyl Alcohol\n* Behentrimonium Chloride\n* Cetyl Alcohol\n* Isopropyl Alcohol\n* Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n* Phenoxyethanol\n* Benzyl Alcohol\n* Parfum\n* Sodium Benzoate\n* Piroctone Olamine\n* Citric Acid\n* Tocopheryl Acetate\n* Menthol\n* Hexyl Cinnamal\n* Polysorbate 20\n* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n* Linalool\n* Hydroxycitronellal\n* Geraniol\n* Propylene Glycol\n* Cereus Grandiflorus Flower Extract\n* Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf / Stem Extract\n\n3. Leave-in conditioner (from what I think it should be) - schwarzkopf GLISS OIL NUTRITIVE with ingredients like: \n\n* Aqua (Water, Eau)\n* Cyclomethicone\n* Phenyl Trimethicone\n* Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil\n* Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil\n* Hydrolyzed Keratin\n* Lactic Acid\n* Sodium Benzoate\n* Dimethiconol\n* Cetrimonium Chloride\n* Coumarin\n* Phenoxyethanol\n* Potassium Sorbate\n* Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone\n* Polyquaternium-16\n* Parfum (Fragrance)\n* Benzyl Alcohol\n* Linalool\n* Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone\n* Citronellol\n\n4. Finally, the argan oil of morocco by OGX - \n\n* Cyclopentasiloxane\n* Cyclotetrasiloxane\n* Dimethiconol\n* Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil\n* C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate\n* Fragrance (Parfum).",

I've tried retinol, trent, niacinimide, etc but nothing has helped tighten the skin. My primary care doctor only now decided to say that they could be allergic shiners, which gives me hope as to why I'm the only one in my family who has them, but im not sure if it's true because i don't have any dark circles. I've started allergy suppression at home with a 24hr 10mg zyrtec I take daily, though nothing has improved in the week I've used them. I'm worried that since I've had them for years, it's going to be very hard for my body to tighten my undereyes naturally. I'm open for any suggestions to bring them down though.",

My skin concerns are:\n* Skin tend to be dry and flaky looking quickly on my forehead.\n* Would like an overall smooth and glowy look to my skin.\n* I tend to get acne breakouts on my chin, between nose &amp; lip, between eyebrows, and on the right side of my cheek &amp; jaw. I'm not sure if it's hormonal because it generally matches up with my cycle, but the left side of my face is always perfect so maybe environmental? It's usually either deep under the surface, or whiteheads. Either way, heavy products like thick lotion and Vaseline do tend to cause me to break out so I want to avoid making it worse.\n\nMy current daily routine is CeraVe hydrating cleanser, The Ordinary HA serum, The Ordinary Ascorbicyl Glucoside serum, and CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion. Occasionally, maybe once every 2 weeks, I use The Ordinary's red AHA &amp; BHA peeling solution. I like how smooth my face looks afterwards but it feels too harsh to use more often, and I'm almost out of that so I'd be open to switching products!\n\nI'd prefer either drugstore or inexpensive-ish products from Ulta, with little to no scent. I'm breastfeeding so I can't do any retinol.\n\nI've hear about milky toners, but I'm not sure if that would be the right type of product?",

I applied everything with prayer hands and scrunched it while soaking wet, upside down.\n\nWhen it’s wet and conditioned it has BEAUTIFUL wavy clumps and it overall looks better even now if I spray some water on it but I can’t keep that pretty hydrated look, it dries up, separates and frizzes up like in the photo.\n\nI am looking for any tips you might have to make the waves nicer/more “hydrated looking”.

Unsure as to what brands are good though especially for the mousse and anti frizz. I have low porosity loose curls around 2C/3A anddd goals are for my hair to have more definition and less frizziness, not much hold though!

I cleanse my face each night and use a milky toner and light moisturizer and sunscreen to prep my face before applying makeup. Should I add anything to my routine? Should I be exfoliating, and if so what is the best way to do it for sensitive skin? I need help and any ideas!",

I spent a few times in the past several years trying to understand and like my curls, to find what works for me. Everything ever seems to weight it down. Is trying to achieve a gel cast possible? And if so, how do I do that without putting too much gel on and weighing things down? Thank you!!!\n\nTo give further context of where I'm at so far, I only just realized you really shouldn't touch your curls much while diffusing. Oops.\n\nCurrent routine: shampoo with dove repair, or ION hard water shampoo. Usually conditioner, Pantene of some kind. Try to plop into a towel but my hair is short. Air dry for best results but it's winter so I diffuse try to upside down.\n\n ",
