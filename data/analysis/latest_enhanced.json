      "content": "After weeks of scouring the internet and harassing chat gpt, I’ve finally decided to make my own post about this. \nThis is gonna be a lot, but after spending time on this thread I know I’m not alone at least. \nAfter three months of being off of birth control, I have decided to restart and am wondering if anyone has experience with stopping and restarting due to hormonal acne. \n\nFor context, I started taking hormonal birth control (single month cycle, can’t remember brand) as a teenager for moderate acne on face/chest/back. It helped back then and I continued that bc until about the age of 19 or 20. By that time I had developed PMDD, so my primary care provider prescribed me Simpesse (3 month cycle) to reduce the frequency of having to suffer through the luteal phase. My skin was pretty clear while on it but still with the occasional breakout/ cystic acne. \nI stupidly decided to stop Simpesse in July as I was having breakthrough bleeding randomly and wanted to see how my body would do without it. \nJuly and august I had normal and surprisingly tolerable periods, but was still getting the occasional cystic acne so I decided to ask my dermatologist about spironolactone. \nLess than two weeks into September the breakouts began. It was chest and neck at first, mostly closed comedones and papules. By late September my skin was the worst it had ever been and I thought it was due to the spiro, so I weened myself off. \nTwo weeks after stopping the spiro my skin started to clear, but since then it has only gotten worse. Never in my life has my skin been this bad and it’s now my face, neck, back, and chest. Objectively my acne may not be considered severe, but it is taking a serious toll on my mental health, especially since it coexists with the pmdd symptoms. \n\nLong story short, for the sake of my mental health I have decided to restart Simpesse. I’m a week back on the pill and the acne is still getting worse. I’m hoping this is a “gets worse” before it gets better situation, because I can’t take looking and feeling like this much longer. \nHas anyone restarted birth control or used spiro in conjunction with birth control to speed up the process of rebalancing hormones? \nAnd what potential topical treatments or lifestyle changes have you made that helped move things along? \n\nI am currently doing: low sugar, no dairy, no gluten, minimal egg, no caffeine, no alcohol, drinking spearmint tea, drinking decaf green tea, I’ve been trying salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide seems to make it worse but maybe I need to trust the process. I am using a very basic cleanser and moisture with spf. \n\nI’ll attach some progress pictures. First is late September (what I thought was the worst), mid October (2 weeks off spiro when it started to clear), and now currently. Any advice welcome, I’m desperate lol. ",

      "content": "I recently picked up a new hair care routine after learning that I was soaking my hair way, WAY too often just to make it presentable. I do it at night starting with a shower and repeat every 72 hours:\n\n• condition hair in shower, brush it out with wet brush under cool water\n• out of shower, apply Love Ur Curls Step 3 and Irish Sea Moss Gel (a good palmful or two of each), brush through with toothed brush to divide up my curls, and scrunch\n•leave completely alone to get crunchy, stiff, and completely dry\n• loosely tie up in a pineapple and sleep on satin pillowcase\n• wake up next day and mist and scrunch hair until it falls into shape\n\nMy hair is usually, as a result, high in curl and coil volume. On day two and three, I usually just mist my hair with water and sometimes leave-in conditioner to get the frizz down and, if it really needs it, do the praying hands technique with a little bit of LA Looks gel. I’ve been following this routine for a few weeks now and it’s been working well— my hair on the third day without washing often looks better now than it did on a normal day (when every day was a wash day) during my last routine.\n\nPictured is my hair at the end of today (day two of this cycle). It’s way more littered with strands doing their own thing away from the rest of the curls than I’m used to, and I feel this came from when I pulled on (and later off) a hoodie yesterday. I made an effort earlier to praying hands some gel into the strands, wet them with a spray bottle, and scrunch them to hell, but they just end up becoming shiny little strings— remnants of broken curls that were ravaged by the tighter than normal collar on this particular hoodie.\n\nAnyways, I know about methods like putting a bonnet or pillowcase over your head every time you want to put on a hoodie (I just didn’t do it well enough this time I guess). Any ideas, though, about fixing these strands and frizz before wash day? If they can’t be reincorporated into their curl families, can they at least be made presentable when things like this happen?",

She did my colour, I usually dye my hair bright red (I get the products myself online and mix a good red base with a pure red mix), have been doing that for years without any issues. I told that hairdresser and showed her pictures and she said no problem I got the colour, let me take care if it.\n\nIn passing I heard her say \"burgundy\" and for a sec got worried. I told her again, no other colour than red, showed her my MIL tee shirt that was bright red and said that colour, nothing else.\nYou can guess where I am going. She does the colour, washes my hair and I end up looking purple ... Like bright Aubergine/eggplant purple. You should have seen my face... The hairdresser was asking why I looked so grumpy and that the colour was nice.\nNeedless to say I will never go there again.\n\nNow to my hair question. I am not a pro with colours other than red. I have been told that if I apply red right away on my hair now it will not look good as in the purple there is probably some black/blue color that will react with the red and give a weird mix if I apply the red right away.\n\nIs there a way I can \"cancel\" the purple? By apply an other colour that negates it or bakances it? Or do I apply the red right away? Will it work?\n\nThanks again for any tips and advice",

      "title": "Constant Acne despite having tried everything. Help! [Acne]",
      "content": "As the title says, it feels like I've tried everything and I still have consistent acne every single day. For context, it all started when I was 15 and I started getting typical teenage acne, but really only 1-2 spots at a time. To treat this, I started using ProActiv's 3 step treatment plan with BP. At the time, it really seemed to be helping and I eventually decided that I really didn't even need BP anymore, and so I discontinued using it at around 16.5 years old. Then, for a brief period, my skin was really clear and the best it had ever been, but I inevitably started getting acne again in Grade 12, which worsened for the rest of the year and eventually led me back to BP, which once again, cleared up my skin, though not without the initial purging phase, which only lasted about 3 weeks. So, going into my first year of university I had relatively clear skin with BP, though it all went bad when I started eating the garbage they gave us on the mealplan. \n\nMy skin had always been affected by my diet, so starting from when I was 15 I always made sure to limit my sugar intake, and I pretty much ended up eliminating processed sugars entirely. Anyways, my skin started flaring up due to the junk food I was eating, which I had no control over. At the time, I was probably getting around 3-4 new pimples per day, though they would subside during breaks where I was back at home and eating healthy. Now, fast forward to the end of my first year, when my breakouts began getting increasingly worse, which I believe was due to a lack of sleep, stress from exams, and a bad diet. This all culminated in me starting Differin (adapalene), as I had heard about it online and had heard success stories even from people I knew personally. Looking back at it, this was probably one of the worst mistakes I have ever made as it immediately resulted in HUGE breakouts (which was normal bc of increased skin cell turnover aka purging). Despite the purging I powered through and used Differin for around 9 weeks until I couldn't take it anymore. I was getting 20-30 NEW pimples EVERYDAY and my confidence was at an all time low. Anyways, I quit Differin and went back to BP after like 2 weeks of letting my skin calm down. Once I was back on BP, my skin did start improving but it was still much much worse than how it was prior to Differin. \n\nCurrently, it's been about 5 months since I quit Differin and my skin still hasn't returned to how it was before, despite using the same products as I did in the past, including BP. I have days where I have clear-ish skin (3-5 pimples), but most of the time it's just constant breakouts (8-15 pimples everyday). I have now even completely cut out dairy products and eat a pretty low glycemic load diet, but it's all for nothing because I still have constant, consistent breakouts. \n\nMy Current Routine is: \n\nAM\n\n\\-Wash face w/ water\n\n\\-Moisturize w/ Amazon Oil Free Facial Lotion (discontinued Neutrogena dupe)\n\nPM\n\n\\-Wash face w/ PanOxyl\n\n\\-Pimple Patches\n\n\\-Same moisturizer as AM\n\nSorry for the really long rant but I'm at my wits end with this stuff. I'm basically just asking for some advice. Should I quit skincare? What are my next steps? Anything will help.\n\nTLDR: Used BP and had clear skin for some time, started having acne and used Differin, Differin ruined my skin and I went back to BP, skin still hasn't recovered.

Now that I'm older this all kind of blurs together, its easy for me to remember distinct products/looks/etc- but lately I am finding that I simply cannot remember the website that all these youtubers were using and recommending.\n\nIt was veryyyy similar to Ulta and Sephora, but they had smaller indie brands (I remember they were one of the few places to sell lime crime), and I believe a pink design/theme. I am almost convinced that it was based in the UK or AUS and they shipped worldwide, I also believe they had the word \"glam\" somewhere in their name or logo. \n\nI'm mostly looking for nostalgia, but also because it was great to be able to buy all the different brands in one place.

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
