      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Some of her biggest concerns/wants are things to help with puffy eyes in the morning and wrinkle reduction (mostly small thin wrinkles). She also has rosacea, so anything to help with the redness would be helpful too.\n\nSome things I've looked up that I'm considering getting her include:\n\nLED mask - I've seen these generally rated well for skin care but do I have to buy a $500 one or will the $100 Amazon ones work just as well?\n\nRetinol - this always seems to be the highest rated product, but I have no clue what specific product with retinol in it to get. There are like a million creams and serums that say retinol. Which one is best?\n\nIce roller - these seem to be inexpensive, but I've seen them rated high for the puffy eye bags. Do they work? Any recommendations on a specific one?\n\nAny other suggestions for anti-aging creams/serums are welcome too. As for budget, we're not exactly rich, but I'm not afraid of dropping $100 on a serum or something for her, but I don't want to spend that on the wrong thing. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!

I’ve seen a few dermatologists and estheticians and will try what they recommended / prescribe and I haven’t noticed a difference. It was first recommended that I use sulfur soap and adapalene gel which I did for a month or two and didn’t see any improvement whatsoever. I was then prescribed doxycycline and did not see any improvement. An esthetician recommended a couple of dermalogica products like the oil based wash and using single use towels on my face, no improvement. I think the oil wash made my face worse actually. Then finally looked into fungal acne and was prescribed a topical gel but was told if it didn’t improve on 2 weeks it wasn’t fungal acne and here I am 4 weeks later with no improvement. I also am using ketoconazole shampoo because I thought if I’m putting that on my face for fungal acne maybe I should extend to my hair but no improvements. The last esthetician I’ve seen wanted me to stop everything and use only a gentle face wash and a moisturizer but Im still not seeing any improvement. ",

I'm really serious about improving my skin since it's one of my bigger insecurities, so if anybody has suggestions for products (preferably including how often I should apply), I would *greatly* appreciate it (:\n\nP.S. do you think it's possible the bumpy/uneven skin on my lower face could be due to the way I'm shaving?

I'm really struggling with frizz, no definition and super tangled hair (I can't even rake my fingers through it sometimes). I really struggle with styling and would just love to have some defined waves without constantly having to have my hair up due to frizz or just general puffiness. I don't straighten or curl my hair anymore (although I did last year). \n\nI have fine but thick hair and I believe my hair type is 2A. \n\nI've not really tried many products but I've tried some Aussie Curly hair shampoo, conditioner and curl cream (all was too heavy for my hair and weighed it down). \nI've tried the Merwave products for wavy hair and this worked well for a short time but this is not sustainable as they are very expensive products.\nCurrently I am trying for a minimalist approach and my routine is as follows- \n\nShampoo with Garnier Ultimate Blends Delicate Oat Milk for delicate hair and scalp (I have a sensitive scalp). \n\nI alternate between the Garnier Ultimate Blends Delicate Oat Milk Conditioner and Garnier Ultimate Blends Banana Hair Food mask which I always use as a leave in on my ends as well. \n\nI only brush in the shower and I tie my hair with a cotton t shirt and then air dry or diffuse. My hair always looks so nice and defined when wet!! \n\nI also sometimes use Curlsmith Effortless Waves styling spray on wet hair but I haven't found this does much. \n\nHair oil I use L'Oréal Elvive Extraordinary oil during the day and then the L'Oréal Midnight serum before bed. \n\nI sleep on a silk pillow and also sleep with a bonnet (which does help with frizz a little the next day). \n\nAny recommendations for getting some definition and softness along with something to tame frizz would be so helpful!",

But the acne just never stops.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I took a full course of isotretinoin. My skin became absolutely clear during and after the treatment, and I finally felt confident… but after stopping it, within a few months the acne slowly started returning. Now it feels even worse at times.\n\nCurrently I’m using salicylic acid and niacinamide, but honestly I don’t think they’re helping much. New pimples still keep coming, especially out of nowhere. It’s really frustrating and mentally draining at this point.\n\nI just want to know if anyone else went through something similar — acne coming back after isotretinoin — and what helped you long-term? Did you go for a second course, change your routine, fix lifestyle triggers, or something else?\n\nAny advice, experience, or guidance will really help. Thank you ❤️",

I know Scalpe+ is the usual go-to recommendation, but the pharmacist suggested this one.\n​Has anyone here used this specific brand? How was your experience?\n​Since it has ZPTO (Zinc), is it less drying than the plain Ketoconazole shampoos?\n​Any tips on how to incorporate this into a routine without frying my hair?\n\n​Thanks in advance!",

I'm a week in, I use a toner, serum and spf moisturiser in the mornings and a daily scrub and regular moisturiser at night. \n\nMy skin is way softer and dewier, which I really like, but I am getting so much more acne. I usually only break out a little around my period and in my t zone, but I'm getting spots on my cheeks and jaw especially. Should I wait it out and see if my skin adjusts to the routine, or is there something I should do differently? I'm in Ireland, so I should have access to most products available in the UK, but I am also a student so I can't afford anything high end at the moment. Thanks :) ",

I mentioned to the associate that I was thinking about doing a color remover or a bleach wash just to lift a bit because I had been dying my hair with a 2NN (darkest intense brown from ion I think) and I didn't think it was going to deposit enough. I wasn't trying to get to blonde, just lift some of the dark brown out. She said that wasn't necessary. Now my roots are so bright compared to the rest of my hair. My natural hair is brown, but maybe 2 shades lighter than the dark brown I've been putting on it. I actually really like the brighter color. Should I attempt a small lift and redeposit the color to attempt to even it out or apply darker at the roots? I'm frustrated I didn't trust my gut on this one. ",
