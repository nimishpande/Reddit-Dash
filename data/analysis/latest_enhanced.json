      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Like, I straight up cannot pull my Denman through my hair after applying them. I have fairly healthy hair with little damage, and can glide a fine-toothed comb through my wet hair right out of the shower, but it feels like a lot of gels just blast my hair's cuticle wide open.\n- Good hold - lots of gels that promise to be \"less drying\" also just have hold that sucks!\n\nI'm not super picky about it being \"no-crunch\", I love a good cast, but I think there's probably something to the crunch-free-ness that makes it more slippy.\n\nPlease help, this gel was perfect but I know there have got to be cheaper alternatives out there. 😭\n\nThe basics of my routine currently:\n- in the shower: Curl Keeper Treatment Shampoo, rinse, then Skala Mais Cachos (the blue one), rinsed about 80% out\n- gently comb to detangle\n- Curl Keeper Tweek\n- John Frieda Frizz Ease Dream Curls Mousse\n- gel (this is the step where the Ultra Defining Gel comes in)\n- section hair and brush style with the Denman (just pulling down with light tension, no brush curling or anything)\n- scrunch, air dry until about 50% dry and then diffuse the rest of the way",

      "content": "It’s really just on my chin. Sometimes they are larger, more cyst like. They rarely come to a head, they’re kind of just swollen red bumps that hurt, and last for a month or so, at which time, new ones have already started to form. They are typically in this formation, more on the sides of my chin, occasionally under my chin/on my jawline.\n\nCurrently use Micellar water to remove makeup, then cleanse with Dr Loretta Gentle Hydrating Cleanser. Moisturize with La Roche Posay Lipikar AP+M Triple Repair. I’ve tried the Paula’s Choice exfoliating pads, and they just made me break out worse. I drink tons of water, I wash my pillowcases at least once a week. I’ve been on a hormonal IUD for 5 years now, so I don’t think it’s that. I’m feeling so defeated and I’m just sick of covering them with makeup, plus they kinda hurt. I’ve never been to a dermatologist before, is that the move? Do I need a drastic diet change? Any product recommendations?\n\nThank you in advance.",

For a little more context, I use ordinary shampoo (just on my scalp) twice a week and ordinary conditioner (on everything but my scalp) nightly.\n\n  \nI don't really have a concrete routine anymore since I've been trying different things every day, but here's what I did for the results pictured:\n\n  \n\\- Completely soaked\n\n\\- Very lightly dried with regular towel (just dabbed enough so it's not dripping everywhere)\n\n\\- Brushed it straight with a wet brush while spraying it with a spray bottle to keep it wet\n\n\\- Applied and brushed through some It's a 10 Miracle Leave-In Potion\n\n\\- Flipped head upside down, ran a palmful of LA Looks Extreme Sport through hair and scrunched all over\n\n\\- Left completely alone to air dry over my back\n\n  \nThe results of my hair feel inconsistent day-to-day. I think I have a straight bottom layer of hair, so I'll see little strands of straight/wavy hair frustratingly protruding from my curls. Frizz feels sporadic and seems to show up wherever it wants.\n\nI know I don't go above and beyond for my hair, so am I expecting too much? Is there really a normal amount of frizz in the photos?

I have changed hair products A LOT and have dyed my hair many times, but since taken a break. I am currently using the Native brand and Soapbox brand for shampoo and conditioner. I had their sprays too, but after some research I found a lot of people were dealing with thinning and frizz. I too.. am dealing with thinning and frizz. For extra moisture I use the soapbox brand too. I’ll put shea oil in my hair on extra frizzy days. \n\nDuring 2021 I used Cantu, but they’ve changed their recipe sooo much over the years and I can’t rely on that anymore. I cannot recall what I was using for shampoo and conditioner, but I honestly think it was Dove shampoo and Suave. I feel like my hair was so much fuller and bouncier in 2021! \n\nExtra info: I air dry my hair and do not blow dry at all. I sleep with a bonnet sometimes and use a silk pillow case ALWAYS. I do not go to bed with wet hair. \n\nWhat should I do? Go back to the basic routine even though they’re full of sulfates or try something new again? I think a hair cut is due for starters. ",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

      "content": "Hi everyone,\nI'm learning to take care of myself after 7 years of illness and depression. My hair had always been cut very short, undercut, buzz cut. Now im starting to grow it longer again since I want to feel feminine again. \nIf you think \"Why didn't your parents teach ya this?\" It's because they both have very different hair than me, both thin hair as in hairstran, volume and just the texture. They're blond and brunette. \nA few things about my hair and scalp.\n\nMy hair: \nNatural ginger\n2a-2b depends on season. In autumn and winter it curls more for some reason and in summer it sags.\nMy hair has always been fizzy\nMy hair is thick, as in I need to thin it out around the 3-4 otherwise it will matt, no matter how many times I brush it because I move a lot in my sleep. \nHairstran thickness is medium, \nTakes very long to dry after it gets wet. Sometimes I sleep with wethair and wake up with it next morning. \n\nScalp:\nHas been itchy and uncomfortable lately \nIt has also been painfully a bit. \nHas some lose bits of skin. \n\nWhat I want: \nVolume, when it gets long the volume of my hair at the scalp is gone but lower it comes back. \nA comfortable scalp, that would be nice since I now keep itching it. \nNot having to thin it out every 3-4 weeks\n\nI just don't know where to start. I get overwhelmed by the haircare section and I just don't know what my hair needs. \nCan someone help me please how to find the right things? Bc I did multiple quizzes, game the same answers but somehow got different hair care treatment suggestions. I just feel overwhelmed. ",

      "title": "My little skincare and haircare routine 🩰✨🫧",
      "content": "🦋\nAbout me 🎀: My skintype is combination(oily on large areas and dry on another). I have large open pores and pigmentation. I easily get whiteheads and redheads if i don’t wash my face to reduce the oilyness. I have PCOS ⚡️and i go to gym like 2 days average in a week. I eat a lot of sugars, reduced carbs and take whey protein. I have facial hairs due to PCOS so i use  facial hair trimmer twice a week.\n\nAbout the products🦩:\n\nFacial Skincare🫧: \n1. Paknet (derma suggested)🪼: skin feels cleared and very smooth. I did a little research and got to know benzoyl peroxide reduces pimple causing bacteria. So i guess it helps reduce pimple. I gently move my hands in circular motion clockwise and upwards to let me skin absorb it and then wash. (AM PM)\n\n2. Acne oc- moisturiser (derma suggested)🪻: reduces pores and moisturise my face. Regulates oil production on face. I have seen some change in my pores and oiliness. I again apply it and move my hands upwards to let it soak in.(AM PM)\n\n3. Adapalene (derma suggested)🦥: it has benzoyl peroxide so it helps reduce pimple causing bacteria and in turn help prevent pimples. I take a very little of it and again in circular motion upwards apply it all over the skin but not on sides of nose, under/close to the eye and in sides of my mouth. Once in two days. Can irritate skin if over used.(AM -use sunscreen after)\n\n3. Moisurex-hydra (prev derma suggested) 🐚: i apply it same way , circular clockwise upwards till absorbs. Its water based so good if you have dry skin.  (AM PM)\n\n4. a. Aziderm (prev derma suggested)🐝: it reduces pigmentation, pimple and pimple marks. Also helps in detaning. My new derma hasn’t suggested it, but it works well so i’m using it. Same application - upwards and in circular motion. I use it as night as you need to save your skin from sun after these products. Use it a little like adapalene as it can irritate skin as well (PM)\n\n4. b. Clindamycin (derma suggested)🐥: no idea what it does but i have to apply it everyday in the morning. Doesnt irritate. Same application - circular, upwads) (AM PM)\n\n5. Deconstruct vitamin c serum ( self suggested) 🪽- my skin has got tanned so started using it recently. Still waiting to see if it works. Read application on the bottle(AM PM with sunscreen)\n\n5 b. Pixi toner -(nykaa gift) 👾- its good, no idea what it does but doesn’t do any harm so yeah, good so far. I apply it with cotton in circular upwards motion. (AM PM)\n\n6. Sunscreens 🌞-( all doc suggested current and prev) - uv doux is best but is tinted. It feels heavy so i will get the non silicone based on from uv doux. Others are fine. (Every two hours under sun, 2x pinky finger size)\n\n7. Vaseline (self suggested) 👄- i have pigmented lips, used it daily whenever i felt my lips have gotten dry, started observing them getting pink and less dark.\n\n8. Meds ( derma suggested) 💊- green one is omega - good for hair and skin. Black one is antioxidant, and peach one is for pimple reduction. I take them everyday\n\n9.shatavari juice (self suggested)🍶- i have pcos, so i take it every day after meal at night, helps with pcos and inflammation i guess. Im using everything so dont know how exactly is this working. I have to drink it for another month or so.\n\n10. Medicube collagen night mask, vlcc detan mask, detan scrub (self suggested)🎭- once a week for tanning.\n\n11. Turmeric and red sandal (self suggested)🎭- got them recently, good for face, clears , depigments brightens. I use it twice a week, it leaves yellowish color, so use it at night.\n\nHaircare:\n1. Ordinary 👩‍🦰: (self suggested): reduces hairfall and dandruff. Works like magic. I have seen hair fall reduction and new baby hairs (PM )\n\n2. Serum (self suggested) 🪮- makes hairs manageable inturn less breakage. After wash or whenever im using heat.\n\n3.  Soul flower serum (self suggested) 🫤- unsure, but i would bot recomment too many stuff ordinary is best.\n\n4. Soulflower oils 🛢️- (self suggested) - best ones for hair growth and thickness. (An hour before hairwash)\n\n\nAll these products are what i use, not suggesting that they work like magic or will work for everyone, but my face is now pimple free and when i touch my skin now, smooth and soft🥰. With PCOS your skin, mood and everything becomes twice complicated😅, i’ll aways suggest doctors when you think skincare and health🔎. If you are in bangalore and looking for the doctor, i have some names. I’m can help you🙃.\n\n\nThanks and have a great skin and hair ♥️🌸\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They’ve gotten darker, itchy, and I’m honestly close to giving up.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\t•\tCrystal Magnesium Solid Stick – not sure if it caused irritation or not, but within a few hours I could already smell myself. Didn’t really do anything for odor.\n\t•\tDr. Teal’s Eucalyptus Deodorant – smells nice, but the baking soda and essential oils burned my skin.\n\t•\tSchmidt’s Sandalwood &amp; Citrus – easily the worst reaction. The baking soda, coconut oil, and fragrance oils made my skin peel and itch.\n\nI’m starting to think my skin just can’t handle baking soda, magnesium, or strong essential oils, but I still want to stay away from aluminum and harsh chemicals.\n\nHas anyone found a truly gentle natural deodorant that actually works for odor without darkening or irritating your armpits? Ingredient breakdowns or product recs would really help.\n\n⸻\n\nWould you like me to make it sound a bit more like a vent (casual, Reddit-style) or slightly more polished to encourage detailed replies?",

I've used isotretinoin/accutane a couple of years ago, so I don't have problems with acne, and my skin isn't oily, but I still have a few blackheads on my nose, and I think I can improve a lot the overall aspect of my face with a few steps.\n\nI don't wanna anything too complicated, just a basic routine, using some products real fast. I think something like this:\n\n- a face soap\n- something for the blackheads/cleaning the pores, like salicylic acid (I don’t know what this is)\n- a moisturizer\n- a sunscreen\n\nIs there anything missing? What’s the order and how many times a day? Which products would you recommend, given my skin condition? I don't wanna anything expensive, since I haven’t done anything until now. I believe anything here will give good results.\n\nI'm a brazillian btw, any national products are welcome!",

      "content": "So, I've had acne since 13-14, definitely my breakouts aren't as bad as before I only get some pimples before my period but I do struggle with PIE marks and overall redness for which I use Azelaic Acid and a Salicylic Acid spot treatment when I get active pimples. \n\nLong story short I went to a new dermatologist for my seborrheic dermatitis and she prescribed Uriage DS emulsion on problematic areas but she focused mainly on my acne. She said my face was too blemished and I need to start Isotreitoin 20 mg a day based on my weight for 11 months, that it would change my life in 2 months and I would be unrecognizable, she didn't warn me about any side effects only that I couldn't get pregnant. I didn't know she meant accutane at the time, but I've heard and read so many side effects and thought it was meant for severe acne. She said it would be beneficial overall because it would decrease the oiliness of my face and help with my seborrheic dermatitis and occasional body acne. The routine she provided was AA on the morning with SPF and Adapalane at night 0.1% but I feel that and Isotreitoin is a lot. I'm scared of the side effects, I already have dry eyes and mental issues too. I wouldn't be able to wax and I do walk under the sun on college campus.\n\nI'm wondering if looking at my pictures the risk would be worth it or should I try only Adapalane and AA first. She prescribe another AA, I was using the ordinary but it hasn't help me improve. \n\nI'm really at a loss, because I only get pimples around my period but she says I need it because I'm scarring. I really thought my acce wasn't that bad and I would only cover it with makeup but seeing tiktoks of people post-accutane makes me see that clear glass skin is what people can get. And I really do want that but I'm scared of the side effects. Also I work at a Hospital once a night and receive artificial light. I'm also on Metmorfin and don't know about the toll on my liver. But nothing else has worked for the past 9 years. Could this be the solution? ",
