      "title": "My Naturally Curly Wedding Hair",
      "content": "Being able to wear my natural curls for my wedding was very important to me, but it was SO hard to fund images of curly wedding hair that was not curled with a curling iron. I really wanted to make a post with some images in case anyone is looking in the future!\n\nSome background: I was a bit disappointed with my hair trial. The HMU artist brushed through and re-curled each curl, which made my curls not only much looser, but they also did not hold for even an hour. I also think my hair did not like whatever hairspray was used. I don't have much experience having my hair styled so was not aware how this method would work on my hair until it was tried. No shade at all to the har stylist. My hair can be difficult... It's fine, low-density, doesn't behave like most curly hair, but also doesn't behave like non-curly hair. After agonizing a bit over it, I did some experimenting. I bought myself some CurlSmith hair spray which worked amazingly well on my hair. I bought a curling wand to match the width of my natural curls. I styled  my natural curls as I usually would (leave-in, curl cream, bowl method, plop 10-ish minutes, scrunch gently with microfiber towel, mousse, heat protectant, diffuse). I jazzed up any curls that didn't feel like cooperating with the curing wand. I did not brush or smooth them out, just re-wound them on the wand following the natural pattern and held for a couple seconds. I mocked up a very simple twist and sent her the pics. I asked her to let me style the curls myself, if needed she could re-curl pieces using the same method I did. Mostly she just needed to twist the front pieces and place the dried flower pins. I also asked her to use the hair spray I bought. She was super receptive and executed it so well on our wedding day. We recently got our professional photos back and looking through them I kept thinking \"damn, my curls look so good!\" for so many of the pictures! Long story short, I'm really happy I went with my gut and found a way to style my curls the way I wanted on our wedding day, and I am also so grateful for how flexible and understanding my stylist was.

      "content": "I have had acne since I was 10 years old, I am now 21. Most of my problems now are post acne. The photos are flipped, so the first photo is the right side of my face where I have the most issues with and the second is my left side. I mean you can see the photos, but I don't even know what to call my skin at this point. Since nothing seems to work and I have bought so many products, I have been very dejected and my routine is terrible and inconsistent right now. I have absolutely no idea what to do anymore. But please just help me because I can't live another 10 years in a shell because of my skin\n\nI don't know my skin type other than that I am obviously acne prone and I also have sensitive skin. Also, I do realize my skin is dry in the photos. I ran out of moisturizer, but I am getting it now 😅.\n\nCurrently, I wash my face with La Roche Posay Toleraine Foam cleanser (for normal to oily skin).\n\nPretty much every other product I use has not been consistent. Most things don't work for me or irritate my skin. It's been a constant guessing game with my skin and getting things that people recommend online just to find out that I used it wrong or that I should've been using another product entirely. I'm tired of the fads and the confusing spiral that skincare products are\n\nBut recently, I've been using L'Oreal Dark Spot Exfoliant Peel. On days where I use this peel I use Good Molecules Discoloration Correcting Face Serum and moisturize with Vanicream. When I apply these products my skin burns the tiniest bit, but it is worrying me that this product isn't for me so I might take it out or reduce the amount I use it. The rest of the days I use Adapalene Gel and Azelaic Acid then moisturize with Vanicream. I know I should be using sunscreen, but I am incredibly stubborn when it comes to it. I was using Eucerin but left it in my hot car and have been mourning the $20 I spent on the bottle to get a new one. But, of course I'll take any recommendations and free advice for sunscreens",

I don't know how it started or what's causing it, but I feel so incredibly insecure of myself because of it. I wish I could figure out how I can just get rid of it and become more confident.\n\nThey're what seem to be very deep blackheads and the occasional average whitehead, but mostly blackheads everywhere. Some bumps even have this white kinda solid puss that come out. The irony in this is that I don't have any acne like this anywhere else on my body, it's only just my breasts, and it frustrates me lots why does this only (but thankfully so) stay in that part of my body.\n\nDo I have some sort of rare condition that I'm unaware of? I have large breasts, so I know there's an expectancy that sweat can often cause breakouts, even heat rashes. I wear sports bras most of the time and wonder if that's the leading cause. I even took concern if the materials of my bras or clothes is part of the problem. I really am at a loss and sorta desperate in wanting to know what to do about this.\n\nI would post a picture as an example of my skin here, but I'm too shy and embarrassed to be putting this on the Internet. I wish I could though, so I can give a better idea of my plight, but I just can't. Anyways anything at all will be helpful so please don't hold back on information.",

Last month I switched to the Wishcare sunscreen because there was a lot of hype and then I heard a lot of bad things about Aqualogica, about them lying about the UV filters and stuff like that. So I switched to Wishcare sunscreen but just a few days ago the sunscreen scandal happened and I have also been seeing people debunk Wishcare as a brand about a lot of their stuff. So now I don't know what sunscreen to use and a lot of people suggested going for the Korean brand or the Japanese or the Australian brands but they are a little quite too expensive some of them and the quantity is also very less of the price that you are paying and I really want to make a switch of course for the better of my skin and I would really love that you guys can help me. I have been trying to find my answers for a long time but then every other person is just saying something else so I thought this is the best place to ask for advice and the Aqualogica sunscreen did really work very well for me but now I don't know because when I was an athlete like it didn't really help me with tanning I got a lot of tanned even while using the sunscreen in the right amount so I would really like it if you guys really really help me out here and I also want a new vitamin c serum because of Wishcare getting debunked so I don't know if I should trust them with the serum as well because I haven't seen any changes I mean I have dark circles as well and I have always had them since I was a kid and one thing I have want to debunk a myth where people say if you sleep less your dark circles get darker or you get dark circles which is so so not true it has been debunked by a lot of dermatologists and just don't believe in that so I really want to get rid of my hyperpigmentation around my nose and some of it under my eyes so when you guys recommend me a good vitamin c serum as well I really like my moisturizer even though dot and key has also been debunked but I still like my moisturizer my toner is very very well I don't know anything about plum I've been using the niacinamide serum for a long time and I don't know it is okayish I'd say it is okayish and same with the plum vegan mucin it is also very good I don't know what to say about the cleansing oil it has been good but it does make my skin's natural oil feel stripped away so if you guys can also suggest a better cleansing oil and please no korean brand  so please help girl out here I don't know where else to go at this point all the influencers are just lying any other creator who is reliable they also don't want to get into you know a fight because what if there's something wrong so please just help me out. I also don't use any retinol or retinoids, because I've heard that you should not use them without a Dermat's prescription or Dermat's proper guidance, and retinol should be used after a certain age, because it can harm your skin if you use it too early. Please also suggest a good under-eye cream. I've seen a lot of recommendations of this eye cream called Eye Bliss, but then I read a lot of reviews, and they were not good. Please suggest a good eye cream or any other brand.",

Now I understand why she said I needed the blood samples first and why she told me to buy some skincare products. What I don’t understand is why wait so long before starting the real treatment and give me antibiotics instead, I know 3 weeks isn’t that much but im so fed up with my acne I just wanna start as soon as possible.

He already applies spf 50 in the morning (in the summer he reapplied once a day, at the moment not reapplying as it’s cloudy or raining). He moisturises in the evening using CeraVe PM face lotion or Body Shop Vitamin E nourishing night cream.\n\nThe skin on his nose has been red, dry and flaky pretty much since he started his postman job 18 months ago. I’ve tried a few other things like Sudacrem, Vaseline and Body Shop CBD restoring facial oil, but nothing has made a single bit of difference. It’s also on his cheeks either side of his nose. \n\nIs it as simple as he just needs to wear sunscreen more consistently, or should try a different moisturiser? \n\nAny help is much appreciated. \n\n",
