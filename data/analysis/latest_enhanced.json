      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my honest experience with Mercure Istanbul Clinics, I know how difficult it is to choose the right place. I was completely bald maybe for 95% and I didnt expect it would ever get like this again. I used finasteride and minoxidil for more then a year but it didnt work.\n\nI am really happy that I have done it and also happy that I went to this clinic, if I see some hair transplant results here from hair mills and everything… I can absolutely recommend them, they did a good job and they were/are always very helpful. And before the transplant I really didnt tought it will be like this again. I am so happy.\n\nMy first hair transplant was with Dr. Carman more then a year ago, and my second with Dr. Bandirmali who did the fue channel all themself, taking grafts out were done by technicians, doctors are all day with you, and just with you, they do just a few patients per day and that was also the main reason I went them. Their price is also reasonable/avarage without being a hair mill.\n\nThe doctors were very serious and focused on their work, and the team around them are also really caring and very helpful. They really want the best for you, I can highly recommend them and I am very thankful. Beside English they have also Dutch support and translators which was more comfortable for me from the Netherlands.\n\nAfter the treatment they check daily the first days for the aftercare and also the months after they keep contacting you, they follow the growth month by month. That felt really helpful especially with the first transplant in the first days.\n\nI had two sessions in total. The first was 4575 grafts for the hairline and top. The second session was 3500 grafts for the crown. I am very happy with the end result of the first hair transplant after now more then a year, the second transplant I’m at month 10 now, and also the crown is starting to thicken up.",

      "content": "Want to share my personal experience with Myntra Support for all folks to be aware. For context, I've been buying from Myntra for many years and even part of their Insiders program.\n\n  \nMy pre-paid order from Myntra was supposed to be delivered 2 weeks ago. They initially sent me a wrong product. To my surprise, their app had no option to return it so I had to fight with the customer executive to raise an exchange request (which is already hard to reach because of their dumb chatbot).\n\n\n\nThey sent me the same wrong product again a week later. Now they're saying the product doesn't have a return policy so they can't process any refund, nor are they responding to any requests for a return.\n\n  \nI ultimately had no choice but to complaint to Consumer Helpline but the Myntra team immediately lied there as well and closed the ticket saying they already did the exchange. What's the point of an exchange if you're just going to send something useless again?\n\n  \nI understand this could be a scam from the seller itself that keeps sending users the wrong product but I'm extremely disappointed at how Myntra chooses to handle such requests and further refuse to refund any money or take back the wrong product I haven't even opened.\n\n  \nPlease be cautious when spending big amounts on Myntra. I'm glad it was approx Rs. 500 order I can forget as a reminder to never use Myntra again but if it was a big amount I'd have been mentally exhausted with how useless their customer support is.",

My husband on the other hand has been growing this out since covid. He hasn't had a haircut in years. \n\nRoutine:\nI help him detangle his hair often using Shea butter conditioner, a denman hairbrush, and a leave-in conditioner while its still moist, then it is air dried (we do not own a blowdrier). We do this every 4ish days. But always by the next day it gets tangled again. \nI want to know, how can I help him style his hair to keep it safe and manageable while still long? \n\nAnd a side question: what type of hair salon could handle this type of hair best in the event that I screw up? Husband is latino and has never been to any hair salon before, because he had short hair his whole life up until now. \n\nThank you for the advice! ",

I don’t have active acne, but my skin doesn’t look healthy and I want to give as much detail as possible about my face.\n\n* Noticeable redness around my cheeks and a few small marks that look like healed pimples.\n* Old acne scars  some small pits or uneven spots on both cheeks.\n* Overall uneven tone and skin texture, and visible pores, especially around the cheek and nose area.\n* A few brownish dark spots or slight discolorations from old breakouts.\n\nI’m not sure what kind of skincare should I do. I currently don’t have any, so I’m open to starting from scratch. I’d say my skin is not very sensitive, but I’m not sure how strong it is either. I think I have an oily center face (nose, chin and inner cheeks) while the outer face is kind of dry (sides of cheeks and neck).\n\nI did a bit of basic research and made the list below, but as I said I don’t know much and I’m open to all suggestions. I would really appreciate specific product recommendations since I’m not familiar with the market.\n\n  \nAfter Wake Up:  \n\\- Cleanser : CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser  \n\\- Niacinamide Serum : The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  \n\\-Sun Screen : ISDIN FotoUltra Spotprevent  \n\\- Moisturizer : Avène Hydrance Light Moisturising Emulsion  \n(Should I apply moisturizer even if I apply sun screen wouldn’t it be too much layer how do I apply that ? Also do I really need sunscreen in winter ?)  \n  \nBefore Bed:  \n\\-Cleanser: CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser  \n\\-Azelaic acid or Retinal or %2 BHA: (3 day alezaic, 3day retinal, 1 day %2 BHA in a week)  \nAzelaic Acid : The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%  \nRetinal : HYALURON ACTIV B3  Multi-intensive Night Cream  \n%2 BHA : The ordinary or Geek &amp; Gorgeous (which one should I choose ?)  \n  \nAlso should I apply moisturizer after those treatments at night ?\n\nAbout tret/retinoid products: I did basic research and found it might be better to start with non-prescription options first so I don’t harm my skin.\n\nI live in Germany and I can buy via online. Also I’m open to prescription medication, but I don’t want professional dermatologist procedures like laser treatments or needles. What would you recommend to me?\n\nThanks a lot in advance for your help!",
