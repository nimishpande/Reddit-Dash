      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I’ve been noticing a lot of consumerism, marketing gimmicks, and wrong skincare trends especially things like topical glutathione, 7-step routines, and overly hyped beauty serums. So here’s some simple, dermatologist-backed guidance based on personal experience and expert advice:\n\nA basic routine will always beat a complicated one. It saves money, protects your barrier, and gives long-term results.\n\nSunscreen: Use it daily (preferably a pharma-clinical grade sunscreen with a blue-light protection filter) and a lip sunscreen. If you have active, inflamed acne, avoid applying sunscreen directly on top instead use shade, or stay indoors.\n\nCleanser: Use a gentle cleanser. Double cleansing is recommended on days with heavy sunscreen or makeup and its encouraged to do so if you have oily skin. You don’t need morning cleansing cold water is enough unless you’re producing too much oil. keep the Cleansers with actives on your skin for 45 seconds before washing it off.\n\nMoisturiser: Choose one according to your skin type. Ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramides are helpful.\n\nThat’s all you need. If you have skin concerns, choose one active only. Get a dermatologist assessment and lean towards pharma-grade medicated products, staying consistent with one routine for at least 3 months before changing anything.\n\nRetinoids: Tretinoin is a holy grail as retinoids help with cell turnover and target many major concerns. Glycolic acid , adapalene, and azelaic acid also work well when used correctly (start slow, sandwich method, apply in moderation).\n\nExfoliation: Avoid physical scrubs and herbal DIY remedies. Only use chemical exfoliants like AHA/BHA (salicylic, glycolic, lactic acid, etc.) and use them sparingly.\n\nSheet masks: Expensive and wasteful; the fiber isn’t great for skin or the planet.\n\nToners: Mostly unnecessary. Just dampen your skin with rose water or plain water before applying products to improve absorption. All products like snail mucin, peptides, ceramides, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid should be used on Damp skin while \npotent actives should always be applied on dry skin ideally 10–15 minutes after washing.\nWhen the skin is damp, absorption increases too quickly, which can push strong ingredients deeper than intended and lead to irritation, or burning.\n\nEye creams: Often unnecessary. Under-eye darkness is mostly genetics, sleep, lifestyle, and makeup (some studies show kajal contributes to darkening).\n\nTrends: Don’t blindly follow trends like slugging with Vaseline. It only works if done properly because petroleum jelly is an occlusive  it must be layered over good hydration and only if your skin type suits it.\n\nK-beauty: Korean skincare products aren’t automatically suitable for everyone. Their products are created for Korean climate and skin, and true “glass skin” is usually genetics + aesthetic procedures.\n\nHyperpigmentation in brown skin: Brown skin produces more melanin when healing. So if glycolic acid, shaving, or any method “darkened” your skin, it’s usually because: • your barrier was weak • the product was overused • sunscreen wasn’t applied properly Barrier repair + fewer actives + gentle care is the real solution.\n\nHair removal: Face shaving and laser is usually gentler and better because they don’t pull hair from the root, unlike waxing/threading. (If you have PCOS or hormonal issues, treat the root cause first.)\n\nVitamin C: Not every active is essential. Vitamin C is helpful but potent having the ability to damage your skin instead. improving your diet with these nutrients is often more effective than relying solely on the serum.",

      "content": "Renew and me stopped my subscription! Tret advice… (UK)\n\nI’ve been using their subscription service for almost 2 years and have worked up to 0.01 tretinoin probably mixed in with azelaic acid and a bunch of other filler stuff… I landed up with excess product and took a very small break after developing perioral dermatitis after a 38c blistering heat visit to Berlin. I spoke to them about this and after it settled down they were happy with me to continue to prescription.\n\nRecently, I went to login to my account to see when my next delivery date was and I had to do the full consultation (like you do when you firestorm join) and they said they couldn’t give my prescription anymore; no reason, zilch. I’ve tried getting some info out of them but they are non-responsive.\n\nI can’t just stop 0.01 tret suddenly!? Using it has meant for the first time in my life I’ve not had cystic acne since I was 12 (I’m 45!). \n\nTo be honest, I’m completely terrified as to what’s going to happen to my skin. \n\nI’ve had a light research into products from India but I’d appreciate any guidance. \n\nI’m also interested in Tazorac cream and if my skin tolerates tret with no issues, is this something I could try? Is azeliac acid something I could combine it with?\n\nMy skincare routine is flawless (I have OCD so the thought of not incorporating the tret in there is giving me genuine anxiety). I use Curel products (double cleanse/ essence, moisturiser/ ceramide spray/ SPF 50 for day).\n\nNot asking for medical diagnosis, just looking for people with similar experiences or routine suggestions. Will speak to GP\n\nHelp a stressed gal out! Thank you 🙌🏻\n\n",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
