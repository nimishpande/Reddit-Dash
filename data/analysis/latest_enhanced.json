      "content": "Finally sharing my progress here! I take 1.25mg every day. My hair loss treatment journey is kinda funny because I only noticed I was thinning considerably because I had just gotten a buzzcut due to my best friend passing away April this year and one of the things he wanted me to do the most was getting a buzz cut. \n\nAfter buzzing I noticed how bad it was and hopped initially on both topical 5% minoxidil and finasteride, I got pretty good results within 2 months but I ditched minoxidil because it was just too inconvenient to use, y’all know that. While I was afraid I was going to lose all the ground I had gained back, I didn’t! So luckily I was able to maintain everything. As far as side effects is concerned, I haven’t experienced much difference, however during the first 2-3 weeks my sex drive was through the roof, I was horny all the time, but that decreased back to what I consider a normal level. 0 changes. Thank God lol\n\nPlan on taking it for life as I look much better with a full head of hair. I’m grateful for my best friend Lucas, if it wasn’t because of the buzzcut I’d probably never realize how important hair is to me. Hair all day every day!!!!\n\nSorry for the long text! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me anything!",

      "content": "In my younger years, going without washing my hair was no problem for me. Now I work a blue collar job, I've got my head next to running car's tail pipes for like a quarter of the day and I end up smelling like exhaust by the end of the day, so I feel like I have to wash my hair every day! I know it's not great for my hair, but I don't really know what else to do. I'd try dry shampoo but then I'd have to brush it out and brushing my hair while it's dry always makes it so much more frizzy. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nPer the rules of the sub, I must include my routine (thought I don't know that it's really relevant to the post) so here's what I use.\n\n- As I am Cowash most days\n- Kristin Ess Clarifying Shampoo once a week, immediately followed by Mielle Rosemary Mint Hair Masque\n- Kristin Ess Curl Shampoo and Conditioner on days that I don't use anything that hasn't already been listed. (This is a new addition to the routine, and still kinda in the experimental phase. I had been trying a few different products from Shea Moisture but none of them were really working out for me)\n- A customer at work today recommended As I Am leave in conditioner because we've got basically the same hair except his is in much better health, so that's going in the routine starting today\n- I've been using a microfiber towel to get my hair from \"wet\" to \"damp\" before brushing, but the previously mentioned customer recommended switching to using an old t-shirt (and I'm gonna switch back because I used to use old t-shirts and my hair was in much better shape back then)\n- After Brushing I apply Kristin Ess softening oil to the ends of my hair at the suggestion of my gf to reduce frizz.\n\nIf anything I've mentioned in my routine raises some eyebrows, please say something! I'm at my wit's end trying to get my hair back to how it used to be!",

My skin is super oily (especially in my T-zone), and I also get small pimples there on my forehead. The texture and look of my skin just really get to me sometimes… I know no one is inspecting my face the way I do, but it still eats at my confidence daily.\n\nEvery time I try to research products it feels like everyone’s just trying to sell me something instead of giving genuine advice. I’d love to hear from people who’ve actually seen results especially with blackheads and oil control.\n\nMy current routine is super minimal AM: La Roche-Posay SPF PM: Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, occasionally the ordinary Plant-derived squalane\n\nThat’s literally it. I feel so lost when it comes to skincare so if anyone has recommendations that truly helped clear up clogged pores or balance oily skin, I’d really appreciate it 🫶🏼\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9w03cx9nw0g1.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7977f78b9e4612b5bf4b8339d470acca4992e3ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/frv3bcx9nw0g1.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81a9149aa07e422fd001c8732028d8960c971e9e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k4jk3dx9nw0g1.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6d66fef2c63a230bd685a871a8fc6a0f4334162\n\n",

      "content": "I have had this forehead cyst for over a month noticed it October 1st. First pic is my cyst with makeup on it. \n\nIt does not feel inflamed its more hard and slightly moveable when you press down on it. In addition if I accidentally brush over it with too much pressure it does hurt. No sign of growth, redness or anything. \n\nI went to a dermatologist two/three weeks ago, very dismissive ,and only prescribed me doxy(which i am very hesitant to take due to the harsh side effects).  I ignored the prescription. Went on a deep dive and have been doing the following things for a week now. \n\nDrinking a glass of pomegranate juice a day. Hot black tea compress with 5 diff applications in one sitting and applying cortisone cream. \n\nNow I did not see results from that after some days. However one day I guess the hot tea compress was too hot and burned the top layer of skin right off the cyst which led to an opening. After that I was applying cortisone cream and using Hydrocolloid patches. From using the patches a lot of gunk came out. I think my cyst got smaller maybe by 10-20% (idk wishful thinking)\n\nThe 2nd and 3rd pictures represents what my cyst looks like now. I used a hydrocolloid patch last night and no gunk came out probably because the burn area is healing and there is no opening to the skin anymore. \n\nI do not know how to move forward. I would prefer trying other methods before a steroid shot (im scared of the indentation and the potential price) and getting it surgically removed since its right in the middle of my forehead. \n\nI do not know if I should go the method of shrinkage: Poking a hole in the cyst, hot compress more hydrocolloid patches (since that seemed to work?) \n\nOr use prid and try to bring it out (by poking a hole). I used prid before with no opening in the skin and it did absolutely nothing. \n\nOr try the doxy pills but idk those seem extremely harsh. Also note : my regular acne isn’t even that bad it just seems like low to mild hormonal acne (pictured in 4th slide) so that’s why i dont want to use doxy for just one cyst. \n\nI not only will appreciate any help but am desperately asking for it. It has been affecting my self esteem as i can not hide it. It is basically a third eye just waiting to come out. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I've stopped using heat on my hair and been following CGM and variations for a year now. I am so miserable with my hair that I'm thinking of hitting the hair tools again.\n\nI believe my hair is a mix of 2a - 2c waves as sometimes it goes wavier than this image. I have dense hair, and it is mostly high porosity and mixed medium to thick strands, they don't feel super coarse but they are definitely not fine. It has been just over 1 year without heat and I get it trimmed regularly. I don't have any chemical/dye in my hair.\n\nWhatever variation of CGM or wavy girl method I try, I don't get even close to shiny and soft hair. It just seems to love being pouffy and frizzy. I live in a hard water area but have a water filter, it is not a humid climate.\n\nMy routine/some info:\n\n* Low poo Johnson Baby OR Cantu co wash OR Tresemme clarifying shampoo to cleanse the roots (only clarifying once in a while as I don't seem to get build up, I'm almost wishing for build up at this point as it would weigh the hair down).\n* Garnier Hair Food Papaya or Banana OR Olaplex Rich Hydrating Mask to condition and also as a leave in.\n* Argan oil as part of LOG method.\n* Giannini Curl Jelly OR Ecostyler Argan OR Ecostyler Olive OR Boots Curl Creme.\n* I never dry brush, I use a wide tooth comb from the ends to roots gently when wet.\n* Have tried S2C, plopping, finger coiling etc etc. I now just scrunch and air dry as it's easier and none of them made a difference.\n* I always sleep on a silk pillow with a silk eyemask. Sometimes I use a silk cap but it seems to be hit and miss, some mornings my hair is flat and shiny and others its a frizz bomb. Sometimes I use a silk scruncy to pineapple, again hit and miss.\n* I attempt to refresh on non wash days by wetting my ends and putting more oil then gel or creme on, but it doesn't seem to work.\n* I only wash my hair once a week, this photo is hair that hasn't been washed for 5 days and has been refreshed everyday.\n* I use cool water rather than hot.\n* Protein treatments seem to make it more straw like, so I don't use them. I'm not sure if this is protein build up or something else, seems to be conflicting theories on this!\n\nI seem to either have hair like the attached photo, where it's pouffy, not defined, looks in terrible condition and no products or refreshing seem to help. Or it's wavier and more defined (thankfully) but then the minute I go outside it pouffs up and becomes frizzier. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason to which it decides to do.\n\nI see other people's straight, wavy, curly, or coily hair walking down the street staying roughly how they styled it and feel utterly at a loss as to where I'm going wrong. I really don't want to pick up the straighteners again but my hair was shinier, softer and stayed how I styled it back then!\n\nI would love some advice, tips, tricks, any products you think I'm missing or shouldn't be using from what I've mentioned. Anyone with similar hair who've achieved shiny, soft, silky waves? I have all my fingers and toes crossed for some renewed hope.",

      "content": "I've been struggling with acne since I was 15 and at this point, it feels like I’ve tried every product under the sun. If you’ve heard of it, I’ve probably tried it at some point in my life. \n\nTo be honest, I’ve made so many mistakes on my journey to fixing my skin because as I’m sure you all know, skincare is confusing. Really, really confusing... The highs, the lows, and everything in between, I've really been through it all.\n\nNow at 22, whilst my skin is not perfect, it's finally in a good place and I owe it all to **healing my skin barrier.**\n\nIn a way, this post is kind of like the message I wished I had, but never received at 15. I know what it’s like to feel like you’re doing everything right and still get nowhere. I promise you’re not failing, you just need to stop fighting your skin, and start supporting it. \n\nHere's the routine I used to heal my skin barrier :)\n\n**Morning** ☀️\n\n\\- Step 1: Ilso Sensitive Bubble Relaxing Cleanser\n\n\\- Step 2: WELLAGE Real Hyaluronic 100 Toner *(On damp skin, I apply this toner in 3 - 5 layers)*\n\n\\- Step 3: Ilso Cencera Repair Cream\n\n\\- Step 4: Cosrx Ultra Light Invisible Sunscreen *(Not my favourite sunscreen, but I use it because it doesn't break me out. On the hunt for a good mineral sunscreen to replace it)*\n\n**Night** 🌙\n\n\\- Step 1: Dewytree Hi Amino All Cleansing Milk\n\n\\- Step 2: Ilso Sensitive Bubble Relaxing Cleanser\n\n\\- Step 3: WELLAGE Real Hyaluronic 100 Toner\n\n\\- Step 4: Ilso Cencera Repair Cream\n\nI hope this post has helped you in some way and always remember that you’re not alone. Please feel free to message me directly or comment below if you ever have any questions :) ",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
