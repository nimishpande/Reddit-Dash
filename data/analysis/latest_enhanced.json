I get ropey waves\n\nSeparating them does nothing other than turn them in skinnier ropes waves and it just looks like I have dreads.\n\nI know my hair can not do this, as it's happened before, and that's because it was the 2nd day, I steamed my curls in the shower and ran my wet hands through them. Unfortunately no photo since it was a once in a lifetime experience I'm sorry.\n\nI don't know why we need to submit a routine just for basic help considering nobody knows wtf products we use if we're not from the US but hey! here you go:\n\n1. Sulkin volumising conditioner (protein) or garnier watermelon conditioner \n2. Redwon teatree shampoo (clarifier) or garnier watermelon shampoo\n3. vo5 megahold gel\n4. sometimes a leave-in conditioner on the ends\n\nOther methods I've tried:\n\n1. Scrunching conditioner in the shower upside down (no)\n2. Only using gel on the ends/mids (no)\n3. Not diffusing my hair (no)\n4. Diffusing my hair (no)\n5. Deep conditioning my hair (no)\n6.

This time I saw this \"Blue light\" one was on offer on Zepto and thought to myself \"oh wow, how nice\" and decided to give this a try because I had a good experience with the original one. Huge mistake. \n\nFirst of all, nowhere on the packaging have they mentioned that this is a tinted sunscreen, I went and bought this completely unaware of this. \n\nSecond, once you apply this on your face it will give you the worst white cast you've ever seen, it might put Casper the ghost to shame, it's so hard to blend and it will take you a very long time to get it to settle down. You have to pay attention to areas like your eyebrows and the corner of your lips to make sure this is blended otherwise someone might mistake it for unblended concealer.\n\nAfter probably 20-30 minutes it will start looking somewhat normal on your face. \n\nI would not recommend this to even my worst enemy. \n \n",

I'm thinking it was a combination of diffuse thinning + stress? So anyway, I hopped on topical min for a year, I feel like it helped a little?   \n  \nUnfortunately I dropped my phone in the sea where I had most of my progress pictures month by month. But yeah, you can see what my hair looked like when I started min in August 2024. And the next picture is from August 2025. It was drastically thicker and more volume overall. But as expected, min did as much as it could and growth stopped at some level.   \n  \nI'm 30 now and always had long hair most of my life, so my goal is to have the hair I had at 25. I gave myself a buzz cut on 1st of August this year and added %0.1 topical fin, 3x / week dermastamps at 0.6mm and keto shampoo.   \n  \nRest of the pictures with short hair are from today, after being on the new regimen for 3 months. I feel like I'm experiencing great increase in volume &amp; baby hair popping up all over.   \n  \nObviously its different hair length but it's shorter, so it must show the scalp even more? \n\nI took the pictures in the same room, at the same spot and time of the day to have the same natural light.   \n  \nIs this regrowth or am I imagining it? What do you guys think? Before anyone asks, I've experienced zero sides so far. at some point in the future I could switch to pills as well. ",

Do you just wash it with shampoo and let it dry right before going? My hair is like ultra dry so that really only makes it worse usually.\n\nI've been to a couple hair salons but usually it's the same issues and my hair always comes out in much worse shape than before.\n\nMy current wash routine once a week:\n\nWet the hair thoroughly, put in shampoo and rub the scalp, wash it out, put it conditioner, wait 5-10 minutes (sort of a hair mask light honestly), comb it with a wide toothed comb while the conditioner gives it slip getting some breakage often due to knots, wash it out then wring it out a little, put in a leave in conditioner while still wet and comb it out again this time I don't get any breakage, put a tshirt on my hair but I don't tie it up or anything it's mostly just to keep my wet hair off my body while I do skincare like lotion and also my face, then I take the tshirt off and put argan oil in my hands and run them through my hair to coat it and then I let it air dry.\n\nDaily I wet my hands with water and run my fingers through my hair to wet it a little and then I do the same with argan oil to coat them again. Getting some snapping the process too.\n\nAlso my hair really sucks like it's always frizzy and dry no matter what I do, So I guess general help would be appreciated too.",

      "content": "Curious as to what our thoughts are on this as curlies. Given that dry brushing is verboten, how would we have dealt with our hair back then? And is there something we can learn from the Victorian routine that would help increase our hair health today in general? We all know that washing regularly isn't good for the hair, but it's the detangling part that needs to be done, when wet and with a ton of conditioner.\n\nDiscuss!\n\n----------------------‚Äê----------------\n\nVictorian Hair Care: Why They Washed Less‚Äîand Looked Incredible\n\nFlip through any 19th-century portrait and you‚Äôll spot it immediately: women with thick, mirror-like hair twisted into gravity-defying styles. Waves that fall just so. Shine that almost glows through sepia. The twist? Most of them weren‚Äôt washing their hair very often‚Äîsometimes not for months.\n\nThat choice wasn‚Äôt laziness. It was strategy.\n\nBack then, the soaps on hand were heavy-duty, made with lye‚Äîthe same harsh alkali used to scrub floors and clean wool. Great for grease; terrible for long hair. A single wash could strip away protective oils, leaving hair dry and fragile. For men with cropped cuts, the damage was tolerable; you could trim and start over. For women whose hair often reached the waist or beyond‚Äîand who were expected to keep it for life‚Äîrepeated washing was a recipe for breakage.\n\nSo Victorian women built a different routine.\n\nNightly brushing wasn‚Äôt a romantic myth; it was a rule. About a hundred deliberate strokes with a boar-bristle brush. That brush choice mattered: the slightly rough bristles lifted dust and flakes while sweeping natural scalp oils‚Äîsebum‚Äîdown the entire length of the hair. Instead of shampoo doing the conditioning, biology did. The result was cleaner roots, nourished ends, and a consistent, natural gloss without water or soap.\n\nThe famous volume and architecture of their hairstyles wasn‚Äôt smoke and mirrors either. They used ‚Äúrats‚Äù‚Äîsmall pads made from saved hair combings or soft fibers‚Äîto create lift and fullness. Styles were not only pretty; they were protective. Pinned up, hair was shielded from soot, smoke, weather, and friction, which helped it stay healthier longer.\n\nActual washes were occasional and intentional‚Äîmaybe monthly, sometimes less. On wash day, water had to be heated; rinses might include eggs, beer, herbs, rainwater, or vinegar to soften and add shine. Drying waist-length hair took ages and care, often by the fire or in sunlight, because wet hair is at its weakest. No wonder wash day was an event, not a routine.\n\nPeriod beauty guides treated all this like science. They detailed how to section hair, the angle of the brush, the pace of each stroke, and‚Äîcrucially‚Äîhow to keep the brush clean. In a world where a woman‚Äôs hair was rarely cut and was bound up with ideas of health, status, and respectability, hair care wasn‚Äôt vanity. It was social currency.\n\nSo they brushed. Every night. For years.\n\nIf that sounds surprisingly modern, it is. Today‚Äôs dermatologists often suggest easing up on shampoo frequency, and the ‚Äúno-poo‚Äù crowd argues that over-washing fuels oiliness by stripping the scalp. Victorians got there by observation: you can‚Äôt change the chemistry of your soap, but you can change your habits. They chose a method that worked with natural oils instead of fighting them.\n\nThe Victorian playbook in a nutshell:\n\n Fewer washes with gentler rinses.\n Consistent, thorough brushing with boar bristle to redistribute oil.\n Protective styling to reduce daily wear and environmental damage.\n Patience and ritual over quick fixes.\n\nNot dirt. Not neglect. Just a different kind of wisdom‚Äîone that trusted routine and nature to do what a bottle often can‚Äôt.\n\nTheir hair was their crown‚Äîand they learned how to keep it shining.",
