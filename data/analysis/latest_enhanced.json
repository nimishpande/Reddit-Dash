Over time, it has slowly expanded and now covers a larger part of my back and slightly towards my shoulders. It doesn’t itch and usually feels smooth, not rough or painful. Its mainly a cosmetic issue (colour/texture change).\n\nI have been to three different dermatologists and got different opinions:\n\n* One diagnosed it as lichen amyloidosis\n* Another said its chronic inflammation\n* Another said its something that can’t really be “fixed” and is cosmetic\n\nI have been using prescribed creams and moisturisers, but I am not sure if its helping much. It seems to slowly expand over time, which worries me.",

I tried diets, changing bed clothes daily, different products but nothing. I got bullied badly for it and want to start summer fresh. So I went to the doctor and they gave me epiduo.\nEpiduo is meant to help clear spots after a few months but first its meant to be really bad. I have sensitive skin and every time I use epiduo it burns pretty much. After I wash  it off I put NIVEA moisturiser on but it stings like hell. \nYes ive noticed an improvement with my spots not being as red but my cheeks turn red after applying this gel and only after 30 mins does it die down. Has anyone here used epiduo gel before and how long do I gotta go until it stops stinging? I just want my acne gone so badly as I got bullied and dont want to be bullied for the dry skin occurring or the redness on my cheeks.\nAny advice would be great. Thank you!",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

Over time, it has slowly expanded and now covers a larger part of my back and slightly towards my shoulders. It doesn’t itch and usually feels smooth, not rough or painful. Its mainly a cosmetic issue (colour/texture change).\n\nI have been to three different dermatologists and got different opinions:\n\n* One diagnosed it as lichen amyloidosis\n* Another said its chronic inflammation\n* Another said its something that can’t really be “fixed” and is cosmetic\n\nI have been using prescribed creams and moisturisers, but I am not sure if its helping much. It seems to slowly expand over time, which worries me.",

I tried a strong hold paste and i also apply sea salt spray on damp hair which didnt work so i really dont know what to do. I dont think its the haircut because i got it layered and yes its medium length so quite lengthy but i dont wanna give up on that. What should i do?

I wash my face with La Roche-Posay Hydrating Facial Cleanser morning and night and I like that. However, I’m starting to notice some fine lines and I tend to get acne scars and pigmentation on my chin since that’s where I usually break out. I’m wondering if there is something better than these products?\n\nI have combination skin. It can get flaky around my nose, my T-zone gets oily, and the rest of my face is pretty normal. My skin also leans sensitive. At one point I was using The Ordinary Glycolic Acid, and I liked the exfoliation it gave me, but sometimes it made my face burn.\n\nI know there are probably things I should start doing now so I can age more gracefully, especially because I’m a high-stress and anxiety girly but I don’t want to overdo it and give myself chemical burns.\n\nI would rather keep the routine to be simple-moderate amount of steps and keep it fragrance free and stray away from anything that involves rolling things on my face or using light therapy.",
