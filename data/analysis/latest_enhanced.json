      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "title": "The #1 hair transplant clinic red flag (and how to avoid it)",
      "content": "When you are looking for a hair transplant, you're likely deep in the trenches by looking on Reddit, forums etc. And it's very easy to make a big mistake. That one mistake can result in many problems.\n\nFor example:\n\n* a botched result that leaves you with regret\n* spending double the price of your original hair transplant to repair it\n* Too much damage to your donor area for future transplants\n\nThe biggest problem is that in order to choose a clinic/surgeon, you basically have to become an expert at it. And when you are brand new to a topic, it's easy to think you are an expert while you actually have no idea how high the mountain really is. It's not your fault, that's just the Dunning Kruger effect.\n\nAnd that's ok, I'll help you choose the right clinic because I've done it a couple times now.\n\nContext: *I've dealt with hair loss for 9 years now. From 19 to 25 it got worse and worse. Started doing combovers, wearing hats and shaving it off. I hated it. Eventually learned what I needed to stabilize my hair loss (finasteride). After being stable, I looked at local clinics and nearly chose the wrong clinic. My entire hair loss journey has cost me over $15k, so I hope this helps you avoid spending anywhere close to that much. I've also helped 300+ men navigate their hair loss journey in the last 3 years.*\n\nSo, from my time doing research into hair transplant clinics and doing over 10+ consultations, I've collected a list of red flags. Right now it's a pretty big list with over 60 red flags total, but today I wanted to talk about just one.\n\n**\"More grafts = better\"**\n\nWhen comparing clinics and asking for quotes, you'll see that the graft count can vary a lot. Even in cases that mirror your exact situation, one person will get 1500 grafts while the other may get 4000. And it's easy to think that 4000 = better.\n\nBut you don't have unlimited grafts. You actually have less than 10k available in your donor zone. And you can only use them once. So use them wisely.\n\nBut clinics know that humans think that 'bigger number = better'. So they may try to play into that. If they advertise huge hair transplant sessions (I consider anything above 3500 huge), you need to be very careful that they aren't doing it for their marketing, or to boost their bottom line.\n\nExample: Perhaps your case only needs 2000 grafts. If you multiply it by a graft price of $2 per graft, you'd spend $4000. But if another clinic advertises a graft price of $1,50, they could quote you 4000 grafts, which ends up costing you $6000.\n\nNow the 2nd clinic used extra grafts you maybe didn't even need, and you spent extra cash you could've needed for other work. Your donor area has also been depleted more, which means you have less options into the future. The donor area had also likely experienced more agressive extraction, that alone leaves you with damage. More damage = less options\n\nOr maybe you had enough donor for 3 hair transplants, but because of the bad work of the first one you can only leave it at that.\n\nSo don't blindly follow 'big number = better'. It will likely bite back.\n\nLet me know if you want the full list or have any other questions :)",

We also know that arrector pili muscles die when you are extensively bald and have major fibrosis. And then we have the issue of escaping stem cells.\n\nSo how did Pelage grow hair from bald areas when we know that progenitor cells and arrector pili muscles die. Also there's the issue of escaping stem cells.\n\n\nThe co-founder of Pelage at 24:25 is saying that the hair follicles are still there and they tested skin sample of a person who was bald for decades and had lots of growth. So now I don't know which is right which is frustrating.\n\n\n24:25 one of co-founders of Pelage talking about hair follicle stems cells on those who have advanced pattern hair loss.\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/using-metabolism-to-improve-skin-aging-and-hair-loss/id1730821144?i=1000652866815",

      "title": "What am I doing wrong?? Curls inevitably frizz.  Sometimes I look like Hagrid, but my hair feels really soft with moisture, it just wont curl . Protein makes it curl but feels awful.",
      "content": "\n\nReally long I’m sorry!!! (Since writing this I’ve realised I don’t put much thought in to the products I use. I kinda just get what is on sale supermarket or what smells nice 😭) any advice appreciated. \n\nIdk what to bc if I only use moisturising products with very little protein my hair has no definition. I look like a tumbleweed or Hagrid but my hair feels super soft and actually quite nice. And if I use products with protein in them, my hair will curl more, but, it feels really corse and rough. The top sections of my hair r the worst, it either looks like straw or I can get them to curl but they’ll still be rough looking, and the curls will become frizzy. \n\nIs it my washing routine or my styling?? Or do I need a big chop lol. My hair is about to my waist. I think I have a few curl patterns because I have layers so the longest layers are 2b? With small ringlets at the bottom and the rest of my hair is 2c/3a. I have ringlets throughout but it’s just rly frizzy and undefined atm. \n\nWash day (I don’t use all of these products at once,  I’ll use one or the other)\n\nShampoo:\n\t•Redken All Soft \n\t•Herbal Essences Chamomile\n\nConditioner/mask:\n\t•Herbal Essences Rose Conditioner for chemically treated hair\n\t•MUK 60 Second Hydrating Mask (purple tube)\n\t•Tsubaki Repair Mask (gold tub)\n\t•Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (red tube)\n\nSometimes I use a mask instead of a conditioner.  I think Redken, MUK, and the Rose conditioner seem to work best?? \n\nStyling\nI’m still figuring out this out but I usually do this, I just rotate products. \n\n1.  I squish a leave in into my hair while it’s still soaking wet.\n\t•Usually Garnier Hair Food Aloe Vera or L’Oréal Elvive Miracle Oil Leave in (mostly because it smells good lol).\n\t•The Garnier Macadamia Hair Food was way too heavy for me.\n\n2.  Sometimes I use a serum. lately the L’Oréal Glycolic Acid Leave In Serum bc it was on sale and I’m obsessed with the smell. It used to make my hair so soft but now it doesn’t do much, if anything maybe rough. \n\n3. Then I put a product with some hold through my hair before I start brush styling.\n\t•I love the Not Your Mother’s Kinky Moves Gel sm. it usually saves me from looking like a poodle, but I’ve run out and it’s not available in my country atm.\n\t•I use Paul Mitchell’s Twirl Around instead. it’s also really good, but I think the  the NYM is better (it doesn’t last as long).\n\n4. I use a large wide tooth shower comb once I got all the products in. then I flip my head upside down and comb thru to get some curl clumps. \n\n5.\tI diffuse on high heat and high airflow. I usually put the diffuser on the floor near my bed, and lay down so my head is over it and wait in my phone till I get a cast. \n\n",
