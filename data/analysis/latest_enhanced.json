Also because I am East Asian, so it's cool to see other East Asians with curly hair. \n\nHer hair inspired me to get back into do a curly hair routine, as I had gotten lazy the last few months and just couldn't be bothered. I don't think I have to put a routine since this photo isn't of me, but in any case my routine for 2C hair is flaxseed gel, bounce curl brush and diffuse. Unfortunately I don't think I could ever get my 2C hair to magically go up to type 3 hair like my inspo's hair 😪",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I have been having a big issue with frizz for quite a while and I was wondering if anyone would be able to tell me why/give me some tips on how to fix it. My curls are usually shiny and decently defined in the front and then the back is almost always not defined and frizzy. The back of my hair seems to be more coarse as well. My routine is as follows:\n\n1. Shampoo with Tresemme Shampoo (it’s not always the same type but lately I’ve been liking the Keratin Smooth one in the red bottle). I use a silicone scalp brush to make sure I get rid of as much residue as possible from my scalp\n\n2. Condition with Tresemme conditioner as well (usually either the Rich Moisture one or the Bouncy Curls one). I comb through the conditioner with a wide tooth comb and then i usually do a loose braid and let the conditioner sit for a couple minutes\n\n3. For styling, I usually like to use LUS brands step 3 All-in-One leave in but I am currently out of that so for a while now I have been using Cantù Coconut Curling Cream. I use a brush to saturate it all in my hair. I use a microfibre towel to scrunch out excess water and then I use praying hands to apply medium hold gel (most of the time it’s Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel but recently I have been trying the Olaplex number 10 gel). \n\n4. I scrunch my hair again with the microfibre towel and air dry until almost fully dry and then I diffuse until it’s completely dry. After it’s dry, I add the Argon Oil of Morocco penetrating oil, scrunching in and loosening the cast of the gel. \n\nEven after all this, I almost always end up with frizzy hair in the back. I even try to take smaller strands in the back and spray them with more water and make sure they’re totally saturated with product but nothing seems to help. I can never get even definition around my head. Any help is welcome 💔",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Not to mention I asked for a blunt straight across bob and she gave me an angled bob that gets shorter in the back and I’ve always hated that look. I showed her inspo pics and she did not follow them in the slightest. I’m literally sitting in my car crying right now. Please make me feel better and tell me it doesn’t look as bad as I think. I know this style is trendy right now but I just don’t have the face for it. Also, I love the bangs so it would be better if I could just pull the hair back and leave the bangs out, but it’s too short to pull back. And advice for getting it into a claw clip so I can just hide the haircut and leave the bangs showing? First 2 pics are the inspo pics, all the others are me ",

I’ve been breaking out daily like, every single day there’s a new pimple or some kind of irritation popping up. \n\nWhenever I visit my hometown, my skin immediately starts to calm down and heal. But the moment I’m back in Delhi, boom acne again.\n\nI’m guessing it’s the water here since it’s hard and chlorinated compared to what I’m used to, but I don’t really have the option to move right now. Has anyone else faced this? Any tips, routines, or products that helped you deal with Delhi’s water and pollution?\n\nPlease share whatever helped. ",

      "content": "Hi all, recently I’ve been paying more attention to my skincare. I’m mostly happy with the way I look, but wish that my skin looked less textured and dull and dry, and more glassy. I wear foundation, and don’t like the way the makeup sits of top of my skin, almost like it congeals on my face? I always have lines where I applied it with a brush or bright spots where the pigment collects in my pores. I think I have oily skin (but get flakey spots where pimples heal) but no matter what formulation of makeup I try (or what type of sunscreen/ primer combo I try underneath) I have the same issue. My routine is as follows: \nPM: double cleanse with garnier micellair gel (the charcoal one) and Cerave gel moussant anti- imperfections. Every two or three days I use the ordinary granactive retinoid 2% emulsion, and every night I use the Cosrx overnight rice mask. \nAM I use beauty of joseon rice and probiotics spf 50, and apply my makeup over top. \n\nThis is a very simple routine so I’m sure adding a few products could help, but I’m not sure what should go where. I use minimal products in the morning because it seems the more I use (moisturizer, primer) the worse my foundation looks, regardless of the formulation. Maybe I’m just using the wrong problems, or missing something?  I would appreciate any feedback, thank you in advance! ",

My issue is that I'll be done with washing and have soaking wet hair (I don't use any leave in product as my hair is thin and fine) and I'm just at a loss with how to \"set it\" to make it look natural. After rinsing my conditioner out it's all plastered to my skull/face. I'll try using a wide tooth comb to maintain curl clumps and get it to stop sticking to my head/give it some lift at the roots, but it always ends up being obvious which directions I combed it in, and the roots will be a little straightened out. If I try scrunching it bunches my hair into different obvious \"zones\" and exposes my scalp more. I've also tried shaking out my curls but it always looks weird and frizzy that way too. The shaking out bit might work better with gel but I struggle to get it to disperse when I scrunch because there's so little length and I end up with the \"zones\" again...\n\nI'm at a loss, any tips are super appreciated! Thank you!\n\nWash routine:\n1. Clarifying shampoo (occasionally subbed for maui shampoo)\n2. Leave in maui moisture volumizing conditioner for 5min\n3. Wash out conditioner with a little bit of maui moisture volumizing shampoo\n4. Air dry (heat is too damaging)",

      "content": "Hey guys just wanted to share the products that worked for me because I used this sub a lot in my skincare journey. I’ve also attached before and after pictures\n\nAround June of this year I damaged my skin barrier and started breaking out like crazy to the point where 2-3 pimples would pop up every day even when I used only gentle face wash. I have acne prone skin but somehow managed to keep it under control since 2022. But the damaged skin barrier triggered a lot of cystic and hormonal acne that I couldn’t control. After visiting multiple dermats and trying so many products this is the routine that finally helped me heal my acne and get rid of the scars.\n\nPrior to this I used to try products on my own. I used many products from the ordinary. Now I’m only using Indian pharmacy products that have honestly been my holy grail. I’ve gotten these products from my dermat but you can get them from any pharmacy without a prescription as well.\n\nThis is everything I’ve used and the procedures I’ve done to fix my skin:\n\nHealing skin barrier: \n\nAfter my skin barrier was damaged the first thing I was adviced to do was to stop using any products on my face. I did this for about 1.5 months until my skin stopped looking red and irritated. I only used face wash and moisturiser morning and night. \n\n* Gorgeous face cleansing gel- morning and night \n* Acne moist cream- morning and night\n\nFixing acne and marks: \n\nAfter my barrier was repaired I first did a microdermabrasion session to get rid of clogged pores and extract existing whiteheads and blackheads. This was the routine I used afterwards: \n\n* Gorgeous face cleansing gel - morning and night \n* Aziderm 10% - keep it on for 2-3 hours in the morning and wash off \n* Golite cream- every night for acne scars \n* Acne moist cream- morning and night\n* I have also done 3 rounds of microdermabrasion treatments with a month gap between each. MD really helped with unclogging pores and fading dark spots.\n\nHope this helps. I spent a lot of money and visited 3 dermats to finally figure it out. My skin isn’t perfect and I still have a few clogged pores and closed comedones but I’ve made a lot of progress! Hope this makes it easier for y’all!",
