Apply GENEROUS amounts of curling cream after every wash when still wet. Style by sectioning into small strands and detangle each separately by pulling between fingers until it runs smooth. Takes about 20 minutes. Air dry and never diffuse. Scrunch once dry.  \n\n\nMaintenance: Sleep with a bonnet. Loosely tie with a silk or fuzzy crunchy under the bonnet. Retie or style in the morning as needed with wetted hands. Trim ends every four months to keep curls healthy, hair doesn’t curl as nicely with damaged ends.  \n\n\nProducts: OGX argan oil of morocco shampoo and conditioner. Marc Anthony coconut and shea curling cream.  \n\n\nPictures taken at end of each day",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I have been having a big issue with frizz for quite a while and I was wondering if anyone would be able to tell me why/give me some tips on how to fix it. My curls are usually shiny and decently defined in the front and then the back is almost always not defined and frizzy. The back of my hair seems to be more coarse as well. My routine is as follows:\n\n1. Shampoo with Tresemme Shampoo (it’s not always the same type but lately I’ve been liking the Keratin Smooth one in the red bottle). I use a silicone scalp brush to make sure I get rid of as much residue as possible from my scalp\n\n2. Condition with Tresemme conditioner as well (usually either the Rich Moisture one or the Bouncy Curls one). I comb through the conditioner with a wide tooth comb and then i usually do a loose braid and let the conditioner sit for a couple minutes\n\n3. For styling, I usually like to use LUS brands step 3 All-in-One leave in but I am currently out of that so for a while now I have been using Cantù Coconut Curling Cream. I use a brush to saturate it all in my hair. I use a microfibre towel to scrunch out excess water and then I use praying hands to apply medium hold gel (most of the time it’s Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel but recently I have been trying the Olaplex number 10 gel). \n\n4. I scrunch my hair again with the microfibre towel and air dry until almost fully dry and then I diffuse until it’s completely dry. After it’s dry, I add the Argon Oil of Morocco penetrating oil, scrunching in and loosening the cast of the gel. \n\nEven after all this, I almost always end up with frizzy hair in the back. I even try to take smaller strands in the back and spray them with more water and make sure they’re totally saturated with product but nothing seems to help. I can never get even definition around my head. Any help is welcome 💔",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

She told me she told her teacher and her teacher said, “Tell your mom to brush your hair.”\n\nI’m devastated we are the reason this happened . I worked last night (yay night shift) so my husband and mom got her ready for school. However, we all struggle with her hair. \n\nShe has long curly hair. When wet, it’s to her waist. Dry, probably mid back. We are okay with her having it long because she lets us brush and style it. We just suck at it.\n\nThe sections around her forehead are very short and frizzy regardless of what we try. \n\nRight now this is what we do. Bath twice a week using shea moisture shampoo and conditioner. When she gets out we put in leave in shea moisture leave in conditioner and brush out with a fine tooth comb due to knots. She’s a crazy sleeper. Let air dry. We try to keep in a basis at night when she sleeps.\n\nWhen I style her hair I usually just run my fingers through her hair or I’ll take a large brush and a spray bottle and completely wet her hair. My go-to hair styles are down, high pony, half up.\n\nMy husband and mom dry brush her hair (which I ask them not to do). Their go-to hair styles are singular braids.\n\nHere are pics.\n\nI just need advice. Products. Routine. Styling. My daughter is a girly girl who likes taking her time to look nice and we are failing her.\n\nThe front facing pic is from today when she got made fun of. The apple dress picture is air dried. The red dress is slept on hair no braid.\n\nI’m sorry for yapping so much. Thank you in advance for any advice. It is so, so, so appreciated.\n\nFrom,\n\nA mom with straight hair who has been crying all afternoon",

I have never used minoxidil, so do you think its time for me to introduce it to my routine?\n\n If you’re interested in my experience with finasteride, here’s the gist of it;\n\nI got on finasteride 0.25 mg (a 1 mg pill cut into quarters) on July 30th 2024, and I stayed on that dose for about 6 months before increasing it to 0.5 mg.\n\nI stayed on 0.5 mg (half a pill), and after experiencing no negative side effects, I upped my dose to 1 mg 5-6 months later. I’ve now been on 1 mg for about 3 months after microdosing for the past year.\n\nI have definitely seen insane progress even at 0.25 mg, and for a diffuse thinner like me, the hairline baby hairs were the most noticeable (even though I was hoping for my crown to fill in more/thicken up more).\n\n\nI have never used minoxidil, but I’ve been giving it a thought for a little while now. My dermatologist was never against it but I was just not in for the hassle of applying it daily and a pill was just easier and more convenient I guess.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(no cleanser in AM and no sunscreen in PM)\n\nsenka double wash foam cleaner \nrice toner\nvitamin c serum \nhadolabo shirojyun brightening gel moisturizer \nskin aqua UV moisture gel 35 spf\n\nnow i’ll be honest, this sunscreen isn’t good. but it’s one that didn’t make my breakouts or texture worse. it has a high alcohol content which i think is pretty problematic, but i react to the high quality chemical sunscreens that i previously mentioned and also to mineral sunscreen. \n\ni also wear haus labs foundation a few days of the week. (contains fatty acids)\n\ni’ve researched a bit and found that fatty alcohol sensitivity is something that can cause extremely stubborn CC like mine. apparently my foundation does contain them, but my current moisturizer and sunscreen do not. the previous sunscreens i’ve tried do. \n\nmy current routine is lacking in exfoliants because my skin barrier tends to be so reactive, but trust that i’ve tried soooo many of the typical methods. if it was fungal, nizoral. different intervals and amounts of chemical exfoliants like AHAs and BHAs. i think these methods do work for clearing it up but my root cause is continuous. \n\nTL:DR my skin is riddled w closed comedones and texture, nothing seems to help so im trying to find the root cause. could it be fatty acids? some ingredient common in korean chemical sunscreens? lmk!\n\ni’m hoping for advice on what it could be (though i know you can truly only find out with trial and error) as well as product recommendations!",

Halfway through my shower after washing my face, my face began burning/stinging all of a sudden. I got out of the shower and put on some moisturizer. But it’s just been feeling this way since. \n\nAny idea what could be going on?? I washed my face with my shampoo and scrubbed pretty hard to get my makeup off, which I know isn’t great, but I’ve been doing that my whole life (or I would use whatever body wash was in the shower) and it’s been fine. I also derma-planed my face last night, so I wonder if that’s a factor. Another theory I had is maybe I’m having some type of allergy reaction to my cat?? But the burning was just so sudden and right after I washed my face so idk. Plus parts of my face are burning (pretty much my whole face) that didn’t even touch her, and other parts of my body that did make contact with her are fine. It also feels like my lips are numb but I’m not sure if they are or if it’s just in my head and I’m freaking out. :(\n\nThat being said, I don’t have any weird swelling, redness, or anything. My skin looks great but it just feels like it’s on fire. Help?",

I oil my hair one night before shampoo. I cannot use oil all day as it makes my hair very heavy and difficult to manage.

Every time it’s gotten to be pretty good my skin dries up and I can’t move my face. When I change my routine to fix that, the acne gets a lot worse. Right now I’m at a point where dryness isn’t great AND acne is on the worse end. It just feels hopeless and I’m frustrated. Atp I’m willing to try whatever crazy stuff that worked for yall (besides accutane, I can NOT have any more hair thinning 😭). Any recommendations beyond just going to a derm? I’ve been with one for probably 2 years now and it just hasn’t gotten me to a great point.\n\nI’m sorry for this being a little bit of a vent.",
