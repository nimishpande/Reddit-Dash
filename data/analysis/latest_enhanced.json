      "title": "tret failed me but taz saved my skin",
      "content": "hey guys! i’m from sri lanka 🇱🇰 and 2024 September I discovered a 3rd-party seller who brings indian skincare here… and yeah, my skin AND bank account have not recovered since lol\n\nbefore that, i suddenly started getting major breakouts (pic 1). this was super frustrating because i had clear skin my entire life. so like many people here, i decided to self-prescribe 🙃\n\ni started tret 0.025% (cream only available here) and imported:\n\n* simple moisturiser cream\n* plum niacinamide toner\n* dot &amp; key sunscreen\n* TO niacinamide 10%\n\nfollowed this routine for 7-8 months with absolutely no improvement. tret irritated my skin SO badly but i kept telling myself to “trust the process” 😭  \n*(pics 2–3 are from this phase)*\n\neventually i gave up and saw a derm(in 2025 May). i was prescribed:\n\n* deriva-c gel (adapalene + clindamycin) – pm\n* aknix face wash\n* clindamycin gel – am\n* azithromycin 500 mg (3x/week)\n\ni swapped the face wash for minimalist SA cleanser because aknix was crazy expensive (\\~₹2400). this routine helped calm down my inflamed, angry acne (pic 4/5), but i was left with a face FULL of closed comedones and Acne marks.\n\nhonestly? i was just relieved. i accepted the bumpy texture because it was WAY better than the war zone i had before💀. so I sticked to that routine for about 5 months.\n\nthen i came across a post here about tazarotene and decided to give it a shot. amazon india only had 0.1%, so i went all in. I started taz in late October.\n\nand listen… this stuff is MAGICAL.  \ndespite being the *strongest retinoid* i’ve ever used, it has never irritated my skin. no burning, no peeling, nothing. within 1.5 months, i had the smoothest skin of my life. i still can’t believe how gentle yet effective it is for me.\n\ncurrent routine:\n\nam:\n\n* Minimalist SA cleanser\n* isntree green tea fresh toner\n* cosrx snail mucin\n* aquasoft ac moisturiser\n* Picspot gel\n* sundrink sunscreen\n\npm:\n\n* garnier micellar water\n* joy pH 5.5 face wash\n\ntaz days (mon/tue/wed/fri/sun):\n\n* aestura lotion *or* minimalist b12 cream\n* taz\n\nthursday (barrier day):\n\n* aestura lotion\n* b4 nappi cream\n\nsaturday:\n\n* formularx lactic acid\n* aquasoft ac\n\ntaz literally did what tret never could for me. if you’re struggling with closed comedones, texture, or tret intolerance, this might be worth looking into.",

I shower at night, so my hair doesn't have to dry in the morning. I make sure my leggings and yoga pants are ALWAYS the first thing washed, so I can just jump into those and a sweatshirt. \n\nHowever, I am very aware that most of the time I look very low effort. My hair will look a little bumpy/off due to sleeping on it half wet. When I want to look cute for a night out at the bar, I realize I look like I didn't have clean clothes ready so I had to opt for leggings/a hoodie. I look in the mirror and just don't feel good. \n\nI know I am a good looking woman, and I have the ability to dress cute, style myself well, etc etc. But I just.. don't have the drive to. \n\n*Examples of things I am TRYING to do to feel a little better that doesn't require me doing something 24/7 (if that makes sense):*  \nI recently lost 20 pounds (160 to 140) and am working to lose 10 more. I'm starting to buy clothing again that I wore in my 20's. (However, I get excited shopping, but NOT excited when it comes to wearing it, so I opt for frumpy/comfy/baggy) \n\nI am ordering a lash lift/tint kit because my eyelashes are gorgeous with mascara, but almost non-existent without, so eyes usually look small and disappear into my face without mascara (which I don't always want to wear). \n\nI bought a blowout brush/dryer so that I can dry my hair into a more styled look before sleeping on it. \n\nI hope I was able to express myself okay in this post. I've seen tiktok ideas where people say something along the lines of \"things I do to remain low maintenance\" or whatever and that's kind of what I am looking for.\n\n",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Not only did I absolutely over wash it (I mean I would refresh it EVERY day for school), I also box dyed it twice and straightened it around 4 times last year 😭😭 rn it’s absolutely dead but I’m very lost on how to get my hair healthy again😢 my mom is kinda anti-curly hair so I get no support from her and I also can’t afford to see a professional or get any sort of curly hair treatment at the moment. \n\nas you can see in the pictures, I do have some layers which give me volume and shape i like in my hair, the problem is my hair is very thin and spaced out ish..? also I noticed my curls have NO bounce at all like genuinely they are stiff and dry no matter how much product they hold. the back of my head also is the main problem, as seen in the second pic it’s a HOT mess…🫩(third pic is the best reference I found of how juicier my ringlets were before last year)\n\n  \n!! for my routine I use marc anthony coconut and shea shampoo + conditioner, then on wet hair I rake in marc anthony strictly curls cream. After that I section my hair and brush style with the bounce curl brush. When I’m done with that I use not your mother’s gel and finally marc Anthony strictly curls mousse. I usually air dry my hair but I did diffuse it in the routine for these pics !!\n\nIs there anything I can do at all??🤧",

I’m hoping that y’all can give some at-home budget-friendly recommendations for treatment. I just bought a Clotrimazole cream this morning and have it on right now to see if it helps at all.\n\nHere’s a list of reasons I suspect it to be fungal:\n\n- It started at the edge of my hairline, then my eyebrows, and has stayed mostly in that area.\n\n- The bumps are very small, with maybe only 2-3 of them being whiteheads, and stay in clusters.\n\n- My antibacterial regiment has made it worse. I did not notice at first, but it’s been about two weeks and my entire forehead is now completely broken out.\n\nHowever, there seems to be no itch that I’ve noticed, but I’ve read that it’s not always present?\n\nThank you!",

It does this by CYP17A1 inhibition (enzyme which is necessary for testosterone production) and AR (androgenic receptor) antagonism.\n\n400 mg/day\n\nIt will reduce T levels by 40-60%\n\nCombine it with 5AR inhibitor - and you will get a strong synergy, basically no DHT and significantly lower T\n\nThe risks are VERY REAL:\n\n1. hepatotoxicity - 1 of 500 patients developed acute liver injury. source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231140/https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm362415.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231140/https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm362415.htm)\n2. Adrenal insufficiency. Ketoconazole inhibits 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase functions of CYP17A1 enzyme. 17,20-lyase activity is needed to create testosterone, while 17α-hydroxylase is needed to create glucocorticoids (most importantly cortisol). This causes many problems, like symptoms similar to Addison's disease.\n\n\n\nMy thoughts about hepatotoxicity: first you need to monitor transaminase levels in blood. Second, maybe NAC will help? \n\nSo, thoughts on this? Any brave souls who tried it?",

AND NOT ONCE I QUESTIONED MY \"ROUTINES\". \n\nthe desperate phase: i tried everything wasting money time and mental peace. my BF lives in US i visit him sometimes and even bought products and serums not available in India just to fix my skin. nothing helped. i even went to docs and did two courses of tretonin (helped for few months but problems recurred) i have lived in north and south india switching jobs and no amount of \"environment change\" fixed my skin suffered for 4 straight years. \n\nthen i just stopped and thats why i am sharing this may be it will help someone. i just stopped all products. i started reading more about skin barrier and how serums exfoliate and over exfoliation destroys skin barrier. i just stopped everything and only started applying basic moisturiser but with extreme dedication applied sunscreen. \n\ni invested in good sunscreens. i had never applied sunscreens so much. always found them greasy would apply only when i am going to office. and never reapplied after few hours even when i am out in blazing sun. but then i started ordering sunscreens korean and others wasted money used the ones i didnt like on my body but finally landed on a a good one. \n\nand man oh man did it work. i religiously apply the sunscreen twice in a day, use most basic moisturiser and use most gentle face wash. its only been 2 months but my skin is so much clearer my marks r fading i am having less and less of acne (barely any) i can feel the hydration returning to my face. and i am so happy. \n\nskin care companies just bombard us with their products thanks to unregulated social media giving us \"advice\" how to live our own lives and cloud our own judgement and intution. skin care routine type content is a cult. we dont need much at all. i completely destroyed my god given healthy skin. \n\ni never post on reddit but i understand the feeling of seeing new pimples and having lots on ur face and the stress of nothing working. i hope someone reads this and it helps someone. \n\nPS since Reddit sells its content to AI companies now i can help train the AI models to stop prescribing acids after acids and just prescribe basic skin hygiene and care routines lol",
