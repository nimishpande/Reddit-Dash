She doesn’t understand curly hair at ALL but she’s constantly making comments about my appearance. My hair being a point of contention whenever I visit.\n\nSo I was recently with family for my sisters graduation. While we’re waiting, a woman a few rows below us goes to sit down. My moms pokes me, leans over and says “wow! She has beautiful hair!” I stare at this woman’s hair (which is beautiful) and see all of the flaws my mom points out for my hair: dusts of halo frizz, wayward curls, etc… nothing wrong with it, but things people like my mother shame me over. Her hair type is JUST like mine, but her hair goes down mid back rather than my shoulder length. I say “Seriously? My hair is just like that and you insult it all the time!” She goes quiet for a moment, thinking, and then says “well, idk. It’s longer and it looks better on her.”\n\nJust can’t win.\n\nRoutine, since I still need to put one down I guess? Shampoo and conditioner is whatever, denman brush for styling, Aluram curl cream and air drying for finish.",

In Feb 2025 I added oral min alongside the current medications. \n\nI decided to stop the topical usage of minoxidil and stick with only oral, hoping the switch would be fine. I made the transition gradually too, over the course of a few months.\n\nSadly to say, I’ve been shedding for over half a year nonstop and have lost all my hair. I keep losing hair every day. I know people say to give it time, but this 6+month shed hasn’t slowed down one bit, and I haven’t seen any crazy regrowth with oral min. I’ve literally had sheds and recovered from them in the amount of time I’m shedding right now.\n\nI’ve since started using topical minoxidil again, alongside both oral fin and min pills. \n\nAny comments or recommendations will be greatly appreciated, I’m basically starting over again. I’ll be using topical AND oral min, with oral fin.\n\n5% topical min, 0.5 oral fin, 2.5 oral min. Dosages have remained the same throughout the entire journey. Hopefully I can make another comeback.\n\nIn hindsight dropping topical minoxidil was definitely a dumb move, as I had great hair last summer. I only wanted to stop it because pills were easier. ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I do struggle a lot with blackheads, so I would love some recommendations for that issue!\n\nHowever, my skin has suddenly started breaking out and it's making me feel so down and insecure. The photos don't show much and the big spots have dried out but I have little bumps and also bigger spots. I have started going to the sauna at my gym for the last two weeks, not every day tho l've been about 4 times so far. And I know that when my boyf started the sauna his skin broke out but then settled as he went consistently. I do think it's a mix of the sauna and possible an early twenties hormonal change, but does anyone have any advice to help with my skin?\n\nThank you!!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

In the meantime I always took care of it, tried products that would help me mantain it, but I didn't bother styling it. \nThis year I want to wear my hair down. I started the styling process but I noticed that my hair is much staighter at the top of my head than the end of my hair. I have a layered cut so in theory it should curl.\nI'm wondering if the years of bun mania might have ruined the curl pattern at the top of my hair. Does anyone else have any experience with this? Do you have any suggestions about fixing this issue?\n\nMy routine:\n- Brush before shower (I know it's not recommended, but brushing during shower made my hair worse imo)\n- Shampoo and conditioner: Amway's, for normal hair\n- Brush my hair again, after the first detangling, while it's wet\n- Section my hair and apply a light hold gel, I do not have the name for the brand unfortunately\n- Flip over my head and apply a foam from the same unknown brand\n- Dry it with semi warm setting\n\nMy curls most of the time look defined\n",

It looks fine for about a month but my hair grows so fast that my roots end up looking flat again, I find myself having to trim at home but there is only so much I can cut off. My hairstylist trims/reshapes every four months. I've tried root clips and foams, but neither give me a consistent or lasting lift. Root clips actually will slip out of my head when styling sometimes. \n\n\ncurrent routine for guidelines:\n\n1. clarify once every 3-5 days with ouai detox shampoo. apply leave-in conditioner as needed afterwards. \n\n2. Detangle, then define curls while wet. Seperate clumps.\n\n3. Microflop until damp, then apply mousse/foam (I alternate between NYM Curl Talk, Herbal Essence's Mousse, and Innersense I Create Lift)\n\n4. Diffuse upside down (kinda wanna stop doing this, it's hurting my back), incorporate root clips once 50% dry. Add a tiny bit of foam at the lengths for extra grit. \n\n5. Finish off with hair spray. \n\n⁠",

I'm envisioning an app that has a scanning option where you can scan you face for example and have any concerns identified ie. specific pimples, specific patches of hyperpigmentation, eczema etc. If anything is out of the ordinary, you will be ref'd to a dermatologist immediately; it could potentially even help with early serious skincare detections. It would then give you tailored treatments / how to apply them to treat those specific breakouts and accelerate your healing timeline. All of your scans are tracked and you can see pasts scans and get advice on what products, diet, lifestyle factors may be affecting your skin. You can also create a custom skincare budget and have products recommended to you that fit that budget. You can buy products directly through the app (maybe a discount?) and can also scan your existing products to see what works for you, how to use them and if anything is hazardous. There would also be a specialized ChatGPT for skincare in the app that you can ask any questions about your skin / general skincare. \n\nIt would be free to use with maybe a premium tier? Or completely free with monetization from in-app product purchases.\n\nWould you use it? Got any ideas? If I build an app like this, I wouldn’t want to do it without the input of the community.",

Then a little less raised and red for the rest of week one. \n\nNow its getting better. Its not raised but is still pinkish. \n\nWill it get better? I want to know what to apply to help it heal/ not scar. \n\n\nMy current plan is my regular skin care and then I apply diffirin gel over my nose and especially on the pimple area. Will this help? \n\n\nPlz share ur advice. ",

(pic2)\n\nNot sure what's up, as the pictures suggest, it looks like a weird divide between the top half of my hair and the bottom half. I can also never seem to get both sides to have good looking waves, as the left side (pic 3, shows more of the back too) looks way better than my right side (pic1).\n\nI have high porosity hair, and it's often very dry past wash day. I do have professionally bleached/dyed hair, however I've had the same issues with my texture and dryness before bleaching it.\n\n\nHere's my routine (pic 1-3):\n- Shampoo twice with \"Imel Ruby Rings Shampoo for Curly Hair\"\n- Apply \"For the Love of Curls\" moisturising conditioner for 2 minutes across all my hair ( just barely not touching my roots ). Detangle with a medium sized tooth comb then wash it out. I have tried the squish to condish method in the past ( which leaves most of the conditioner in my hair ) but it did not make a difference honestly.\n\nThen while my hair is still wet:\n- Apply a good amount of Taft Curl Mousse everywhere.\n- And finally I scrunch in a pea sized amount of Taft Maxx Power Styling gel around my hair.\n\nPic 4 is when I only used a generous amount of Taft Maxx Power Styling gel on wet hair for reference…Without any conditioner though, as I only used the shampoo I mentioned earlier. it looked better than usual when initially diffused, but lacked any definition or any sort of longevity past 2 hours.\n\nI diffuse and that's it. Have no refresh routine ( which sucks, aside from wash day I brush out my hair to get more volume, and usually it's still moisturised so some curls form at the bottom ).\n\nHonestly just looking for a way to get consistent longevity and definition, maybe volume too if you guys have a way of it not being frizzy and not becoming flat immediately. Thank you in advance!!",

      "title": "[Routine help] Is this a terrible routine? (main skincare goal: acne reduction)",
      "content": "32/M/ambiguous skin type (maybe combo?) with chronic acne. Parts of my skin are prone to developing huge, inflamed bumps (they can sometimes get so big that I think they qualify as abscesses, not cysts). On my face, they commonly form (sometimes in clusters) right above my eyebrows, in the space above my temples between my eyes and my hairline, and on my jawline and earlobes (but my beard usually covers these). My main skincare goal right now is preventing these from forming in the first place, and making them go away faster when they do form. Secondarily, I want to reduce inflammatory redness, both on and around the big lesions, and the persistent red, scaly bumpiness and occasional whiteheads on my nose. I also want to reduce the visibility of red hyperpigmentation from past acne, but that's more of a longterm goal.\n\nI've thrown many products and meds (both OTC and prescription, including a stint with accutane as a teenager, and years of daily oral doxycycline) at my acne over the years, but I have never been organized enough to develop a solid, well-planned routine. My current prescriptions are daily oral doxycycline monohydrate, and clindamycin phosphate lotion. I have disabling mental health issues, so a routine that is easy to stick to is key. It's hard for me to use the sink without making a mess, plus every clean towel I have to use to dry my face is extra laundry to do. So my preference is for no-rinse options. Is there anything glaringly, obviously wrong with what I have planned right now? (As in, do any of these steps totally cancel each other out, or risk making my acne worse)\n\nHere's the basic routine I have in mind:\n\n\\-In the morning, wipe off dried benzoyl peroxide from the night before. Then cleanse with micellar water on cotton pads. Don't rinse off with water, but wipe off residue with some kind of wet wipe (I'm leaning towards something with HOCL, like Base Laboratories wipes. I've never tried HOCL before). After the HOCL dries, apply clindamycin lotion.\n\n\\-Wipe face with HOCL wipe and apply clindamycin again sometime during the day\n\n\\-At night but not right before bed, cleanse with micellar water and HOCL wipe again\n\n\\-Before bed, apply benzoyl peroxide\n\nAnd again, keep in mind I will be taking a daily oral antibiotic (doxycycline) alongside everything, if that makes any difference.\n\nI don't have any dedicated moisturizer in mind right now (the clindamycin lotion is kind of moisturizing). I'm not too worried about dryness or irritation right now. I'd rather start with something that gets the acne under control, even if excessive, and gradually experiment with reducing it for the sake of moisture or comfort, than the other way around.",
