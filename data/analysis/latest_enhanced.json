      "content": "I’m focusing on getting my curls healthy and bouncy after years of using damaging h.eat and heavy protein products, I’m finally finding what works for my hair type. \n\nIn the past I’ve been using h.eat on it ever since I was a kid to go to church or parties, without any protection oil ( the 90s), just damping h.eat from the h0t cur/ing ir0n. I got my first chemica/ re/axer at 12, which burned my scalp and caused a painful swirl of scabs and hair which was too painful to pull or comb. The things I’v done with my hair through the decades… But today a new day, a healthy way forward!\n\nIn 2024, I stopped using high h.eat, completely avoiding f/at ir0ns, and also quit co/oring my hair. At first, it made my hair look kinda worse, but thanks to these Reddit subs like this I think I’ve figured out part of the problem and the solution. Turns out I was overloading my curls with protein, and that just doesn’t work for my hair type anymore. Still figuring it all out, but I feel like I’m finally on the right track.\n\nWhen I used to si/k press my hair, I think it needed that superficial glow to look healthy, but wasn't, so I ended up using heavy coatings and lots of protein-based products. Now that I’ve stopped and don’t damp it in or anythin, the products just seem to sit on top of my hair instead of absorbing. I don’t really know the science behind it, but that’s what it feels like and look like.\n\nSo after a big clarifying wash this summer and switched products to light or none protein based product. I started washing with apple cider vinegar, only 1 time, I used way too much, because my hair looked scary dry. But I kept on using the new products and it’s already improved in just a couple of months and it feels like it is getting better with every wash.\n\nThe photos serie starts with my Day 7 hair  from last week, I was out and about, windy, traveling etc.\nSo when I got home I washed my hair when and kept my conditioner in overnight, too tired to style it. \n\nI documented the process, with a before &amp; after.\n\nI’m very much open to tips and advices!\n\n\n\n\n*Hair Routine + products in the photos \n\nProducts in order of use\n\nOnce a month Clarifying:\nGiovanni 50:50 Balanced hydrating clarifying shampoo.\nCurlsmith Mask Double Cream Deep quencher.\nRegular washing: 1 or 2 times a week\nKerastase Shampoo Curl Manifesto.\nKerastase Conditioner Curl Manifesto.\n\nStyling:\nGiovanni Curl defining Leave-in Curl Habit.\nGiovanni Curl shaping Gel Curl Habit.\nCurlsmith Frizz Rescue Curl Retainer.\nUmberto Giannini Boost Mousse Rosemary.\nMixed Chicks H.eat and Humidity protection serum.\n\nTools:\n-The Bounce curl brush  \n-Blow dryer diffuser with low h.eat and cold settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

No matter what routine I’ve tried, I can’t wake up without a mess and have to brush it out. Then completely have to get it wet all over again. It also is always SOO tangly too, to the point I have to just brush or I would be combing tangles out for over five minutes. When I treat it like “straight” hair without products I can easily brush through without force. For this wash day it was Davines OI Shampoo/Butter mask, then after on soaking wet hair I scrunched in JVN Air dry cream and let completely air dry before scrunching the crunch out. Some other routines I have tried were the same shampoo/butter mask instead of the air dry cream I will either use Herbal Essences curl mousse or Not Your Mothers gel or La Looks blue sports gel. I’ve also tried the same routine but diffuse with my Dyson and get the same results. I clarify regularly with either Suave clarifying shampoo or davines Solu shampoo. And I will sleep with a pineapple in a bonnet. I am not sure if my shampoo/conditioner is too heavy? But when I wear my hair “straight” aka just brushing it and using just leave in conditioner it won’t get oily fast or seem weighed down. ",

No more that dry, squeaky feeling after washing. My skin actually feels normallll? Like I don't have to rush to slap on moisturizer immediately. \n\nApparently, these newer barrier -safe cleansers use things like ceramides, hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and other fancy humectants that keep your microbiome balanced (and I didn't even know we had one till last week).\n\nStill testing a few- Simple, Ponds, CeraVe, and this newer one that claims to have \"Vera-hyamino\" something. \n\nAnyone else switched to gentler facewashes lately??",

      "content": "I've struggled with acne on my chin for around 20 years. I've found looking after my skin barrier has been the key to keeping on top of it (esp after being misdiagnosed with PD).\n\nTo set the scene..\nI stopped washing my face in the shower or deliberately letting hot water run over or relax my face many years ago, which massively helped. I wash my face at (not in) the bathroom sink with cold-lukewarm water. I also don't use a towel and go straight onto skincare after rinsing.\nThrough clarifying shampoo and more thoroughly rinising my fine hair, I wash my hair every 3-4 days, or 2 if I have somewhere to be.\n\nNow...\nI had surgery last Thursday on my neck and as a result, I can't wash my hair for atleast a week. I've had to have very quick showers/stretch them out to avoid steaming or getting my dressing wet.\n\nMy hair looks like a frying pan post a big fry up but, my chin acne has completely cleared up! It hasn't felt so smooth and calm in a long time.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?\nIt probably seems simple but, is it down to no steam, no rise in skin temp due to no contact with hot water at all or hair products (even though I wash my hair facing away from the shower, so next to no product gets on my face, only back).\nI live in an area with soft to moderate hard water area if this helps answer any water questions.\n\nAny tips on how to maintain this, that doesn't involve skipping lots of hair washes?",

      "content": "I’ll be turning 20 in two months, and I’m around Norwood 1–1.5. My ferritin levels were low (33), and while I do have some AGA, most of my shedding seemed to be telogen effluvium. My doctor said 1.25 mg oral minoxidil would be enough, but I started with 2.5 mg. It’s been 5 days now, and I’ve also switched to an iron-rich diet.\n\nI’m honestly super stressed about my hair loss — I know it’s making things worse, but I can’t help it. My dad was around Norwood 3 at my age, though my grandfathers and uncles all still have hair. Only my dad and his brother went bald.\n\nAnyway, here’s my question: since I’m still young and not sure if I’ve fully matured hormonally, I decided to start with oral minoxidil first. My plan is to maintain for at least 1–2 years, then add finasteride later.\n\nBut I’ve seen some people on this forum say that after adding finasteride to their minoxidil routine, they lost all the gains they made and their hair actually got worse. Has anyone experienced this? If I start finasteride 1–2 years later, will my hair really get worse?\n\nI’m 19 and just want to wait a bit before jumping into finasteride.\nThanks a lot for reading 🙏\n",

My University was located in a damp, coastal region, so natural moisture wasn't a luxury there. That's also when I first found out I can grow wavy hair (bam!) and even curls after a certain length (double bam!).\n\nFast forward to now it's been one year since I moved back home (dry and dusty, arid desert climate) and I've witnessed much deterioration in my hair quality, feel and texture despite better, softer water supply. Which has also discouraged me to grow my hair beyond 6 months at a time. \n\nFor reference \nPics 1,2 &amp; 3: my hair from the time I was still studying for bachelor's, with minimal care (because a late teen living in hostel who barely knows about grooming, with lectures 6 days a week)\n\nPics 4&amp;5: my hair from the past month with a basic hair routine (rn I shampoo and use a leave-in conditioner on alternate days(due to excessive dust and heat around the city), sometimes use a normal conditioner-cum-heat repellent with the shampoo and occasionally use coconut or olive oil (once between 2-3 weeks))  \n\nBetween the years from then to now, I think I also let myself go and became somewhat indifferent to hair care, so that must've been another contributing factor to the damage.\nThis time thinking I'll grow them longer, went for a little trim yesterday, and I might be overthinking, but I think I got botched (will likely make a second post on that).\nAnyway, I'm finally turning to this community for advice to overcome the effect of an extreme change in climate and my own negligence. Thank you already if you've read so far!\n \nPS: I'd be grateful if someone can also tell me what my hair might be, I'm always stumped by that question for some reason. I've definitely got coarse, thick hair that become a dust catcher the moment I step out lol.",

      "content": "Hi everyone! ✨\n\nAs the title says - I have (too many) premature fine lines around my eyes. I think I’ve had these as long as I can remember (I’m 25 now). Even at 19/20, I remember having them but with time, this has grown into an insecurity. As a girlie who loves getting ready and wearing make-up, things tend to get worse due to creasing.\n\nI don’t know the reason behind it but I have some speculations. A little background - I’ve been wearing glasses since I was 4, so my eyesight + squinting due to sensitive eyes could be a reason. Second, I rub my eyes a lot - I know I shouldn’t but sometimes, I just can’t help myself/do it absentmindedly. Third, my mom has these fine lines on her eyelids, which is also something I haven’t noticed in most people. So it could be a mix of genetic + lifestyle factors. I drink a lot of water these days so I’m not sure if it’s dehydration.\n\nOverall, these lines are quite prominent, even without any makeup. And my only fear is that they will get worse with age. \n\nI did go to a dermatologist for this and they did give me an eye cream but that did not do anything. Any suggestions? Skincare reccs that might help? 🥺👉🏽👈🏽\n",

I have been plucking the dark ones for years now with no issues, but about a year ago almost all of them started growing back as ingrowns.\n\nI have tried to just let them grow out to the surface, but one time a hair just REFUSED to come to the surface, and I developed a big bump and what I think was an infection around the area, so I ended up buying Tend Skin based on recommendations from Reddit, and used it on the area for about a week until the hair came close enough to the surface and, with a needle and tweezers, pulled out what must've been like a 2 inch hair (🤢🤢🤢), and the scar from the infection didn't go away for like 8 months so now I'm kind of too mentally scarred to just leave the ingrown hairs alone.\n\nEver since then, that has been my routine dealing with these ingrowns – gently pull the end of the hair to the surface with a tiny needle, pull it out with tweezers, use Tend Skin, then moisturize with an unscented, hypoallergenic lotion. I don't wear bras or tight clothing. But no matter what I do the hairs just keep ingrowing and I am growing more and more frustrated and it's honestly been affecting my confidence.\n\nI'm looking for suggestions, whether it's a product or something else (also, should I be concerned about any hormonal issues? I'm unsure if this amount of hair growth around my nipples is normal or if my hormones are out of whack.)\n",

      "content": "Hello everyone! As the title says i would love to get your thoughts on what foundation I should get from Sephora. (I don’t have sephora or anything high end where I live but im going to Greece next week, so I want to get one)..\n\nFor reference, for everyday use I use my Catrice True Skin Hydrating Foundation for everyday and it is one of my favorites and matches my skin tone perfectly (030 natural sand). I have some acne scars and sensitive acne prone skin, but mostly (knock on wood) it has gotten calmer and better over the past year or two, and now im working on resolving the last bit of acne left with my derm. That’s my little side rant sorry.\n\nBack to the point. For bigger events, last year i bought the Estée Lauder double wear foundation in 1W2 Sand. I love it. It is even more of a better match than the catrice one. However I find that it separates at the end of the night for me very often. Maybe because of my skin type. I have normal skin with it getting oily in my t zone sometimes. But mostly normal combo skin if that makes sense.\n\nSo I guess my question is. I want to get a foundation for big events that wouldn’t break me out (honestly i haven’t noticed any foundation breaking me out but i figured id mention that anyway), that is long wearing, not too heavy on the skin, but still gives full coverage and doesn’t separate or get cakey or patchy or separate on me over the night. I want to use it for special occasions like birthdays, weddings, work events etc because I love doing my own makeup. And I wouldn’t change my Estée Lauder if it didn’t separate on me but idk what to do. What do you guys recommend?\n\nI see very mixed reviews about the House labs foundation, and I have always wanted the one NARS foundation that the OG beauty gurus used back in the day.\n\nI would really appreciate if you would give me your holy grail full coverage, acne safe, beautiful and lasting foundation recommendations! Thank u so much in advance ❤️ I hope this wasn’t too long ago, sorry.. i only got one shot so i figured I would ask here",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
