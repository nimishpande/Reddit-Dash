The curls went a little flat. Usually when I practiced this style I didn’t let it sit for ~an hour between drying and styling. But I’m fairly happy with how it turned out. So frazzled that morning so I’m glad i practiced so much before!\n\n",

Some times it’s looking incredible and hydrated and soft (for me, which still has never been as soft or hydrated as I’ve liked), other times it’s dry and crunchy mess. \n\nI used to wash every 3 days but due to a sensitive scalp with buildup and dry/flakiness, my stylist recommended I wash every other day. Currently I am using my custom Prose set for shampoo and conditioner. About 2x a month I use my Prose pre conditioner treatment. I also use Aunt Jackie’s Quench leave in conditioner on wash days. I air dry, always. \n\nI know my shampoo and conditioner are probably the biggest causes of my dissatisfaction with my hair, but honestly I would love to start over with a whole new routine from scratch. \n\nI am considering using OrganiGrowHairCo gold bundle for low porosity. I used it back in college (platinum bundle) and it really helped moisturize my hair, but always left it a bit greasy. Any other suggestions out there?",

If you were my hairdresser how would you cut it and how much would you say should be cut? I wanna keep it long and growing out. But there’s also a lot of it so I get that. Would u charge extra for excess hair and how long would it take and how would u accommodate me? I have severe allergies as said in another post and I sneeze a ton in salon because all the chemicals flying around and hair with pollen particles triggers a massive rapid sneezing attack. I’d wear a mask but would u be ok with providing extra tissue and breaks?\n\nRoutine is to wash it weekly-every 10 days with Garnier products and detangle in the shower with the conditioner in it with a wet brush. Then scrunch in Garnier gel with the hair sopping wet and then scrunch the crunchiness out. Thanks!",
