She has helped me some but im wondering now if im leaving my coconut oil in to long.\n\nRoutine\nOkay so now before I go to bed I put jojoba oil on my scalp and massage it in. Then I put coconut oil in my hair and I put my hair up in a bonnet then go to sleep.\n\nI do this every night and now wash then wait 2 days before washing again. So the oil is building up every day. Is this bad? Should I not do this as often?\n\nMy fear is if I dont do it though my hair will not look good in the morning or I will have to wash it out, and im trying to avoid washing my hair everyday. \n\n",

I try to wash it once or twice a week so I can reduce the amount of heat I put on it. It’s still extremely damaged however &amp; I’m very insecure about it. I just hate that even when I straighten it, you can still tell I have curly hair because of the way it looks. I also can never seem to figure out how to part my hair &amp; I never like it. I started getting highlights when I was 14 &amp; would get them twiceish a year. I did this until last November — at which time I switched to just bleaching the whole head. I know I know, the bleach is not helping the damage. Basically my question is — I’m getting my hair done tomorrow, &amp; I’m wondering what I should get done. Pics 1-6 are with the bleach. 7-9 I was only getting highlights. And the last pic is my hair right now with my roots grown out. What color do you guys think would suit me best? Should I keep bleaching? Go back to my natural color? I need a hairstylist’s advice — what exactly should I ask for in your opinion that best flatters my facial features. I also would love advice on hair care, styling, etc. I currently use a hair dryer brush to “blowout” my hair while it’s 30% wet and then either wear it like that or then use a curling iron on it after.

However when I put my head upside down it looks really nice! \n\nI had curly hair when I was a child but when growing up, I used to bleach my hair and cut them really short so there was absolutely no curl pattern. \nI’m in the process of growing my hair long and they always looked curly-ish while wet so I wanted to try this new routine.\n\nWhat do you think? \nShould I keep doing this routine or my hair pattern isn’t worth it? \nAlso why does it look fabulous upside down but terrible in a normal position?

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

My skin feels super dry and its even flaking and peeling on my T zone, but at the same time its super oily on the same T zone, while my cheeks feels normal. The skin on my forehead and especially my nose is always peeling and flaking, and always feels tight from dryness; but theres also extra oil on the same area, they re always super shiny and oily. If i use moisturizer for dry skin to help with my peeling on the T zone, the oil on my T zone gets even worse. If i use moisturizer for oily/combination skin, this time the peeling and flaking gets worse. I have no idea what to do at this point, ive been searching for a moisturizer that works with my mess of a skin type for YEARS. Both dryness and oil is happening at the same time on my T zone simultaneously. i dont know what to do. ls there other people experiencing the same thing as I? cannot find anything about this online either. I also would appreciate any moisturizer recommendations for my skin.",
