I know curls aren't a feminine thing btw) anyway my friend encouraged me to grow my hair out at the beginning of 2024 and I'm so grateful. People always compliment my hair, and I hate that it took me so long to embrace a part of me. The last photo is from May of this year when I had a different method so you can see the difference. Thank you to everyone who commented on my last curly hair post and gave me tips!! Have a great holiday season everyone 💖\n\nProducts listed at bottom.\nRoutine:\nI wash my hair two times a week. For one wash just shampoo and conditioner.\nOnce a week: wash with clarifying shampoo, then shampoo, then conditioner then conditioning treatment\nWith still dripping wet hair, apply curl creme then scrunch, then apply mousse and scrunch thoroughly, then gel and scrunch.\nDiffuse hair. Scrunch out crunch or use hair oil\n\n\nShampoo: not your mother's curl defining shampoo\nConditioner: not your mother's curl defining conditioner\nDeep conditioning treatment: Mielle Organics Babassu Oil and Mint Deep Conditioner (5-15 minutes) rinse out\nCurl creme: Briogeo Curl Charisma Rice Amino + Avocado Leave–In Defining Cream\nMousse:Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Activating Mousse\nCurl Gel: Briogeo Curl Charisma Rice Amino + Quinoa Frizz Control Gel\nOil: Oaui hair oil\n I wear a satin bonnet to bed every night, and use satin pillowcases and do not do a refresh routine.

Shampoo, using noughty shampoo, alternating between clarifying and normal frizz\n2. Conditioner, john freida repair since my hair is so damaged\n3. Brush conditioner in in shower, scrunch it and leave for a few mins\n4. Rinse and put LOTS of leave in conditioner in, I’m not sure what this is the label fell off!! it feels smooth like seaweed when I stop. Brush that in while still dripping in shower. Scrunch again\n5. Plop in towel for a short time while getting dressed\n6. Put in a creme, using noughty serum very gentle just running it over the waves (my hair doesnt curl until its dry, then the waves seems to suddenly curl up) not stretching them out at all\n7. Then do the same with a mega hold only curls gel\n8. Shake again (gently) to get natural clumping and curl pattern then scrunch in cotton t shirt lightly a few times\n9. Diffuse until nearly dry. \n10. Leave an hour then scrunch it out and give it a shake to poof\n\nI also wear a silk scarf at night which has made a HUGE difference and I can leave it a day if I clip it up\n\nIts so many steps.

      "content": "Hey yall. So basically, I was dealing with issues with my liver and my birth control pill without knowing, and my hair completely changed over 2 years of this happening. I’m addressing the source now, and it should be improving eventually, but I’m having a really hard time not hating my hair. I miss my old hair. It defined easily with minimal product and effort and pretty much always looked good. Now I put in 3x the effort for 1/3 of the results, and they’re inconsistent too. I don’t know how to have anything but resentment towards my hair for reflecting health issues that could’ve been caught earlier if healthcare professionals bothered to check anything. It’s also been falling out since February and isn’t stopping. I rarely like how my hair looks now, and I don’t know what to do about it. It is not a length thing, as my hair was starting to loosen up when it was still shorter too. I’ll list my routine, so really anything helps. Maybe from people who have my current hair type? I haven’t felt compelled to give up on caring for my hair in a long time, but this has definitely taken me there. \n\nHair type now: wavy, coarse, medium density \nHair type before: curly, coarse, high density \n\nCurrent routine: Innersense clarity hair bath and hydrating cream conditioner. Styler is usually 1 lightweight foam and 1 gel,  ex. the tgin miracle foam + innersense I create curl memory. Usually brush styled with a denman or bounce curl definition brush, scrunched, diffused.

Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Almost one year later, and I still have acne—and it has gotten worse than I thought. It first started on my cheeks as little pimples. I didn’t mind them because I thought they would go away, and I assumed it was only because of my period. I never had a pimple that stayed for a long time before.\n\nWeeks passed, and they didn’t go away. At first, they were small, tiny bumps. Ever since I moved here to Japan, it got worse. It started appearing on my chin and forehead too and continued to spread, which has been making me worried and more insecure. I’ve never had this kind of acne before because I never had pimples that stayed for so long.\n\nI thought it was probably because of the products I was putting on my face because of my work (I’m a UGC creator). But for the past few weeks, I stopped using everything and only used Dr. Althea 345 Cream. My pimples wouldn’t show in the morning, then would appear about 30 minutes after waking up. I stopped using the Dr. Althea 345 Cream after my mom told me to stop. Now I only use Pixelpure Gentle Cleanser and sometimes Fation Deep Pore Cleansing Foam.\n\nI don’t even know what type of acne this is, and it’s still here and getting worse—mostly on my hairline and cheeks. It grows back, then fades, then grows back again.\n\nThese past few days, I noticed that most of the acne on my cheeks turned into black spots, and I need help figuring out how to fix it. I’m still having pimples (or bumps? red ones) on my forehead, something grew on my nose, and I have a few bumps on my cheeks and chin.",

Any recommendations?\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone with similar skin type 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "content": "I decided to come here because I've been growing my hair out for about 2 years now with 2 or 3 cuts in the interim and finally got it to a length I'm liking. But my hair is so coarse, dry, and here it looks floofy because I left it in a ponytail overnight. If I don't do that, it's incredibly flat and dull. This is especially challenging because before I started medically transitioning almost 2 years ago, my hair was incredibly oily and had to be washed daily, so this is new to me.\n\nMy routine lately has been this: wash with Monday moisture shampoo once a week followed by deep condition with a Shea Moisture masque sample pack I got (Jamaican black castor oil strengthen &amp; restore), then condition with Monday conditioner every day following. I often use ion leave-in conditioner and a few spritzes of an ogx biotin &amp; collagen oil mist but it just makes my hair shiny. Sometimes when I'm getting dressed up for a night out I'll use Not Your Mother's curl mousse.\n\nAnd lastly, I stopped blow drying it because it destroys what curls I do have and flattens my hair out so I just let it air dry. I find better results when I put my hair in a ponytail while it's still wet, usually turns out looking decent after that. But after a few hours it just looks lifeless again. I also wish there were a way to help my curves thrive on the top of my head but I think the weight just pulls the hair down?\n\nI've been broke for a while but now have a good job so planning to try to find a salon next month but anything I can do between now and then would be a lifesaver. Thank y'all 🙏",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
