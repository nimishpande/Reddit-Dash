It has a silicone texture which worked as a great base for me when doing whatever minimal makeup I was doing. On my regular days this sunscreen and Kay loose powder was all I used to look put together. But since this has raised doubts in me regarding the sun protection I sadly had to look for another option 🥲.\n\nBeauty of Joseon : This spreads beautifully and does not take time to blend like UV doux. No silicony texture which I miss. Cant say anything about sun protection as there was no prolonged exposure or harsh Sun in December. ",

Though, I have realized that I’m not a big fan of blonde and the contrast with my roots doesn’t look good to me. Think I want to have it dyed a shade or two lighter than my natural dark brown (maybe a chocolate brown). Also want to get a U-cut with face framing layers so there’s more volume in my hair but they’re SO expensive at curly girl salons. Would you guys recommend me just getting a cheaper cut at a cosmetology school or should I def go to a curly certified hair stylist?\n\nRoutine:\n\nFor shampoo and conditioner I use olaplex though I’ll probably try to find a budget product since it’s a little expensive. Also have been more consistent with deep conditioning these last few months and I feel that it’s helped my curls a lot! I use Rizos for curl cream and not your mothers for gel. I diffuse my hair. No bonnets to bed I feel they make my curls flat but I do use a satin pillowcase and tie my hair up in a pineapple bun.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

I've had a look through posts but I'm specifically lookinging for UK products and couldn't really find what I needed.\n\nThis year, my hair has become really brittle. I am fairly sure it is linked to hormones, but getting that sorted is proving to be quite the battle. \n\nMy hair is naturally thin and fine, curly/wavy/frizzy, but I've also started growing thick black and white hairs over the last couple of years, entirely different texture. It's my fine hair that is suffering though. The two things combined are giving me a \"permanently frazzled\" look since the shorter, thicker hairs stick up and I have whole little sections of short, broken, fine hair. \n\nI have straightened my hair maybe 3 times in the last year, and use an argan oil heat protection spray when I do. I don't use a hairdryer. I have dyed it once in that time with box dye, about 5 months ago. I also take collagen every day and a B complex, including biotin, every other day.\n\nIf I put it up in a ponytail, it seems to create more breakage, but my hair is so big and frizzy right now that it's the only way I can look anything like presentable, and not like an eccentric wild woman (not that I'm against that, it's just not a look I want all the time 😂). \n\nThe breakage is mainly the top layers, which makes sense since it gets all the exposure to changing weather, heating etc, but it all feels pretty brittle. I do sometimes get ringlets in the bottom layers. I currently use Aussie moisturising shampoo and Garnier ultimate blends honey hair remedy, and neither seem to have made an improvement. Please give me your best suggestions on helping my poor hair? I don't suit shorter hairstyles but it's so bad right now! ",

One is the Nivea moisturizer (it says on the pack that it can be applied on the face as well), and I’ve also tried Vaseline Deep Moisturiser Body Lotion (which I think is mainly for the body).\n\nWhenever I apply these on my face, my eyes start feeling heavy — not exactly sleepy, but like they want to close or feel slightly drowsy/uncomfortable. This only happens when I apply it on my face. If I apply the same products on my body, I feel completely fine.\n\nAny idea why it happens? or anyone with similar experiences?\n\nAlso, I have dry skin with a few pimples and some pigmentation patches on my face.\nCould you suggest:\n\t•\tA good moisturizer suitable for dry + slightly acne-prone/sensitive skin, and\n\t•\tAn additional product (serum/cream/etc.) that can help with pimples or pigmentation and works well along with the moisturizer?\n\nAny help or recommendations would be really appreciated.

How do you manage your hair routine for morning swims?\n\n  \nI've always been an evening swimmer, but I'm looking into swimming in the mornings before my classes since my uni has a pool and I have more time in the mornings now (10am classes). I've never had to worry about styling and drying my hair at the pool, so I need advice!\n\n  \nI have super thick, long curly hair that is low-porosity, so it takes AGES to dry. I put a lot of gel in my hair for a good curl cast since thats the only way I can get my curls to last, but it also takes AGES to dry (my hair can still be damp after spending 30m diffusing and air drying overnight).\n\nI'm going to cut my hair shorter which will ideally decrease drying time, but i'm not sure what else to change. I can't bring a blow dryer to uni everyday, but I also can't walk around with wet hair all day esp in winter :( \n\n  \nI'll also mention I wear a swim cap, but my hair still gets very damp and humid underneath + my pool uses a LOT of chlorine so I always wash it after (plus my curls would get ruined under the cap anyway lol).\n\n  \nAny advice?

      "content": "\nI have been full bleaching my hair to a platinum for 8 years. I’ve had breakage and a side cut before, got into extensions whatever. As I started to get a bit annoyed with the upkeep I wanted to transition to something involving less upkeep but as I let my hair grow out, I noticed I really have gotten a lot of white hairs over the years and I sadly need to camouflage those.\n\nMy hairdresser developed a bleach allergy and told me she could sadly not provide service for bleaching anymore and yesterday I went to my extension stylist to get my outgrowth under control. She recommended me to switch to “air touch technique “ but my og girl said it’s actually melir technique. Essentially it seems like a lot of highlights where she used a comb and only 50% of the hair part to apply bleach to.\n\nWell she didn’t lift my hair enough and I’m left with really orange spots. I’m horrified because I have no idea how she is able to fix it as it’s not like a simple re application as it used to and if she breaks my hair on my crown it’s gonna be impossible to hide , I just switched to middle parting and curtain bangs.\n\nI’m lost at what to do I am not even sure I like the technique she used and maybe I should have stuck with my usual but she really talked me into it. It seems too dark to me.",

After trimming my beard with a blade one day, when I already had blackheads, I started breaking out.\n\nMy main issue is that I have oily skin. I get blackheads and whiteheads, and they often turn into pus-filled acne.\n\nAfter the breakout, I stopped using everything and started using only Saslic DS and a toner twice a day. Even after that, my skin still gets very oily, especially during office hours, even when I haven’t applied anything. I’m also still breaking out.\n\nI’m confused and worried now. If I’m using Saslic DS twice a day and not applying any moisturizer, can that actually make my skin produce more oil and cause more acne?\n\nAt this point, I honestly don’t know what to follow. I feel lost when it comes to skincare and understanding which products are right for oily, acne-prone skin 😔.\n\nI currently have the following products with me:\n\n\t1.\tSaslic DS 2%\n\n\t2.\tJovees Tea Tree Face Wash (pH 5.5)\n\n\t3.\tJovees Cucumber Toner\n\n\t4.\tPlum Rice Water &amp; Niacinamide 2% Hybrid Sunscreen\n\n\t5.\tDot &amp; Key Cica Calming Oil-Free Moisturiser\n\n\t6.\tBenzoyl Peroxide 2.5%\n\nIf my current products aren’t suitable, please suggest better options and a simple routine. I’d really appreciate guidance on how to understand skincare and what actually helps.\n\nPS - i have been on isotretinoin med years ago and it worked very well but i stopped it as it is steroid.",
