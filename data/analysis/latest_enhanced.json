I have severely senstive acne prone skin. \n\nAM: Just water on a clean skin club towel (I've tried wash cloths and they dry me out. \n\nVanicream daily facial moisturizer \n\nBubble solarmate mineral sunscreen (the yellow tube)\n\nPM: LA Roche Posay toleriane gentle hydrating cleanser \n\nVanicream daily facial moisturizer \n\nIf I'm wearing makeup I use a clean skin club towel and the blue garnier micellar water to remove it. \n\nI've struggled with this type of acne since I was 16. It lead to awful skin picking. I was miserable and couldn't find out what the issues was. I finally found it was my skincare causing it after I stopped all products and my skin cleared up.\n\n The first picture is from 2015, the 2nd from 2022, and the last is from today. It took me so long to find products that didn' t break me out. I realized I had severely senstive skin and have found a laundry list of ingredients and products I can't use. I've struggled with brands reformulating and not being able to use things I once could and having to start all over again.\n\nWhile my skin is very sensitive it is combination as well. It gets dried out very easily but if I use anything slightly too heavy it becomes very oily and gets severe acne. \n\nI still struggle with redness and the occasional break out. I'm also turning 30 soon and am not sure how exploring anti-aging is going to go since I have such sensitive skin. Right now I am so happy with where my skin is. It is such a relief to not finally have a routine that doesn't do more harm than good. \n\nI also want to add I do not have on any filters or makeup. The sunscreen gives a nice soft glowy finish while not being tinted.  \n\nIf anyone wants a list of products that didn't work for me I have a list I would be glad to share! ",

Sometimes I will add Coconut oil, but I always use Cantu curling cream and the leave in conditioner.\n\nI just let my hair air dry after squeezing out the excess water and towel drying.

Now you’ve taken it to a whole new level.\n\nI’m curious who thought it was a good idea to utilize a 6-month-old baby in an ad called “slow hair growth” and showcase that same baby at 17 months with beautiful hair as though the baby’s hair actually flourished because of your oil?\n\nChildren grow. Their hair grows. It’s called science. You didn’t invent evolution.\n\nLet’s talk about your lack of common sense - you aren’t even a brand that specializes in children. What was the reason you used an infant in an advertisement, in order to have parents feel that their child is growing at an unacceptable rate?\n\nThis isn’t marketing, it’s desperation and to do so using an innocent infant.\n\nShould you, instead of using infants to gain emotional sympathy, focus your time on developing a solid product for adults? You already have a damaged reputation.\n\nSome brands really will stoop to any level to sell.",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

The hair distribution is noticeably sparser than my other brow and no hair at all grows where the scar is. Right now I’ve just done a quick tidy up with the tweezers, and brushed some of the longer hairs over the scar to cover what I can. \n\nI don’t wear makeup a lot these days, and I’d prefer not to get any tattooing/ microblading done. I have used a brow pencil or powder to try and cover the scar in the past but the skin texture there is more shiny, and it’s difficult to make it look natural; it tends to really stand out especially under fluorescent or natural lighting.\n\nI’d like to know:\n\n1. How obvious is it to the casual observer? What do you think when you see my brows?\n\n2. Could I be shaping my brows differently or using a different technique to minimise the contrast in brow density and hide the scar a bit more? I have pretty much just had the same bare minimum routine for 10+ years (plucking the strays in the middle and on the forehead area plus a few from underneath). \n\n3. Has anyone had a similar issue and used any sort of hair growth product they could recommend to successfully grow hair over scar tissue, or at least increase density of hair distribution?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice 😄",

Over time, it has slowly expanded and now covers a larger part of my back and slightly towards my shoulders. It doesn’t itch and usually feels smooth, not rough or painful. Its mainly a cosmetic issue (colour/texture change).\n\nI have been to three different dermatologists and got different opinions:\n\n* One diagnosed it as lichen amyloidosis\n* Another said its chronic inflammation\n* Another said its something that can’t really be “fixed” and is cosmetic\n\nI have been using prescribed creams and moisturisers, but I am not sure if its helping much. It seems to slowly expand over time, which worries me.",

I’m trying to see if a protein treatment would help restore my curls. I find myself washing my hair more because I can never refresh my curls after sleeping - after two days, my hair is very dry/coarse,frizzy and greasy (even if I put my hair in a bonnet or a pineapple bun). \n\nMy daily routine:\n\noccasionally use Olaplex Bond Maintenence shampoo/conditioner as clarifying \n\nswitched to NYM naturel curl defining shampoo and conditioner when not clarifying (not a huge fan so far- used to use ouidad moisture lock s/c)\n\nbrush when wet, then Ouai leave-in conditioner\n\nMiss Jessie feather soft curl cream or davines curl serum\n\nsometimes use Ouidaid gel cream in substitute of a curl cream\n\nscrunch and diffuse, then add a hair oil \n\nany type of mousse or gel leaves my hair so stiff and even after I scrunch with oil. My curls get really greasy if I apply too many products or do the CGM. \n\nWith my latest routine, tried to restore my curls by using a deep conditioner mask for 5 mins, then leave in and mousse while still in shower but my wet hair was still straight even after scrunching - it was only when diffusing that some of the curls/waves arrived. \n\nI’m trying to see if I have moisture overload. I used to do the LOC method (leave in, oil, curl cream) and my curls were great! But my hair is not curling even when wet so I am at a loss of what to do. Please let me know if a protein treatment would help or am I due for a trim?\n\nThank you!!!",
