My natural hair colour \n\nBackground / hair history:\n\n* My natural hair colour is a neutral-to-warm light brown.\n* In April 2025, I did a full permanent colour of a darker brown.\n* The ends of my hair are now lighter and coppery, probably from that dye job lifting colour and washing out.\n* Recently, I had very light blonde highlights done at a salon (this was a gift and now I can’t afford to maintain salon colouring - these prices are scary?!).\n\nCurrent situation:\n\n* The highlights are growing out and look very stark against my natural brown.\n* My hair now looks like multiple colours:\n   * Natural brown at the roots\n   * Very light blonde highlights\n   * Coppery/lightened ends\n* The highlighted sections are also drier and more porous.\n* I’ve realised blonde isn’t for me, and I want to blend everything back toward my natural brown and grow it out cleanly.\n\nWhat I wnat to achieve: \n\n* A blended, natural-looking light brown result\n* No harsh line between blonde and brown\n* Something that will fade gently as my natural hair grows\n* A professional, neat look as I’m starting a new job soon at a very proffessional office work setting \n\nConstraints:\n\n* I’m a student on a tight budget (around ±$25 in my currency) - meaning I can probably get 2-3 boxes/colour products\n* I can only colour at home\n* I live where brands like L’Oréal Paris, Garnier, Schwarzkopf, Clairol, John Frieda, L’Oréal Professionnel, Schwarzkopf Professional, Redken, Moroccanoil, Kérastase, and Wella are available but not always alll their product ranges. \n\nWhat I’ve heard (but I’m unsure):\n\n* That bleached hair needs warmth put back in first before going brown again\n* That skipping this step can cause green/grey tones\n* That using permanent dye over everything might cause the same coppery fading on my virgin hair later\n* That semi- or demi-permanent colour might be safer for blending\n\nMy worries:\n\n* I’m scared of going too warm and ending up orange/copper again\n* I don’t know:\n   * Whether I need a filler, gloss, shampoo, or dye\n   * What shades to choose (golden? neutral?)\n   * Whether to use permanent or semi-permanent colour\n\n**My main question**  \n**Given my situation, what is the simplest, lowest-risk at-home approach to:**\n\n1. **Neutralise and blend the blonde highlights**\n2. **Bring everything closer to my natural light brown**\n3. **Avoid over-darkening or strong copper tones**\n\nIf anyone can recommend specific product types or shade families, I would be incredibly grateful.\n\nThank you so much for reading xxx",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Everything seems focused on fast dry time and hair health, with cool shots and heat cycling.\n\nWith curly hair, my hair is already mostly dry from sitting under a hooded dryer. I use a blow dryer specifically to stretch, smooth, and straighten the curl, not to dry wet hair. A lot of the newer dryers get warm but don’t stay hot enough to actually smooth.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for professional blow dryers that get really hot and stay hot? Not worried about being the healthiest option, just looking for heat and power.\n\nAppreciate any suggestions.",

I know one of my bad habits is that I wash my hair every single day, even though I’ve heard it’s not great for the skin or hair. I also make an effort to be gentle when drying my face with a towel, so I don’t think I’m irritating my skin that way.\n\nI’m not sure what kind of routine I should start with or what products could help with these breakouts. Any tips for beginners or product recommendations would mean a lot! Thanks in advance for the help.",

      "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI (35F) have kind of a weird situation. I have a chronic disease (Addison’s) that, among many other things, means my body doesn’t make a hormone called DHEA. Don’t ask me to explain all the biochemistry, but basically it’s the precursor to making the small amount of testosterone that bio females have. So I haven’t had testosterone in me for a good 15 years at least.\n\nI started taking DHEA a few months ago. There are a ton of benefits to this med that make it absolutely worth taking, but…\n\nY’ALL IT FEELS LIKE I’M HITTING PUBERTY AGAIN.\n\nI sweat a lot. I smell bad. I have acne. That’s the part I need help with. I have no idea how to handle this.\n\nMy skincare routine for most of my life, if it could even be called a “routine” has been:\n\n\\- face wash (CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser) every couple of days\n\n\\- sometimes a refresher of micellar water to get the sleep off my face in the morning or take off makeup when I rarely wear it\n\n\\- popping zits and blackheads way more than I probably should but words cannot express how much not getting the nasty out grosses me out.\n\n\\- SPF moisturizer in the summer (CeraVe)\n\nSide notes:\n\n\\- I have dishydritic edema so no scented products. CeraVe has always been a safe choice for me, but I’m open to trying other brands.\n\n\\- my skin tends to be dry\n\nWhat I’m hoping for is some advice on products and routine, for as simple and inexpensive of a routine as I can get away with. I really don’t have the time or inclination or money to get elaborate unless it’s some sort of miracle substance.\n\nI’m trying to get into the habit of at least washing my face properly every day. Habits are hard for me but I’m making progress!\n\nI would be grateful for any help.\n\nTL:DR: I have acne bc I have testosterone now. Previously I could get away with very sparse skincare, but now I have the acne of a 15-year old and I can’t figure out how to get rid of it.",

And since all hair is different it’s hair to know which type it’s good for. I did read that clarifying at least once a month helps. But I’d like to know the scientific basis on what protein is good for? And how do you know you are buying a protein product other than just the label? Is it for daily use? And does hair ethnicity matter when it comes to using protein products? \n\nThank you! ",

      "content": "Hi, I have a problem with my pores on my cheeks getting really clogged. I have dehydrated skin that always gets really bad in the winter, so even now, it's very sensitive and irritated. And it's quite dry only my cheeks but I have medium to oily T-zone. In winter I have textured skin because of the clogged pores. When I try to pick them, they get sometimes inflamed (I try not to but oh well) .Otherwise, they're fine but it really irritates me. I started to stick to this routine: \n\nIn the morning: \n- wash with water\n- Salmon Caring Centella Cream Heve Blue (PDRN)\n- (makeup): Purito Cica Clearing BB Cream \n\nNight / after I come home:\n- Dermacol Sensitive Micellar Water Lotion (wash off makeup)\n- Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence\n- Salmon Caring Centella Cream Heve Blue (PDRN)\n\nI just started sticking to this routine so nothing special happened. I still struggle with dry skin sometimes in the morning. But my biggest problem are the closed comedones or clogged pores on my cheeks.\n\nPlease help me to make a routine / get advice on this one. I am open to suggestions but I can't have a routine with loads of steps because my skin is very picky and gets irritated quickly. I also have these products at home so they could help with my routine:\n\n- SPF Relief Sun Rice + Probiotics Beauty of Joseon (I know I should use, but I don't know where in the routine and also I am scared of too many steps)\n- Numbuzin Toner 3 (I like this one)\n- Nivea regular cream (sometimes I use it locally because of dry skin)\n- La Roche Posay Effaclar Duo + M (sometimes used in summer)\n- Venira serum against imperfections (10% niacinamide + 1% zinc)\n- Vichy Normaderm Double Correction  Moisturizing Care (quite like this one)\n- Red Bean Refreshing Pore Mask of Beauty of Joseon (I use this like once every two weeks)\n- black coal facial soap (also used in summer but now it's sooo drying)\n- Skintra Brightoner (mandelic acid, tranexamic acid, kojic acid, vitamin C) (never used)\n\nIf you have any suggestions on what could be causing the closed comedones or help with my routine I would be very thankful :)",

However I want to change that this year, but don’t know where to start. \n\nAny recommendations on creators or sites to follow for simple curly hairstyles? \n\nHair routine \n\n1. I shampoo and condition with Botanic Hearth (Biotin brown bottles) \n\n2. (This is for when I leave my hair out) Still wet I apply Cantu leave in conditioner for curly hair, comb it in with a curl defining brush, scrunch in Cantu gel. \n\n(Idk why people say Cantu is bad, out of all the products I’ve tried Cantu is the only brand so far that’s produced great results for my hair) \n\n3. Air dry since I don’t have a diffuser. ",
