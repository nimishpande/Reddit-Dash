      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hey y’all! I’m 25 years old and I’ve had a very loose skincare routine for about 2 years now. My skin type is **dry** and face is usually clear aside from minor blemishes. I dipped my toe into the world of skincare because I really love achieving that glassy glow🌟 + ever since keeping up with a skincare routine I get a smoother base when I do makeup 🙂‍↕️\n\nRight now, I mainly use 3 products in this order: \n\n**1st** \\- B:Lab Matcha Hydrating Foam Cleanser \n\n**2nd** \\- Torriden Dive-in Hyaluronic Serum \n\n**3rd** \\- Etude Soonjung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream. \n\nI think this works pretty well for me, but I want to add some retinol, PDRN, &amp; SPF products to my daily routine. (Would adding all 3 of those be too much?) Any suggestions for products that work well with dry skin would be appreciated. \n\n\\^ Is there an order I need to follow when I eventually add these? And I’m still a bit clueless when it comes to which products actually need to be applied daily 😵‍💫\n\nI also want to add stuff to help with my main problem areas (maybe not to my daily routine, but definitely a few times a week?) \n\n**Need something to target extreme dryness** **during the winter months.**\n\nIn the winter, I always get dry patches around my face + my nose will begin to flake and peel. I’ve started using a humidifier and I think that helps a bit, but what products do you guys use to keep your face from shriveling up like a raisin? (Face masks, moisturizers etc ?) \n\n**Discoloration &amp; Hyperpigmentation?** \n\n(I tried to capture these in the photo I attached, but I’m not sure how noticeable it is on my phone camera 🙃 I still have the iPhone 12 sorry)\n\n\\- I have **dark circles** around my eyes which I’m pretty sure are genetic. Will any under-eye patches or brightening serums at least make it less noticeable? Please let me know which ones y’all swear by!\n\n\\- I also have **lighter spots** on my face that become pretty noticeable when I tan. Went to Brazil a few weeks ago and was promptly reminded of this 😕✌️ Showed it to my friend and she said it kind of looked like sun fungus, but we concluded that it probably wasn’t since it’s the same spots on my face every year that refuse to tan (and it never spreads) Does anyone know what products/treatments help with this? \n\nMy TikTok FYP is trying to convince me that microneedling is the best way to fix it 😅 Seems like a pretty expensive addition to a skincare routine…even if it’s only every 4-6 weeks… but I’m open to being influenced (and de-influenced lol) \n\n**TLDR: Need tips/suggestions on what to do for dry patches, discoloration (light spots, noticeable when I tan), &amp; dark circles around eyes. Also is microneedling worth it for any of the problem areas I mentioned? Or is that totally overkill** 🧐",

      "content": "After almost a year and 2 hair cuts, I think I have a good routine down! First pic is from the start of this journey, second pic is today. My hair is pretty average, normal porosity, medium density, finer hair in front and medium coarse hair in the back. \n\nCurrent routine: Garnier Fructis clarifying shampoo followed with Shea moisture hydrating hair masque once a week\n\nConditioner only every other day or every 2 days depending on greasyness and laziness levels\n\nSquish to condish \n\nKnot Today leave in conditioner while hair is dripping wet in the shower, scrunch so my hair isn't dripping\n\nOut of the shower, I roughly section a top and bottom section and do the bottom section first. When I style the top section I split it into 2 sections, left and right\n\nFor each section, I spray with water to moisten the roots more, comb away from my scalp with a wide toothed comb, put a bit of Shea moisture whipped curl cream in my hands and emulsify (not really necessary but I bought it to try so I'm just trying to use up at this point). I rake the curl cream through, then using praying hands to reform the clumps and scrunch. I microplop with a microfiber towel, then put a golf ball size (more for the top section) of Not Your Mother's mousse and apply with praying hands and scrunch. Spritz some heat protectant, then I diffuse upside down till a cast has formed and my roots are like 75% dry. Then I pixie diffuse right side up, flipping side to side. I use a small rounded hair claw to clip my roots where my section is to get some volume\n\nI shower at night, so I leave the cast in my hair, put on a satin bonnet, and sleep. I scrunch out any cast in the morning. Usually it's a bit wild at the start of day 1, but it flattens a bit as the day goes on. For day 2 (and sometimes 3), I just spritz with water in the morning to dampen, scrunch a couple times, then scrunch out the cast after it's dry. \n\nLately I've been more into mousse more than gel. Gel gave me more definition, but mousse has given me more consistent results. Plus it's easier to sleep in the cast set by mousse than gel 🤭 the amount of mousse I use is probably a lot but it works surprisingly well",

      "content": "So I’m trying to get my hair to get more defined. That’s my goal here. I’ve been watching curl training/routine videos for a while, seen so many different things, but I wanted to ask for product recommendations to try and for people to tell me what does and doesn’t work for them so I can try and get some idea what to do. Also I don’t know how important this is, but my ideal hair length is what it is in slide 5. My hair is more of a zigzag than curly, some pieces in the front get coils, some are just barely a wave, and some are zigzags. \n\nMy routine kinda looks like this normally, I shower, and I’m either using As I am co wash or Kevin Murphy Killer Curls. After that, I use my holy grail product, Not Your Mothers leave in conditioner. I used to use their curl cream and gel, but after that not working the best I switched to Mielle’s curl smoothie which seems to work a little better, but I wanna try a different curl cream and see what works best for me. I don’t use gel anymore, should I? I used to use sea salt spray, I’ve heard it helps but I’ve also heard it dries out your hair so I rarely use it anymore. I also use the Mielle rosemary mint hair oil recently, as well as the Mielle weightless oil for my ends. (If you can’t tell, I’m a brand whore. Once I like something I wanna try their other stuff haha.) I saw a video online saying to use mousse again, and I don’t have any but a while ago I used to use NYM’s curl foam stuff, but my mom told me too much product will weigh the curls down so I stopped and pretty much just did leave in confirmed and curl cream until recently. This time I even added some hairspray, I saw someone say that and I thought I’d give it a try. The brand is Kenra, I used to use it for when I’d curl my hair when I was in middle school haha. I usually let it air dry as I never give myself enough time before work to dry it, but today I used my conair orange blow dryer, it was cheap and from Walgreens I didn’t think it mattered but now I’m starting to see it does. But yeah, that’s my curl routine, I did it differently today and didn’t seem to get any different results. \n\nWhen I was showering I doused my hair in conditioner and scrunched it, I even did the twisty curl things where you roll it and twist it out today, but I don’t know how to tell which way your hair curls so I kinda just pick a direction and alternate like I would if I was curling my hair. I don’t expect it to make an immediate difference, but it didn’t seem to do anything so I will keep trying that to see if it helps. Should I do that after showering too? \n\nI also am aware I don’t do the brush thing and then coil it around that, I’ve seen that a lot, but my brush is very old and needs to be replaced, plus it doesn’t seem to be the best for doing that so does anybody have any brush recommendations? And does it matter what kind of blow dryer/diffuser I use? If so, what do you guys use? Also, what kind do heat protectant should I use? I stopped straightening my hair ages ago and I don’t know what works good, I don’t even really have anything except the 10 in one Not Your Mothers stuff but I don’t count that, it’s just currently my only option and I really don’t wanna damage my small curl pattern haha. \n\nSorry, I know this is a lot but I’m looking for product recommendations to try out, things I could do differently, and just tips in general. What works for you that you would recommend for curl training? Thank you to anybody who responds with advice. ",

I’m a bit confused as I have no idea if these routines are properly being done and the order of each product or how often I should use each product, which is why I’m posting on here! Any recommendations and guidance is encouraged and appreciated :)\n\n**Both photos are of the same scar and that is my worst and darkest one! Its just in different lighting**",
