Bali Curls Moisturizing Conditioner\n\n3. Bali Curls Hydrating Curl Cream\n\n4. Bali Curls Curl Defining Gel \n\n5. Bali Curls Bonding Oil for scrunch out the gelcast.\n\nI never had long hair and had to find out just after my early 40s that i have curly hair (i would say 2c-3a). It is very fine but it seems i still have a lot strands. I was going to cut that dry and frizzy mess short again until i learned how to maintain it after watching videos, search the internet and finally got a \"curlsys\" cut from a hair stylist knowing how to handle curly hair and teach me how to maintain and style it. I also learned that some things makes night and day like avoid friction and sleeping only on a silk pillowcase with a loose bun (also silk scrunchie here). It can get really on my nerves to maintain that mane but i just feel so much better now at my age with my longer hair and while in the beginning people said it looks terrible, now it is more the opposite and it is a great conservation starter to women and man.\n\nI am still searching for maybe some better products for my special hair type and try other things. I just bought the \"Lockenbox\" Christmas calendar with 24 tools and products to try for next year ;) My journey just began (even i am already a 47 years old man) and hope to grow the curls much longer and maintain them better. I still have some bad hair days with a frizzball on my head but now i know how to \"repair\" it. One thing for sure, even if some people try to talk me into a shorter hairstyle i am done with shorter hair.....at least until it might get thinner as an aging man. So far i think i still have some years to go. ",

In the past two years or so I’ve realized my hair actually is wavy and I’ve been looking into caring for my hair more. I have dyed my hair often since I was 16 (~10 years) but I am trying to grow out my natural hair, recently cutting 5 inches off, and seeing how I feel about my natural color since I haven’t barely seen it in a decade as well as trying to let my hair get healthier. \n\nMy current routine is CHI Luxary black seed oil shampoo and unwash conditioner but these were for vivid hair color care. Are either of theses still okay to use? I used a moisturizing cream for like two months which did help but it was super expensive for very little product. I then dry with a cotton towel and wrap it as I dry off then free my hair and let it air dry. I would love any advice anyone has for me. \n\nI have read through the beginner guide but do have some thoughts and questions. For example, I live at a very high altitude (~8500 ft) and it is super dry up here. Does anyone have any advice to keep moisture in my hair? I am also autistic and the thought of the crunchy gel sounds awful to me sensory wise. Is it needed or can I use just stay in cream or something else? \n\nThere was a brief few months where my hairdresser gave me a moisturizer that is not recommended here but that is some of the best waves I have had. Just any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\nPhotos:\n1) me at 12\n2) natural hair 3 years ago (only shampoo and conditioner)\n3 + 4) my hair with the same shampoo, conditioner, and a moisturizing leave in cream",

Absolutely no side effects, and if you get it from Costco, Fin is very cheap. \n\nFeels like I'm through the worst of it and I'm pretty sure I'll keep my hair as long as I'm taking my daily dose -- though I'm curious if others have had the experience of years of hairline stability that suddenly falters.\n\nAnyhow, just wanted to say, if you're able, get on Fin; this stuff saved my ass.\n\n  \nBless y'all!",

      "content": "Hey,\n\nI’ve had acne all over my back for about 2 years now. It’s a mix of active spots and dark/red marks. It’s really starting to get to me mentally.\n\nBasic info: 26, male. Back acne for: \\~2 years\n\nTreatments (past + current): • Lots of oral antibiotics as a teenager • Currently on oral antibiotics again from my GP for the back acne • Adapalene gel at the moment • Previously used tretinoin (helped a bit but didn’t clear it) • Was on isotretinoin (Accutane) about 10 years ago for facial acne – I didn’t have back acne back then. My derm is now suggesting Accutane again.\n\nLifestyle / hygiene: • Eat fairly clean, exercise regularly • Shower straight after workouts • Change into clean clothes after sweating • Wash bed sheets 1–2x per week • Use a gentle cleanser on my back (no scrubs) • Not using moisturiser on my back at the moment – some moisturisers seemed to break me out • Sometimes my back feels itchy after washing, so I’m worried I might be irritating my skin barrier\n\nExtra context: • I sweat a lot – even when I’m sitting still and not hot, my armpits/back/chest get sweaty • My recent blood tests showed higher oestradiol (E2) • I take finasteride for hair loss (DHT blocker)\n\nWhat I’m looking for: • Has anyone had similar back acne + sweating + hormones/finasteride, and what actually helped you long-term? • For those who went on Accutane for body/back acne, did it help the back specifically? • Any body washes/moisturisers you’ve found that don’t make things worse, especially if your skin is easily irritated/itchy? For the scars and dark marks, did anything help on the back or was it mainly time + stopping new breakouts?\n\nI’ll attach pictures of my back in different lighting.\n\nI know nobody can diagnose me here – I’m just trying to get real experiences and see what’s worth discussing further with my derm.\n\nThanks in advance.",

But one type has persisted.\n\n**The Issue:** Without having to send a pic, they can basically be described as hardish lumps of almost translucent slightly yellow \"pus.\" The outside doesn't look bad unless touched, but can be scratched off. They don't look like any acne I've seen on charts defining the types, so I'm not sure how to tackle them. **I get them everywhere: my back, front, stomach, legs sometimes, and arms.** The can be gently squeezed out too, but they're never liquidy.\n\n**Skin type:** I would say normal. Not too oily, not too dry.\n\n**Current routine:** I have literally tried everything, but right now I am washing with a cleanser with eucalyptus oil in it (not an acne specific one), and moisturize with CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion. On my face I use Azelaic acid, retinol, and the same moisturizer, but **my face is fine**. It's my body that's the issue.\n\n**Things I have tried in the past (please read):**\n\n* Niacinamide + zinc (the ordinary)\n* Many salicylic acid cleaners, body spray, moisturizer, you name it.\n* Retinol\n* Benzyl Peroxide\n* Sodium Sulfacetamide (prescribed by derma)\n* Metronidazole gel\n* Loose clothing, natural fibers, changing bed sheets often, silk pillowcases, showering after sweating, changing shirts often, etc.\n* Going to the dermatologist. Basically wasn't taken seriously and prescribed above prescriptions that didn't work. Going back is not an option case yay US healthcare system.\n* Moisturizing every day with various moisturizers. Non-clogging mainly.\n* Not fungal acne but tried products for it\n* Antibiotics didn't work\n* Birth control didn't work. Neither worse nor better on and off bc.\n* I have tried different exfoliating schedules: Once a week, every day, 2-3 times a week, etc. Right now I'm at 2-3 times a week.\n* I was my body last (after shampoo and conditioner)\n* Used gentle laundry detergent on clothes and no fabric softener\n\n**Things to consider:**\n\n* I am blonde and have thin, soft, light hair on my body.\n* Waxing doesn't change anything\n* I keep out of the sun and always use sunscreen.\n* I did go see a professional, but didn't feel like I was taken seriously. I was in there a total of 10 minutes, probably less. He basically just said acne vulgaris and gave me prescriptions that cost $$$$ so I can't get them again, nor can I go to another derma just yet.\n\nHas anyone else had this problem? Did you ever find a solution or do I just have to deal with this? Thanks in advance! Although I know my acne is not nearly as bad as others, it has been a great source of depression and self-consciousness my whole life. I am also a chronic picker so I know that doesn't help but it's been an addiction I've struggled to stop my whole life.",

      "content": "I’ve had acne for as long as I can remember. Birth control helped clear it up, but I switched to an IUD at the beginning of 2023 and my acne came back full force. I went to the dermatologist, who prescribed me 3+ creams and gels with spiro to help, but I think this was too harsh on my skin and the spiro gave me side effects. I went cold turkey on everything about a year ago and saw a lot of improvement in my skin. I also had been using CeraVe for oily skin and switched to La Roche Posay gentle cleanser, which I think helped.\n\nAfter all of this, I noticed less breakouts, but had some deeply clogged pores. I started using Differin 0.1% nightly (introduced slowly) which helped with this, but I eventually stopped using it. My skin is the best it has been since I got off birth control, but I still breakout here and there (still more than the avg person). Currently my routine is -\n\nAM:\nLRP gentle cleanser\nOlay SPF 15 (I use 30 in the summer)\n\nPM:\nMicellar water to remove makeup \nLRP gentle cleanser \nVanicream night cream\n\nI am thinking of reintroducing Differin 2-3x per week to keep breakouts at bay. I have also seen people saying that you should use an acid the night after a retinol to eat up the cells that are turned over, and people recommend vitamin C serum in the AM. Is this necessary/would this be beneficial? I like to keep my routine simple and I don’t want to add in unnecessary steps unless they’re worth it. Please let me know your thoughts :)\n\n",

I have simple layers with a middle part. \n\nThe long story short is, I've never been happy leaving a salon. I love when they cut it, but HATE when/how they style it. I want them to put mouse in my hair and let me leave. The issue is - I don't want to pay $80-100 just to have them cut it and leave when I know I'm also being charged for styling. \n\nI am wondering, if all I ever want is just a trim, should I ask the salon if they will discount me for not also styling it? Could a barber do a similar cut if I just want my layers trimmed? I'm just trying to figure out the best and most cost effective method of keeping my hair how I like it. Salon's seem like too much, but I know barber's seem too little, what's a girl to do? \n\nAny advice would be truly appreciated. ",
