These are suppose to be the best years of my life and I am so miserable. I have slept away all of this time. I can't live with myself looking like this.\n\n  \nI have been on dutasteride and oral min for about 2 years now. I was thinking I might be okay with many hair transplants and using these meds but a few weeks ago I learned that my biological dad isn't who I thought it was. After seeing a picture of who my bio dad actually is, I now know he is fully bald. I am so depressed and am so panicked.\n\n  \nIn this time I have been scrolling tressless endlessing. Googling answers hoping to find some miracle cure. I have researched hair transplants endlessly but honestly they don't look good at all. Even from top doctors, they are all clearly the product of surgery.\n\n  \nI just want my old hair back. I have been going to therapy twice a week and tried like 20 different antidepressants in this time and none of it will convince me that I am fine the way I am, i just hate it. I go to the gym 3 times a week but I don't feel better during or after. I just stare at all those mirrors on the wall just hating myself.\n\n  \nI have always been a very weak man. I know that I have some pretty severe depression, anxiety, ocd, and body dysmorphia, but I have been seeing a therapy since I was 11 and I don't feel like I have gotten any better since. I just feel like I wasn't meant to be here.\n\n  \nMen go bald all the time, yet this very small thing has completely ruined me. One of my closest friends is balder than me and I don't think he has thought about it for more than 10 combined minutes. I would probably guess that balding has consuming about 8-12 hours of my day for the entire past 4 years. But I guess that is just the OCD loop that won't stop.\n\n  \nI should be happy with my life. I think I am conventially attractive and have a nice body otherwise, I have a girlfriend, many good friends, I have a very good paying engineering job. But I can't get over this one thing and don't think I ever will.",

I lost about half of my original volume (partly from the damage, partly from the stress of it all 😭).\nSince then I’ve been using the K18 mask and Label M M-Plex, and I feel like it helped me get out of the absolute worst phase. But honestly, at this point only time will heal them — I’m just trying to grow them out so I can cut off the damage without ending up with super short hair (I have a big, round head lol).\nBefore all this, I followed the Curly Girl Method for about 4 years and it really worked for me. Now I’d love to slowly get back into it, but my hair is still super dry, frizzy, and shapeless — it looks like a bird’s nest the day after washing.\nDo you have any recommendations for CG-friendly products that could help me restart my routine and bring my curls back to life? I’d especially appreciate advice for bleached, high-porosity, fine curly hair.\nThank you so much for any help 💕\n\n",

I now use Geek &amp; Gorgeous moisturizer and have been on it for 1 month, so i was wondering if this could also be a cause of cysts. \n\nI use Garnier sensitive skin Miscellar water, Vanicream cleanser, Hydration Station Moisturizer, and Omi Bear Sunscreen. Occasionally benzoyl peroxide as well. \n\nI also have hormonal acne flare ups but Spironolactone did not help me (made it worse) So some days are better than others, it’s hard to find out a root cause of the acne. \n\nBut i haven’t had cysts like these in months-years. My fungal acne looks to have gotten better but i’m unsure if the cysts are caused my hormones, the makeup, or the moisturizer lol. \n\n\nAny advice? similar experiences? ",

My college is in Hyderabad, where the weather is usually dry  and my skin is perfectly fine there, more on the normal to slightly dry side.\n\nBut every time I go to Bombay for internships (where my family also stays), my skin completely changes. It becomes extremely oily, sweaty, and sticky the moment I step out. Since I’m constantly running around in formal clothes for court/office, by noon my skin looks super shiny, dull, sticky and just... disheveled. Like not the glowy kind of oily, it's the tired, heavy, “why does my face feel like it’s melting” kind. And it feels uncomfortable ngl\n\nI’ve tried blotting papers, which help for a while but even after that my skin feels heavy and sticky for some reason. I also tried the Innisfree No Sebum Powder, but it made my skincare kind of pill (that weird rolling feeling on the skin), and I hate that texture.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\n\nMorning:\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n2. L’Oréal Revitalift Serum\n3. L’Oréal Revitalift Hyaluronic Acid Cream\n4. Dot and Ket Watermelon Sunscreen\n\n\nNight:\n\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n2. Earth Rhythm Serums (I alternate between the CLEAR SKIN SERUM and 10% NIACINAMIDE SERUM)\n3. Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer\n\n\nI don’t wear makeup daily, maybe just sunscreen and Etude water tint. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, but my skin just hates Bombay weather. Is it the humidity? My routine? Any product or routine adjustments that could help?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice, I’m tired of looking like a greaseball by lunchtime 😭",

      "content": "I AM ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE FOR HELP DEALING WITH CHRONIC PERIORAL DERMATITIS‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️ 23/Female\n\nI am genuinely feeling at my wit’s end in dealing with perioral dermatitis. I have experienced it on and off again (mainly on) for the past 13 years with nothing providing a real solution. Many dermatologists, rounds of doxycycline or other antibiotics, topical after topical, clean laundry products, clean toothpaste. You name it, I have tried it at least twice or maintained doing it over the past 10 years. My skin is otherwise relatively decent, breakouts here and there that tend to be hormonal, manageable, and never cystic. Sensitive skin and a history of different skin cancers run in my family, and I have always been very diligent when it comes to taking care of my skin, even from a young age with very sensitive, eczema-prone skin.\n\nNote- the pictures included are of recent flare-ups, and the final is with light makeup to show the consistent flaky dryness\n\nMy current routine has been consistent over the past few years-\n\nAM-\n\nWash- Ketoconazole shampoo for face wash Moisturizer- La Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer Dieux Instant Angel Lipid-Rich Firming (have been trying and enjoying for about a month)\n\nSPF- Neutrogena SPF 60 facial serum\n\nPM-\n\nWash- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil (don’t use daily, 3-4 times a week, and primarily when removing makeup) Cera Ve SA Renewing SA Cleanser\n\nTreatment: 0.05% Tretinoin Cream (started using tretinoin at 14 for acne, have been consistent at 0.05% for 6 years)\n\nMoisturizer: La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer\n\nOther: \nVaseline (as needed for discomfort relief) Tri-Estrella Birth Control (hormonal birth control prescribed by a dermatologist at 15 to manage severe acne) Ketoconazole 2 % topical cream and tacrolimus 0.1 % topical ointment (recently prescribed and intended to use both twice a day, but they have caused severe irritation so I paused and notified my dermatologist) Hello Brand Toothpaste Clean no-scent detergent Hypochlorous Acid Spary Clean make-up, body, and hair care\n\nI could go on listing the products and prescriptions I have tested over the years, and when I say nothing has truly provided long-term relief, let alone a “cure”, NOTHING has worked.\n\nIf anyone can offer any recommendations or advice, it would be so greatly appreciated!!!!! This has been one of my biggest physical insecurities for the better part of my life. At its best, I am uncomfortable and itchy, and at its worst, it is burning and painful. This is a cry for help, TYIA🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
