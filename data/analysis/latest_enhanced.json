      "content": "almost a month out of my haircut that i hated lol and while its still not quite curling/waving how i like, it IS sitting a lot better and i am learning how to style it. i felt really pretty and cool the other day with it; i do like having short hair, i honestly do think it adds a unique sort of character to my appearance, and once it gets just a touchhhh longer and starts curling/waving the way i really like, i think ill be super happy :)\n\nincluded photos are when i styled it the other day, and then a couple short ponytail/pigtail styles ive been able to do :) also ignore that i was wearing the same shirt LMAOO I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE. also included just to be silly was my hair dried with no product.. unfortunately still just a puffy triangular orb.\n\nroutine: wash and condition with herbal essences grapefruit volumizing shampoo and chamomile conditioner. rake through a tiny tiny pea sized amount of kinky curly knot today in the shower (still debating if i need it at this length, i did when my hair was longer bc it’d get super dry). once out of shower, i lightly part and place my hair, but its still very wet. i then scrunch in pea sized amounts of aussie instant freeze gel, scrunch out excess water with a microfiber towel and air dry OR, as in these photos, very lightly hover diffused for a few minutes. \n\nwhen my hair was longer, i always diffused and hated air drying as it flattened out my waves and just took longer. but with the shorter hair, it dries so much quicker and looks decent enough. ive tried pixie diffusing it like i used to but it camd out sort of wonky at this length, like my hair wants to bend instead of form curl clumps. but today, though i dont have a photo, i DID diffuse side to side up to my scalp for a bit and it came out pretty voluminous and a bit more curly/wavy, so maybe i just needed to give my hair time to recover before diffusing like usual lol :)",

I started taz in late October.\n\nand listen… this stuff is MAGICAL.  \ndespite being the *strongest retinoid* i’ve ever used, it has never irritated my skin. no burning, no peeling, nothing. within 1.5 months, i had the smoothest skin of my life. i still can’t believe how gentle yet effective it is for me.\n\ncurrent routine:\n\nam:\n\n* Minimalist SA cleanser\n* isntree green tea fresh toner\n* cosrx snail mucin\n* aquasoft ac moisturiser\n* Picspot gel\n* sundrink sunscreen\n\npm:\n\n* garnier micellar water\n* joy pH 5.5 face wash\n\ntaz days (mon/tue/wed/fri/sun):\n\n* aestura lotion *or* minimalist b12 cream\n* taz\n\nthursday (barrier day):\n\n* aestura lotion\n* b4 nappi cream\n\nsaturday:\n\n* formularx lactic acid\n* aquasoft ac\n\ntaz literally did what tret never could for me. if you’re struggling with closed comedones, texture, or tret intolerance, this might be worth looking into.",

Not only did I absolutely over wash it (I mean I would refresh it EVERY day for school), I also box dyed it twice and straightened it around 4 times last year 😭😭 rn it’s absolutely dead but I’m very lost on how to get my hair healthy again😢 my mom is kinda anti-curly hair so I get no support from her and I also can’t afford to see a professional or get any sort of curly hair treatment at the moment. \n\nas you can see in the pictures, I do have some layers which give me volume and shape i like in my hair, the problem is my hair is very thin and spaced out ish..? also I noticed my curls have NO bounce at all like genuinely they are stiff and dry no matter how much product they hold. the back of my head also is the main problem, as seen in the second pic it’s a HOT mess…🫩(third pic is the best reference I found of how juicier my ringlets were before last year)\n\n  \n!! for my routine I use marc anthony coconut and shea shampoo + conditioner, then on wet hair I rake in marc anthony strictly curls cream. After that I section my hair and brush style with the bounce curl brush. When I’m done with that I use not your mother’s gel and finally marc Anthony strictly curls mousse. I usually air dry my hair but I did diffuse it in the routine for these pics !!\n\nIs there anything I can do at all??🤧",

Nothing fancy. I've been doing this routine for over a decade. When I was a teenager, I made a mistake of getting my hair cut short and have been growing it out since, with trims in-between. Nothing against people with shorter hair, it just wasn't for me and I missed my long hair I had as a kid so I decided to regrow it.\n\nLong story short, I had to get hospital tests and was monitored for several days, basically bedridden. They also had to use medical glue on my scalp to connect cords and monitor brain activity. After everything, I was left with a HUGE matt in my hair. Two local salons turned me down. Then I went to a local beauty school which helped reduce the size of my matted hair ball but they couldn't get it out completely. The professor told me her students did their best, and I appreciated it so much. So the question is, what now? The picture on the right is after they reduced the size of the matted ball. Left side is what my hair usually looks like. It's at the end of my hair but all balled up which is why my hair looks a lot shorter than it actually is.",

      "title": "2 months | 30M | Topical finasteride/minoxidil",
      "content": "Hello Tressless. Long time reader, first time poster. \n\n**TL;DR:** If you struggled with oral finasteride side effects and are considering topical, I’d recommend taking a shot. (Consult your doctor too). \n\nWanted to share my experience with Topical finasteride/minoxidil spray. Mainly sharing because my hair has been somewhat of a point of sadness for me over the past 2-3 years. I was especially sad when I reacted poorly to the oral finasteride, showed no gains on topical minoxidil and as result felt hopeless to my genetic fate. So, as I think I’ve now found something that works for me, when all hope was lost - it felt only right to share in case others are in a similar situation. Happy to answer all and any questions. \n\nSee pictures attached, taken approximately 2 months apart. My hair loss has always been worse on one-side (barely noticeable on the other). There has been marginal recession, mainly just density loss on this side - however I’ve noticed my hairline also progress slightly forward. By no means the finished article, but happy with the short-term results and excited for what the future holds. \n\nOnly regret is that I didn’t start sooner when I was in denial at around age 28. \n\n**Side effects:** \n\n1. Slight libido loss for around the first month and it has since returned to normal in the last couple of weeks. \n\n2. No other sides. \n\n**Questions:** \n\n1. How would you rate my progress? \n\n2. Admittedly, I am a bit confused by my gains. I read somewhere that hair progress works in 3-month cycles. How is it possible to have noticeable hair growth in 2 months? \n\n3. Has anyone else suffered with hair loss on just one side? I assume it’s because it’s the side I sleep on but it’s always been thinner on that side so could just be a natural density thing. \n\n**Topical solution ingredients:** \n\n1. 0.1% finasteride \n\n2. 7.5% minoxidil \n\n3. Melatonin \n\n4. Caffeine \n\n5. Fluocinolone acetonide\n\nHappy to share details of where I get my topical for those interested. \n\n**Important points of context:** \n\n1. First noticed hair loss at around age 26. Had a very bad case of Telogen Effluvium after getting fairly sick from Covid. Hair density returned to 85% pre-Covid and then gradually declined (likely from MPB and not TE). \n\n2. I took 0.5mg oral finasteride every second day for approx 2 months last year (started around Mar ‘25) and experienced pretty bad sexual side effects. Quickly stopped. \n\n3. I was using minoxidil 5% for almost 9 months (started Jan ‘25) without any results before switching to the topical finasteride/minoxidil. I think the tretinoin/minoxidl in the new solution definitely helped gains.\n\n4. I have also made some slight gains on the crown however this was not bad to begin with (didn’t take pics).\n\n5. My diet has been very clean for the past 2 years, eating mainly whole foods and limiting alcohol consumption to twice per month. \n\n6. I started a new training routine, hitting the gym 4 times per week and lifting heavy since Ju",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "I have had acne my whole life and am seeking guidance. **The following is context, you can skip to the bottom for my question**. \n\nI got my period at 11 and began developing severe acne by age 12. Between the ages of 12 and 16, I was prescribed multiple acne treatments, both oral and topical, including doxycycline, tetracycline, tactupump, and tretinoin, though these are only the ones I can clearly remember.\n\nAt 17, I was referred to a dermatologist and began a full course of Accutane, which consisted of approximately 2.5 months at 20 mg, 2.5 months at 40 mg, and 3 months at 50 mg. While Accutane ultimately cleared my skin, it came with significant side effects—I previously had 20/20 vision, but Accutane blurred my vision, and it also caused my periods to become unbearably painful for the duration of treatment. Despite this, I completed the full course.\n\nMy skin remained clear afterward, but at 19, in 2023, I began experiencing mild breakouts and was prescribed Winlevi and tretinoin; both caused me to break out, and although I understand topicals often lead to purge periods, after having had great clear post-accutane skin, and after having endured horrible side effects because of accutane, I freaked out and stopped using the topicals. Eventually, my skin cleared on its own, and my breakouts remained minimal, so I moved on.\n\nIn April 2025, at age 21, during a very stressful academic period, my skin began breaking out severely again, and unlike previous flare-ups, it did not resolve on its own. From April onward, I have been breaking out consistently every month without fail. Considering the breakout occurred post-accutane and was triggered by stress, I know my acne is mostly hormonal.\n\nSo, today, January 2026, I visited my dermatologist. She said she wouldn't recommend spironactone because it takes too long to kick in, it is not worth the irregular periods, and I'd have to be on it for a long time. She said she wouldn't recommend accutane because it had bad side effects for me before. So, she prescribed me **Cabtreo** (she also prescribed Akleif and Differin, saying I could test them out and choose one of the three, but ultimately said Cabtreo seems best for my case.)\n\nI’ve dealt with acne my whole life. At this point, I’ve given up. \n\n**My Question:** If you've used Cabtreo, did it help you? If you've used Cabtreo post-accutane, could you share your experience? Does anyone have any general advice pertaining to my situation?",

      "title": "[Acne] Post-Accutane hormonal acne — has Cabtreo helped anyone? Any advice or stories appreciated.",
      "content": "I have had acne my whole life and am seeking guidance. I got my period at 11 and began developing severe acne by age 12. Between the ages of 12 and 16, I was prescribed multiple acne treatments, both oral and topical, including doxycycline, tetracycline, tactupump, and tretinoin, though these are only the ones I can clearly remember.\n\nAt 17, I was referred to a dermatologist and began a full course of Accutane, which consisted of approximately 2.5 months at 20 mg, 2.5 months at 40 mg, and 3 months at 50 mg. While Accutane ultimately cleared my skin, it came with significant side effects—I previously had 20/20 vision, but Accutane blurred my vision, and it also caused my periods to become unbearably painful for the duration of treatment. Despite this, I completed the full course.\n\nMy skin remained clear afterward, but at 19, in 2023, I began experiencing mild breakouts and was prescribed Winlevi and tretinoin; both caused me to break out, and although I understand topicals often lead to purge periods, after having had great clear post-accutane skin, and after having endured horrible side effects because of accutane, I freaked out and stopped using the topicals. Eventually, my skin cleared on its own, and my breakouts remained minimal, so I moved on.\n\nIn April 2025, at age 21, during a very stressful academic period, my skin began breaking out severely again, and unlike previous flare-ups, it did not resolve on its own. From April onward, I have been breaking out consistently every month without fail. Considering the breakout occurred post-accutane and was triggered by stress, I know my acne is mostly hormonal.\n\nSo, today, January 2026, I visited my dermatologist. She said she wouldn't recommend spironactone because it takes too long to kick in, it is not worth the irregular periods, and i'd have to be on it for a long time. She said she wouldn't recommend accutane because it had bad side effects for me before. So, she prescribed me **Cabtreo** (she also prescribed Akleif and Differin, saying I could test them out and choose one of the three, but ultimately said Cabtreo seems best for my case.)\n\nI’ve dealt with acne my whole life. At this point, I’ve given up. If anyone who has had a similar experience, or has used Cabtreo, has any words of wisdom for me, I would appreciate literally anything.",

AND NOT ONCE I QUESTIONED MY \"ROUTINES\". \n\nthe desperate phase: i tried everything wasting money time and mental peace. my BF lives in US i visit him sometimes and even bought products and serums not available in India just to fix my skin. nothing helped. i even went to docs and did two courses of tretonin (helped for few months but problems recurred) i have lived in north and south india switching jobs and no amount of \"environment change\" fixed my skin suffered for 4 straight years. \n\nthen i just stopped and thats why i am sharing this may be it will help someone. i just stopped all products. i started reading more about skin barrier and how serums exfoliate and over exfoliation destroys skin barrier. i just stopped everything and only started applying basic moisturiser but with extreme dedication applied sunscreen. \n\ni invested in good sunscreens. i had never applied sunscreens so much. always found them greasy would apply only when i am going to office. and never reapplied after few hours even when i am out in blazing sun. but then i started ordering sunscreens korean and others wasted money used the ones i didnt like on my body but finally landed on a a good one. \n\nand man oh man did it work. i religiously apply the sunscreen twice in a day, use most basic moisturiser and use most gentle face wash. its only been 2 months but my skin is so much clearer my marks r fading i am having less and less of acne (barely any) i can feel the hydration returning to my face. and i am so happy. \n\nskin care companies just bombard us with their products thanks to unregulated social media giving us \"advice\" how to live our own lives and cloud our own judgement and intution. skin care routine type content is a cult. we dont need much at all. i completely destroyed my god given healthy skin. \n\ni never post on reddit but i understand the feeling of seeing new pimples and having lots on ur face and the stress of nothing working. i hope someone reads this and it helps someone. \n\nPS since Reddit sells its content to AI companies now i can help train the AI models to stop prescribing acids after acids and just prescribe basic skin hygiene and care routines lol",

      "content": "My skin has been suffering for almost 6 months now where I literally cannot tolerate anything anymore on my cheeks and lower face. It started back in mid-August where I used a moisturizer on top of tretinoin which caused an intense burning, redness, and tight sensation. To the point where I could feel it in the nerves in my cheeks. Instead of washing it off, which I should have, I slept through it because it was getting late and I didn’t think much of it. The next day, m I woke up with continued red, burning cheeks and nerve sensitivity.\n\nSince this incident, I have not been able to tolerate anything. Even simple bland moisturizers and oils like Vanicream, zeroid soothing cream, and pure squalane oil have given me trouble. Same goes for Vaseline. I will get the same red, burning, tight sensation with hypersensitized nerves. And the more I use it each day by trying to push through, it will eventually lead to sandpaper texture with numbness in the cheeks until I stop. This predominantly happens to my cheeks and a little bit around the nasiolabal area. Forehead and neck are completely fine.\n\nI have had patch testing and I am only allergic to formaldehyde which is in none of my skincare products that I own, confirmed by dermatologist. I even used steroids for a very short period, and tacrolimus for 6 weeks( both of them prescribed by a dermatologist) Neither of them have helped. If anythib no tacrolimus just made my skin burn more. \n\nI have seen two dermatologists already, and have a follow up with the second one next week. Both of them have confirmed that I am suffering from irritant contact dermatitis. Unfortunately neither of their approaches have helped. The one I am seeing again has suggested cerave healing ointment and zinc oxide. As soon as I used it, it leads to the same incident as before: burning, tightness, nerve sensitivity, etc…\n\nI fear that I may be out of options and the only thing left for me might be zero therapy for awhile to let my skin calm down. In fact, I have already started it yesterday and my skin does feel better and calmer by not using anything. The only drawback is dryness and tightness. And I am still worried if it’s even sustainable long-term. And how would I know when it’s time for me to reintroduce something back into my skin? I’m really scared at this point and it’s affecting me mentally. I really want to cry. Please what do I even do? I can no longer distinguish right from wrong anymore :(",

I have my basic skincare routine that works great for my face. But not sure where to start in treatments for the body acne issues.\n\nUnfortunately I'm very restricted in what I can wear, I work a job that has an assigned uniform that is not breathable whatsoever. I live in the south, so it tends to be hot and I work outside a lot. I make sure that I only put on clean clothes starting my day. I have specific work sport bras and I make sure get washed very well. But I still get home from work and it's all flared up and angry again. It's very frustrating and uncomfortable. But I don't know where to start with products to use. Any suggestions? Especially if you relate to having to work in an environment like I mentioned.\n\n(Side note: Y'all gotta bear with me, only have more recently been going down the self-care route but have been trying to do better to take care of myself.

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice from people who’ve successfully used 15% azelaic acid, especially if you have dry or sensitive skin.\n\nI’m 28F with very dry and acne-prone skin. Recently, I’ve developed mild melasma and rosacea on my cheeks, so I introduced AzA into my routine. I started with Naturium 10% AzA and my skin tolerated it very well but had to stop using it as I’m not able to get it anymore. So I decided to give a prescription strength ago and started Finacea about three weeks ago.\n\nI’ve been extremely cautious with it: Week 1: applied once Week 2: applied twice Week 3: applied three times so far\n\nI always apply it on top of a hydrating serum and moisturizer, never on bare skin, because I know my skin can’t handle that yet.\n\nEven with this slow approach, I’m still getting a lot of stinging, itching, and dryness after application. I know some stinging is normal, but my skin now feels generally sensitive throughout the day, especially around my mouth and chin. The first couple of weeks felt manageable, but lately I’ve noticed tiny bumps / small breakouts, and my skin just feels irritated overall. It doesn’t really look inflamed, but it feels irritated — especially when I apply sunscreen, which now stings around the chin and mouth.\n\nWhat’s confusing is that I’m not even using it daily and I’m buffering it with moisturizer, yet my skin seems to be getting more reactive rather than adjusting. I’d really prefer not to stop using it as I did have good results with AzA and since it’s so often recommended for melasma, rosacea, hyperpigmentation, and acne.\n\nFor those with dry or sensitive skin, how did you make Finacea work for you?\n\nDid you start even slower? Use a smaller amount? Apply it after waiting between layers? Or take breaks to protect your skin barrier?\n\nAny tips or personal experiences would be really appreciated. Thanks so much 😊",

I need a routine that's preferably not too expensive, and one that can help my skin glow.\n\nI relatively already have smooth skin, and I do not have acne or breakout unless my diet has gone wrong. But I get pimples under my lip, my nose and sometimes on my face (under my eyes) and they're also the places my face is the oiliest. I've been struggling with an oily nose since I was 12, and when I slack off my hygiene I always get pimples on my nose. (Because of the oil)\n\nI need something to help me preferably calm down my oily skin, and also I have visible pores that they come out of. I've googled but everything seems so expensive (~100 for a product??) and I am on a budget. \n\nI also have prominent smile lines I'd like to reduce, but they don't bother me as much. I have problems with hyperpigmentation in certain areas too (My armpits, my cleavage, my neck, in between my thighs, my knees and elbows) And I'd like anything to help me just get rid of them. No, it's not diabetes. I went through 4 years of derpessive episodes where I showered like once a week, and it just started from there.\n\nI also want to get into things like moisturizing, waxing, exfoiliating, and basically everything that has to do with feminine healthcare. Can I please get some help?\n\nTLDR: I need a skincare routine for an oily face, and to calm down smile lines, and something to get rid of dark underarms / neck / every other under part.\n",
