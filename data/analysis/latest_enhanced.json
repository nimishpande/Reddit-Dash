      "content": "Hi everyone. About six months ago I posted here in a pretty desperate mood and shared a picture of what I thought was my completely unrully hair. Even back then some people were sceptical, because my hair can look good sometimes, but the issue was always that it only lasted for a day. After that the curls disappeared and I had to redo everything every single morning, which was exhausting.\n\nFor context, I straightened my hair from around age 13 for almost ten years. I have only been properly embracing my natural curls for about a year and a half, so I am definitely still figuring things out.\n\nA few months ago I got the full Bali Curls line as a gift, and since then I have actually stuck to one routine. I now wash my hair with the Bali Curls Nourishing Shampoo and Bali Curls Nourishing Conditioner, brush it while it is wet, then comb through a small amount of Bali Curls Curl Cream. After that I apply a generous but not excessive amount of the Bali Curls Curl Defining Gel. I learned the hard way that too much gel just makes my hair feel heavy and lifeless (even though a lot of peole commented on my last post that theres no such a thing as too much gel, thats just not how it works for me)\n\nI scrunch with a cotton T shirt, plop for a few minutes, then diffuse. I start diffusing without touching my hair and only scrunch later. I never fully dry it because that would take forever. After about half an hour I scrunch in a bit of hair oil (honetsly I just use whatever brand is at my hands) and that is usually when things start looking good. I also use the Bali Curls Heat Protection Spray whenever I diffuse.\n\nOn non wash days I refresh with water from a spray bottle and usually diffuse a little in the morning if I am going out. I do not add extra product. The biggest change is that my hair now actually lasts. It still needs refreshing, but it does not completely fall apart anymore, and it finally looks like curls instead of a daily mystery.\n\nThanks again to everyone who commented on my original post. You were more right than I wanted to admit.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I’m not a nail tech, but I wanna do nails just for fun.\n\nMy brother’s girlfriend used to be a nail tech and whenever she did nails infront of our pets, they hated it. Threw up multiple times and started freaking out. So she just stopped doing it infront of them.\n\nHowever, I have 3 lizards in my room. Which, I might be incorrect, but the smell of acetone hurts reptiles way more than cats. Additionally, I hate the smell of acetone.\n\nI’m curious to know, if any of you own pets and do nails (bonus points if you hate the smell of acetone), what helps you?\n\nBeing in another room? Keeping them out of the room? Using a fan? Using an air freshener? Opening a window? Or should I just wait until I move out to start it as a hobby?\n\nAny advice helps! ❤️",

I know that I would need to pause tret before a peel. \n\nI have a couple questions about peels. I have looked at peel university so I have some basic understanding but I am completely new to peels.\n\nWould a peel help me to remove dark sun spots? Or should I stick with my current routine for a bit longer before considering a peel?\n\nAlso I think that I would need the strength of a TCA peel but being new to peels I’m worried about jumping straight to TCA.\n\nIs there another peel I should try that would help with sun spots? Or should I go for TCA but just make sure that I spot test and be very careful. \n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!",
