I also exfoliate my underarms when needed and am generally careful to not use the glycolic acid more than 2x a week but this is what happened (photos attached)\n\nI know I know I KNOWW this looks horrible can someone please please help me.\n\nSuggest products, tips anything. Do you think I should go for carbon peeling? Please help\n\n",

      "content": "I’m reaching out for some advice. Lately, I’ve noticed that my hair isn’t curling as well as it used to, even though I’m using the same products and have the same routine (gel or foam). I go to a hairdresser who specializes in curly hair.\n\nNow I’m confused because I’m not sure whether my hair just doesn’t curl the same way anymore, or if it’s simply too long (although I’ve had long hair before, and it used to curl better) or it’s not cut correctly. \n\nI’ve always had the issue that the bottom layer of my hair hardly curls at all – it’s more wavy than curly. When I get a layered haircut, that bottom part tends to stick out, making the difference between the curly and wavy sections even more noticeable. This is why I don't like very layered cuts. When my hair is shorter, the curls are more defined, but the bottom layer still stays wavier.\n\nI don’t know what would be best – to change my hairdresser, cut my hair shorter, change my routine or just accept that my hair doesn’t curl the way it used to or something else?\n\nEdit: my routine: I change shampoo and conditioner a lot, I brush my hair in the shower and then apply Tootilab Styling gel and then in between drying it with a diffuser a spray PoulMitchell Sculpting Spray. As somebody mentioned - I indeed started with new medication (oral contraceptive) two years ago. I was also thinking this could be a reason why my hair curls less (when I was a kid I had completely straight hair, they started curlying in puberty- so maybe hormonal changes does affect my hair a lot).

I’ve tried everything from rollers, using the brush to set my hair backwards to combat the effect, pincurls etc. Still nothing works to lose this annoying effect. Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to fix this? Thanks in advance!! I’ll add pictures to show the effect on the one side of my hair along with the other side to show the wanted effect. (First is unwanted second is the wanted effect!) ",

      "content": "Hey everyone, After I did a visit to dermatology, I’ve just started using Benzoyl Peroxide 5% &amp; Clindamycin 1% Gel (it’s 1 product) and Adapalene 0.1% for acne, and I’m about a week in. I’ve experienced some irritation and dryness, so I’m looking tips about these. My Routine: Benzoyl Peroxide &amp; Clindamycin Gel: 3 days a week Adapalene 0.1%: On the other days, E.g monday for benzoyl, tuesday for adapalene etc. I don’t use the products one day a week to rest my skin. Cleanser: Gentle, for sensitive and dry skin Moisturizer: contains glycerin, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and squalane Sunscreen: SPF 50 Hada Labo (only when I go out) Early Impressions: Benzoyl Peroxide &amp; Clindamycin Gel: Last time when I used that, I felt burning for couple minutes, maybe I put too much of product. Otherwise I Had some redness and dryness, so I skipped a night and used Madecassol to calm it down. It helped a lot. Adapalene: I think the peeling I’m experiencing is from Adapalene. My skin feels drier and flakes a bit after using it. I tried Sandwich method with moisturizer but it doesn’t seem to help. Questions: Irritation: Has anyone experienced redness or irritation like this? Should I use the combo gel less often or is this normal at the start? Dryness/Peeling: How do you manage peeling from Adapalene without slowing progress? Sunscreen: I’ve been using SPF 50 Hada Labo when I go out, but any other sunscreen recommendations for this routine? Any advice or personal experiences would be super helpful! Thanks!",

      "content": "\n\nI have been struggling with my skin for the past few months now, I’m really unsure what to do! My skin has become very textured on both of my cheeks and slightly on my forehead, some of the pictures don’t really show but my skin feels bumpy and is breaking out/ clogging so much more often than it used to. I’m also struggling more with pigmentation scarring from these blemishes. Pics 9 &amp; 10 for reference of how my skin used to look 20 ish months ago.\n\nRoutine :\nAM:\n- For about 6 weeks I have stopped using cleanser in the morning, just wet it in the shower or splash with cold water \n- Byoma milky toner (pat it into skin, been using for one month) Before this I used Simple toner and a temple spa toner. \n- Beauty of Joseon glow deep rice serum (purchased 1 week ago so have not used for long enough to see any effect)\n- The inkey list 10% Azelaic acid \n- For about 1 month I have used Simple gel moisturiser, before this I was using Superdrug’s Vitamin E SPF 15 day moisturiser, very creamy and heavy so stopped once I ran out incase that was clogging my pores. \n- SPF: I don’t use everyday as I WFH and live in the UK so by the time I’m finished with work the UV is practically zero, but when I do use spf I use Heliocare SPF 50 tinted gel, but last week I purchased the beauty of Joseon aquafresh relief spf 50 to try and incorporate a light spf in daily. \n\nPM:\n- The inkey list oat cleansing balm \n- Superdrug Hyaluronic acid cleanser, contains Niacinamide and Ceramides \n- Byoma toner, wiping over face with a cotton pad \n- Twice a week, the inkey list retinol \n- Weleda skin food night cream (have been using this for over a year but going to change once I run out) \n\nRecently since experiencing breakouts I have used acnecide 5% benzoyl peroxide gel and dots for spots (spot patches). \n\nIn July, I thought I had initially caused the breakout by overusing and combining Nip + fab salicylic pads with Superdrug’s Me+ Niacinamide &amp; Zinc and believed the combination caused barrier problems. I was using the Inkey lists ectoin barrier serum but didn’t see any change so stopped after 2 bottles. \n\nI was using hyaluronic acid twice a day but stopped about 6 weeks ago when I learnt that it can be used wrong and can suck moisture out of the face, hence leading to dehydrated skin &amp; closed comedones. However before this I was using it for about 2 years so I’m not sure how much of a contributor it could be. \n\nI also on occasion use the St tropez face spray but have stopped in the last few weeks, again, have not noticed much difference. I also use drunk elephant bronzing drops occasionally and I don’t wear makeup very often for it to be that. \n\nPlease note, I eat a super healthy well-balanced diet, I probably eat 10 different fruit/veg a day! I eat different protein sources and oily fish. I am conscious to always have clean hands before doing skincare and I also sleep on 100% cotton pillowcases at my boyfriends and a mix of 100% cotton and silk at my house. I always use a clean flannel every day too. I stopped taking the birth control pill July 2024 which seems too long ago to cause any hormonal skin issues? I also suffer from Crohn’s disease so I am on dual therapy immunosuppressant medication to treat that. Oh and I am also sometimes partial to a stress pick/squeeze 🫣 The only things I think I can improve on day to day is drinking more water, and getting more  and better quality sleep. Listing every variable that comes to mind sorry! \n\nI am in need of a restock this week with regards to cleanser, day and night moisturiser so please drop some recommendations below. \n\nPlease, please offer up your knowledge and advice skincare wizards of Reddit!! I would love to have skin like the last pictures again, I just can’t work out what is going wrong. Also I am a Reddit newb so this is my 3rd attempt at posting this🙃\n\nMany thankyous in advance! ",

I have tried a nearly exhaustive list of products over the years but ultimately gave up since everything just weighed it down without helping much.\n\nI just recently grew my hair out, and it seems more noticeable now since the lengths of each strand wildly differ. It's a huge self esteem hit, I look dirty and unkempt.\n\n\nI use:\n\n•\t⁠Aussie miracle volume shampoo / conditioner every weekish\n\n•\t⁠SEEN curly creme on wash days (big fan of fragrance free / derm friendly / low tox)\n\n•\t⁠occasional dry shampoo from a holistic apothecary\n\n\n\n\n\nPossibly of note: \n\n• I got off Accutane five months ago. I was on it for 6-8 months. \n\n• I dye my hair with henna every three/four months. I have done this for three years. This problem came about before then. \n\n• I wear my hair in a bun every night, recently switched to satin scrunchies. \n\n• Each strand is thick and coarse at the bottom but gets very thin and smooth near the roots (possibly due to Accutane?)\n\n• I used to use a lot of thick masks as conditioner, usually Shea Moisture brand. My hair still looked like this, maybe a bit less... but I realized Shea Moisture is not made for me. \n\n\n\nThank you for any advice. I will be crossposting this !! ",

This is my hair after washing it and using no curl products (and drying naturally).\n\nWithout products, my hair won't curl properly, as you can see, its like most of my hair is nothing at all (not wavy, not curly, not straight) its just pure frizz and no definition, its actually worse than the picture shows, because some locks of hair are like this from the root to the edges (and in the picture, you can mostly see only the frizzy edges), specially those behind my head. \n\nAlso, I have A LOT of frizz all around the top of my head with the baby hairs, not even the \"New hair\" looks healthy.\n\nThis problem doesn't solve properly using curl products after washing it, like mousse and oils\n It gets much better but it fades fast and I wonder if im not \"forcing\" my hair into something it isnt, but I also feel my hair just isn't right, it feels like an unhealthy hair that can only be solved cutting fully. \nThere is also a mystery I cant solve that is the locks of hair right around my ears that are perfectly beautiful, they are curly, shiny and smooth, and all I can wonder is why the rest of my hair isn't at least 10% of it, what am I doing different or if its just born like that. \n\nI would like to know if anyone already experienced it or if thats just normal and if thats how it is. I searched on this subreddit about this topic but most of the pictures I've seen people had so much less frizz or just lacked a little bit or definition, while in my case its like most of my hair is like this. What could I do to solve it? Is it normal? \n(Routine/details: picture after washing it with Arvensis products - free petrolatum/parabens, but looks like this with any shampoo/conditioner. No after products, I wanted to see it without it. \nEdges cut one month ago. Hair looks beautiful when done in a curls saloon. I have no chemical treatments in my hair such straightning, colour change, bleach, nor use heat in any case, my hair doesn't fall much.\nI sleep with satin bonnet, my hair is mostly kept in a bun bcz its too messy naturally, wash max twice a week)",

I recently switched back to Aussie's miracle curls shampoo and conditioner after trying other products (Shea Moisture, hated it, Paul Mitchell extra body, meh) and found that my hair was shiny again which I liked. I wonder though if my hair is flat today because of a build up of silicones or maybe I just used too much product after? The other pictures are how my hair has usually been looking. What I'm asking is, when your hair is flat and awful on wash day, would you just start over by clarifying or do you leave it be until the next wash so it can recover? How should I fix this so my hair isn't weighed down and dull again tomorrow?\n\nWhether I have washed or am just refreshing my hair, my routine has been to get it completely soaking wet and scrunch in NYM curl cream, put NYM mousse on the ends, and diffuse to dry before scrunching it out.",

(Currently I don’t use any products so the hair you see in the pic is without anything in it) \nSo I just need recommendations for shampoo conditioner and other products to make my hair not so dry and the curls more defined instead of frizzy please (I’m begging) and thank you!\n(Also yes I bleach and dye my hair ik that is definitely a factor I just need the best I can get basically!)\nRoutine:\n1. Old spice 2 n one (ik it’s bad trust me)\n2. Nothing (maybe some mouse sometimes but I hate the feel) \n3. Air dried\n4. I don’t sleep with anything special I don’t pay attention to it at all this is the first time I’m truly trying to take care of my hair. (..would wearing a bonnet help???
