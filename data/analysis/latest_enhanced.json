      "content": "Notes from a skin cosmetologist.\n\nIndian skin tans easily, marks easily, and holds onto pigmentation longer. Ik, it's a little sad. Mostly because our melanin response is very active (thanks to sun + heat + inflammation).\n\nIf you're dealing with tanning, dark spots, or acne marks, here are ingredients that actually work, and (istg this is more important) how they work:\n\n1. Mulberry Extract\nA gentle tyrosinase inhibitor. What this does is it slows the enzyme that makes excess pigment. Good for people who want brightening without irritation.\n\n2. Niacinamide\nDoesn’t lighten melanin!\nInstead, it reduces melanosome transfer, which means less pigment gets passed to the surface layers.\nAmazing for acne marks, PIH\n\n3. Alpha Arbutin\nA stable brightening ingredient that also inhibits tyrosinase, but gradually\nGreat for uneven tone without harshness.\n\n4. Licorice Extract\nContains glabridin + liquiritin. Magical as they are, both work as tyrosinase suppressors + anti-inflammatory... Licorice is giving 😌\nSo it treats dark spots and the inflammation causing them.\n\n5. Centella (Cica)\nMy favourite when it comes to formulating! Not a brightener by itself, but reduces inflammation + oxidative stress, which are major triggers for pigmentation.\n\nBiggest rule for pigmentation :\nREDUCE INFLAMMATION FIRST.\nBrightening only works when the skin is calm.\n\nHope this helps!",

      "content": "I just want to share something I wish I had found sooner. If you’ve ever had filler dissolved and feel lost or hopeless I wrote this for you. You’re not alone. Earlier this year I had cheek filler dissolved after regretting it almost instantly. What followed was one of the hardest periods of my life. I lost a lot of volume quickly and my face didn’t feel like me anymore. Not just the way it looked but the way it felt. Unsupported sunken and heavy. Like it wasn’t holding me.\n\nI searched everywhere. Reddit threads forums youtube even clinical studies. Most of what I found was fear sadness or silence. What helped me feel visible progress might help someone else feel less alone. Deep facial massage. Not a spa facial not gua sha or lymphatic drainage only but something that works with structural facial massage, tension fascia and deeper things you don’t even realize your face has been holding onto. I found someone who understood that skin health isn’t just topical it’s emotional too.\n\nI never expected this to help me. My muscles softened my skin woke up and I looked like me again not cause something fake was added but cause something real returned. My face held shape again felt more integrated and brought back a sense of glow and support.\n\nAfter the first session I noticed something shift. Not just in how my face looked but in how I felt inside it. My face stopped collapsing inward visually and physically. My eyes and face softened. I can look down again without seeing my skin fall. I feel held and that feeling is really everything when you’ve been walking around trying to pretend you’re okay. This wasn’t some luxury fix. I didn’t need more procedures. I just needed to feel safe and like myself again.\n\nIf you’re reading this and you’re going through something similar please know it’s not hopeless. You’re not broken. Your face remembers you. I have nothing to gain from sharing this except the hope that it helps someone else feel less alone. If this gets taken down so be it I’ll still find a way to share this cause this is a real lived experience and everyone deserves to feel hope again. To feel familiar in their own skin. It is possible.\n\nI’m happy to share photos privately with anyone who’s genuinely interested or going through something similar. I just don’t feel comfortable posting them openly right now. At the end of the day I’m the one who lives in my face every day and I finally feel more happy and confident in it. That’s a blessing in itself and if sharing this helps even one person then I did what I came here to do.\n\nI know there may not be clinical studies on this yet and I’m not claiming it restores literal fat. But for me structural massage brought back lift, support and ease I didn’t think was possible. I’m not claiming massage regenerates fat cells the way an injection might ‘add volume.’ What I’m saying is that it reorganized the structure of my face in a way that feels and looks like support and harmony were restored and that changed everything for me.\n\nThe reason I even shared this is cause I didn’t see anyone talking about it. I dismissed facial massage for so long too until I finally tried it not expecting anything and now I’m here, truly feeling like myself again. And I am so grateful. I’m not here to prove anything. Just to share what I’ve lived.\n\nWhat I later learned made so much sense. These massages retrain deep tissue memory, helping tight muscles relax and asleep ones activate again. They restore circulation and support lymphatic drainage, reducing water retention and unlocking areas where filler tension had stagnated things. Fascia becomes less gripped allowing your face to hold a more balanced shape. The result isnt just a visual change it’s a felt one. I felt lighter safer and at ease in my own face again.\n\nThe glow doesn’t just come back, it stays cause your face remembers how to function naturally again. I know it sounds like a lot but I truly believe more people would benefit if they knew about this. The science is there but more importantly the results are real. I’m living proof🤍",

I still use the same gel and leave-in conditioner for both of these pics.\n\nDamaged my hair by tying it back in a low ponytail and wearing a hat most days for the last couple years, and only doing the full curl routine like twice a week. I also had some significant shedding last year so I got on finasteride and minoxidil earlier this year which is why I think I'm seeing more short flyaways around my scalp than normal. Hair is also way more matte than it used to be.\n\nOutside of just not pulling my hair back as much and as tight by using silk scrunchies instead of tight hair ties, any recommendations for some tweaks to my routine?\n\nRoutine:\n\n* Wash every 6-7 days with Ouidad Cleansing Oil Shampoo.\n   * Every three washes I will instead use Malibu C shampoo with a dab of aussie miracle curls shampoo to cleanse the hardwater and silicons.\n* Condition with Cantu Argan Oil Leave-In Conditioning repair cream and then rinse.\n* 1.5 pumps of Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-In Conditioner.\n* Around 4 pumps of Ouidad Climate Control Gel - I have to use a lot to keep the frizz in check.\n* Scrunch out some of the moisture with a microfiber towel.\n* Diffuse on low heat with Dyson diffuser for about 15-20 minutes to about 70-80% dry.\n* Around 3 hours later carefully crunch out cast with Olaplex Bonding Oil or some Morraconoil Argan Oil (mostly just cup my ends and press it against scalp for a second or two)\n* On days that I want a quicker routine for work if I don't have meetings or presentations, I just swap the gel for some Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream and don't worry about diffusing. Gets me like 70% of the results as above, but with less active time.\n* As needed I deep condition with Ouidad Moisture Lock Mask.\n\nI use a silk pillowcase and I have tried pineappling at night and have even tried a silk beanie, but I have never been able to really refresh my curls to the point I think they look acceptable. One of the reasons I tied it back so much. My hair is fine/medium fine with low density.",

I’ve been wearing my hair curly since my early 20s, but I am now 4 months pregnant and trying to grow my hair out. At this new length, my hair is not responding to my usual routines (and maybe the hormones are playing a part). I am trying hard to take care of myself as my body changes, so it’s important to me to find a better routine. \n\nFor reference, my hair has a strong wave; it’s straight at the top but wavy / curly towards the bottom with some ringlets. It’s fine but thick and low porosity. The first two pics are my hair post diffuser. It was looking stringy, so I switched to a blow drying cap - results are the next three pics. In the last pic I tried brushing it and didn’t like those results either. Here is what I tried today:\n\nClarifying shampoo with scalp massager, moisturizing shampoo with scalp massager, moisturizing conditioner, deep conditioner. While my hair was still soaking wet I put in Davine’s curl cream, then Cake curly hair mousse, then some Eco flax / olive oil gel. I scrunched it with a microfiber towel a few times and then plopped for 30 minutes. After that I sprayed in some Marc Anthony “length and strength” heat protectant, then used the diffuser and blow dry cap. \n\nI have also tried the bowl method, then blow drying or air drying. I’ve used a hair curling headband with mixed results. I used to just use these products then let it air dry and refresh with water / leave in conditioner spray. \n\nPLEASE give me some advice. Do I need a need diffuser or dryer? New products? Should I just chop my hair off? Help! ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Fast-forward, only 3 years later in 2016, his hair looked awful and looked almost completely bald. ([https://www.thesun.co.uk](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/1255974/wayne-rooneys-two-previous-hair-transplants-appear-to-have-flopped-as-he-prepares-for-euro-2016-with-a-threadbare-rug/))\n\nThese days he pretty clearly uses hair fibres to make it look fuller. If fin was this guaranteed “stop button,” none of that should’ve happened. But it did.\n\nA lot of people here like to say *“well he just didn’t take it consistently”*, but the uncomfortable truth is that fin (and even dut) only slow hair loss, they don’t stop it for everyone. Especially if you’ve got aggressive genetics, all they really do is buy you time. For some guys that’s 10–15 years. For others it’s like… 3–5 years and then the loss just keeps marching on.\n\nRooney started losing early and aggressively. Fin likely helped *slow things down*, but it clearly didn’t freeze his hair forever, even with multiple transplants backing it up. And meds didn't save his native hair from continuing to miniaturise.\n\nAnd it’s not just Rooney. There are plenty of normal, well-documented cases of guys who started early (NW2-ish), stayed on fin for 12 years, and still ended up heavily thinned or basically bald. Here’s one of those documented cases people like to ignore: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WxN5ocR6TU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WxN5ocR6TU)\n\nSo yeah, Rooney isn’t proof that fin “doesn’t work”, but he *is* proof that fin doesn’t work equally well for everyone, aggressive hair loss will often win eventually, and meds mostly delay the inevitable, not stop it.\n\nAnyone pretending otherwise is just coping or hasn’t been on this journey long enough yet on.",

Yes, I’ve made some good progress, but I still haven’t achieved the results I was hoping for.\n\nDo you think I should switch to dutasteride?\n\nIf so, what daily dosage would you recommend?\n\nThanks in advance.",

My hair is thick and wavy. I want to buy some extensions but I can’t find my hair colour literally anywhere online. It doesn’t have to be a 100% perfect match but I’m really struggling to find a dark/golden blonde that isn’t too ashy or light. Any advice on what site I could find a similar match? Also what length and weight of extensions would work for me? Ideally I would like 18-20 inch. I know I will need atleast 180-200g as I have thick hair. \nThank you! ",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
