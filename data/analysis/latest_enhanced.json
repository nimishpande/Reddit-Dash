      "title": "Hair Loss “Cure” for Inflammation: Topical Roflumilast",
      "content": "Roflumilast is a small molecule anti inflammatory that blocks an enzyme called PDE4.\n\nWhen you inhibit PDE4, cyclic AMP goes up, and immune cells tend to shift from attack mode toward a calmer state. That means fewer inflammatory signals get produced overall, not just one single cytokine.\n\nWhy this matters for the scalp is that a lot of common inflammatory scalp problems look different, but share the same basic theme: the skin barrier gets stressed and the immune system overreacts, then keeps the cycle going with cytokines. When you lower that immune “volume,” symptoms like redness, scaling, and itch can drop.\n\nSeborrheic dermatitis is often associated with Malassezia yeast plus oily scalp conditions, but it’s not simply an infection. The bigger issue is the body’s inflammatory response. Topical roflumilast foam is actually FDA indicated for seborrheic dermatitis, so this isn’t just theory.\n\nPsoriasis is more of a classic immune loop disease, heavily driven by the IL 23 to IL 17 axis with TNF helping reinforce it. Roflumilast doesn’t target one node like a biologic, but it can lower the overall inflammatory output. Topical roflumilast cream is FDA indicated for plaque psoriasis.\n\nEczema, especially atopic dermatitis, is strongly tied to a weak skin barrier and type 2 inflammation, like IL 4 and IL 13, which then further damages the barrier and increases itch. Again, roflumilast can reduce inflammatory signaling broadly. Topical roflumilast is FDA indicated for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.\n\nScarring alopecias like lichen planopilaris are a different category because the immune system targets the hair follicle itself and can destroy it permanently. Roflumilast is not approved for lichen planopilaris, and the evidence is much thinner. The best way to think about it is as a possible add on to reduce surface inflammation symptoms like burning, itch, and perifollicular redness, not as something proven to stop scarring on its own.\n\nSo the essential takeaway is this: roflumilast works by raising cyclic AMP through PDE4 inhibition, which broadly turns down inflammatory signaling. That makes it useful across multiple inflammatory skin diseases, including several that commonly affect the scalp. But for scarring alopecia, treat it as “potentially helpful for symptoms,” not “proven to halt disease,” unless future data says otherwise.",

I started taz in late October.\n\nand listen… this stuff is MAGICAL.  \ndespite being the *strongest retinoid* i’ve ever used, it has never irritated my skin. no burning, no peeling, nothing. within 1.5 months, i had the smoothest skin of my life. i still can’t believe how gentle yet effective it is for me.\n\ncurrent routine:\n\nam:\n\n* Minimalist SA cleanser\n* isntree green tea fresh toner\n* cosrx snail mucin\n* aquasoft ac moisturiser\n* Picspot gel\n* sundrink sunscreen\n\npm:\n\n* garnier micellar water\n* joy pH 5.5 face wash\n\ntaz days (mon/tue/wed/fri/sun):\n\n* aestura lotion *or* minimalist b12 cream\n* taz\n\nthursday (barrier day):\n\n* aestura lotion\n* b4 nappi cream\n\nsaturday:\n\n* formularx lactic acid\n* aquasoft ac\n\ntaz literally did what tret never could for me. if you’re struggling with closed comedones, texture, or tret intolerance, this might be worth looking into.",

      "content": "I am 36F, so i always had tiny pimples here there all my life and sometimes some bad phases with multiple pimples at the same time but would clear in few weeks. thats how human skin behaves unless u use filter to show ur face to the world through social media and never leave the house. \n\nthen came a phase in my life where i got influenced by the over bombardment of skin care routine contents on youtube and insta. and oh the aesthetics the ASMR. and then started the self destruction of my skin. i started using all kinds of serums started finding small issues with my skin i am quite light skinned so small marks show and till 4years back people were not criticising the filters or may be i was living under a rock. n i did not realise that its filter and human skin has marks and pores and lines n they all play their biological role (i wasnt enlightened enough i guess)\n\nn then the problems started the deep pimples that wont go away for months, leaving black dots on my face which was never a problem before, dehydrated skin (i am blessed with a supple full skin thanks to my mother who is 65 barely looks 55) but i felt my skin stripped off all of that then larger pores and then more defined lines. AND NOT ONCE I QUESTIONED MY \"ROUTINES\". \n\nthe desperate phase: i tried everything wasting money time and mental peace. my BF lives in US i visit him sometimes and even bought products and serums not available in India just to fix my skin. nothing helped. i even went to docs and did two courses of tretonin (helped for few months but problems recurred) i have lived in north and south india switching jobs and no amount of \"environment change\" fixed my skin suffered for 4 straight years. \n\nthen i just stopped and thats why i am sharing this may be it will help someone. i just stopped all products. i started reading more about skin barrier and how serums exfoliate and over exfoliation destroys skin barrier. i just stopped everything and only started applying basic moisturiser but with extreme dedication applied sunscreen. \n\ni invested in good sunscreens. i had never applied sunscreens so much. always found them greasy would apply only when i am going to office. and never reapplied after few hours even when i am out in blazing sun. but then i started ordering sunscreens korean and others wasted money used the ones i didnt like on my body but finally landed on a a good one. \n\nand man oh man did it work. i religiously apply the sunscreen twice in a day, use most basic moisturiser and use most gentle face wash. its only been 2 months but my skin is so much clearer my marks r fading i am having less and less of acne (barely any) i can feel the hydration returning to my face. and i am so happy. \n\nskin care companies just bombard us with their products thanks to unregulated social media giving us \"advice\" how to live our own lives and cloud our own judgement and intution. skin care routine type content is a cult. we dont need much at all. i completely destroyed my god given healthy skin. \n\ni never post on reddit but i understand the feeling of seeing new pimples and having lots on ur face and the stress of nothing working. i hope someone reads this and it helps someone. \n\nPS since Reddit sells its content to AI companies now i can help train the AI models to stop prescribing acids after acids and just prescribe basic skin hygiene and care routines lol",

      "content": "Hi all. I'm 28 and have been struggling with bacne since I was a teen. I am so tired of having acne and not being able to get rid of it. Please give me advice on what I'm doing wrong, what to try next, and any suggestions that might help. I currently cannot afford to see a dermatologist and am on a budget with products. Here is my current routine:\n\nI use an african net sponge to scrub my body with all the products I use. First I apply Neutrogena Body Clear Acne Body Wash in the shower. I wash that off then follow it up with Panoxyl and Nizoral, and let those products sit for several minutes before washing off. My hair is the last thing I wash in the shower and I flip it upside down so that way my shampoo and conditioner don't touch my back. After the shower I use Pacifica Bacne Warrior 2% Salicylic Acid spray and let it dry then moisturize my back with lotion. This is my routine every shower, and I shower every other day. I also sleep with a bonnet and otherwise have my hair in a bun every day so my hair doesn't touch my back.\n\nI'm not sure if this is hormonal acne, bacterial or fungal. I have an IUD and no longer have periods. I did have chest acne but my routine cleared it. I do still occasionally have acne on my face. Before this routine my body acne was bigger, itchier, and rougher. The acne I get on my back is mostly smaller pimples with whiteheads, with a big pimple on occasion. I've been using this product/shower routine for over a year now and besides slightly smoother skin, I'm not noticing much of a difference in acne. My husband notices break outs on my back pretty often, and I am just getting so discouraged that I'll ever fully get rid of this acne.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "title": "Any tips on keeping the “soft” and “wet” feeling hair? (Please read the body text)",
      "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI’ve been blessed to have the privilege of growing cool curly hair after going through chemotherapy treatment, and I need some tips on dealing with it. I’m a complete noob at dealing with curly hair, so forgive my lack of knowledge on the topic.\n\nI haven’t cut my hair ever since it started growing again, and now I got long curly hair to deal with. I didn’t cut it because I honestly didn’t know what haircut to get, since being curly was a completely new thing to me, and one of the coolest things I’ve found about having curly hair is that you could just shower and dry it and the curls will make it look like you styled the hair, so styling my hair hasn’t been a big issue for me so far. \n\nIt’s been way more complicated now that the hair is a lot longer. Most of the time I wear a metal headband to hold the hair back, but I’m not a big fan of the way it looks. I like the more “natural” styling in the first photo, and here’s where the reason for my post arises: the curls are too curly, and I’m wondering if I can do anything about it 😭\n\nI don’t know what the proper name for this styling is, but in my head I associate it with a more organized John wick/tame impala when he has long hair hairstyle 😭😭😭 I also like having the wet + conditioner hair in the “Jesus” hairstyle, but again, it coils up as it dries, and it looks like my head is growing sheep hair. \n\nThe first photo is taken after I comb it back with my hands after a shower, after applying Camille Rose Leave-In Conditioner. The second photo is taken 30 minutes later. I love the way the hair looks and feels when it’s still a little wet and soft right after I apply the leave-in conditioner, however, with time it dries up and the hair coils up, killing the more organized and “straight” hair, and making it significantly more difficult to try to style it with my hands, which would be pointless because the hair is sprung up, so it wouldn’t lay the way it want it to regardless.\n\nI’ve tried using hair pomade for curly hair after applying the leave-in conditioner, but it hasn’t been as effective as I would’ve liked to. It makes the hair feel like plastic/feel artificial, and adjusting the hair with my hand throughout the day seems to break the bonds created by the pomade, which then destroys the hairstyle. \n\nOn the other side, I love how the hair looks and feels after conditioner has just been applied, however, it becomes too soft and doesn’t really hold the hairstyle, leading to hair strands falling onto my face which is not optimal for me.\n\nBasically, I’m looking for a solution somewhere between very soft hair and glued hair that makes it feel like I’m wearing a helmet. From what I’m understanding, the hair will need something heavy to “weigh” down the coiling, like the water + conditioner combo and pomade do, but are these the only two options? No one in my family and none of my guy friends have long curly hair like this, so I honestly don’t know who else I could ask for useful advice. \n\nI just noticed the notification from the moderators saying that I need to share my routine:\n\n\\- I only use shampoo about two times a week. I brush my hair in the shower while the shampoo is still on the hair to detangle it. Up until yesterday I used some generic shampoo + conditioner product from target  that I had a full tub of since before my straight hair fell off. I felt bad about having to throw it away because it wasn’t for curly hair, but it was getting the job done, so I just went with it. Yesterday I bought Aussie shampoo and Aussie conditioner, both with rice water. I went with them because they were the only option I could find at my local Hy-Vee for curly hair, and they seemed reasonably priced to me.\n\n\\- On days when I want my hair to look organized, I dry my hair with a towel a little bit, before applying the leave-in conditioner, followed by air drying it after I put on the metal headband.\n\n\\- On days when I don’t care how my hair looks, I dry my hair with a towel a little bit, and either air dry it, or dry it with a fan if I have to go outside when it’s cold.\n\n\\- I don’t protect the hair in any way when I sleep.\n\nThe photos I’ve attached were taken over two months ago, so my hair is even longer now, and I’m considering cutting it in the upcoming days, but I figured I’ll ask you guys for advice first, in case you might have a solution to my problem. This is the longest I’ve ever had my hair grow out in my life, so I’m learning how to deal with long hair on top of them being curly now. I LOVEEEE how it looks when it’s wet, but dealing with it when it’s dry has been a pain that doesn’t really seem to have any upsides.\n\nSorry for the yapping and for the hideous blurring of my face. Thanks in advance to anyone that takes the time to read this and reply :)",

I feel it's gotten worse over time and I'm at a real loss of what to do.\n\nAcne and blackheads affects my face, shoulders, arms, legs, buttocks. \n\n​I decided to try a new skincare routine recently, plus I have also started using a mini pill (cerelle) and I feel my skin is worse it's been in a while.\n\n​My skincare, twice a day, all products are Yepoda:\n\n​Oil cleansing balm \nSalicylic acid cleansing foam \nHyaluronic acid face mist\nDay/Night moisturising cream\n\n​I've been washing my face twice a day, plus also in the shower.\n\n​For my showers, I wash my face and body I use a Salicylic Acid &amp; LHA 2% body wash.\n\n​My diet hasn't really changed. I don't eat a lot of dairy or sugar generally. I don't take any vitamins. I have been going through a lot of stress in life recently. I haven't been drinking much either.\n\n​I will also admit, I was influenced on Instagram to buy the skincare set but I don't really know if its doing anything... clearly not... been using for 2 months now. \n\n​I'm really at a loss and so desperate for help. I've googled what to do but I'm really overwhelmed with the amount of options out there. I have thousands of these tiny blackheads all over, plus hundreds of these small white spots filled with pus :( I feel so disgusting. \n\nI have major problems with shaving and razor bumps too. I have never had a clean shave without any all over my legs and intimate area. I've resorted to hair removal cream which seemed to help a bit. But I still get pus filled red pimples on my buttocks and legs/thighs. I'm very pale so it looks really bad when inflamed. \n\n​Can anyone share a skincare routine that genuinely changed their life?\n\n​Please no affiliate stories or links, I'm so tired of influences faking everything for money. I'm just a simple girl, trying to make my skin look better, so I can feel a lot better in my own skin.\n​",

I have very dry skin naturally, though it did get notably worse after starting some low-level acne cream treatment. I've since stopped the treatment since it didn't really help enough and honestly just caused pain. Unsure what exactly it was, but I can dig the bottle out if it makes any difference.\n\nSince then, I've been trying to generally just take care of my skin, but even washing with a simple face wash + moisturiser 2x a day dries my skin out to the point of noticeably flaky skin around my eyes, mouth and T-zone and pain at times. It seems to be a lot more manageable if I just wash it once a day.\n\nHonestly, it might be more of a dermatologist-type thing, but I wanted to see if there was anything I could try before going that far. Just anything I can both use to help stop the dry skin and also form a basic routine that won't cause worse dry skin.",

I had previously been using Neutrogena's Sheer Zinc (the yellow one) but it has unfortunately been discontinued :(\n\nI'm currently using The Derma Co.'s Ultra Light Zinc Mineral Sunscreen and faced zero issues so far , especially regarding it breaking me out given it's thick consistency, the only con being it being difficult to cleanse (needs double cleansing) which is feasible since I usually wear it under makeup when going out. Besides that it is slightly sticky for humid weather since I live in Kolkata so I alternate it with The Derma Co'.s Ultra Matte Sunscreen (the spf 60 one) during summer, which also has a nice primer like texture. \n\nBut with all the outrage and heat the derma co has been catching on the internet regarding its sunscreens, I'm slightly skeptical about their sun protection which is my no. 1 priority when picking out a sunscreen, so if anyone could verify whether these particular sunscreens give adequate sun protection and has tested them out, please let me know whether I should continue using them since I haven't really encountered any side effects or purging (white cast not being an issue) while using them.\nSuggestions for similar or better sunscreens are welcome :)",

I had almost platinum blonde hair 6 months ago that was very damaged so I went back to my hairdresser and went back natural and got lowlights put in and it toned down to a more natural light brown however it has faded to this blonde warm colour or dark blonde?? It truly looks so different with every angle or lighting. I want to cool it a bit more and stop it from looking so warm as it's a bit jarring on my pale skin! I'm hating the orangy tints in it Can anyone recommend a toner or shampoo/ conditioner that may assist in this ?\nThankyou!",
