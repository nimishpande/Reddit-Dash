      "content": "I spent months searching for the perfect hair stylist to help me style my curls for my wedding day. The first stylist I found had beautiful photos from past brides, but no curly haired brides. During our consultation call the artist insisted I come in with dry hair with no product for my hair trial🙃. I convinced her to at least let me prep my hair with all my normal products so she could style it without having to worry about applying product. When we finished our trial I was let down because my hair, even with all my products was so fizzy and didn’t look as good as I had hoped. Don’t get me wrong, this artist does a great job doing bridal hair, but didn’t know how to handle my curls.\n\nI then reached out to a hair artist who I had been stalking on social media and specialized in curly hair. She was much more expensive but based off her posts on social media I knew she would be worth it. I trusted her so much just based off our texts and calls I decided to skip a hair trial. Come day of my wedding she gave me the most perfect hair I could ever dream of. My hair had definition and great volume! I’ll never ever regret embracing my curls on my wedding day, it made me feel so beautiful to embrace my natural beauty. So if you’re getting married soon and thinking about rocking your curls, invest in an artist that specializes in curly hair so you feel like the most beautiful version of yourself!!!\n\nFYI I did my normal wash day routine using the Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Shampoo and Conditioner. My hair artist applied only Rizos Curls products, not sure exactly which products but that’s the only brand she said she uses for her curly hair brides. ",

I generally love my curly hair, but I don't often wear it down because there's one section of my head that grows almost straight and incredibly fluffy (and has for all 25 years of my life). It's unfortunately really noticeable when I wear my hair naturally, standing out from the curl pattern on the rest of my head, and it bothers me a lot. Styling doesn't help, as this section won't hold a curl no matter how much product I add or how much scrunching I do.\n\nDoes anyone have ideas for what I could do to make this section curly? Maybe per.m this piece? Have you experienced this and found a solution that you like? Thanks in advance :)\n\nThe first image is my normal curl pattern on most of my head and the other two images show the straighter section in different lighting. Sorry they're bad! Trying to avoid doxxing myself\n\n\\[Irrelevant but as required, my routine: I use the Herbal Essences Jojoba Oil &amp; Lavender Curls Shampoo (infrequently) and Aussie Miracle Curls with Coconut Oil Conditioner in the shower, then the Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine Leave In Conditioner and Odele Air Dry Styler (wouldn't recommend) right out of the shower before air drying.\\]",

My skin does feel a bit more hydrated.\n\nI also bought a red LED therapy panel, because honestly, I feel lost and just want to find something that helps.\n\nI’ve tried salicylic acid before, but it was super irritating. Tretinoin seemed to work better for me, but since I’ve been focusing on barrier repair, the last time I used it, it caused a lot of irritation.\n\nI have some rosacea, and while azelaic acid has helped before, it also tends to irritate me if I’m not careful.\n\nIf anyone has experience with similar skin (textured, sensitive, slightly rosacea-prone),\nwhat would you change or add to my routine?\n\nAny advice would mean so much 🤍",

With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Since then, I've cut down  my routine a lot. Here's what I do:\n\n-either generic H&amp;S shampoo, Ion sulfate free colorsafe shampoo, aussie wavy shampoo, or whatever I have. My hair's not picky.\n-loreal hyaluron plump conditioner (purple one). Sometimes I use a deep conditioner, especially after clarifying shampoo (mostly used to fade color)- again, whatever I have, rn that's daily dose deep conditioner, eva nyc hair therapy mask, or the Sauce honey chia mask that I have a sample of (bit heavy for me tho).\n-one of several spray leave ins (eva nyc 10 in 1, daily dose leave in, nutri ox leave in, often i get some free at work so it rotates.)\n-l3vel 3 salt spray \n-ion sun care air dry cream (not used in pictures, just bought it)\n\nI just wash, condition, towel dry/scrunch, spray, and scrunch with a T shirt.\n\nYou can go to my post history to see my previous routines, but I stopped using mousse and gel as despite the hold, they made my hair super stringy looking.\n\nMy issue is that my hair is super wavy when wet (pictured), but it dries mostly straight! My hair is layered and fairly healthy as well so I think it's mostly a styling issue. I just want it to dry wavier without being stringy or crunchy or having to diffuse! Thank u :)\n\n",

Just… another 5 years, bros. (Okay, I can’t stop making jokes.)\n\nHere’s the new mechanism: *“As per researchers, the irritant leads immune cells to move into the layer of fat beneath the mouse's skin. This signals the fat cells to release fatty acids that are absorbed by the hair follicle stem cells, thus triggering hair growth.”*\n\nSo basically, we can add topical fatty acids to our sugar-topical regimen. If someone’s hungry, they could just lick my bald spots, win-win.\n\nAnyways, has anyone read about this? What’s your opinion? Could it be a nice addition to one’s stack?

As I got out of the shower I started smelling something that seemed like sewage. I checked around the house for a bit before realizing it's my hair that smells like that!\n\nI washed it again, and the smell is still there!\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that a couple of days ago I went to a salon for a shampoo + style package. I had gone there before. They used the same shampoo as before. But while they previously styled my hair with just a hairdryer and a brush, this time they used a hair straightener. While they used It, It smelled like something burnt a bit, but I am not used to it so I figured it was business as usual, as nobody seemed to mind.\n\nCould the smell be due to some chemicals left on the streightener? How do I fix it? \n\nThe smell is not on my scalp, which further proves it's not the water and it might have indeed been the straightener. \n\nI have long straight hair that reaches below my waist. I need to go to work tomorrow and I smell like sewage! 😭\n\nUPDATE: It's not the water. I went to my mother's and washed my hair there. Same smell.\n\nNow thinking that it might be residual formaldehyde from somebody else's treatment, transferred through the streightener. Apparently, formaldehyde can smell like a musty basement, which would kinda be a fitting description for how my hair currently smells.\n\nI'm more interested in finding a solution rather than the cause of it all, to be honest. Just tried an apple cider vinegar rinse with only a slight improvement.",

And also have just started wearing make-up regularly, over the last year or so.\n\nI’ve been buying all kinds of products and spending all this money I don’t have, and would like to know what would be necessary for a solid routine at this point?\n\n**Also, quick note**: I’ve lost around 200 pounds over the last 3ish years. So, I have tons of excess skin all over my body (have a picof arms after working out so you can see), and maybe you can tell in my face and neck, though thankfully, I didn’t carry a lot of weight there. I’m just very grateful for my health now, which got me wanting to pay attention to my appearance.\n\nI have sensitive, combo skin &amp; still have some occasional acne + acne scarring/sun spots. Currently, trying to fade some acne scarring on my left cheek.\n\n**Nighttime routine:**\n\n\\-double cleanse -occasional Prequel milk exfoliant -Mediccube zero poor pad -just started Anua niacinamide + txa serum   \n\\-15% azelaic acid (prescription but not sure if it’s doing anything, lol)   \n\\-Prequel half &amp; half moisturizer -differin gel like once a week   \n\\-Medik8 crystal retinal 3 (all other nights)   \n\\-barrier moisturizer like Bioderma Atoderm or Aestura Atobarrier\n\n**Morning:**   \n\\-quick cleanse with Aveeno calm &amp; restore   \n\\-Mediccube zero poor pad   \n\\-vitamin C Trueskin or Naturiam(but would love good suggestions, or does it have to be the Skinceuticals?)   \n\\-moisterize w/ Clininique dramatically different gel   \n\\-tinted sunscreen (Paula’s Choice mineral age restore or Supergoop mineral matte screen)   \n\\-makeup (base usually BareMinerals Complexion Rescue)\n\n***What would you be adding or take away so that I can look as cute as possible for awhile, short of surgery until later?*** (pla to have skin removal on body at some point)  \n  \n**\\*A**lso, need to dye hair (I just like covering the gray but have been busy)  \n  \nTYIA. 🙏\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l5m5st6fyoxf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a7fb3dfad09c17e05f0969067c92edc62939572\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/risyd76fyoxf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c01277ced5ceaaa74ae320280ca7b086f36328ff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ng5yg66fyoxf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=938e1dba69cb2d69dd6ecaa4cdd9355839e1a0bb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/opg99i6fyoxf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2528f398afc23e17d6f08a7432e3f7ec1d2ae21\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uap8s96fyoxf1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1a00ec933187d4559c39ce351346a80e9460096\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wwu6t66fyoxf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=582d061b928c573ca9206bff0ae972afaa48f28e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v3md466fyoxf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94e840b8f4deaac56f012bf5aa35874bcc43f125\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yfjyj66fyoxf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4d79c9bf8d543c6548ae54976ad3a1491d897da\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/489jz56fyoxf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63463d4be512e6760ebf02f87ca343bf9c012dfd",

      "content": "Hello! I’m looking for some advice on my skincare routine. I’m 24 years old and I feel like I could be doing more for my skin. I have combination skin that is acne-prone, dehydrated and prone to redness. The acne I have is hormonal around my chin which my dual hormonal birth control has helped with but it’s not gone completely. I also do have a bit of congestion on my forehead and I’ve recently gotten some bumps around my nose. \n\nHere are the products I’ve tried in the past but made my issues worse. I figured it might be helpful ! ⬇️\n1. Skin 1004 - Centella Sunscreen \n2. Anua - Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil\n3. Anua - Heartleaf Quercentinol Pore Deep Cleansing Foam\n4. Byoma - Barrier and Repair Treatment \n5. The Inkey List - Super Solutions 10% Azelaic Serum\n6. Torriden - Dive In Hyaluronic Acid Serum \n\nMy current routine ⬇️\n1. Grown Alchemist - Gentle Gel Facial Cleanser \n2. Cocokind - Calming Magnesium Mist \n3. Grown Alchemist - Skin Renewal Day Cream\n4. Dr Dennis Gross - Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel Pads (I love this stuff)  \n5. Youth To The People - Youthscreen Sunscreen \n\nProducts I’m interested in ⬇️ \n1. Prequel - Gleanser + SA \n2. Prequel - Pre Gleanse\n3. Prequel - Half &amp; Half \n4. Experiment - Molecular Mesh \n5. Stratia - Lipid Gold \n6. Stratia - Interface \n7. Cocokind - Electrolyte Water Cream \n\nWith my current routine, I find myself unimpressed with the products I use - my skin hasn’t gotten worse but it hasn’t gotten better. The cleanser is nice but I think is a bit drying and lately my moisturiser has been burning my skin, only a small amount (I’m wondering if it’s the niacinamide). The only two products I’m impressed with are the daily peel pads and the calming mist. The daily peel pads are really helpful with my congestion and hormonal acne but I still have some lingering spots which are super stubborn. The mist feels refreshing and does help with redness. \n\nThe reason I want to try the products I listed is because I’ve seen them over this subreddit and Tik-Tok. I want to know if it’s really worth the hype! I see the high praises these products get but I’m worried I’m seeing undisclosed sponsorships. I also can’t afford my routine. I tried the products on a whim but it’s expensive and honestly, not the most responsible purchases. The only thing I don’t mind spending money on are the peel pads, I purchase the $20 pack and cut them up so they last longer. \n\nI would love to hear what you guys think of my routine and the products I’m eyeing. What I should swap, what your personal experiences are, what products I didn’t list but should add, whatever your thoughts and options are please let me know! \nI know it isn’t perfect but I love my skin and I need to treat it better! It’s an organ after all lol",
