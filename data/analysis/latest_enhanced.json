      "content": "Hi everyone. About six months ago I posted here in a pretty desperate mood and shared a picture of what I thought was my completely unrully hair. Even back then some people were sceptical, because my hair can look good sometimes, but the issue was always that it only lasted for a day. After that the curls disappeared and I had to redo everything every single morning, which was exhausting.\n\nFor context, I straightened my hair from around age 13 for almost ten years. I have only been properly embracing my natural curls for about a year and a half, so I am definitely still figuring things out.\n\nA few months ago I got the full Bali Curls line as a gift, and since then I have actually stuck to one routine. I now wash my hair with the Bali Curls Nourishing Shampoo and Bali Curls Nourishing Conditioner, brush it while it is wet, then comb through a small amount of Bali Curls Curl Cream. After that I apply a generous but not excessive amount of the Bali Curls Curl Defining Gel. I learned the hard way that too much gel just makes my hair feel heavy and lifeless (even though a lot of peole commented on my last post that theres no such a thing as too much gel, thats just not how it works for me)\n\nI scrunch with a cotton T shirt, plop for a few minutes, then diffuse. I start diffusing without touching my hair and only scrunch later. I never fully dry it because that would take forever. After about half an hour I scrunch in a bit of hair oil (honetsly I just use whatever brand is at my hands) and that is usually when things start looking good. I also use the Bali Curls Heat Protection Spray whenever I diffuse.\n\nOn non wash days I refresh with water from a spray bottle and usually diffuse a little in the morning if I am going out. I do not add extra product. The biggest change is that my hair now actually lasts. It still needs refreshing, but it does not completely fall apart anymore, and it finally looks like curls instead of a daily mystery.\n\nThanks again to everyone who commented on my original post. You were more right than I wanted to admit.",

I got the Cetaphil daily facial moisturizer SPF 35 and really like it so far however I didn’t realize how expensive and how small bottles are for facial sunscreen. Also, I am applying in the morning and I’m reading that I may need to apply at least one more time during the day which would probably put me through two bottles a month.\n\nAre there any cheaper products out there that are still designed for your face? I have normal to oily skin so I don’t wanna just put regular sunscreen on which will smell really bad and clog my pores. Alternatively, I could use the Cetaphil in the morning and then, if there’s a cheaper option to use in the afternoon if I need to reapply.\n\nThanks for all your help answering these stupid questions",

If the specifics matter, I just finished a 5-day pulse of 1000 mg/day and will be doing a similar dose once a month going forward.\n\nBefore starting the steroids, I didn't really have any concerns with my skin. I had some acne and dryness, but I didn't really worry about it or put very much effort into skincare. I pretty much just used whatever was gifted to me, and I wasn't very consistent about it.\n\nHowever, after starting the steroids, my skin has become very dry, textured, and acne-prone. I have a lot of acne in my mouth area, as well as my cheeks, hairline, and even my back and chest area. I would really like to reduce this acne and prevent scarring if possible.\n\nMy current routine is: micellar water for makeup removal, Clinique acne foaming cleanser (I also got the Shiseido deep cleansing foam for Christmas, and I'm wondering if I should switch to that one), Clinique acne solutions toner, Differin adapalene gel, and Cetaphil rich hydrating cream.\n\nThe last two were recommended by a nurse, and I've been really liking them so far, but I'd really appreciate some more feedback/suggestions. I'm open to buying pretty much anything if the price is reasonable, but I don't really have the capacity for a very extensive routine at the moment. I'm really bad at being consistent with skincare because of my health, but I will try my best because it's really affecting my confidence.",

      "content": "For context, I’m a 17F living in Brazil. I have mild acne concentrated in the T-zone, mostly pustules and whiteheads.\nMy current dermatologist prescribed Differin 0.3% for nightly use. Only now do I realize how strong that concentration is.\nPreviously, with another dermatologist, I used adapalene 0.1% combined with La Roche-Posay Effaclar (Concentrated). That combination actually cleared my acne very well, but over time my skin became extremely dry and started peeling. Everything I applied burned intensely and was painful. That dermatologist didn’t prescribe a moisturizer at all. At my second appointment, she told me to switch Effaclar to the High Tolerance version, but that made no difference—my skin looked exactly the same for weeks, until I eventually finished the adapalene 0.1% tube.\nWith my current dermatologist, this is the routine she prescribed:\nAM:\n– Avène Cleanance Cleansing Gel (for oily, sensitive skin)\n– Eucerin serum for oily skin and hyperpigmentation\n– La Roche-Posay Anthelios Airlicium SPF 80\nPM:\n– Avène Cleanance Cleansing Gel\n– Dermage “Secatriz” moisturizer (a Brazilian brand; very lightweight—I’m not sure it’s doing much, though I was already using it before)\n– Differin Gel 0.3%\nI jumped straight into using all of this daily 😭\nNow, one month in, I feel like it’s doing nothing for my acne. I went through my usual menstrual breakout, and my skin handled it worse than it did before I started adapalene. I wake up with my T-zone extremely oily—something that hadn’t happened to me in years—and my skin gets oily much faster throughout the day. It doesn’t feel dry at all, and instead has developed a constant shine.\nI don’t know if this is just the purging phase, but I’m honestly afraid to keep going. Would it make sense to reduce how often I use adapalene during the week? Should I switch moisturizers—or do both? I’m really unsure.\nShe told me to come back in 3–4 months, but I’m already at the end of month one and seriously considering booking another appointment. Should I? If my skin were dry or irritated, I’d understand what’s happening—but increased oiliness and more acne are really discouraging.\nThank you so much for any advice or recommendations.\n",

I have to say this product is kinda decent, especially for oily acne-prone skin like me. I heard someone said it might ball up after layering makeup, but I normally just use a hydrating serum, moisturizer and sunscreen, so it works for me. The reason I bought this is because I want to address my redness and hyperpigmentation, and it indeed removed my hyperpigmentation but it really takes time. Lots of TikTok videos show that the hyperpigmentation would just be gone within a week, and I have to say, it’s not that magical. Aside from that, the texture likes a silky gel, which I like.\n",
