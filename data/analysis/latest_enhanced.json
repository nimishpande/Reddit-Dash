Every time I look up how to look better without makeup on TikTok or YouTube, all of the advice is from people who already are naturally beautiful or surgically enhanced. \nI don’t have the money for fillers or micro blading. I havent had a proper hair cut in years. I have quite a prominent, straight nose, and uneven eyebrows no matter how I try to do them. I feel that this asymmetry is not doing me any favours. My question is: what are some basic things that take little time or money to invest, that I can do to enhance my looks without makeup? Thanks I’m advance. ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

That gel was discontinued a few years ago, and I have literally bought nearly a dozen different gels since then, hoping that one of them would be similar, with nearly zero success.  The only one I've tried that is even remotely close is Aussie's Instant Volume Gel, but it's only 60-70% close and my hair just does not cooperate with it very well.  I've resorted to paying overinflated prices on ebay, but it's even getting hard to find on there.  I even emailed Pantene Customer Service recently, and their recommendation (Pantene Flexible Waves &amp; Curls Gel) was absolutely terrible - very watery, zero Hold.  If anyone used to use this gel and has found something that is very similar in texture and hold, PLEASE let me know.  Here is a list of everything that I've tried and doesn't come even remotely close:\n\n* Aussie Instant Freeze\n* Pantene Flexible Waves &amp; Curls Gel\n* L'Oreal Studio Line Clean Gel\n* L'Oreal Studio Line Mega Gel\n* American Crew Firm Hold Styling Gel\n* Agadir Men Oud Wood Firm Hold Gel\n* Johnny B Fuddy Matte Styling Gel\n* Garnier Pure Clean Extra Strong Styling Gel\n* Aussie Instant Volume Gel\n* Redken Hardwear 16 from like 15 years ago",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I have been struggling with my acne recently and wanted some recommendations for gentle exfoliator for sensitive skin and acne advice if anyone has some! \n\nI started getting acne when I was a junior in college after never having had it before. I originally started using tretinoin for about 5 months but it honestly broke me out worse so I stopped. I recently graduated and want to get my skin under control. My dermatologist recently prescribed me clindamycin (which I’ve been using for about a month), 100mg of spironolactone (which I’ve been taking for about a week), and aklief (which I have used twice this week). I can tell that I am going to get some peeling from the aklief. I was wondering if anyone could suggest a exfoliator that is gentle yet will help with the peeling skin. I’ve tried Paula’s but it was to harsh for me. I was my face with cerve hydrating facial cleanser and moisture with cerve daily moisturizing lotion. Although up until recently I was using keihls anti acne moisturizing cream. Please let me know what you guys think about this mix/ any advice that might be helpful! Sorry this was so long winded and thank you if you read all this! ",

We’ve tried a number of different shampoos, conditioners, gels, overnight curlers, skala, etc and nothing seems to help. Hairdressers have suggested shorter layers at the back, which we’ve done, and using pipe cleaners as overnight curlers but that didn’t keep either. \n\nWe do air dry as kiddo has AuDHD and can’t handle the sound of the hairdryer, and we use silk pillowcases as he also doesn’t like keeping bonnets on - he’s a side sleeper so he’s not laying directly on the back. We’ve also tried using a mini curling iron which worked for short periods, but I mostly avoid using that sort of heat on his hair. \n\nI assume it’s just two different hair types but it drives me nuts because he’s so beautifully curly at the front. Does anyone here have experience with this sort of thing and have advice or things I haven’t tried yet? TIA. ",

Another mixed girl with a yt mother who didn’t know or care to learn how to do her hair 👋🏼😐 As of the last 2 years, I haven’t gotten any chemical treatment and it is now almost completely grown out (I’ve also been cutting it off in like 2-3in increments periodically). Now I just have terrible heat damage. I have NO IDEA how to do anything with my hair. I’ve been educating myself in the last couple weeks and bought a whole bunch of products. As of the last week, I stopped using heat on my hair and learning how to manage it day to day with no heat &amp; no slick backs. I’m going to be trying to learn how to braid, too, but that’s gonna take me a minute 🤣\n\nAnyway, right now my routine: I use Camille Rose Curl Love shampoo, conditioner, and leave in. During the day, I’ve been working on learning how to define my curls (that are currently non-existent). I start with a wet head, leave in (Curl Love), comb that in, section hair, curl crème (As I Am), scrunch, gel (Combat Gel watered down a bit), scrunch, then air dry or regular hair dryer. I bought a diffuser but I don’t have it yet At night, I rinse the day products out and put in a mask. I’ve been alternating every other day with Texture ID deep treatment mask and Shea Moisture Intensive Hydration mask.\n\nI am getting a hair cut (not a big chop, but the rest of my processed hair) next week, I wanted to get it professionally cut since I’ve been doing it myself. What else? What other products? Advice? Anything haha. Thank you!\n\n*First pic is dried, styled, scrunched, all that lol. Second pic is wet with leave-in",

      "title": "[Acne] Is my acne hormonal, diet-based, bacterial? Any solutions other than changing products?",
      "content": "First 3 photos are October, next 3 November, 1 from December, and last 3 are January.\n\nHello! I have struggled with acne since I was 10-12 (idk when exactly) and I’m now 20 and still have it. I guess I’m just coming on here to see if anyone knows any products or things that could help me. My brain really wants to believe that this is all either hormonal or diet-based, because my brother and sister both had acne growing up but got rid of it completely by 18 or so, yet here I am. My skin has always been very oily, but it does often feel super dry after I wash it. I started using hyaluronic acid recently and that has helped a lot I think with feeling less dry.\n\nIt’s always pretty much looked like the photos, however in prior years the big red pimples have been concentrated on my forehead, not my cheeks, same type of pimples though. In fact, the outer parts of my cheeks NEVER had acne up until a couple months ago. I believe they could be because of either dairy (because I was eating like a pint of ice cream a day) or stress? (rough relationship with someone I met a few months back). As you can see in the last 3 pics that area is doing better now, so I think it’s dairy.\n\nBesides that, my nose is one of my biggest insecurities. Scroll to see up close pics of it. I popped my blackheads like crazy in middle school and now have deep holes left behind all over my nose, especially the sides, don’t think I can do much about that. But the blackheads or sebaceous filaments (both?) are horrendous. You can see them from a mile away. I just want a smooth nose. I think I’m just cursed with large pores as you can see in picture 8 with my ears I also have large visible pores there. Is there anything I can do to make these appear smaller? The blackheads or sebaceous filaments, what can help these?\n\nThe last few months I tried a new routine consisting of:\n\nMorning: gentle cleanser, hyaluronic acid, cerave moisturiser one day. And Murad salicylic acid cleanser, salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid, moisturiser the next day.\n\nNight: gentle cleanser, benzoyl peroxide serum, cerave moisturiser, sometimes a light layer of aquaphor.\n\nI only did that for a few weeks, and I also tried oil cleansing with jojoba oil on my nose a couple times. Didn’t see much of a difference and a few days after I would get white heads on my nose.\n\nA few weeks ago I decided to forget all that and get differin. I used it for like two weeks and then stopped so I never really got to see any difference. My problem is that I’m really bad at doing skincare twice a day, mornings I generally do my routine because I’m leaving the house, but at night… it’s bad. Right now I haven’t done anything to my face at night in almost 3 weeks. I mean tbf the last 3 pictures (from today) look the best, so maybe I need to do less. 🤷‍♀️\n\nSo my question is, do you think this could be hormonal or diet based? If so, what can I do to help? Like if it could be diet based what should I add to my diet, like fiber etc. Or supplements? I really think it all could be diet based because I don’t each much real food, I eat a lotttt of processed packaged stuff. And lots of sugar, I’m addicted. And I’m probably lacking most nutrients, like I’m often dizzy when I stand up. I have a feeling my gut is all fucked up and cleaning that up could help, so how do I do that?\n\nAlso, do you think accutane could be helpful? I really am so sick of this I just want to go on it, especially because it’s not something I have to wash my face every night to use.\n\nI tried tretinoin before, but never consistently. That’s my problem, I can’t wash my face frequently enough to see if anything works. So I’m looking for a solution that doesn’t require me to be super consistent with skincare. I will appreciate any help/advice.",

I went once to get it “professionally” and it took 6 hours and almost $400 for a full highlight 🫣. im not sure if thats average time/pricing, she did tell me she is working to improve her timing and i loved my hair and experience but the price scared me lol. ANYHOW, i went to touch up my THICK money pieces I had got done and did not touch any of the old stuff that was previously beached. I used the wella bleaching powder and wella 30 volume developer then the wella T14 toner. i did not realize my newly bleached hair (that did not lift to a level 9/10) would not tone the same way that the older bleached hair (that was a level 9/10 lift) did. so now i have two different tones of blonde in the front of my head and its bugging me daily. i know… what was i thinking… 😂 well now i have new growth I want to bleach and don’t know how to go about it. \n\nMy question is should i do a round 2 of bleach in the growth i did myself then touch the roots? then tone? If i do that will the almost white toned hair become over-toned? should i go with a glaze instead of a tone to even it out? \n\nFirst picture is a section of the money piece, the line separating the very light stuff from the more golden top section. Second pic is the more golden top section vs the third pic of the very light bottom section. ",

My boyfriend (26 M) works in a hot kitchen every day and is constantly using a steamer. At one point he was burned by it and it’s caused redness that never goes away, plus with how often he’s using the steamer, his skin gets extremely dry to the point of flaking off like eczema almost? His medication he needs to take also causes painful cystic acne everywhere. Is there anything I can do to help keep his skin hydrated at work? Or any treatment we could try to help lessen his redness? The current routine is having him use a lotion for eczema and then applying aquaphor advanced healing ointment on top at night. He uses an exfoliating face wash once a week as well. Thank you for reading, I would really appreciate some advice to help him feel less uncomfortable and heal!",

I brush and comb my hair twice a week whenever I wash it, and I don't do anything else special. I was gifted a curl cream for Christmas (Mielle Brazilian curly cocktail curl cream) but I have no idea what it would even do for my hair tbh. I'm completely clueless. \n\nI also have no idea what my type of hair is, and I don't really have any good pictures of my hair (right now it's wet, so not a good reference) but I think I might have somewhat of a picture in my posts somewhere. \n\nThis might be a stupid post, but I really want to learn how to take care of my hair, so any advice is appreciated.

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

Like 2 months later.. my ends are dry again already! This is my hair like 3 hours after the shower and my bangs already feel so oily. My hair gets really crazy poofy if I brush it so I can’t really do that to help. My hair is just not cute right now and it does not feel great haha! Some parts are oily and some are dry.",
