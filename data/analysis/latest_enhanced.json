      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I got my first curly hair cut this year and it helped a lot. Thanks all and I’m glad y’all exist. \n\nMy routine: I use Prose Shampoo, Prose Conditioner, and then squeeze my hair out and then put Prose Hair crème. And I usually try to air dry, but waiting 2.5 hours is not always fun. These pictures are with only those products and air drying; sometimes I put in a bit of curl defining crème since my hair is rather fine and doesn’t do well with heavy products. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I'd like to ask your opinion on something I'm doing in my routine that I know isn't the norm.\n\nI've been using The Ordinary's AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, and although the official website and user reviews always recommend using it only 1-2 times a week, I'm using it every day: morning and night.\n\nThe reason is that I suffered from nodulocystic acne and had already tried many treatments without success: benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, tretinoin, azelaic acid, etc. Nothing worked well for me. When I started with this peel, I initially used it once a day and saw a small change; then I increased it to twice a day, and that's when I noticed a real improvement: less texture, fewer blackheads, and the pimples practically disappeared.\n\nI've been using it like this for two weeks now, and so far, I haven't had any visible irritation or side effects. My skin feels normal, and I'm actually seeing a significant improvement. I also want to clarify that my skin has always been super resilient: it stings a little, but it's a tolerable burn. And it's not a fake product; I bought it directly from The Ordinary's official website in the US.\n\nAnother detail that might be relevant: I have a dark olive skin tone, but not completely dark. I'm Latino (from Peru), so my skin falls within the medium-to-dark Latino skin tone range, in case that influences how well I tolerate acids.\n\nMy current routine is as follows:\n\nMorning:\n\nCleanser with 2% salicylic acid\n\nPeeling Solution AHA 30% + BHA 2%\n\nHydrating serum\n\nSunscreen\n\n\nNight:\n\nSoap with 4% benzoyl peroxide\n\nPeeling Solution AHA 30% + BHA 2%\n\nHydrating serum\n\nMoisturizer\n\nI know this isn't the recommended routine, but since my skin is tolerating it and I'm seeing results, I wanted to know what you think. Has anyone had a similar experience? Could it be damaging my skin even if I don't notice it yet?\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nI forgot to mention that my skin type is super oily",

Works well for thick, slightly wavy hair growing out\n\n2. Reduces poofiness\n\n3. Won’t worsen seborrheic dermatitis\n\n4. Is good quality / premium\n\n5.

It’s also stretched forward a bit, you can see a faint line on where the free margin should technically be but isn’t.\n\nI have eczema. I’ve been to dermatologists. This all started with my pointer finger when I was around 3 years old. It’s like it’s contagious or something because it spread one by one (thumb, middle, ring, pinky: all on right hand). It’s a little bumpy on my left fingers (excluding pointer), but it’s like they just stopped there.\n\nI’ve used topical nail ointments, hand soaks, vaseline + gloves, I moisturize each time they’re wet. I have never been told I have anything other than eczema, but what could this even be? I have given up at this point, but I’m posting this hoping someone has a clue. It’s not life threatening, but I am slightly concerned for the safety of my nail if it ever decides to recede further and fall off 🥲 Please no lol\n\nAny help SO appreciated please! Thank you so so much.",
