      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have not really posted here before, but about 1,5 years ago I read on here that spearmint could work for hormonal acne. I was suffering from pretty bad post pill acne so I wanted to get rid of it! I ordered some spearmint capsules. I took one a day.\n\nLong story short. My skin improved. But unknowingly, i began to feel worse and worse. Shortly after starting I wrote in my diary that I felt \"kinda flat like being on the pill again\". Which at the time I did not connect to the mint.\n\nOver the last year I developed hormonal issues like heavy periods, painful periods, spotting, low libido, crying spells, insomnia, brain fog and just an overal awfull luteal phase (pmdd symptoms).\n\nWhen looking for solutions online, I FINALLY read somwhere (I think on this subreddit!) that my estrogen dominance issues could have been caused by the spearmint! I quit immediately and felt sooo bad for putting my body through this.\n\nSo now I've quit 1,5 months ago, and my skin is as perfect as it will ever be. There is some more facial and body hair (same as when I quit the oral birth control pill). The spotting is gone.\n\nBut I still dont feel like myself again. My libido has not yet recovered and my mood is also wacky.\n\nSo why this post? For two reasons\n\n1. to warn future users about the possible side effects and to support people who are looking for their symptoms online and haven't found the connection yet\n2. to connect with people who experienced the same, because i feel really alone in this.\n\nWho else experienced this, and how long did it take you to feel better?\n\nThanks so much in advance for any replies",

      "content": "Hello skincare addicts, sharing my journey with skin, expectations, and a bit of self-realization.\nI’m 38M. For most of my life, skincare simply wasn’t something I thought about. No proper routine, no sunscreen, and very little attention to skin health overall.\nMy work later required long hours outdoors, often sunrise to night, several days a week, for a few years. Constant sun exposure, dust, and heat gradually took a toll on my skin and hair. At the time, I didn’t really notice because it was just part of the job.\nIn 2022, a small incident made me pause and look at myself more closely. I happened to really observe my skin in the mirror for the first time in years and realized how much sun damage, tanning, and uneven pigmentation had built up over time. That was the moment I started thinking seriously about skincare.\nAround 2024, I began following skincare discussions on Reddit and social media. Seeing people’s progress motivated me to improve my own skin.\nBut enthusiasm quickly turned into overdoing things.\nI started buying almost every product people recommended, serums, creams, actives without fully understanding what suited my skin. I ended up with more products than I could realistically finish, and mixing things randomly actually irritated my skin instead of helping.\nI did consult a dermatologist and was given a basic routine, but I kept getting distracted by new recommendations instead of sticking to consistency.\nRecently, after learning more about skincare fundamentals and setting realistic expectations,\nI accepted a few important things:\nSkincare takes time and consistency matters more than product quantity.\nYears of sun exposure won’t reverse quickly.\nGenetics determine baseline skin tone, chasing fairness isn’t realistic.\nHealthy, comfortable skin should be the goal, not lighter skin.\nThat realization simplified things for me mentally.\nNow I follow a minimal routine: cleansing, moisturizing, sunscreen, and patience. No product hoarding, no rushing, just steady care. Honestly, this approach feels much better both physically and mentally.\nStill learning and open to advice, I’d genuinely appreciate constructive feedback or shared experiences.\n\nAlso, these are the products I currently have not including the ones already in use or the ones I’ve finished.\n\nTL;DR\nIgnored skincare for years → sun damage → product overload → irritated skin → reality check. Now keeping it simple and focusing on healthy skin, not fairness.",

It’s very cheap and gives you so much more control than regular spray bottles. I’ve found that my hair absorbs products better and maximizes volume more on damp hair rather than soaking wet hair, which is how I used to apply my products.\n\nI also ordered microfiber towels from Amazon and stopped using regular shower towels. Lately I’ve been dealing with a lot of frizz. Normally I don’t mind frizz at all and think it adds character, but it’s been excessive, so I’ve been finger coiling more and it definitely helps tame everything better.\n\nOverall, this routine has made a noticeable difference in how my curls look and feel, especially with volume and frizz control. I’m still tweaking things, but I’ve been really happy with the results so far and wanted to share in case it helps anyone else.",

Their hair grows. It’s called science. You didn’t invent evolution.\n\nLet’s talk about your lack of common sense - you aren’t even a brand that specializes in children. What was the reason you used an infant in an advertisement, in order to have parents feel that their child is growing at an unacceptable rate?\n\nThis isn’t marketing, it’s desperation and to do so using an innocent infant.\n\nShould you, instead of using infants to gain emotional sympathy, focus your time on developing a solid product for adults? You already have a damaged reputation.\n\nSome brands really will stoop to any level to sell.",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

      "content": "Hello everyone! I was wondering if anyone would be able to give ne some advice on how to present my hair as \"professional\" for a job interview (many in fact :p). My hair is puffy, curly, and a bit coarse. If someone could help, I would be eternally grateful. I don't want to chop it off lol, but I have never had someone to help or guide. If you can let me know and I'll send the picture of my hair. I'll post one here, but everyday it changes it's attitude. But always naturally parts in a way that covers my face almost completely.\n\nMy current routine is every 2-3 days using head and shoulders shampoo, tressemme strength conditioner. Sometimes I will add Coconut oil, but I always use Cantu curling cream and the leave in conditioner.\n\nI just let my hair air dry after squeezing out the excess water and towel drying. As far as night protection, I just use silk pillow covers, because no matter what I do my hair always wants to knot.",

At that moment I found the LRP Baume b5 (which I mentioned before) and after this time (closed comedones) I made an appointment with a qualified cosmetologist for an examination. The cosmetics she recommended were great at first, but after a month the barrier repair cream started to close my comedones (again😔) and every time I put on the cream (a pea-sized amount) I felt like I had a thick mask on my face.\n\nand now? my face is still back at the beginning of this whole journey - closed comedones, red spots and acne... I don't know what to do next and what's wrong.\n\nIn the last days, I do research and lot of people (influencers) recommend - neutrogena hydro boost water gel - This is such a terrible cream - it made me even worse than before...\n\nI hope I have described my situation at least a little bit clearly… 🥹\n\nI am already desperate that everything that seemed good will soon do the complete opposite… everything what is ,,non-comedogenic” is for me like hell…\n\nthe only thing I noticed is that in the past I used more natural brands (and they don't hurt me at all - they suited me) although when a pimple appeared - they didn't do anything to it, but they didn't hurt either…\n\nwhat brand of cosmetics would you recommend? I have oily, but now also dry skin in some places, sensitive…\n\nwhen I was looking at the brands, I really liked medik8 cosmetics, do you have any experience with it?? It seemed it can be better than LRP\n\nThank you to everyone who read this far! I appreciate every single comment!🌸✨",

Wash day used to be an actual nightmare that I'd put off until my hair was basically one giant knot.\n\nThe biggest problem for me is sectioning. I'd try to apply the product evenly but without proper clips, half my hair would just fall back down while I was working on another part. Some pieces ended up drenched in leave-in conditioner while others barely got touched. The end result was always this frizzy, uneven mess that made me want to cry.\n\nI tried using whatever I had around the house. Those big claw clips were too weak, they'd slip right out. The smaller ones were too tight and left these awful dents that ruined my curl pattern. Bobby pins were a complete joke. They'd just disappear into my hair like they never existed.\n\nThen I saw this girl on Instagram with her wash day routine and she had these perfect little sections all clipped up neatly. I commented asking what she used and she told me they're just basic sectioning clips that actually grip without creasing.\n\nShe mentioned she got a big pack online for cheap, like 24 clips for around $12 from some wholesale beauty supplier.\n\nI found a similar set on Alibaba and went for it. My hair actually stayed where I put it. I could see what I was doing for the first time ever. The product went on evenly. My curls dried with actual definition instead of that half-done look I'd gotten used to.\n\nWash day went from this two-hour frustrating ordeal to one focused hour where I actually felt in control. My curls have never looked this good and I'm kind of mad nobody told me about this sooner.\n\nIf you've been struggling with managing your hair during wash day, I'm begging you, get proper clips. It's such a small thing but it makes the biggest difference.",

I really regret doing this to myself and it feels like I can't fix it...\nThe ends are the worst but I really don't want to cut much length off since I've been growing it for 2 years (currently waist length). I've been using basic drugstore conditioners like the one from Pantene but it's just not cutting it.\nFor context: I have fine hair even though it's pretty damaged now and my budget is only around $60.
