      "content": "Last few pics are from 2024. It was the exact day I thought, “Hm. Perhaps my hair isn’t straight.” 😂 And then I dived into the curly girl rabbit hole head first.\n\nMy hair was fighting for its life so the first thing I started doing was olaplex no.3 and curlsmith bond repair masks once a week. I alternated between the two.\n\nMy hair was also really thirsty from a lifetime of neglect so I did masks before I washed. This was usually a curlsmith mask. I’m obsessed with the double cream deep quencher. Smells incredible too. Now my hair is really soft so I do this once a month only. (Same with repair masks) I used to use curl cream too until recently. Not sure if I’m stopping completely yet - I’m going by hair feel on wash day.\n\nI tried lots of different routines for a while but one thing that was standard was always styling dripping WET and using a shit load of gel. Like a lot.\n\nCurrent 1x a week wash routine:\n\n•Tootilab shampoo and condish (detangle and brush here) - Clarifying shampoo around every 3 washes or so.\n\n•Tootilab gel. I probably use around a handful. Like a golf ball. I separate top and bottom half of my hair and comb gel through. I don’t usually brush style, I just make sure my hair is wet and smooth/seaweedy before a shake and scrunch. I go upside down, side to side, squish squish squish. You know how it goes. My fingers are pruned in winter.\n\n•Diffuse upside down!\n\n•When it’s around 70% dry - surprise! I add a tad more gel. Smooth it over and scrunch a bit more. Esp on the bottom layers which are a looser curl pattern.\n\n•I use a drop or 2 of olaplex oil for the crunch. Smooth over then shake shake shake.\n\n•I alternate sleeping with a … Bambon? I think it’s called. It’s like a cotton tube. And then I also have silk scarfs that I tie on. That usually works better.\n\n•Refresh is usually just wetting my hands and smoothing and scrunching again. Just to get that slight cast again. On the 3rd/4th day I use mousse and wet a lot more. On 5th/6th it’s cap or bun days with bangs styled.\n\nAny questions, shoot! It’s been a fun learning curve (:",

I have lots of stubborn Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. \nI currently use a gentle facewash (Angel by connote's suggested by a dermat) and moisturizer (cerave), but I’m wondering if adding an oil cleanser before my regular cleanser would actually make a noticeable difference.\nDid double cleansing help with congestion, texture, or breakouts for you?\nIs it worth doing daily or only when wearing sunscreen/makeup?\nWhich oil cleansers (or cleansing balms) have worked well for you, especially if you’re acne-prone or sensitive?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences and recommendations.

      "title": "PP405 Won’t Work: Follicle Is Miniaturized, Fibrosed, And Missing Key Support Cells",
      "content": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb3575\n\nThe foundational understanding of PP405 is based on observations in human and murine hair follicles. When follicles transition from telogen to anagen, there is an increase in lactate and LDH activity in the stem cell bulge. This lactate associated signaling appears to activate hair follicle stem cells and help drive the follicle back into growth. However, these observations were made in otherwise healthy hair follicles.\n\nhttps://www.ishrs-htforum.org/content/25/3/93\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/323809336\\_Androgen\\_modulation\\_of\\_Wntb-catenin\\_signaling\\_in\\_androgenetic\\_alopecia\n\nIn androgenetic alopecia, the stem cells and follicles are not normal and may undergo substantial changes. In some cases, fibrosis can develop in and around the hair follicle. Furthermore, the stem cell niche and dermal papilla cells can be reduced in both number and size, in part due to suppressed WNT signaling.\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4158628/\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12782632/\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/ics.12341\n\nBecause of this, these follicles might not respond the same way. If they are dormant due to AGA, that is not necessarily comparable to the temporary dormancy seen in a typical telogen anagen cycle. In AGA, follicles can appear dormant because stem cell function is impaired and, in some cases, the follicle is structurally compromised, for example through severing of the arrector pili muscle. We know that as androgenetic alopecia progresses, the arrector pili muscle can atrophy. \n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.12921\n\nThis matters because it connects the hair follicle to the bulge region. Without that connection, stem cells may not migrate appropriately toward the follicle to support regeneration and growth. As of now, PP405 has no clear indication that it would reattach or restore that muscle follicle connection.\n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0303742\n\nFinally, we know that once a follicle enters anagen, lactate associated signaling declines. It may not be wise to chronically stimulate and sustain this pathway, especially given that UK5099, which is mechanistically similar to PP405, has been reported to be toxic to human hair follicles. \n\nIt may push them toward a self destructive state, such as premature catagen and telogen, or dystrophic anagen, where the follicle sheds and reduces production due to disrupted cellular energy metabolism. We also do not know what fraction of scalp follicles are truly dormant at any given time, but it is certainly not all of them. So you may be impacting native, functioning follicles and their energy supply by modulating these PP405 adjacent pathways.\n\nJust my thoughts, informed by the literature.",

I am now to this day struggling with dry, frazzled hair, low porosity (the test took 3 days before the strand sank). I have done everything recommended to me by everyone, from washing hair once a week only, coconut oil, argon oil, leave-in's. I've used OGX, which worked for a short while, bondbar which im using now, aussie, hairitage, and native. Even at one point cut 3 inches above the dead ends off. I work an outdoor job, wear a headscarf periodically, i do wear a hat with a silk lining i stitched in. My routine is about once a week (unless i get my hair dirty dirty) i wash my hair with hairitage daily gentle and scrub until ive covered my whole scalp, then condition with bondbar's little white bottle, then ill pat dry and apply a leave in conditioner with coconut oil, I don't use a curl enhancer or whatever unless it's special occasions. I tend to keep my hair in a loose bun or loose pony tail. I'm feeling lost in the whole struggle and I really don't wanna potentially lose my hair. Any tips, advice, product recommendations would greatly be appreciated. I am on a heavy budget so if affordable that would be the biggest help ever!",

I dealed with a lot of frizz but i thought i didnt follow the right hair care. \nUntil 6 months ago.\nNow im thinking, am i delulu, and do i have just straight hair, so i thought i could ask you guys. \nI have mediun thick hair, little bit of layers and hair to the half of my back.\nI tried a couple of things like a curl leave in from liesse, and a japanese mousse from liesse 'wave styling foam' None of the things worked, when its dry its half straight, just not defined and the back of my hair has some defined waves. I dont know what i do wrong, i dont know where to start if i do have wavy hair.\n The first question is, do i have wavy hair or am i just delulu. I added a picture when i have put mousse in it from andrelon, and one fresh out of the shower onkt scrunched a bit. also i do not have a diffuser so i do air drying, but i tried it once and i didnt see any difference though.\n\nRoutine:\n1. In the shower i do regular shampoo twice and conditioner only the tips of my hair.\n2. Rinse the condtioner out and brushing my hair\n3. I do not scrunch, i do like lifting my hair and u will see a wave.\n4. When done showering, when it is soaking wet, i scrunch with bare hands.\n5. After that i use a microfiber towel to scrunch the water out of my hair.\n6 (i dont know) i used the liesse wave foaming mousse and leave in, but it just made it a little bit frizzy. \n7. Air dry , tried the diffuser because i dont have it at home, but didnt see any difference.\n\n\nThank you guys",

I fortunately have always had easy skin so it's been kept to a minimum. I currently use Innisfree Volcanic face wash, the Ordinary barrier repair serum, and the ordinary beta glucan moisturizer. Occasionally I use the Innisfree sunscreen in the morning (I know I need to be better about it). \n\nI will be 27 this year, and I'm starting to notice aging signs. I am a VERY expressive person lol, I have no idea what to use for this, and where to place it in my routine? I've heard retinol, then I've heard it's too strong for beginners. I've heard Tretinoin, but honestly I'm getting more and more confused. Can someone help me figure out what to use and when? \n\nAreas I'd like to focus on are smile lines, forehead lines, and around my eyes. Thank you so much for any help, I am so super appreciative of this sub. I've been learning so much!! hope everyone has a beautiful day 🫶🏼",
