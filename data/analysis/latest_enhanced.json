      "title": "6 months post-HT in Turkey - Did my homework and saved $8k compared to US clinics, My comparison breakdown",
      "content": "Hey Tressless fam,\n\nLong-time lurker, finally ready to share my experience. I'm 6 months post-op from my hair transplant in Turkey and wanted to share my research process since I see a lot of questions about going abroad.\n\n**Background:** 28M, Norwood 3, been on fin for 2 years which stabilized things but wanted to address the temples. Got quotes from 3 US clinics ranging from $12k-$15k for \\~2500 grafts. That's when I started researching Turkey.\n\n**My Research Process:**\n\nI spent 3 months comparing options. Here's what I looked at:\n\n**Turkey Options I Researched:**\n\n* **Smile Hair Clinic (Istanbul)** \\- 4.9/5 on multiple platforms, 4900+ reviews\n* **Vega Hair Clinic (Antalya)** \\- Solid reputation, beach location was tempting\n* **MediHairs (Istanbul)** \\- Good reviews, slightly higher price\n* **ꓧеаꓲtһꓧор packages** \\- Found them through Reddit actually, they work with vetted clinics and handle all the logistics ([https://healthhop.com/hair-transplant-turkey-exclusive-package/](https://healthhop.com/hair-transplant-turkey-exclusive-package/))\n\n**What I compared:**\n\n* Surgeon credentials (this is CRITICAL - don't just go for cheapest)\n* Actual before/after photos (not stock images)\n* What's included (hotel, transfers, aftercare)\n* Technique (FUE vs DHI)\n* Reviews from multiple sources (Reddit, RealSelf, Google)\n\n**My Decision:**\n\nEnded up going through ꓧеаꓲtһꓧор's all-inclusive package ($2,700 vs their regular $3,300 - caught a promotion). Here's why:\n\n1. They pre-vetted the clinics (saved me anxiety)\n2. Everything coordinated - hotel, transfers, translator\n3. 24/7 support (used it twice, super helpful)\n4. Same surgeon did my entire procedure (some clinics use techs)\n\n**What was included:**\n\n* 3 nights at a legit 4-star hotel\n* All transportation (they picked me up at airport)\n* The actual procedure (\\~2800 grafts, they went higher than estimate)\n* Post-op kit and meds\n* Follow-up care\n\n**6 Month Results:**\n\nNot gonna lie, months 2-4 were rough (shock loss, ugly duckling phase). But now at 6 months I'm seeing real density. My hairline looks natural, not pluggy. Still have 6+ months of growth to go but already worth it.\n\n**Cost Breakdown:**\n\n* Turkey (ꓧеаꓲtһꓧор): $2,700 all-in\n* Flight: \\~$800\n* Extra expenses: \\~$300\n* **Total: \\~$3,800**\n\nvs US quote: $12,000+ (just the procedure, no hotel/travel included)\n\n**Saved: \\~$8,200**\n\n**Would I do it again?** 100% yes. But DO YOUR RESEARCH. Not all Turkish clinics are equal. Some are hair mills. I spent hours reading Tressless posts, checking doctor credentials, and comparing options.\n\nHappy to answer questions. Also still on fin (1mg daily) and added min to the routine post-op.\n\n**TL;DR:** Did extensive research, went with vetted Turkey clinic through medical tourism coordinator, saved $8k+ compared to US, 6 months in and results looking solid.",

The Phase IIa trial that read out in June 2025 showed that 31% of male patients with a higher degree of hair loss had a greater than 20% increase in hair density at week eight—which was four weeks after the completion of treatment.

      "content": "Please help y’all I cant for the life of me find something that my hair actually soaks up. It takes me like 3 hours to do my hair and it’s always a let down because it never comes out juicy. I’m currently growing out my keratin treatments for the first time in my 23 years of life. I have never dealt with my natural hair, I’ve gotten relaxers and keratin treatments my whole life. It’s impossible to deal with its always poofy, the front doesn’t curl its just a poof mess. I’ve tried miche gel and it works a but better than anything else but it still doesn’t help the front clump up and curl.\n\nMY ROUTINE: I don’t really use any curly hair shampoo and conditioner. I use whatever shampoo I find in the bathroom (ik tragic) and I skip conditioner and just go in with  Manuka Honey &amp; mafura oil Intensive hydration hair mask by shea moisture , I steam it with a steamer especially my roots. then I either use jamaican black castor oil strengthen and restore leave in conditioner by shea moisture . If I don’t style then I wait for my hair to air dry and put in a single braid. If I do style, I go in with miche gel in sections, focusing on the roots, and use a define brush. I have to force some type of curl in the front bc it just frizzes up and even when i force a curl it’s an extremely poofy curl in the front. In this particular pic I actually just twisted the fronts and when it dries I separate them a bit so they don’t look like just twists only in the front lol. Then I defuse and I make sure to focus on the roots first so they dry first before anything else. I have low porosity hair so even defusing it takes like an hour because it just takes forever to dry.  At night I use a silk bonnet, and silk scrunchy when i pineapple it.\n\nIdk how to refresh my hair without ruining it either lol so I literally just wet everything, brush it out with any conditioner (i dont have a specific curly conditioner) so i’ll just use the maracuja skala in the shower and rinse it out, and then do the miche gel steps again and defuse.\n\nI have two different curl patterns currently (thank u keratin treatments) so I just need help making the roots juicier and not as dry looking as I transition back to my natural hair. My mom is lowkey my biggest hater when it comes to my hair so I just want to prove her wrong that I can take care of it and I can make it look good.",

I think I might have combination skin.\n\nBefore switching cleansers, I was using the Cetaphil Gentle Foaming Cleanser for normal to dry skin. After washing my face, but before applying moisturizer, my cheeks and the lower half of my face would feel tight. I would then use CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion for normal to dry skin.\n\nA few weeks ago, I switched to the CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser for normal to dry skin because I thought it would help with the dryness and tightness. With this cleanser, my skin doesn’t feel tight after washing. However, I’ve noticed that it has caused many more small bumps on my forehead and has made my cheeks worse.\n\nI use all of these products at night. I originally followed this routine every night, then reduced it to every 2–3 days to see if that would make a difference, but the results were the same. I also live in the southeastern US, it’s very humid.\n\nAlso, not sure if this is relevant but I used to have eczema 6 years ago, it kinda went away on its own and I haven’t had a flare up since then.\n\n(2nd pic is my forehead btw)",

I’m looking for some advice or a routine intervention.\n\nAs you can see in the photos, I get these random \"semi-perfect\" curls that actually want to spiral and behave. But the rest of my head? It’s just a frizzy, undefined mess. I know the curls are in there somewhere, but I can’t get them to come out consistently across my whole head.\n\nMy Current Routine (Daily):\n\n1. Wash: Sebamed Everyday Shampoo.\n\n2. Condition: Garnier Banana Hair Food (leave in for 5 mins, then rinse out).\n\n3. Leave-in: Garnier Fructis Aloe Vera Hair Mask (used as a leave-in on wet hair).\n\n4. Technique: Scrunching with a 100% cotton T-shirt.\n\n5. Drying: First, I diffuse with my head upside down (cold/low speed). Then, I let it air dry for a bit while I finish my morning routine. Finally, I finish it off by diffusing with my head right-side up.\n\n6. Finish: Isana Argan Oil scrunched in at the end.\n\n7. Protection: I sleep with a satin bonnet every night.\n\nI’m based in Germany, so I mostly shop at dm or Rossmann. I’m finding that despite this routine, only a few strands clump into that semi-perfect shape while the rest stays chaotic.

Once they had a little natural length, I soaked them off, then got a gel manicure on the natural nail with some cute designs.\n\nIt’s been about a week and I already had three nails break/peel, several are cracking, and most are super bendy. I know one salon visit isn’t going to undo 25+ years of biting, but it honestly feels like the acrylic set and then gel set made already thin nails even weaker.\n\nI’m thinking I need to go back to basics: let them grow under regular polish and forgo enhancements for now. I’m going to the salon today to get plain polish, but I’d really like some advice on pre-treatments or strengthening routines I can do before or ask them to do first.\n\nSo I guess my questions are:\n\n• Any recommended brands or products (serums, oils, hardeners, etc.) that helped you?\n\n• Any salon-appropriate preps or in-chair treatments I can request?\n\n• Should I avoid certain salon services while building strength?\n\nIt’s discouraging to see progress and then have them snap off, so I want something that actually helps instead of just masking the problem.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I'm getting my hair thinned and trimmed on Tuesday\n\nso I have questions..:\n\n\\- What products should I use to begin with? I don't own any right now I just use whatever my mum has lying around the house..so whatever products you guys think would be good (I'm uk/ireland area if that helps for specific products)\n\n\\- how do I maintain it after day 1, usually I just brush it out because it gets frizzy but I want to stop it from going bad like that\n\n\\- how do I style my hair down...? I never wear my hair down and I haven't since I was 8 so I kinda have no idea how to wear my hair down without it getting in my face or just looking stupid \n\n\\- what's better? bonnet or plopping with the shirt?\n\nokay thats all the questions I could think of rn but any advice is great, I have no clue what I'm doing but it seems to be doing alright just a little frizzy ",

I use heat about twice a week with a blow dryer and a blow drying brush. I do not use a separate heat protectant because most of them weigh my hair down. I tried the Living Proof styling spray and it made my hair feel flat and heavy.\n\nNow I am starting to notice damage and I really want to fix it before it gets worse. Can you guys suggest products that actually help with heat damage, especially for fine hair that gets weighed down easily?\n\nI saw Abby Yung recommend K18 and I am thinking about buying it. But after reading reviews I am confused. Some people say it completely transformed their hair and others say it did nothing for them.\n\nI have virgin hair, no color or chemical treatments, so I am not sure if K18 would even make a difference for me.\n\nIf you have used K18, what was your experience? Was it worth the money, especially for fine dry hair?\n\nAny other repair products you would recommend?\n",

I honestly don’t really understand what counts as “too much”.\n\nHere’s what I’m using:\n\nAM:\n\nCeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser\n\nGood Molecules Niacinamide Brightening Toner\n\nCeraVe Skin Renewing Vitamin C Eye Cream\n\nCeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion\n\nSupergoop Triple Prep SPF 40\n\nPM:\n\nCeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser\n\nGood Molecules Niacinamide Brightening Toner\n\nIT Cosmetics Bye Bye Pores Glycolic Acid Serum\n\nCeraVe Skin Renewing Vitamin C Eye Cream\n\nCeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion\n\nThe cleanser and moisturizer are things I’ve already been using at my dermatologist’s recommendation for years without issues. I added the toner, eye cream, and glycolic acid serum to help with brightness/evenness and pores.\n\nAre these products safe to use together? Is there anything I should adjust?\n\nWould love some advice…just trying to not wreck my face!!",

I’ve tried the recommended ones but still dries down and like I can tap my nails on it because the cast is so hard.\n\nEverybody has that wet look when having sleek backs, and that’s the look I want too. Shiny/a bit wet.\n\nWhat do you guys do/use for this? It’s really frustrating \n\nSideinfo for those who want to know: \n\nMy routine is shampoo once a week (sometimes clarifying), loads of conditioner and just rinsing my hair a couple times without shampoo throughout the week. Ad I struggle with hair that tangles and gets frizzy all the time, always use leave in conditioner, sometimes a conditioner spray too, curly cream and a mousse or gel depending.\n\nI’ve tried different hairs masks, both for hydration and for protein. My hair grows loads so seems to thrive with this routine but my hair structure just seems to want to knot up and get frizzy. I have 2C hair so more wavy than curly I guess. My hair is straight at the top of my head and maybe 10 cms down, so I also have flat roots. ",

I have fairly dry/damaged hair due to all the styling I did before, and live in a very dry climate. I feel like I have a fairly good wash day routine going, as I'm always happy with the look and feel of my hair after wash day. However, the morning after I wash it, my hair seems to have lost most of it's volume, and kind of mushed together if that makes sense. What can I do to fix this? Routine/care below, thank ya'll!: \n\nShampoo with camille rose black castor oil shampoo, then follow with Camille rose black castor oil deep conditioner for 20 mins. Rinse that out, then apply a small amount of Camille rose black castor oil +chebe buttercream as a leave in on wet hair. After that, I scrunch in camille rose curl maker gel and spiked honey mousse, and diffuse. Then, I break the cast with an oil, usually the cocoa nibs and honey oil from the same brand. I sleep in a bonnet, and refresh my hair when needed in the morning with the camille rose honey dew liquid moisture refresher. I usually wash my hair every other day, sometimes every 2 days.",

So first we treated the acne now acne is gone. She Told me to apply some tropical like nicinamide and retinol serum because as per my dermatologist i have hyperpigmentation , so I have been using nicinamide for quite some time now, like it's been eight months. yet I still feel that my face has been burned and there are no such changes in my skin texture tone. So recently I visited my dermatologist again after seven months, so she said that I have a lot of acne  scars. That is why this problem is looking more dominant and again, she suggested me to use retinol and asked me to done have some procedures done like micro needling  and chemical peels and also said only applying topical will not help me. I should go for some chemical treatment as well.\n\nShould I change my dermatologist and consult someone else? Or stick to this one and apply the topicals like retinol and nicinamide which are prescribed and i also use sunscreen daily .\n\nMy primary goal is to have an even skin texture and tone, like I want my face skin tone to be somewhat similar to my natural skin, which is on my chest and other body parts.\n\nSuggest me what should i do!",
