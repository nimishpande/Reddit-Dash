      "title": "Don't give up!!!! My 2 year progress in pictures.",
      "content": "In case you are thinking of giving up (because I was SO close to that at many points over the past 2 years) please don't! \n\nI grew up in the 90s before anyone knew how to properly care of curly hair, and I'm also Korean so I resented the fact that my hair was not slick, shiny, and straight like the other Korean girls I knew.  My mom used to scrunch my hair with mousse and air dry and send me to school with big, frizzy, triangle hair.  I hated it.  So in high school I started flat ironing my hair straight and also had various relaxing treatments done over the years. My hair was always in a state of incredible heat damage and I didn't even realize how bad it was. \n\nAny attempts in my pre-curly era to wear my hair naturally ended in huge fails because of the heat damage, lack of a good curly cut, and lack of proper know-how for product applications and styling techniques. I had lost hope I'd ever be able to figure it out. \n\n2 years ago something snapped and I decided to finally REALLY go for it.  I stopped flat ironing my hair completely. Cold turkey. At first it was bad. Really bad. As my new growth came in I had 2 vastly different textures and it looked awful. I had no clue how to apply products correctly for my hair texture. Every single wash day was a new trial and error. But I stuck it out. \n\nThis past January I got a good curly haircut and removed ALL of the heat damaged length.  They cut off about 10 inches. After that the remaining hair became SO curly. I was shocked. What I thought was more of a crimpy curl pattern had turned into actual tight ringlet curls.\n\nMy dream is to have long hair again but this time with curls. Now for the first time in my life I feel confident that I can actually get there and am so happy I stuck it out to this point and excited for the future. It's not perfect and I'm still learning more all the time but looking back I'm happy I didn't give up early on when it was so tempting to do so. I usually don't post anything online but I so badly wanted all the curlies out there who are thinking of giving up to know that you are not alone, and it will be SO worth it in the end. \n\npic 1 - Aug 2023 - the day I decided to go for it!\n\npic 2 - Mar 2024 - new growth with more curly texture\n\npic 3&amp;4 - Nov 2024 - new growth continues\n\npic 5 - Jan 2025 - after big curly cut\n\npic 6 - Jul 2025 - growing out, curls galore!\n\npic 7 - Sep 2025 - most recent progress\n\n\n\nCurrent products I use:\n\nCurlsmith Essential Moisture Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, Curl Reset Detox Shampoo, Double Cream Deep Quencher, Weightless Air Dry Cream, Hold Me Softly Style Balm, Curl Defining Souffle, Bonding Oil.\\* \n\n\\*I really think that the styling technique matters MUCH more than the specific product used, and while I like Curlsmith I'm sure I would get similar results with many other product brands and types.  \n\nRoutine:\n\nI alternate using the moisture shampoo and detox shampoo each wash, which is typically about every 5 days.  Out of the shower while soaking wet I put in a little air dry cream and then the style balm I brush in sections so that product is evenly distributed.  Then in small sections I apply the curl souffle with a bounce curl brush.  I plop for a few minutes then diffuse until I get tired or run out of time (usually 15 minutes) and let it air dry the rest.  Once completely dry and crunchy I scrunch out the crunch with the bonding oil. ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I even replaced my pillowcase and cleaned my brush, thinking maybe that was it. But somehow, the smell still lingers sometimes, especially near my scalp.\nIs this just buildup? Product residue?

I have not had any side effects from either medication. The only difference I’ve noticed in my life is my hair has gotten better. I had a lot of shedding the 2nd month of taking finasteride, my hands were covered in hair every time I showered.

      "content": "I've been struggling with what I believe is over-conditioned hair for the past 6 weeks. Before that, my 3b hair was resilient, thick, and naturally dry regardless of how much product I put in. It started feeling mushy, lifeless, and flat when I switched conditioners from Briogeo's Don't Despair Repair deep conditioning mask, to the regular conditioner in that same line. It's like my hair collapsed. The latter seems to have less protein and more emollient. I also believe I was putting in too much leave-in conditioner after wash days (also Briogeo Don't Despair Repair; my go-to for years).\n\nI am shocked by how unresilient my hair is now. It's even become greasy, which is something I've never experienced, and my dry time has decreased as well (both air dry and with a diffuser). I've tried a lot to fix my hair, but I haven't experienced much improvement. It's super demoralizing, as I took a lot of pride in my thick hair. I haven't been shedding an unusual amount, but when I hold my hair in my hands it feels like so much of it is gone.\n\nI have tried a few different routines in attempting to restore my hair to it's normal state:\n\nRoutine 1: Lots of clarifying shampoo (Sauve Daily), with no conditioner to follow up. Basically, I would only shampoo and put no other product in both during the shower and after. My hair would feel very dry from this, understandably so. But it had a lot more body.\n\nRoutine 2: Clarifying shampoo (Sauve Daily) with no conditioner, followed by protein treatment spray (Aphogee leave-in spray). This left my hair feeling too soft and mushy.\n\nRoutine 3: A stronger clarifying shampoo (Neutrogena) with the Briogeo Don't Despair Repair mask. My hair once again felt limp, soft, and body-less.\n\n**Has anyone experienced this before, and does anyone have recommendations for what I can do to fix this?** I've been clarifying consistently for many weeks with little progress. How long should I expect before things improve?",

However, I've recently noticed some small acne patches, somewhat persistent oiliness, and itchiness with dead skin build up, so I wanted to do something about that. I think my skin has been both dry and oily historically (dry in winter and oily in summer if that makes sense?). I had some acne but not too bad as a teen. I do not use makeup.\n\nI got myself a salicylic acid cleanser and an oil-based moisturizer. I tried them both last night and reapplied moisturizer after splashing face in the morning. Immediately after using the cleanser, I had some shiny redness and tightness. Today, my face is tingling and my complexion is very uneven, which is unusual for me. Like very small patches of redness/darkness and of my normal skin tone - this patchiness is all over my face.\n\nI wonder if because I've never used product this is a normal initial reaction/purging? Or have I broken the skin barrier/over exfoliated? Not sure how to proceed.\n\nThanks!",

The other day I soaked a towel in hot water, squeezed it out, and put it on my face. It was like my skin was a sponge it was insane. At first I thought I somehow wiped it off on the towel, but no, it just soaked in. I don't hear many people mention this, so if it helps anyone... give it a try! It's free! Just don't burn yourself, please!",
