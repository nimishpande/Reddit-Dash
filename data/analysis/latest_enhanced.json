      "content": "So, I’m 25 years old now, but started to take meds for my baldness when I was 21.\n\nI don’t know why I started balding? No one in my family is bald so is not genetics, and I’m not a stressed person to the point of losing my hair. \n\nAnyway, I started with **only** topic minoxidil 5% by kirkland, just with a few drops on my scalp every night before sleep. \n\nThe first photo is from October 2021 and the other one is from January 2022. In three months I had an insane regrowth progress. \n\nAnd so I keep up with the treatment for the next year or so, but then I stopped in December 2023… worst mistake ever, so that was my hair in March 2024 on the day that I’ve started taking **only** oral minoxidil 2,5mg and oral finasteride 1mg. One capsule from each every night before sleep. \n\nThen, after an insane shredding phase that I did not take pics(because of how bad i’ve looked), in July 2024 my hair looked like the one in the picture, not as good as it was in the first treatment, but better than no hair right?\n\nAnd the last picture is my hair now (January 2026). I’ve never stopped the treatment with the oral finasteride and minoxidil, and I continue to use it daily(sometimes I forgot to take it, but it’s not that bad to forget just a few days - i hope so). \n\nMy hair is still not perfect and I have plans of doing an hair transplant in the future, but at least is not ugly and sad like it was back in the days that i’ve stopped the treatment lol.\n\nSo yeah, that was my journey. I’ve never had any collateral effects with the medicines, the only bad thing that happened is that I can’t donate blood because of the medicine :( \n\nBut both of them (topical minoxidil or oral finasteride and minox) can help with the hair loss a lot, but if you stop the treatment like I did, you might be cooked like I was.",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I’m looking for insight rather than quick product recommendations.\n\nI’ve had this raised, uneven texture on my nose and inner cheeks for several years now. It’s been basically stable over time — not inflamed, not itchy, not acne-like, and it doesn’t really flare or go away. It’s more like persistent raised texture or pebbly skin in the same areas.\n\nA bit of background:\n\nMy skin is sensitive and reactive. I had a period of barrier disruption in the past and used tretinoin daily years ago (I stopped a long time ago). The texture didn’t suddenly appear but became more noticeable and just kind of stayed. I don’t get pustules or typical acne here.\n\nCurrent routine is very minimal:\n\nI use a gentle cleanser once daily and a simple moisturizer. No actives at the moment.\n\nWhat I’m hoping to understand:\n\nDoes this look more like sebaceous prominence or enlarged sebaceous units versus rosacea-related texture?\n\nIs this the kind of thing that can improve naturally once inflammation is fully calm, or is it more structural?\n\nAre there any low-irritation approaches people have found helpful for this type of texture?\n\nI’m not looking to aggressively treat or over-exfoliate — mostly just trying to understand what this is and how to manage it realistically.\n\nThanks in advance, and I’m happy to provide more details if helpful.",

I have been wanting to embrace my curls, but whenever I try, it seems like my hair is weighed down with product and gets greasy. I'm not entirely sure how I achieved the waves in the photo, but here is what I have tried. I'v studied this reddit extensively, and am in need to some advice!\n\nHere are my issues (that I think are) impeding my waves. Any and all advice would be helpful\n\n**1. I can never get my hair wet enough to achieve the 'seaweed' texture that people talk about. I feel like my hair does not absorb water in a normal way, but it still takes (literally!) 12+ hours to airdry and at least an hour with a diffuser on medium heat**\n\n**2. I can not get my hair to form a cast! My hair is always super soft and no matter how much or how little product I try, a cast does not show up!**\n\nAny tips or tricks are appreciated. I don't mind spending $ on product but really would love to get back to my 1x a week wash schedule with bouncy waves!\n\nCurrent Routine:\n\n1. Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Conditioner and MorrocanOil Curl Shampoo, with \\~biweekly Malibu Undo Goo clarifying and Ouai Curl Creme and Neuma NEU Styling Mousse - this was working when I had longer hair (1x a week wash) and if I finger curled and then slept in it, but now that it's a bit shorter, it just weighs it down.\n2.

      "content": "Your skin doesn’t understand the concept of “indoors.”  \nIt only responds to radiation exposure.\n\nFrom a biological standpoint na, the skin’s pigment cells and collagen fibres react to UVA radiation, not to whether you’re sitting at a beach or like under office AC. Unlike UVB (which causes visible sunburn), UVA rays remain constant throughout the day and penetrate glass effortlessly. This means your skin can be triggering melanin production and collagen degradation even when the temperature is cool and the light feels harmless. What makes this exposure deceptive is its low intensity but high frequency. A few minutes near a window, daily commuting, or repeated indirect sunlight doesn’t cause immediate damage but research shows it leads to photoaging, pigmentation irregularities, and barrier weakening over time. Ik Ik big concepts but then yeah they exist. This is why sunscreen isn’t positioned as an outdoor only product in dermatology. It functions as a biological filter, reducing the amount of radiation that reaches deeper skin layers regardless of whether that radiation comes from a beach or behind a glass panel.\n\nIn other words, office AC doesn’t neutralize UV exposure. It just makes it easier to ignore. I’ve made plenty of skincare mistakes over the years, learnt a lot through trial, error, and listening to people who know better and I’m still learning. Sharing this so it helps you make a more informed choice, not because there’s only one “right\" way. ",

After she uses Curl Talk curl cream and diffuse dries. She sleeps in a bonnet and never uses a brush. Her curls look pretty good, but could look better. She has some frizz and her hair is a little dry. I feel like there is a better curl cream out there for her hair and a weekly mask would help. We already have a hair steamer as I also have low porosity hair. I would love any advice! I have super straight hair so we are both learning as we go. Also want to add that she has alopecia but the hair is growing back, not sure if that matters.",
