      "content": "Hi everyone, I have long wavy hair (reaching my chest) and despite cutting them every three to six months, they always look like this. I lose a lot of hair on a daily basis (not a handful but almost). \n\nYet, I don't roughly dry my hair with a towel, I don't use any hot tools, I put some conditioner on the hair ends every time I wash my hair (every other day) and my nutrition is near perfect because of my efforts to eat well since last year. I don't drink and I don't smoke. \n\nI would like to know how to fix this : to get rid of the fuzzy hair but also to know how to hide it because it makes me look unkempt for work, even when I put my hair in a ponytail (with a loose scrunchie).\n\nThank you for your help !",

Need help choosing:\n\t1.\tA good anti-dandruff shampoo + conditioner (for dryness + hair fall)\n\t2.\tA body wash for back acne + what to apply after bath\n\t3.\tA gentle face wash + moisturizer for oily/acne-prone skin\nAlso want tips on finding my skin type, reliable brands, and routine structure.\n\nAny recommendations or routines that worked for you guys would mean a lot üôè\n\nAlso I think this post can be handy and of good help to not only me but also many other folks like me so please give your valuable contribution. \n\nThanks in advance!",

Need help choosing:\n\t1.\tA good anti-dandruff shampoo + conditioner (for dryness + hair fall)\n\t2.\tA body wash for back acne + what to apply after bath\n\t3.\tA gentle face wash + moisturizer for oily/acne-prone skin\nAlso want tips on finding my skin type, reliable brands, and routine structure.\n\nAny recommendations or routines that worked for you guys would mean a lot üôè\n\nAlso I think this post can be handy and of good help to not only me but also many other folks like me so please give your valuable contribution. \n\nThanks in advance!",

I wanted to first say that I understand there are likely lots of posts like these, but I wanted to ask myself, for I cannot find any posts or resources that are helpful.\n\nA few years ago, I began to transition from male to female. Over time, my mom has accepted me more, and she tries to support me in my endeavors, but she isn't the teaching type. Basically, I'm a girl with little to no real girl \"experience.\" I have no clue where to start with makeup, I don't know what I should mess with and try out to practice, and any attempts to search for beginner guides online results in more advanced concepts and hard-to-understand videos.\n\nI was hoping you guys could give me some assistance in finding some basic \"how to girl\" \"how to makeup\" guides or starting points. I'm basically asking for an emulation of that experience a lot of young girls have with mothers where they get to learn the *core basics* and *simple concepts*. If that makes sense.\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "I wanted to share my experience with TheMaxBeauty because I‚Äôve seen a few people mention it here and there, and there seems to be some confusion about what it actually offers.\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs not a skincare product brand in the usual sense there are no creams, serums, or deliveries involved. It‚Äôs actually a digital platform that gives you personalized skincare, haircare, and wellness programs. You get access to guides and routines online after signing up, and everything is designed to help you build better self-care habits based on your skin type and goals.\n\n\n\nI tried one of their skincare programs out of curiosity because I liked the idea of something structured to follow instead of jumping between random tips and products. It‚Äôs simple and feels tailored more about learning consistency and understanding what your skin needs rather than selling you more things to buy.\n\n\n\nOne thing I noticed that‚Äôs important to mention is that it runs on a subscription model, and it renews automatically unless you cancel. It‚Äôs clearly mentioned in their terms, but I think some people overlook it and end up surprised by the renewal. I had no problems canceling through customer support when I tested it, but I get how that could confuse people if they weren‚Äôt expecting it.\n\n\n\nOverall, I‚Äôd say MaxBeauty is legit for what it is a digital tool to help you improve your skincare routine and habits. It‚Äôs not a replacement for actual skincare products, but it helped me stay more consistent and intentional with what I already use.\n\n\n\nJust wanted to share this in case anyone else has been curious about it or was unsure how it works. Has anyone else here tried it or a similar program? I‚Äôd love to know how your experience compared.",

      "content": "Alright, I really REALLY need some advice here. I am 27 F and have gone though breakouts periodically throughout my life. My skin will sometimes be awesome, and sometimes just awful. I mainly breakout on my forehead &amp; sides of my chin. I wash my face in the AM &amp; PM, I rarely wear makeup during the week, and if I do: I always take it off before bed.\n\nThe last few years, I‚Äôve been really struggling with acne and clogged pores. I have combination skin and I‚Äôve gone from adding a ton of actives, to nothing besides moisturizer and face wash. At one point, I went to the derm and they prescribed me a low dose of Tretinoin, which was just a disaster. I had the worst purge ever (which was expected) but it started to get painful. Since then, I‚Äôve tried varieties of retinols about 4 times (different types, 1x a week, etc‚Ä¶) and every time my skin ends up itchy &amp; in pain. I decided retinol wasn‚Äôt for me.\n\nI later went back to the derm, where they gave me Metrogel to use daily, which seemed to really work at first. My skin was gorgeous. All I was using was a gentle face wash, metrogel, and moisturizer. After a while, I started noticing some clogged pores , so I started to use IS Clinical exfoliation pads 1x a week. This worked super well at first too.\n\nA few months went by with this routine, and then I started to notice more breakouts. I continue to use metro gel but I feel like it doesn‚Äôt help anymore.\n\nThe type of acne I get is called closed comedones (I think). It looks like a blackhead and comes out like a little hard seed. This is usually what happens when I break out. I am a picker by nature , so I tend to squeeze these suckers out, and you can imagine it creates all sorts of other problems.  Since I‚Äôve been getting these more often, it feels like the only way to get the seed out is to extract it. I have been popping so much recently and it feels like I‚Äôm out of control. I know it‚Äôs making it worse but I don‚Äôt know how else to get rid of them‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve tried oil cleansing, but I feel like it breaks me out more..?\n\nI have a red light mask that I‚Äôve been using for the last few weeks because my skin just feels inflamed and in pain. I read on Reddit  that azaelic acid could be good for me i think? I just ordered the ‚Äúcalm‚Äù exfoliant from Paula‚Äôs choice to use as well.\n\nI feel like I‚Äôve tried it all and nothing seems to be working. I also have been diving into an online / google hole, and I really need someone to offer some advice &amp; create a skincare routine for me. PLEASE HELP!!!",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
