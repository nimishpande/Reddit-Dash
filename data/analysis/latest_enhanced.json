      "content": "Finally sharing my progress here! I take 1.25mg every day. My hair loss treatment journey is kinda funny because I only noticed I was thinning considerably because I had just gotten a buzzcut due to my best friend passing away April this year and one of the things he wanted me to do the most was getting a buzz cut. \n\nAfter buzzing I noticed how bad it was and hopped initially on both topical 5% minoxidil and finasteride, I got pretty good results within 2 months but I ditched minoxidil because it was just too inconvenient to use, y’all know that. While I was afraid I was going to lose all the ground I had gained back, I didn’t! So luckily I was able to maintain everything. As far as side effects is concerned, I haven’t experienced much difference, however during the first 2-3 weeks my sex drive was through the roof, I was horny all the time, but that decreased back to what I consider a normal level. 0 changes. Thank God lol\n\nPlan on taking it for life as I look much better with a full head of hair. I’m grateful for my best friend Lucas, if it wasn’t because of the buzzcut I’d probably never realize how important hair is to me. Hair all day every day!!!!\n\nSorry for the long text! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me anything!",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I'm struggling to find a happy medium between weighted down curls and too frizzy curls. \n\nFor some background: \nmy hair is on the finer side, I do have a lot of hair on my head, just thin strands. My curls are also 100% white lol, they are not multicultural. \n\nWhat I've tried: \nPicture #1 in the grey shirt, is day 3 curls only refreshed with a steamer, no additional product. \nPicture #2 is day 1 curls with the following products on: pillow soft curls cream custard, the doux moose def texture foam, and not your mother's hair gel. The product was put on in sections, with a curl brush, diffused with a diffuser. (my usual routine). \n\nMy problem:\nI noticed that when using the products I mentioned, I feel that my curls are weighed down and I can't get any volume and they become frizzy by the end of the day. When I wear no products, I like the volume and softness, but it goes frizzy too fast. I also cannot pinpoint my hair type (2a, 2b, ect), which may help me. \n\nAre there any product recommendations out there that fix this issue? If you had this issue, what are you doing to stop it? Any tips for me and my journey? Keep in mind ive only been wearing it curly out the house for a few months now. \n\nThank you in advance! 💗\n\n\n",

I do have decent density, and when my hair is light and fluffy there looks like I have a TON of it, but it can easily become very flat.

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

Even though I held it away from my scalp, one day it spit out about 1/2 cup of BOILING water onto my head. I put my head under the sink in cold water for about 30 mins and treated it until it healed, but it could have been so much worse. \n\nIf this had been just a few inches further forward it could have gone in my eye and caused severe damage or maybe blindness. I know a lot of people love steaming their hair for various reasons and I’m so sad I can’t do it anymore, but I just wanted to warn you to be careful!  \n\nIf you do get one I would only get something made for hair, use distilled water only, and clean the hell out of it. But I’m too scarred by this to try again. My head peeled and was seepy for a long time and I was afraid my hair was gonna fall out, which it’s already thin to begin with. ",

I'm 20 now and it still hasn't gone back to how it used to be. I'm currently trying to get it to curl again by scrunching it after washing it, which is kind of working, but only keeps it curly for about a day before they start to loosen again, and they're not as tight as they used to be. Letting it air dry rather than blow drying it also seems to maintain them a bit better, though I would like advice on what else to do. \n\nI don't have a routine aside from that",
