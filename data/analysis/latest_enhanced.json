      "content": "\nHi everyone,\nI’m a 26-year-old male and work in acting. I had early hairline recession but no major thinning or crown loss. Because of my profession, hairline design was extremely important to me. Almost every successful lead actor in India has a strong, well-designed hairline, and I wanted something similar—customised and slightly aggressive, while still looking natural.\nFirst surgery (top celebrity clinic in India):\nI initially went to one of the most reputed clinics in India that operates on many celebrities. The plan was hairline enhancement. However, the team mainly worked on the fronto-temporal angles and didn’t significantly improve the central hairline or peaks. The result was okay, but not what I had envisioned. It lacked personalisation and refinement.\nTo be fair, I fully understood their concern about keeping the hairline conservative in case future baldness progressed. Still, I felt the execution didn’t match my expectations, especially considering my case was mild recession and not active baldness.\nAfter around 6 months, once growth became visible, I decided to restart my research.\nSecond surgery:\nThrough Quora, I came across Dr Abhinav Kumar (Patna), an ex-Eugenix surgeon, repeatedly praised by patients for customised hairline design and attention to detail. After detailed discussions, we went ahead with a second surgery focusing purely on hairline aesthetics.\nCurrent results (5 months post-op):\nI’m sharing my current results—a Shubman Gill–style hairline (inspiration only, not replication).\nWhat I’m genuinely happy with:\nStrong but natural peaks\nFlat, well-blended temporal points\nVery fine, single-hair grafts in the hairline\nSmooth transition between hairline and temporal zones\nI’m honestly in love with the hairline. It looks natural, age-appropriate, and camera-friendly.\nFinal thoughts:\nThis is not an endorsement or advertisement. I’m simply sharing my experience to highlight that:\nAll hair transplants don’t have to look unnatural\nCustomisation matters a lot, especially for hairline work\nSurgeon’s aesthetic sense and attention to micro-details make a huge difference",

      "content": "I’m looking for impartial advice about my curly hair.\n\nI grew up never being taught how to care for curls (I was always told to brush it), so I kept my hair very short most of my life. A stylist recently told me I have strong natural curls and recommended growing it out for \\~6 months. I’m about 4 months in.\n\nI’m having a hard time telling whether what I’m seeing now is a normal curly grow-out phase that just needs shaping—or whether my curl pattern/head shape genuinely works better with short hair. I’ve gotten mixed feedback in real life, which makes it difficult for me to evaluate clearly.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n1. Is this current length/shape a normal curly grow-out phase that will pay off if I keep going?\n\n\\- Or does my curl pattern/head shape honestly suit short hair better?\n\n2. If the answer is “keep growing”, should I be doing maintenance shaping (sides, neckline, around the ears) to keep it looking intentional?\n\n3. If the answer is “cut it”, is there a shorter curly style that still works with my natural texture rather than against it?\n\nPhotos are anonymized. I’m genuinely open to either outcome—I’m just looking for curl-informed, impartial feedback.\n\n**Routine**:\n\nI shampoo and condition daily using Paul Mitchell Shampoo Two and Paul Mitchell Detangler conditioner.\n\nAfter showering, I do not towel dry. I let my hair air dry.\n\nWhile my hair is still damp, I apply a light Moroccan oil and DevaCurl cream using my hands. I apply both by scrunching the hair upward while my head is upright, letting the curls form naturally as they hang.\n\nI live in a humid area, so the products are mainly to control frizz.\n\nI do not currently use any protection while sleeping (no bonnet, scarf, or satin pillowcase), and I do not have a refresh routine on non-wash days.\n\nIf there’s anything else I should include for routine context, let me know.",

I’ve always had dry skin, but this is next-level: active peeling (like a sunburn), tightness, flakes that come back hours after moisturizing — mostly on my forehead and hairline. I’m indoors most of the time.\n\nSince I’m pregnant, I’ve stopped most actives and I’m very cautious with products. I run everything by 15 Minute Beauty, so my routine is pretty conservative.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n\t•\tCleanser: CeraVe oil-based cleanser (night only, in shower)\n\n\t•\tToner: HaruHaru Black Rice toner — 2x/day\n\n\t•\tMoisturizer: La Roche-Posay Triple Repair Cream — AM + PM\n\n\t•\tHyaluronic acid — night only\n\n\t•\tVaseline — morning only\n\n\t•\tHumidifier — about 3x/week overnight\n\nNo exfoliation, no retinoids, no acids.\n\nDespite this, my skin keeps peeling and moisturizer just seems to sit on top.\n\nQuestions:\n\n\t•\tIs HA making this worse in winter?\n\n\t•\tShould Vaseline be at night instead of morning?\n\n\t•\tAm I overdoing toner?\n\n\t•\tAny pregnancy-safe tweaks to actually repair my barrier?\n\nThanks!

His natural hair colour was jet black, he’s now mostly all grey, but still has flecks of the black coming through and the back of his head is still a little darker.\nHe’s been using my left over Nak blonde shampoo and wants to buy more, but is unsure which product is the best for what he wants to achieve. (He’s aware that dying/toning it will be the best for achieving what he wants but he just wants a regular shampoo that will overtime help brighten it).\nI wouldn’t say he necessarily has any yellow or brass tones in his hair. But despite this can purple shampoo actually help brighten grey? And if so which purple shampoo should he get?\nI’ve always used Nak products, so that’s all I can recommend to him. Nak do a platinum blonde shampoo/conditioner too would that be better than the regular? \nAny other suggestions to help him achieve the look he wants? ",

I’m actually unsure if this is milia or not but i will leave a photo below just in case.\n\nI think that these ‘spots’ appeared because i’ve been bringing my skincare up to my eyelids (moisturiser and serums) for the past two months because i saw the skin there flaking. Just fyi, i’ve had milia under my eyes before but they disappeared after a week of not putting anything on my skin, but those one are way smaller compared to the one on my eyelids. I’ve done some research on reddit and was recommended tretin or bha/aha but i’m unsure if it’s even safe to bring up to my eyelids. \n\nSo please!! Is there anything else i can do at home before going to a doctor or dermatologist? Both of the options are not really affordable to me right now so i hope there is something else i can do at home.\n\nThank you all !!",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I’ve been on a mix of topical min and oral min for over a year now. The first few months was just topical then I added in 2.5 mg of oral in the morning and continued with the topical at night. \n\n\nI feel like my face is slightly swollen and I now have much larger under eye bags. It seems like lately my friends, family, and coworkers are always telling me I look “tired” that cannot be good! \n\n\nAny tips here on dealing with this? Sticking my face in a cold plunge every morning sounds awful! \n\n\nAnyone deal with this successfully by maybe going every other day with oral, or even trying to cut the 2.5 mg pill in half?\n\n\nI’m currently stopping the oral min and just going to continue with the topical to see if my face changes at all. \n\n\n\nThanks for the help yall.

      "content": "Hey everyone,\nI’m dealing with acne and post-acne marks mainly on my cheeks and beard area. It’s not severe acne, but it’s constant enough to affect my confidence. Small pimples keep coming back, and even when they heal, they leave dark marks that take forever to fade.\nI’ve been using tretinoin 0.05% for about a month now (3x a week), along with benzoyl peroxide (spot treatment), a niacinamide + salicylic acid face wash, and a basic hyaluronic moisturizer. I recently started taking Evion 400 as well. I trim my beard (don’t shave).\nI know tretinoin takes time, but honestly, it’s hard to stay patient when your skin looks worse before it looks better. Some days I feel like I’m doing everything right and still not seeing “clear” skin. The marks, uneven texture, and occasional breakouts really mess with my mental state.I’m not looking for miracle cures — just realistic expectations and advice from people who’ve been through this:\nHow long did it actually take for your skin to clear on tret?\nWhen did the “glow” start showing up?\nAny mistakes you wish you hadn’t made early on?\nWould really appreciate hearing real experiences.\n\nThanks for reading 🙏🏻 ",

When I was younger I would honestly get frustrated and keep it at a pixie cut because it's was difficult to upkeep but now I'm older and I get kinda stuck on how to style it so I usually just put it in a bun or a pony tail .\n      \nFor routine ,I use a hair mask every week sometimes twice if I'm not busy consisting of wild growth hair oil on my roots and a mix of olive oil , castor oil , honey and (now) argan oil and my shampoo and conditioner are a mix of different bottles I've bought just because I had so many that were barely filled . After washing I spray in aussie hair insurance and comb in softee aloe curl activator gel and let air dry. I usually wash my hair with shampoo once a week in the winter and every other day in the summer. ",

That was on the 18th, but since then (24th, 26th, 29th), and across two or three washes, I have not managed to reproduce that; it feels that I either end up with hair which is less defined (curls are more frizz than anything) or less \"moist\"-looking, or even both. Perhaps I am overanalysing this, but if anyone could perhaps suggest what is wrong specifically with my hair, I would appreciate it!\n\n  \nRoutine (Has not changed much since the 18th):  \n**(All products applied by raking)\\***  \n**WASH**   \n\\- Aunt Jackie's Moisturising or Clarifying Shampoo  \n\\- SheaMoisture Moisturising Shampoo or Sleeek Argan Smoothing Conditioner (only used the latter once)  \n\\* I used to use a Cantu moisturising masque, but fears about too much moisture led me to discontinue its use shortly before the 18th.  \n\\- Comb: \"Bounce brush\"  \n\\- Rinse out (I have been trying using the \"squish to condish\" method, with mixed results)  \n  \n\\- Out of the shower: Lottabody Leave-in conditioner, followed by Curl Keeper Styling Gel, then the curl brush, with occasional use of a spray bottle to keep my hair wet. I finish by scrunching it.\n\n**STYLING (morning)**  \n\\- Curl Keeper Styling Gel only; I get my hair decently wet using the spray bottle, then apply the gel, using it to detangle and redefine my curls. Once done, I do not touch it until it is dry, when I scrunch it out. On the latter, I actually tried olive oil two times before the 24th, and after the 18th, but did not find it was useful at all, and so these days I scrunch it with my dry hands only.\n\n**\\*On raking:** I attempted the \"praying hands\" technique a few times, but did not find it worked. I might try it again for morning styling, where I find a lot of gel is needed to hold my hair together. However, the last time I tried this method, the results were supbar, unless I was mistaken about what I saw. ",

Press-ons unfortunately don’t work well for me as I’m quite heavy-handed.\nI’ve been researching different systems and I’m currently deciding between polygel, Gel-X style extensions, or acrylic. Acrylic seems more difficult for a beginner, especially using my non-dominant hand, so I’m leaning towards something a bit more beginner friendly while I learn.\n\nI’ve watched a few tutorials and read up on prep and application, and I want to make sure I’m using products correctly and safely as a beginner. I’m also trying to be mindful about quality when choosing lamps and gels.\n\nBecause I’m on a budget, I wanted to ask:\nWhat extension system would you recommend for a beginner wanting length and strength?\nAre there any affordable UK brands (around £40 or under) that are decent quality for beginners?\nIdeally I’d love to start with 4–5 gel colours plus essentials.\nI’m not in a rush to buy anything and would really appreciate advice from people who’ve started doing their own nails at home.
