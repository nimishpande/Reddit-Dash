I recently got my dead ends trimmed and was thinking maybe that would help with this problem, but I’m very much still having the issue. \n\nBasically, the front of my hair and other chunks around my head are pretty curly, even having ringlets, but some random chunks especially in the back are pretty straight. Not sure if this is because I’m doing something wrong or if it’s because this is just my hair’s texture. \n\nRoutine: I wash my hair pretty infrequently, use curl-friendly shampoo and conditioner. Then I use matrix a curl can dream scrunch n go spray and verb define &amp; defrizz cream. Drying with a diffuser sometimes helps but the back still falls to this straightish texture in some chunks pretty  fast. This is air dried with some scrunching in the picture. ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

But over the past year, her skin has noticeably worsened, it looks duller, with uneven texture and small breakouts that she never had before.\n\nA few weeks ago she went for a professional facial/cleaning, but it didn’t go very well — her skin broke out afterward with red pimples and hasn’t really recovered since.\n\nShe feels lost about where to start now and would love to rebuild a proper skincare routine. Could you please help us figure out a simple, effective plan, ideally with some product recommendations (brands too, if possible)?\n\nShe’s looking for advice on:\n\n* A gentle cleanser\n* A good moisturizer\n* Daily sunscreen\n* Something to help with texture and prevent new breakouts\n\nHer skin type seems to be normal to combination, it wasn’t sensitive before, but has become more reactive lately.\n\nThank you all so much in advance for your help and guidance 🙏",

      "content": "Dear curly/wavy/kinky Redditors, I am so at a complete loss with regard to my hair that I was forced to revive an ancient Reddit account, so please excuse the absolutely hilarious name my 14yo self came up with. Anyways, I have fine, low porosity 3a/3b hair that I have been growing out from a buzz cut for about a year. My routine consists of washing about every 3-4 days with conditioner (Shea Moisture coconut &amp; hibiscus, it worked for me for ages) and once weekly with shampoo (random store brand), and styling just with a curl cream (John Frieda Frizz Ease) and letting it air dry. For a while, I was fairly happy with my curls; they were defined, lasted a couple of days and held in place, but I felt they were a little dry and too tangled, so I decided to opt for a leave-in, which was a mistake.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I got a Cantu repair leave-in with Shea butter (bad for fine hair, I figured it out too late) and I used it ONCE, just a bit on my finger and then finger-combed through hair, and since then my hair has been an absolute disaster. \n\nAfter my hair dried, I noticed that it had, in fact, made my hair very soft but also loosened up my curl pattern, reduced definition and created a lot of soft, straightish, and sort of floaty frizz. Additionally, in the shower instead of clumping in big, drenched, wet curls, my hair remains frizzy and just sort of damp (it feels oddly not wet enough for now, long it has been soaking). I also feel like I have been shedding more, but that might be just the looser curl not catching the shed hairs as well as before.\n\nSo, my question is, what is happening and what can I do? I stopped using all products for two weeks and only clarified but I see little to no improvement. I read about protein and moisture overloads, both of which are readily available in the Cantu product, but the information on the internet seems super contradictory, and I don't want to damage my hair further. I tried the stretch test, but I can't figure out how to prevent my hair from just slipping out of whatever I use to hold it, haha, it's just so fine and smooth.\n\nAny and all advice and experience is welcome. I attached a couple of pictures of my hair now, a day after clarifying. Day 1 frizz is not that bad but the straightish flyaways in the first picture could give a good idea what appears all over my head during days 2 and 3. Unfortunately, I have no before images. Thanks, everyone.",

I wash my hair with water daily in the morning ( i often get sweaty from playing sports), apply the kinky curly knot today leave in detangler through the ends of my hair and then half dry it by scrunching it with a terry towel, then let it air dry. Every three/ four days I use the Umberato Gianni Curl Jelly wash shampoo and conditioner. I sleep with a bonnet at night. But my hair is always flat, stuck to my head, not properly curled( and looks like wavy seaweed), while also being kinda frizzy and not defined. My goal is to get it to look like the first two guys - but i have no clue how - Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong? Can anyone suggest a routine? I live in the UK, and live in a region with very hard water. I'm also still a student, so i dont have that much money - the most i can spend on something is 5 - 25 pounds. Please help!",

I’ve always done minimal make-up, mascara, brow tint, and foundation when I felt like it. \n\nLately I want to get back into doing more as it makes me feel prettier and more confident. I stepped away bc I wanted to try being more “natural”, like no makeup, perfume, lotion, etc but I just don’t feel womanly. So even basic advice would be helpful bc idk where to start. Some info that might help is I have thick wavy hair, oily skin type, and don’t have a lot of experience doing make up but willing to learn more. \n\nSo what are your tips, tricks, or advice on where to get started?

My skin is not particularly sensitive, it doesn’t get dry, and I don’t get acne or blackheads. \n\nThis is my current routine:\n\nAm:\n- Wash with water  \n- Vitamin c\n- Niacinamide \n- Moisturizer\n- Sunscreen \n\nPm:\n- Oil cleanse when needed \n- Foam cleanser or sulfur foam cleanser \n- third step: Mon: retinol / Tues: azelaic acid / Wed: rest / Thurs: retinol / Fri: azelaic acid / Sat: azelaic acid / Sun: rest\n- moisturizer \n- jojoba oil (x2 week) \n\nX1 week - bentonite clay mask \n\nSome notes:\n- I got the sulfur cleanser in order to help with my pores. A dermatologist on YouTube recommended it for helping reduce the appearance of pores. I’ve been using it almost daily since January but have seen no improvement at all honestly. At this point I’m just finishing using up the tube and backed down from daily use to every other day or so \n- I tried using salicylic acid daily last year for at least 6 months if not longer and it did nothing to help  \n-  I’ve been using retinol on and off for a few years but not consistently. I think my product expired though so I need to order some new stuff \n- the bentonite clay mask works to help make my pores less noticeable but the result doesn’t last more than like a day \n- I have used niacinamide on and off for the last few years but also found no help in reducing oiliness. I decided to try again though which is why I’m using it right now \n- I have been using glycolic acid a few times a week for the past few months but honestly idk why. I don’t even remember why I got it. I stopped using it.\n- I just recently like a few weeks ago started using azelaic acid and vitamin c in my routine \n\nJust wondering if my routine is okay. I tried using ChatGPT to help formulate somewhat of a plan but it keeps going back and forth about either adding on a ton of acids and actives vs warning me about overdoing things and to be careful. I don’t trust it to be giving me accurate info which is why I want to run my plan by on here. Also I know you can’t reduce the size of pores. I know they’ll always be there. I just want them to look a bit nicer and not stand out so much.",

I KNOW I may not need all this but I would like to experiment and see how these products might (or might not) help. Some things about me:\n\n\n-I am 28F\n-As far as I can tell, I have normal to dry skin (mostly normal though)\n\n\nThe picture is in the order I would use them for the most part. Some clarification just in case:\n\n-I would only use the oil cleanser at night\n- I’d only use the Vit C serum during the day\n- Eye gel I would use at night \n- The retinol would be a couple times a week to start\n\nSo again my question is, are any of these products not safe to use with another? A lot of these I’ve seen part of a routine for many women on TikTok (I know that’s not the most reliable source of info but it’s where I looked) and there wasn’t much talk about not mixing this with that, but someone mentioned it once about some other product so it occurred to me that I should make sure these are all safe to use together (and respectively to day and night stuff).

      "content": "I started taking topical minoxidil 6 years ago and had decent results at slowing down the hair loss but wanted to totally stop the hairloss and potentially regrow a little so 1.5 years ago I switched to hims topical minoxidil/finasteride spray. Since then my hair has continued to recede and thin out. looks worse than when I was only using minoxidil but i cant say fin actuallymade it worse. Could be more that fin just didnt do anything helpful and my hair loss naturally continued.   But either way I cant really  justify paying the money for something that isn't doing much of anything. \n\nMy own theory is that simply less minoxidil caused my  hair to get worse.  The min/fin spray is only once a day and using the recommend 4 spray pumps once a day lets me make the bottle last until the next one arrives, so no option to use it more often unless i want to pay even more than i am now. I think no longer using minoxidil both day and night was enough to make things worse. I could keep using the min/fin once a day and add only minoxidil back in the mornings but for cost reasons and considering i havent seen any benefits from adding fin, id rather juat not use it at all. would like to just go back to using minoxidil only.\n\nI get that min is the fertilizer and fin is the pesticide or whatever that farming analogy is that everyone loves to use, but wondering if switching back to only min causes increased hair loss and thinning based on anyone's experience.  To sum it up... am I stuck paying for and using fin forever to avoid any negative effects of stopping the topical fin",
