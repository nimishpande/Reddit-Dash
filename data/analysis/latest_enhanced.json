      "content": "1st pic: shampoo + conditioner + air dried hair on a very good hair day. Air drying usually takes 2-3 hours which is strangely long for short hair with shaved sides and back.\n \n2nd pic: shampoo, conditioner, curl cream, diffused on medium heat medium intensity.\n\n3rd pic: I decided to add gel to the previous routine before diffusing, and what on earth did I just do? I tried to diffuse it, took me half an hour and it was still soggy in some places. It took me over 12 hours to air dry after that, then I scrunched it and it looked like this.\n\nBefore that (undocumented attempt) I tried using less gel and it did absolutely nothing except for make hair feel icky, no amount of scrunching helped.\n\nI applied gel the same way that I apply conditioner, kind of rake it through my hair with my fingers and then scrunch.\n\nProducts I use:\n\nShampoo: Redken All Soft Mega Curls, although I sometimes use Pirolam when my scalp condition flares up.\nConditioner: Novex Deep Conditioning Hair Mask (the instructions on the jar say it can be used as a conditioner, I tried keeping it on longer like a mask but there's no difference). I rake it through my hair and that's when I also use my fingers to gently detangle it (although it hardly ever gets tangled). Then I scrunch.\nCream: Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream,  applied to wet hair in the same way as conditioner.\n\nMonstrous gel: WS Academy Gel For Waves And Curls (Polish brand that's being marketed as kinda fancy). Applied in the same way as above.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the gel just has too much stuff in it and I would probably get better results with a simpler formulation. Or maybe I should ditch the curl cream and just try the gel alone. Honestly I'm losing my mind and feeling I'm throwing money into a black hole of pointless experimentation, please help me make the experimenting less pointless üòä\n\nBonus 4th pic: random cute pic of the \"protective\" topknot  I wear when cooking, painting, DIY, or when it's hot outside. I also sleep in it sometimes (the scrunchie is silk) . I generally do my best to sleep in a silk headscarf, it's life-changing because without it my head looks like an exploded pot of pasta on the next day.\n\nFun Fact: I also have a jar of Inebrya Ice Cream Keratin Restructuring Mask but it also does the opposite of what it's supposed to do, turns hair into straw. I guess my hair already has enough protein.",

I was told this is a \"mousse cast\" that I need to \"scrunch out\" at the end of the day.\n\nHere's the full routine:\nMorning (In-Shower):\n1. Scalp Cleanse: Ashba shampoo\n2. Leave-In: Ashba Leave-in Conditioner (applied on soaking wet hair)\n\nPost-Shower:\n3.  Style: Curl Up Mousse (scrunched in while hair is still dripping)\n4.  Plop: Gently plop hair into a cotton t-shirt for 15-30 mins.\n5.  Air Dry: Let it air dry completely. (Rule: Don't touch it!)\nEvening:\n6.  S.O.T.C.: Once 100% dry, \"Scrunch Out The Crunch\" to break the mousse cast.\n\nIs this stiff/crunchy feeling normal before S.O.T.C.?\nDoes this routine look good for a beginner? I'm worried it's missing a normal rinse-out conditioner, which might be why it feels dry. Any advice would be amazing. Thanks!",
