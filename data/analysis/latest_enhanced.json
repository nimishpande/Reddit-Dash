      "content": "So dermatologists (even mine) have stated point blank for some people, especially those with chronic, hereditary dandruff or sweaty workouts, shampooing the scalp daily is the BEST thing you can do your your scalp health.\n\nBut there’s NO mention of the practical reality of washing hair that requires 2 hours for the washing routine.\n\nI.e. If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I am SUPER DRY (you may be able to tell lol). This is less than 10 minutes after putting Cetaphil on. In general I have very sensitive skin and have tried out a couple sensitive skin moisturizers, but this is the standard outcome. In terms of my existing routine, there isn’t much. I wash my face with Cetaphil cleanser (which also burns, but not as bad and I don’t get so red). I never had acne or bad breakouts, maybe because I am so dry. I don’t wear makeup and don’t have any confirmed skin allergies, but I have frequent dermal reactions to any type of medical needle, medical skin cleaner, and bandaids. (Not sure if sharing that is helpful, but I thought I’d include it jic) Any product suggestions for super dry reactive skin are appreciated (face moisturizer and/or general body products). Thanks!!\n\n(PS I am scheduled to see a dermatologist, but the appt isn’t until June 😵‍💫)",

I have still managed to get a load of sunspots, a little bit of melasma, and probably some age spots of sorts. I have really uneven skin tone that’s dull and lifeless, enlarged pores on/around my nose and some on my cheeks next to my nose, and I have texture that are in the form of bumps without being pimples/acne. I think they’re keratin filled bumps or something? I really don’t know, I just read about it and I believe that’s what they might be. \n\nMy issues: \n\n1) I’m on a relatively tight budget (The Ordinary is the type of budget I can stick with)\n\n\n2) I need a  short and simple type of skincare routine. I have *horrendous* adhd and genuinely forget to do things or stick to a routine so having less steps in my skincare routine is my best bet. Other than washing my face, having things on my nightstand I can put on when I get in bed at night is ideal. \n\n\n3) I have semi-sensitive skin. Mainly around my T-zone and my cheekbones. If it’s of any help, I am able to handle The Ordinary’s Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Toner. \n\n\n4) I’m not wanting to use steroids or retinols since my skin is sensitive to it. \n\n5) I know it’s unlikely but I’d like to see improvement or at least some life brought back to my face for my sisters wedding I’m part of in April. \n\n\nI hope I covered everything…if I’m missing anything please let me know!

      "content": "Hey Reddit, Im a 24yo (F) that has never dyed her hair- ever. I have naturally dirty blonde hair and my skin color is very fair (white as hell tbh lol). I want to try a “natural redhead” look since I think it would compliment my skin very well.\n\nI used to have long straight hair but I did chemo treatment 2 years ago and now its grown back curly(above breast shoulder length). When I lost my hair, I remember thinking “Man, I wish I would have experimented with my hair more.” And now that I am able to, I have no clue how to go about it. I have no idea if I should go to a salon or if I should box dye. If I box dye, what brand and shade would y’all recommend? And how does one go about in actually dyeing it? I can always search a youtube tutorial on that but any tips/tricks would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks Reddit 🫶🏻",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "I'm a later in life runner (started in my 30s, early 40s), and I don't know if it's running that does it, or what, but I periodically get chest/shoulder acne that flares up during the year.\n\nUsed to be, I thought this was related to laundry detergent. I have sensitive skin, and sometimes it just gets irritated. But earlier last year, I felt like I had a flare that was lasting longer than normal, so asked my (new) dermatologist if I could try something specific for it. She said she'd normally recommend a benzoyl peroxide wash, but that might be too harsh for my skin, so prescribed clindamyacin wipes and a sulfur wash.\n\nSulfur wash seemed to do nothing (dermawash was the brand). I tried the clindamyacin wipes and, although they seemed to start working, within a week, I had an entirely different rash that was itchy and spreading. I believe this was a fungal reaction...I guess the bacteria was killed off and yeast took over. At the time, I was traveling, so bought antifungal cream and head and shoulders and things started to calm down.\n\nEnter: now. Several months later, and I'm still battling this persistent acne. I've tried 10% benzoyl peroxide wash, ketaconazole shampoo (2%), alternating each twice per week...things will clear up, then I'll break out again. I started using a friction stick (gold bond) across my chest and shoulders before runs: that helps a little, but I still get breakouts. I shower immediately after workouts. I've tried periods of just using soothing, basic cleanser followed by a basic lotion (vanicream), but the breakout persists.\n\nSo my question here is: what actually works for you?? I can't figure out if my skin is just too sensitive for anything active (and therefore reacts), or if I'm using the wrong thing entirely. I know some people have success with zinc bars (from reading, these can be too harsh for sensitive skin and cause problems), some people swear by benzoyl peroxide wash (same deal... sensitive skin doesn't play nice), salicylic wash (way back when I saw the dermatologist, I was using this and I was still having breakouts). I'm so frustrated and just want clear skin 😭",

      "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nFirst, thank you to this subreddit that helped me start on this journey. It was fall of 2023 when the learned that I could use meditation to improve my hairline.\n\nEthnicity: South Asian, male, 37.\n\nFirst image: left picture is from January of 2024. Right picture is from September of 2024. I used the same camera, same location, same lighting, same hair length (3 days after trim).\n\nSecond picture (just one pic) was taken December of 2025. Location is different, lighting is different, I think it was about 5 days of trim.\n\nProduct: Hims 0.3% fin, 6% min. In 2024 I used derma pen once a week with 1.5 mm cartridge. In 2025, I rarely used it as I ran out of cartridges and got lazy. But towards the end of 2025, I started to use derma pen again once a week with 1.5 mm cartridge.\n\nAdditional products: in fall of 2025, I also added 0.3% of dut, hence why second picture has yellow tint on the scalp.\n\nProgress: As you can see the progress in 2024, not much of a progress from September of 2024 to December 2025. I think progress has been plateaued maybe with some hair getting thicker is some areas.\n\nFuture plans: should I try oral dut on top of topical fin/min? Or should I go HT route?\n\nThank you\n\n[First Picture](https://preview.redd.it/ewbgdjq1secg1.jpg?width=1924&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf4aae7498dbe3e112c0cbe99730b9ddda2eae7f)\n\n[Second Picture](https://preview.redd.it/qswd9mq1secg1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f70efba72b3f4c8fe58e370471db72bfc72c193)",
