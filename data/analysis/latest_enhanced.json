      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

(correct me if i’m wrong)\n* hormonal acne? \n* pore clogging/black heads on my nose\n* spot cystic acne here and there\n\ni will say though, i never break out this bad on a regular. my period is supposed to start anytime now, but i guess it’s good to ask now so that you can see its “full potential.” i feel i break out the most around ovulation and my period, so a good amount of the months time. every month is a new month, so where and what the breakouts will be are a mystery. my cheeks rarely ever break out, my T-zone is what gets everything the most\n\nclearly, i’m wanting advice from real people that can actually see my skin and go from there. what was recommended are all included with my skin’s photos, let me know your thoughts and ask questions if needed! thank you all",

I do have some layering which hasn’t seemed to help much. \n\nRoutine:\n\nI washed my hair x2 (kinky curly clarifying shampoo or Nizoral when needed) and no conditioner because sometimes I feel like it just looks better without? Then I sectioned and brushed in Rizos Curls defining mousse with my bounce curl brush. After I scrunched in four pumps of Innersense I create hold gel and then plopped for a bit. I then did a bit of air dry and then went in with a diffuser. I slept with it in a banana clip on top of my head and my satin bonnet.\n\nOther info about my hair:\n- I would say I have a lot of very fine soft hair\n- It starts to get frizzy pretty quickly out of the shower\n- my hair appears to dry fast but still takes hours for it to fully air dry\n- my hairdresser said I have low porosity very healthy hair and just recommend an air dry cream but the cream doesn’t help with the hold/definition at all (R+Co air dry)\n\nAny help/recommendations would be greatly appreciated! 😊",

      "content": "\nSo I’ve been thinking about this for a while and honestly I don’t get why this isn’t already a thing. We already have tons of biologic drugs that basically work as “sponges” for stuff in the blood. Like monoclonal antibodies that bind PCSK9 for cholesterol or ones that bind TNF-α, IL-6 and whatever for inflammation. That tech already exists and works.\n\nSo the idea is super simple in my head:\njust make a big protein that only sticks to DHT, dump it in the bloodstream, and boom -&gt;&gt; free DHT gets neutralized as it floats around. Meanwhile 5-alpha-reductase is untouched so neurosteroids don’t get nuked like with finasteride/dutasteride. And when you stop taking the drug, the protein levels drop and everything goes back to normal. Seems way cleaner than blocking 5-AR itself.\n\nThere’s even bonus points: big proteins usually don’t cross the blood-brain barrier well, so in theory you’d mostly suppress peripheral DHT (scalp, skin, prostate etc) but maybe leave more brain DHT alone. So possibly less CNS interference than fin/dutasteride. Making something selective with a protein is way easier than with a tiny small molecule that binds everything.\n\nYeah, it would probably have to be an injection and would be stupid expensive cuz biologics always are. And obviously you’d still be suppressing DHT systemically so long-term safety would need studying. But as far as WHAT PHARMA COULD ACTUALLY BUILD in the next 5 years? This seems like the most realistic shot at “DHT suppression without resucing neurosteroids.”\n\nSo… legit question:\nWhy hasn’t anyone made this yet?\n\nIs it just lack of market interest? Technical limitations? Patents? No one’s thought of it? Or is there some huge reason this wouldn’t work that I’m missing?",

I have oily skin, and I want to understand all possible causes — even the most remote — so I can tailor my routine better.\n\nHere’s what I currently do:\nMorning:\nMinimalist cleanser during bath\nMoisturizer\nSunscreen over moisturizer\n\nEvening (when I have time):\nCleanser\n10% Niacinamide serum from_____ (applied on slightly damp skin)\nMoisturizer\nSleep\n\n\nLifestyle notes: I drink 4-5 cups of chai daily (sugar varies)\n\nConcerned about possible impact of chai on skin. \n\nOily skin prone to uneven texture and tone.\n\nI recently came across some tips on using Vaseline in skincare routines, mainly as a hydration sealant on clean, damp skin, but I’m worried about using it with oily skin. I want to know the best way to add Vaseline without worsening oiliness or breakouts, and which parts of the routine it fits into.\n\nMy main queries:\n\nWhat can be the causes of uneven skin tone, including less obvious or remote reasons?\n\nHow can I improve my routine specifically for uneven tone with oily skin? \n\nWhat key steps might I be missing?\n\nHow should I incorporate Vaseline into my current routine without causing excess oil or clogged pores?\n\nDoes drinking multiple cups of chai a day affect the skin significantly, and should I be adjusting anything because of this?\n\nAre there any other lifestyle or skincare factors I might be overlooking that could contribute to persistent unevenness?\n\nAny advice, product suggestions, or insights would be hugely appreciated! Thanks in advance.\n\nPS: The query was initially asked to an AI, since I'm not a one directional dude, I decided to ask those at reddit too. The wording are though from the ai. ",

I’m a 26m looking for help and advice on skin routine\n\nSo I have a super oily skin and I suffered from acne in my teen years but solved it with isotretinoin and it worked like magic.\n\nKept trying products and now I have my routine, So in the morning I wash my face with La Roche-Posay Effaclar Acne Foaming Cleansing Gel followed by La Roche Posay Mela B3 anti-dark spots concentrate cream SPF30 with Niacinamide and end it with La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Oil Control Gel Cream SPF 50+ 50 ml\n\nAt night I alternate between panoxyl 10% and the previous cleanser the night with panoxyl I follow with only rice moisturizer cream, but when I use the other one I go with La Roche-Posay Effaclar Acne Serum with Salicylic Acid and Niacinamide followed by the moisturizer I also use the ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% twice weekly\n\nBut my skin still looks oily and ppl think that I’m sweating &amp; idk if this is normal or I can change it\n\nSo what do you think about it?",

Volume and curls non existent. after drying the curls are shiny and oily but thin and after 1 or 2 days they become undefined and dry.

Also, my face stings when I apply any product.\n\nRetinol: Cosrx 0.3% Pure Retinol Cream\n\nTimeline: 11/14 - used once at night time 11/15 - saw some redness but not this bad. skipped retinol this time 11/16 - applied retinol again at night 11/17-18 (today) - haven’t used it again. i’ve just been double cleansing and, a hydrating toner, and the Dr Althea 345 cream to moisturize\n\nShould I stop or tough it out? Need your thoughts please!",

      "content": "Hi everyone, apologies for the long post but I'm very new to this subreddit as I have recently discovered I have curly hair and have lots of questions. After years of not being able to dry brush and constantly frizzy hair, you can imagine my realization when I find this sub.\n\nAnyway, I read through the 80 page google doc wiki and still have a few confusing questions about curly hair maintenance. For reference, I'm 25m with medium length, fine texture, medium density, high porosity hair. I *think* my hair type is 2C but I'm not 100% sure.\n\n\n\nHere's my current routine before getting into the questions:\n\n1. SHAMPOO: kristen ess clarifying shampoo 1x a month, otherwise shea moisture intensive hydration shampoo 1-2x a week as I feel like I need it\n\n2. CONDITIONER: shea moisture men avocado butter &amp; manuka honey deep conditioner daily. I also co-wash on days I don't shampoo and fully rinse this out. I use a wide tooth comb to brush my hair in the shower.\n\n3. LEAVE-IN: after I get out of the shower, I use about 6-8 sprays emulsified in my hand of shea moisture hydrate + repair multi-action leave-in.\n\n4. CURL CREAM: shea moisture coconut &amp; hibiscus curl &amp; style milk, I put about a penny sized drop into my hand and emulsify before scrunching into my hair\n\n5. OIL: if my hair feels dry or I shampoo'd, I use 2-4 drops of cliganic argan oil. after this I just let it air dry, which usually takes \\~1hr\n\n\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. am I really meant to only \"wash\" my hair every 3-4 days? I go to the gym 4x a week and sweat profusely in the summer, I feel like I absolutely need to shower and at the very least condition my hair daily.\n\n2. the wiki says NEVER brush unless we are applying conditioner in the shower, but then there's a section on brush styling which also confused me. I've been styling my hair with just my hands when scrunching my products in, but once it dries it looks really messy like I just got out of bed. It's sitting the way I want with no crazy flyaways, but it doesnt have a \"clean\" or neat look, I suspect I need to brush but in my experience brushing has always made my hair frizzy in the past when I've used a standard hair brush.\n\n3. the wiki recommends just styling with gel, but there's also a section talking about LOC (or LCO), when are you meant to use which? My guess is that when you're doing a \"refresh\" such as getting ready in the morning you do the LOC method without gel? or is it more of an alternative to using gel instead?",
