I’m trying to find the right products (&amp; routine) for me without trying a bunch because I just can’t afford it. Trial and error is totally part of the deal , but I’d love to get recommendations and avoid at least some heartache and unnecessary expense!\n\nPics for reference:\n\n1 - 4 are decent hair days \n\n5 &amp; 6 are styles but not good hair days\n\n7 is day 3 or 4 after brushing it before showering \n\nMe:\n\n\\- nonbinary, they/them pronouns (not a woman/girl/etc).\n\n\\- disabled and chronically ill with a weak neck, so I can’t tilt my head back to diffuse, do everything upside down, or do my whole routine standing\n\n\\- newly curly; my hair became wavy/curly a little less than 2 years ago\n\nMy hair:\n\n\\- Mid-back length \n\n\\- 2b/3b (I think)\n\n\\- medium/high porosity\n\n\\- medium/fine and medium density\n\n\\- smooth hair besides damage, very little coarseness/strand texture/hold\n\n\\- mixed healthiness and textures due to hormonal shifts; split ends and in need of a trim\n\nEnvironment:\n\n\\- I live in a high desert environment but use humidifiers inside and WFH, so low/medium (30% - 50%) humidity most of the time and then very low (like 15%) when I’m out. \n\n\\- very hard water (\\~120)\n\nCurrent products:\n\n\\- NYM Tahitian gardenia &amp; mango butter shampoo &amp; conditioner\n\n\\- NYM curl talk leave-in conditioner\n\n\\- NYM curl talk styling products that I use in different combos (obviously not all together), including flash freeze, hold, and spray gels, cream, mouses, and foam\n\n\\- NYM beach babe salt spray\n\nRoutine (\\~2x/week):\n\n\\- dry brush before showering\n\n\\- lightly scrub scalp &amp; then brush through shampoo\n\n\\- rinse\n\n\\- deep scrub scalp with shampoo\n\n\\- rinse\n\n\\- condition midlengths to ends thoroughly, brushing through; let sit while I shower the rest of me (\\~5 mins)\n\n\\- rinse\n\n\\- add leave-in while still soaking wet, brushing through &amp; scrunching\n\n\\- add styling products while still pretty wet, brush through, style, and scrunch lots; add water as necessary\n\n\\- air dry (sometimes I diffuse)\n\nI often try to refresh on day two to no avail and end up in braids.\n\nI use silk pillowcases but can never get a bonnet to stay on. \n\nWhat I’ve noticed:\n\n\\- creams seem too heavy\n\n\\- the flash freeze gel and mousse are sticky and hard for me to manage; the gel is okay when I get it into soaking hair but the mousse always seems heavy\n\n\\- the foam honestly works best, but I tend to use it on day 2 or as a touch up and I don’t like how it makes my hair feel\n\n\\- nothing ever holds all day\n\n\\- hover diffusing seems to do nothing other than speed up drying, but the finished look is the same \n\n\\- diffusing adds volume but messes up my curl pattern\n\n\\- roots are always flat\n\n\\- my hair is dry and frizzy by end of day and oily at the roots on day three\n\nI’ve tried a couple shea moisture products, all too heavy. \n\nPlease help!! And please be kind. ",

As shown in the first picture about 6 months ago i was nearly completely bald, but thankfully i decided to stop denying it and started the medication (1g finasteride and topical minoxidil 5% daily). I know its not some crazy transformation but i'm satisfied with my current hair density and thinkness, and everyone i know who used to say \"hey dude i think you are balding\" \" you gotta do something about it, your sculp is very visible\" are now making remarks on how much my hair has improved. I'm sorry about the quality of the pictures, and i also see that the lighting wasnt very consistent; however, i think you could still see the improvement in the density of the hair. I am incredibly happy and satisfied with my looks now, i wish you all guys a head full of hair, its truly a blessing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c53omlng818g1.jpg?width=963&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6434709562a019c719f94175026cb9ab90ae471f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z1rkaq8h818g1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d01127c622122c469b3ed6576e424548302840d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xh6rbr0i818g1.jpg?width=1212&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=811befad7bf80b89d64d84e12219fa7e2fdda787\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xuc2hgqi818g1.jpg?width=963&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c9ca9e45affa5f726d2358231f7c110380a0d0c\n\n",

I applied only moisturiser and forgot sunscreen in a rush. Result- got significant redness on face and neck (maybe its a mild level of sunburn)\n\nSo I’m trying to fix it now by cool water splashing every few hours. But whenever I apply moisturiser my face is really itching and its also like peeling slightly near the mouth area. \n\nVaseline gluta hya moisturiser is causing burning itching feel. (so on a clean face again also used a bit of nivea but that too is itching and burning) these 2 products are really good using it since three years- so the product is not a problem. The problem is sunburn and maybe my skin isn’t able to take in any moisturiser(trust me I tried 2 moisturisers and also some body milk directly on my face- but they all just sit on the face.) There is also a patch of roughness maybe small red bumps on my skin which is not allowing moisturiser to go in) and it really burns too and itches. What should I do? Please someone help if faced similar problem or knows more about curing sunburn. Google suggested aloevera pulp direct application on the redness; but I don’t think it’s a good idea to use something directly without knowing much. Attached photos of my products. ",

Looking for a moisturiser to use here, please suggest the best one.\n\nResults-\n\nCleanser: i’ve been using for about 6-7 months now and i dont know if it works but i have noticed that oil production has reduced in my T-zone. It has never broken my skin out or anything harsh like that so I’ll probably repurchase it and continue using it.\n\nSunscreen: Been using this since the start of summer this year so around March, and I quite like it. Again I honestly don’t know if it’s doing anything because I have fair skin with redness on my cheeks 😭. But I haven’t tanned so i guess it’s working? It’s light-weight, blends into my skin quick, no white-cast, and the texture is thin, not thick at all, hasn’t caused any breakouts so I have recently repurchased it and will continue using it.\n\nToner: Just bought it a week ago, no clue if it’s working or not, hasn’t caused a breakout, let’s see if it reduces pores as it claims. Will update in the comments if I notice improvements.\n\nSerum: Definitely noticed a difference from the first week itself, I used 5% for like 6 months and it hardly did anything so I started using 10%, I can see the redness reducing and other people have noticed it too so i’ll keep using this one.\n\nTLDR: Sharing my review of these 4 products &amp; Requesting y’all to drop some advice/comments about my routine, what other serums I can try to reduce redness and acne scars, and please suggest a good moisturiser for my skin type.",

Does anyone have any experience with doing multiple rounds of the aphogee treatment, and if so- how often did you use it? I will include photos of my hair in comments.\n\nRoutine: I alternate between brands of shampoo and conditioner. Currently I switch between Redken Acidic Bonding shampoo+conditioner but I also use Garnier Wholeblends, which I am planning to swap for a better CG brand after I use the rest of it.\n\nI alternate what I use post-shower as I'm trying to find what works best, I bounce between various brands of leave-ins, frizz taming products, oils, and serums. I air dry my hair, currently no nighttime protection and no \"refresh\" either. I am currently reintroducing curly haircare to my life after neglecting my hair for a long time.",

I’ve been trying to achieve a wet hair look for ages, but I still haven’t got it.\n\nPics 1-2 show how my hair looks right after a shower or the beach (no products)—it’s legit perfect. The issue is, once it dries, it turns into pics 4-6, which isn’t bad, but not what I want.\n\nIdeally, I’d love it to look like pic 3 (Neymar style). I’m a total noob at styling curly hair, so I don’t know how to get there.\n\nOn products: Most I’ve tried (leave-in conditioner, gel, curl cream) make my hair too curly and don’t keep that straight, wet vibe from pics 1-2. They tangle my curls more and turn it coily, like a lil fro.\n\nMy routine: Wash 4 times a week (after sports), then air dry. Shampoo once, conditioner every other time. No real products except a bit of oil sometimes or sea salt spray. I sleep with a bonnet and silk pillowcase.\n\nSorry for the essay, but if anyone has recommendations, I’d really appreciate it ✌🏽",

      "content": "Hey, I'm dealing with very poor hands during this winter and I would like some advice to help them get better. I think the problem is a mix of dryness because of the cold temperature and overwashing; I used to wash my hands a LOT both at work and at home (I'm borderline maniac with that) and it just fucks me up. I work retail so I deal with a lot of dirty stuff (from plain dust to rotten fruits) and I always feel nasty and have to wash my hands, though I've been trying to reduce that lately and I seem to be managing it. When I get home I apply cream and leave my hands be, but it doesn't seem to be working at all, they still look very dry, red (especially between the fingers and on the knuckles), and feel a bit warm to the touch. I'm helpless because it looks so bad and I don't know what else I can do to soothe my hands. In the future I wanna get them tattooed but I know it's impossible if they stay in this state :(. Any help is appreciated, much thanks!",

      "content": "Hello!\n\nI have extremely thick, wavy hair and I've been considering cutting it for a few days now. I got it cut super short about 4 years ago after some body issues and depression, but grew it out. It's currently at 20ish inches. Because of my mental health struggles, I find it extremely hard to take care of myself and have to force myself to complete basic hygiene procedures like brushing my teeth, showering, and washing my face. Having long hair has made me less likely to care for myself. I love it sometimes, but most days it just feels overwhelming. I cried over it yesterday because I felt so frustrated. I just want it to be gone. \n\nI don't have the money to get it professionally cut so I'd have to DIY it and there's no way for me to get professional help if I mess it up. I trimmed it once a couple months ago and it helped for a week or two. A braid it my go-to style, but even the act of braiding it feels overwhelming right now. My wavy pattern makes it impossible to have a quick, low effort wash day. \n\nI don't think I'm in the right headspace to cut my hair, but I also don't feel like I can continue functioning for very long with my hair the way it is.\n\nTL;DR - Should I DIY cut my hair short to try and improve my mental health?\n\nI'd really appreciate any advice\n\nI attached photos of my hair before the trim, after, and right after a high-effort wash day.\n\n[After a wash day \\(NOTE: It doesn't normally look this good- my waves are looser- but I was feeling good this day and put a lot of effort into it\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xsiuarc5r18g1.jpg?width=1334&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d90619dc7da1abb4ca0a7d46a304801c7c7fd19)\n\n[After my trim in September](https://preview.redd.it/u16khwc5r18g1.jpg?width=699&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9712da704675dc339157f8e857b4bc020d95545)\n\n[Original length before trim](https://preview.redd.it/glam1tc5r18g1.jpg?width=487&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b536737dc06171bc77c7ab2f8852bc29ff4eb3cd)\n\n",

It used to be fairly curly, now it’s just… this. I still do my curly routine. This is what it looks like when I air dry it. It’s been particularly dry this winter, the frizziness has been a battle. \n\nI guess I have four specific questions:\n\nShould I get a perm? \n\nWould a shag cut suit me? \n\nShould I stop parting it to the side? (I have a cowlick right there so I just started putting my part there so I didn’t have to fight it so much.)\n\nWould a fringe suit me?\n\nI want to keep it longer but if yall think it looks dumb then I can just bob it again. \n\nLookin for extremely honest opinions and also any advice on reviving the texture in my hair. I even had the stylist go crazy with layers last time hoping that making my hair less heavy would help it curl again, but no such luck. Last cut was in July.\n\nThanks friends.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

They are mostly on my cheeks and temples, and there are a few on my forehead and chin. \n\nRight now my skin is the best it's ever been, my routine works really well for me with hydration, and made my skin texture way better, but I want to get rid of these completely, is there anything I could add to my routine that would help?\n\nI have oily skin, and this is my current routine:\n\nAM: wash with water\nPurito oat-in calming gel cream\n(Sometimes) Anua Heartleaf 77 clear pad\n\nPM: Coxir Ultra Hyaluronic cleansing oil\nCeraVe foaming cleanser\nSkin 1004 centella ampoule\nSkin 1004 tea-trica relief ampoule\nPurito mighty bamboo panthenol cream\nDr.Althea 345 relief cream\n\nAnd SPF, sunscreen is a must. I use the Round Lab birch juice sunscreen. I use silk pillowcases that are changed regularly. I also have dermatitis for which I use Elocon.\n",
