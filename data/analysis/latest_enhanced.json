No silicony texture which I miss. Cant say anything about sun protection as there was no prolonged exposure or harsh Sun in December. ",

I know that doesn’t make sense but every time I try, it’s a flop. I do it bottom, middle, top or atleast try to. Do you guys do the same or do u do front middle back (in terms of sections).Also how do you do it so the already product-ed hair sections don’t get in the way? I try to move it to the back but even with long hair it gets in the way and falls back. I swear every time I try and put it in a pony tail, it gets a ponytail dent and kind of clumps together. I hope this makes sense and I’m open to anything!\n\nHere’s my routine:\n1)detangle in the shower with ouidad curl quencher\n2)put in pattern moisture milk \nAnd not your mothers mousse\n3)use a curl comb (the one with ridges on the side)\nThat’s it (if you have suggestions please leave them!

My eyelids easily develop dry patches during the winter and I have to be very careful with my skin or I will develop dry patches on my neck. Since then, I've been avoiding moisturizers with active ingredients, harsh facial cleansers, and limit showering with very hot water. I've tried to use Aquaphor and Vaseline for relief but find that it actually causes a burning sensation when I put it on, and do not give me the moisturizing effect that I'm looking for. I've also tried the CeraVe line that is created specifically for eczematous skin but with no success. I'm at my last straw and need help. I cannot afford to go to the Dermatologist and scared to try any steroid products. Do you have any products you recommend?\n\nThank you and I'd love any advice!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I tend to scar easily and somehow I’m always hurting myself so consequently I have tons of scratch marks/scars on my legs and also a few burn marks on my arms. \n\nWhile I’m sure I can’t do anything about the burn marks, I would like to know which products would help with hyperpigmentation and other scars such as scratches and bug bites. I’ve bought the ordinary glycolic acid to give it a try but I’ve heard it best to pair exfoliants with some type of moisturizer, which I have no clue what to search for or what products help brighten skin. Though, I have heard about Alpha Arbutin, but I’m not sure if it’s actually good or what strength to get.\n\nTL;DR : I would love to hear recommendations such as serums, toners, lotions, or body washes for (kinda??) severe body hyperpigmentation and scarring.

      "content": "Hi y’all! Recently I’ve been trying to find body wash, oils, perfumes, and various other products to help me achieve my dream scent. I really want to smell like a warm, elegant, orange-vanilla mocktail. However, I’ve run into a dilemma. I don’t have a budget, and I’ve been looking into higher-end products, but none of them seem to have good vanilla body washes that don’t have a million other scent in them that I don’t want. And when I look at cheaper options, they’re always sugary vanilla instead of warm/spicy vanilla. I don’t wanna smell like a sugar cookie! I hate sugar! I guess finding orange products is a little easier, but I still need recommendations. I can’t find any higher-end products with good orangey-citrus scents. Also, what types of things do I need to complete my routine? So far, I’ve only been searching for washes, oils, perfumes, and lotions. But is there anything else? The photos I’ve included are just there to provide a visual for the VIBE I’m going for, by the way. Other scents I enjoy include jasmine, lavender (slightly), and sometimes florals.",

Been doing everything I can: deep conditioning every week, consistent trims, a gentle shampoo + conditionner + leave-in that finally seems to work. I have even done some hot oil treatments, professional mask with essential oils, cornrows as protective styles, now finger coiling (because i have not had definition otherwise) over 6 years now. \n\nNow, I have seen SOME progress. But my hair has been consitently dim, stringy, dry to the touch, hard to get my fingers through, and has really bad breakage at the front and crown of my head. I also struggle with definition most times.\n\nFor context, i had an active lifestyle: i did kickboxing, and i like to go out whenever i need to on short notices. And I chose to go natural for one reason - to get healthier hair. \n\nNow, i need 5 hours​​ to style my hair, lasts me all week - BUT when i workout (no,  pineapples do not help) my hair becomes a sticky frizzy mess. It feels like weekly torture, because through it all I walk with unhealthy hair and cramped limbs... \n\nProfessionals, even the curly natural ones, have failed my hair, they always say it is heat/chemical damage, but i have not been using heat at all and have not used done relaxers since 6 years. They reccommend treatments that broke my bank, but have not changed my hair at all (but 2$ DIY treatments helped???)\n\nDoubts and stress have been getting to me and am about to consider protein treatment/keratin/silk presses - at least I can stop worrying about styling. But I am SO scared of going through damaged hair rehab AGAIN. \n\nWhat would you suggest? Thank you so much for reading through this.​\n\nMy current routine:  \n\n1. shea moisture curl n shine shampoo \n\n2. Shea M manuka honey &amp; yogurt hydrate + repair  conditionner \n\n3. Shea M jamaican black castor oil strengthen and restore curl cream​ \n\n4. Flaxseed gel (DIYed). \n\n5. Sometimes i use grapeseed oil on my scalp.\n\n6. I clarify using a sulfate based shampoo occaisionally (Le petit marseillais force et eclat)\n\n7.I blow dry with cool air\n\n8.i sleep in with a silk/satin bonnet and a satin pillowcase \n\n[9.No](http://9.No) refresh routines, curls refuse to revive if manipulated after styling\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ichsjvejlcg1.jpg?width=3456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d49ef1a166910c5d8567ae53a172694b3cb412ff\n\n",

My hair seems to break off around this length so I’m going to see if frequent trims helps it get longer. But if I’m going to the salon, should I get some layers and if I do, how extreme should I go?\n\nLast pic is just to see what layers may look like. I don’t know if cutting the top layer super short will make the tops curly bc I think my hair grows kind of straight at the root. \n\nRoutine: \n\nWash: Suave clarifying shampoo 1x or more a week, tresemme shampoo and conditioner. Occasionally use Trader Joe’s hair mask. Would love recs for shampoo and conditioner but I def do better with some sulfates than none\n\nStyle: squish to condish, rinse up side down, add Kevin Murphy mousse to roots and scrunch, add quarter size of Not Your Mothers Curl Talk gel and scrunch. Spray with Not Your Mothers salt spray and diffuse (mostly right side up, but sometimes upside down) \n\nSleep/refresh: pineapple bun, sometimes a hair buff. Not ideal so I usually do a pretty heavy spray refresh every morning and diffuse to mostly dry. Occasionally use the vents in my car to dry the rest. Which is fun to see if you drive past me at a red light\n\nThanks!!",

      "content": "So about 6 months ago I dyed my hair calico and then it faded and it was just blonde with like 2 giant very noticeable chunks of brown on the sides and all the orange was pretty much faded to blonde. So I kept it like that for a while then decided more recently like a month ago to bleach the leftover brown parts and orangey parts to have it all blonde, butttt it all processed differently and after 2 or 3 rounds of bleach it’s not all different shades of blonde with my natural brown roots so i decided to go for this other cool look I saw where its just bright blonde hair with dark brown tips and roots. But I kinda started to hate it since my blonde is all different shades and I accidentally got a big splotch of the brown on the back of my hair a bit higher from the ends. I’m wondering now, can I just buy a super almost black dark brown color and put it on all my hair, then use this infra red manic panic I bought on top and go for a cherry red kind of look?? I’m scared that the blonde parts of my hair will be brighter red then the rest but I’m not sure since I’m dying it dark first? I looked it up and it said that could happen so I’m worried. Should I just go to a professional or save money and try my idea? I’m scared to mess it up again. I have naturally curly hair I’d say type 2c or 2b? My hair is naturally dark brown and the bleach and dyes I used were manic panic flash lightening hair brightening kit, and revlon dark brown color on the tips of my hair. (Not sure what shade exactly) PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF MY IDEA FOR GOING CHERRY REDISH COLOR WILL WORK OR IF IT WILL BE DIFFERENT SHADES AGAIN🙏🏻",

After that I started trying to care for it. My moms previous chemical straightening had ruined most of my hair beyond repair so that's why I kind of chopped it off. Now almost a year into hair care, I still haven't gotta a haircut again just letting it grow for now. \n\nI've spent alot of time and money on products and testing them out, they work in every other department but frizz. Like my hair doesn't fallout/break beyond what you expect with detangling and stuff, its shiny, (it does lose its shine after a few days) it grows at an average speed, and its like a lot of hair, like I guess its thick rn but its slightly thinning out to how it naturally is, and its curly like 2A-2B.\n\nSo my routine like how I wash and style is basically. Ill get it wet (obviously), then ill go in with usually a Kristen Ess shampoo (I have no clue which type, its usually the pink one or the green one) but when I don't have that I use this tresmme anti breakage with vitamin blend or whatever. Then I go in with the Monday Smooth Shampoo, I used to be the Monday volume but then I switched. This is also when I detangle with a brush and like really get in there. Then for conditioner currently I'm using the blue Skala, used to be the Monday Smooth conditioner with a mix of Kristen Ess. I rake the skala through and give it like 10 minutes then I wash it out with cold water after that while its straight up soaking, since the Skala is also a leave in I'll rake it through my hair using my fingers and then use an athletic shirt to scrunch since the fabric is smooth and absorbs well, after that Ill do around 2-3 pumps on each side of the Shea moisture frizz free moose, and ill scrunch that in after that is like no touching and I let it air dry. \n\nThats it and god no matter what I do it will always be frizzy, and its so annoying because I have friends with the same curl type is just shampoo and conditioner for nice and smooth and soft and frizzless hair so any advice who be appreciated",
