      "title": "[Acne] Acne &amp; PIE Only Get Worse :(",
      "content": "I am at a loss of what to do. I absolutely hate the way my skin looks and it’s really taking a hit to my well being to be honest. \n\nHere’s my skincare timeline: \n\nPrior to 2020, I used some products, like the now viral Paula’s choice exfoliant and first aid beauty moisturizer among other things that I don’t even remember now. I never really thought twice about skin care and only broke out minimally in my luteal phase. I wore minimal makeup, but had started getting into it more in 2019 and 2020. That’s when I started pretty frequently wearing bb cream. \n\nSpring of 2020 I noticed I started to breakout much more frequently. This was pre masks. \n\nThen when masks became the norm it got significantly worse. My job involved talking excessively into a mask all day so it was pretty damp under there…. \n\nI started getting more into skin care because of my acne and tried a variety of random TikTok popular products to no avail. \n\nMasks continued well into 2021 for me, and my acne never really improved. Once masks came off later that year, my acne still did not improve. I continued my dive into skincare, learning more, trying more and always to no real help. My skin would fluctuate, sometimes improving and then always coming back to acne. \n\nIn Oct 2022 I started tret. That was a huge error in judgement as I didn’t properly work my skin up to it, and I broke out significantly worse for months. I tried to push past the purge phase but I ended up stopping in Feb of 2023. My skin improved and went back to its old state of acne but not nearly as bad as while on tret. I experimented with gentler retinols as exfoliants, but never had success. \n\nIn September 2024, I decided to try Naturium azelaic acid. I’d heard so many good things, especially for PIE, which was getting worse and worse for me. I didn’t react particularly well to most exfoliants or retinols so I thought this would be a really gentle option. My face blew the hell up. I continued using it because apparently there can be a purge stage you have to push through and every thing I read said azelaic acid is so so gentle and shouldn’t be an issue long term. I persisted. Throughout my entire acne journey I try to make sure I’m trying something for at least a few weeks if they are known to have a purge stage to see if it will help. Also, in Dec 2024 I started using a red light panel for 5 mins daily for the next several months. Finally, I stopped using azelaic acid around Feb 2025 and it had made my skin astronomically worse. The PIE I was maintaining was significant. I was so frustrated that I’ve fucked up my skin so much more. I became suspicious that I have a niacinamide allergy and that’s why the Naturium azelaic acid was so bad. I removed it from my routine. \n\nAt this point I was so over PIE and experimenting that I went to a medical esthetician. They recommended micro-needling for the acne and PIE but I asked for a DYE VL laser for a few treatments to specifically target the PIE first which was the biggest hit to my confidence.  After 2-3 treatments from March 2025 to July 2025 it hadn’t seemed to improve yet, and I was trying to get pregnant so I had to stop the laser. I also discovered the sunscreen and setting spray I was using daily had niacinamide so I was hopeful that was the reason I hadn’t seen any improvement and replaced it in my routine. \n\nIn August 2025 I switched to microneedling which I then did for 4 treatments from August 2025 to January 2026. I didn’t notice improvement from the  treatments and now I’m realizing microneedling actually makes my skin breakout a ton. It gets glowy for a duration after which has made me go back for more but I think it ultimately is making things worse. \n\nIn December 2025 I also realized that the moisturizer I was using daily had niacinamide . I had checked it previously but was reading an outdated ingredient list and their new formulation now included it. I removed it from my routine. I finally feel confident there’s no niacinamide in my routine but my skin hasn’t improved. \n\nMy esthetician suggested I remove tocopherol but it’s in bloody every makeup product I can get in my country and I literally can’t leave my house without makeup or at least a tinted spf because of how awful I feel in my skin. \n\nAside from those big changes I’ve listed, I’ve tried what feels like every product under the sun. Ive gotten a chemical peel but it just broke me the hell out. I’ve removed dairy from my diet for multiple months. I’ve removed gluten from my diet for multiple months. I’ve lowered sugar to &lt;25g daily from multiple months. I wash my pillowcases weekly. Ive tried a low histamines. Ive gone weeks at a time simplifying my routine to only simple cleanser, moisturizer and spf.  I’ve used single use towels to wash my face.  I’ve been to a derm who just suggested hormonal meds and didn’t even look at my skin without makeup. I have endometriosis and hypothyroidism and know they can contribute to acne but I consistently have good blood test results for my hormones. I feel like I’ve tried almost everything and can’t solve this. \n\nThe things I haven’t tried:\n\n1. Hormonal medication. I refuse to do this because I had an awful experience with birth control years ago that ruined my health for 11 months afterwards. I’m trying for a baby and can’t afford to throw my hormones out of wack.\n\n2. Removing tocopherol like suggested due to the makeup thing. \n\nI’m so frustrated and don’t know what to do. Is this going to be my skin forever? Help please :( ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm 35, with two young kids and have noticed my skin suddenly shift and show more visible signs of aging. Nothing wild, just the usual - fine lines on my forehead and from nose to mouth, crows feet, sagging skin under my eyes. And because of the two young kids I feel and look tired! Possibly slightly puffy under eyes - I think thats making that area look a bit sagging.\n\nI'm a total skincare beginner - every time I start looking into options I get overwhelmed with how many options there are and get paralysed with indecision! My current routine is very simple: oil based cleanser (Aesop Parlsey Seed from a friend), Weleda Skin Food Light and I've started experimenting with The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid after a friend suggested it. I like everything I use but am happy to mix it up and would like to add in something that is more proactive at reducing fine lines/firming plumping under my eyes.im looking for recommendations for a few products and when to use them.\n\nI used to think I had oily skin but years ago I started using Johoba Oil as my main moisturiser and my skin actually totally settled down and balanced. I don't use it now but have a better understanding that my skin doesn't like to be too dry and it overreacts.\n\nI'm in the UK and would prefer products that are relatively affordable and easy to find in the here. And not too many steps or I'll never find time to do it all! I've looked into The Ordinary simply because they have lots of info on their website but don't understand the difference between retinol/growth factors/peptides etc!\n\nOh. And I use sunscreen in the summer but not often in winter/Spring/Autumn. I want to but find it so heavy and greasy and it makes me develop spots. I would love a recommendation for something really light that I could use every day. Maybe something milky in texture if that exists?\n\nAny advice or recommendations are so welcome, I am totally out of my depth!",

      "content": "Hello! I'm wicked poor and I don't know how to take care of my face. It is always oily, but the skin around my nose is painful, red, and flaking off all the time. Especially in the winter. My smile lines get a little flakey too. My pores are massive all over my face. It is like my nose pores refill every night with new nasty no matter what I do. I have had chin, jaw line, lower cheek, and some neck acne my whole life (I'm 29). \n\nI currently use a gentle moisturizing face wash for sensitive skin with a wash cloth, thyers rose water toner, and good molecules overnight serum all in the morning. I know it says overnight, but for some reason I'm getting better results when I use it during the day and night every day even though it says once every three days, and I feel like I'm probably using a lot. It doesn't help with acne at all otherwise and it hasn't been making the dry skin any worse than it already is. I just started putting a thin layer of aquaphor by the corners of my nostrils and down my smile lines to help with the dry skin that turns into scabs when I inevitably pick at it because it looks like I have dried snot around my nose all the time and I can't stand it. The overnight serum and the aquaphor has helped with the painful, red, flakey acne skin around the corners of my nose and smile lines, but not entirely. Nothing gets rid of the stubborn black heads from my nose all the way down my chin and what isn't a blackhead is a bump under the skin that won't pop or go away. \n\nI have pretty deep forehead wrinkles for my age, but every lotion/sunscreen I try makes me more oily and break out more. I've given up on lotion/sunscreen at this point but I know I need it. My forehead/wrinkles are like if someone filled the grand canyon with oil. I keep googling and getting results for products I can't afford. I need walmart chic lol. Does anyone have any recommendations? I'm hoping for no more than 3 or 4 products at $5 to $10 each if possible",

They only last me like 3 months max. \n\nLately though it’s often out of stock online and I’m looking for a less expensive alternative with similar or better performance. I’ve done a lot of research and I see this sub swears by Minimalist Vitamin C. I’m thinking of switching to Minimalist 16% Vitamin C (E &amp; Ferulic) since it’s about half the price of Agelite‑X. \n\nAlso I’ve also seen a lot of good reviews about Melano CC (though it seems pricey), but recommendations on that too would be great.\n\nWhat I am asking is it worth switching to Minimalist 16%? Or should I try Melano CC instead or should I just continue with Agelite-X?\n\nWould love to hear user thoughts on results and overall value. Thank you!",

But I would live to hear all of recommendations. \n\nI am very new to curly hair, ive only started to wear my hair curly this year. I have been using Kerastas Genesis (the dry hair version it is in pink bottle), and ravines oi conditioner. I have used Davies oi shampoo as well which was good but I feel like weighed my hair down a lot. \n\nI have a dry scalp, I wash my hair once a week bc It really doesn't get oily but I also have some flakes which im trying to figure out whats causing that. Anyways, I need to get new shampoo and conditioner and I wanted to ask recommendations because my hair is thin but doesn't get oily. and I dont do a curl routine because its very defined anyways usually, I just oil it everyday and spray it with water if I want it to be less frizzy or more  defined. (I am scared of hairloss which had been an issue for a while). I think I have 3B ? type of hair, I dont mind not having tight curls haha. I would love to get recommendations! ive tried my sisters amika hydro rush shampoo and it was  good! idk if it was the best tho tbh. ",

I think I need to take care of it differently\n\nthe current routine:\n\n\\- vichy dercos sensitive shampoo\n\n\\- the ordinary behentrionium chloride 2% conditioner\n\n\\- harologi rebuild spray, every third wash for 5 min\n\n\\- hask curl defining cream, scrunched in\n\n\\- air dry or dry with diffuser\n\nthe pictures have been taken on wash day after diffuser drying and brushing once completely dry\n\nI suspect that this routine is drying out my hair a bit too much and I think the curl cream is too heavy. I‘m not sure whether the uneven curl pattern is due to my products not being ideal (the top layer is quite dry) or if that‘s just naturally what my hair does now\n\nI‘d like to try new products and techniques but am having a hard time navigating the sea of options. Any advice I can start researching from is appreciated :) I kind of don‘t know where to begin, that curl cream belonged to my ex and I just stuck with it lol\n\nalso… please be very honest, I feel like the back of my hair looks tragic ;-; do you think I should cut it shorter? I love the way it curls in the front at this lenght but whenever I see a picture of me at a slight angle or from the back I feel pain\n\nthank you!",

Almost everything I use regularly at home, and the travel sizes are stuff I've used fine at home and at my daughter's house. \n\nIs the water in the hotel too hard or soft?\n\nThis was my second wash at this hotel. First was fine, not exceptional, but fine. Second wash, hair washed fine, suds were normal. \n\nThe InnerSense Conditioner is amazing, normally, but this time my hair tangled badly, and the wet frizz was off the charts when I rinsed it out. Usually, I have soft seaweed hair after rinsing. Not this time. So, I put extra EcoSlay cream (normally use AG beach bomb sparingly at home), and it felt sticky, so I added more water, and \"squish to condish\" without improvement. \n\nI loaded up my hair with InnerSense I Create volume, that I normally I use for slip while brushing, and it was better, but my hair felt WEIRD. \n\nSo, second wash I left the gel off. Tried a little InnerSense I Create Lift foam to help with definition. Diffused, and I guess it'll stay in a pineapple until I go home. \n\nRoutine (travel kit)\n1. Ouidad Anti-frizz shampoo (I always use)\n2. InnerSense Conditioner (I always use)\n2a. BounceCurl detangler brush (I always use)\n3. EcoSlay Orange Marmalade cream - travel size pump\n4.
