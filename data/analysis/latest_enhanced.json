      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I decided to start derma rolling and using minoxidil at night for the last 2 weeks because I haven’t seen from what I can tell any regrowth from finasteride atall.\n\nIve also started to try taking some supplements. I take protein powder, vitamin d3, k2 and Zinc, magnesium(all in one pill). Omega 3 fatty acids (consumed via a can of sardines).

Around 2-3 years ago, my Derm put me on Tretinoin for a year when I was 14-15, as well as Benzoyl Peroxide treatment cream. My skin looked good and my breakouts were pretty much casual, only triggered whenever on my period. But now I’ve stopped using Tret and really only use Benzoyl whenever I have a cystic pimple, the thing is, every two days I get recurring pimples and my cheeks look very flushed. I keep my routine as simple as possible and have tried almost a wide variety of different products. The tried and true products that I use on a daily from since 2 months ago are—\n\nLa Roche- Posay Purifying Foaming Cleanser (Am-PM)\nVanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer (Am only )\nL’Oréal Paris Bright Revival Sunscreen (Am-  only reapply once throughout the day tbh)\n\nPrior to these, I was using all CeraVe products and my skin looked much worse but I’m still very unhappy with my skin. I eat relatively clean, workout,  drink spearmint tea, but how come my skin now that I’m 17, has become extremely oily and sensitive??? \n\nI heard Salicylic Acid was good so I tried it for a month and it did nothing.  \n\nI’ve considered seeing my Derm again but last time I went he said going on birth control would help but I’m worried it might have worse effects !\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated 🤍🤍",

There are red spots all over, and it hurts to even put aloe Vera on. I've been using zinc oxide with black seed oil cream that's meant for baby rashes, and it has somewhat helped.\nHowever, I am worried the burn marks will scar. Should I leave it to heal on its own or contact a dermatologist for help? Has anybody dealt with something like this that could give me advice? Dermatologists here are quite expensive, so l'd like to know if this is a good reason to contact one and that I am not wasting my money.\nThank you.",

      "title": "“Irish Curls” Please Help",
      "content": "reposted because I forgot to cover my face in a photo.\n\n\n\nHi, I am new here, and looking for help with styling and caring for my hair. Sorry this is long. I’ve struggled with my hair my whole life. It’s always had wave in front and wavier in back, like ropes, so I mostly kept it long and wore it down to cover “Irish curls”. I started getting salon cuts as a kid and have had decades of layering and thinning it, and spent my teens and early 20s straightening it. A couple of years ago I decided to grow out the layers and thinning and trim the ends at home, and ended up with a giant curly bump under the back. Recently the bump became bigger and completely unmanageable, so I did some layering, and I have been stunned with how wavy/curly it is. \n\n\n\nMy biggest issue is that it’s still only slightly wavy in front even with diffusing. I do have a bad habit of touching the front of my hair so I’m trying to quit. Clarifying has also seemed to help a little. Did I cut front pieces too short? The front is finer but very thick, and the back is very coarse, tangles easily and very thick. I actually kind of like how it looks with just a scrunch, minimal product and air drying and think the front blends better, but I’m curious whether I can get it to look more like the back so I have the option of wearing it wavier.\n\n\n\nI’m not really sure I have a specific question, but has anyone else found a solution to Irish curls? I’m considering giving up and just growing it long again and using heatless curlers at night, but I’m only a few weeks in to CGM, so trying to not let myself quit. \n\n\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nWash Aveda sapmoss shampoo, nutriplenish conditioner. Lolavie or innersense protein mask every once in awhile when it feels dry. Styling: brush in shower while soaking wet then scrunch, Aveda be curly cream and or gel, brush in sections ecotools curl defining brush, scrunch with t shirt and diffuse \n\n\n\n\n\n* I haven’t colored it since 2017, and sun bum spray on lightener in 2022 once. very rarely use heat, haven’t straightened in about 15 years, stay out of the sun, and only wear it up in a clip. I love hot showers so am trying to use less hot water in the shower. Idk if the front is damaged, but it’s always been straighter than the back.\n* I have to use a clarifying shampoo often and wash daily to every other day because of a scalp condition. I try to make up for it with hydrating conditioner, masks, and leave in conditioner on ends.\n* We have very soft water.\n\n\n\nPics:\n\n1 My hair pre thinning as a kid. The front has some wave so I’m hopeful that will come back\n\n2 the bump pre layers\n\n3 layered no styling\n\n4 diffused\n\nThank you for any advice/ tips! ",

They are starting phase 3 trials next year. \n\nIn phase 2a trial, 31% of those with higher degree of hair loss were treated with PP405 exhibited a greater than 20% increase in hair density.\n\nPP405 induced new hair growth from follicles where no hair was previously present — offering early validation of its regenerative potential.\n\n\nBut here is where it gets interesting...\n\n\nYears ago we learnt that hair follicles never die when you go bald, but progenitor cells do die. We also know that arrector pili muscles die when you are extensively bald and have major fibrosis. And then we have the issue of escaping stem cells.\n\nSo how did Pelage grow hair from bald areas when we know that progenitor cells and arrector pili muscles die. Also there's the issue of escaping stem cells.\n\n\nThe co-founder of Pelage at 24:25 is saying that the hair follicles are still there and they tested skin sample of a person who was bald for decades and had lots of growth. So now I don't know which is right which is frustrating.\n\n\n24:25 one of co-founders of Pelage talking about hair follicle stems cells on those who have advanced pattern hair loss.\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/using-metabolism-to-improve-skin-aging-and-hair-loss/id1730821144?i=1000652866815",

      "content": "Hey everyone, this is actually my first post on Reddit ever ! I’m very new here and have no idea what I’m doing TT but I figured this was the only place where I could get real help. I’m F (19) and throughout my whole life I’ve been bullied or considered not attractive because my bare face has a lot of acne and damaged skin. I really just want my skin to clear up, because it’s so annoying and painful, especially when I can see it through makeup. I use makeup very occasionally (like once or twice a month) for dance team competitions. It’s so overwhelming on the internet because everyone’s trying to promote their brand and I’m not sure what is actually good or bad for my skin. I tried natural remedies like haldi, honey, and yogurt masks, neem masks, multani mitti, etc. and I’ve been doing this for YEARS with barely any change. I have tried pretty much every cheap mask and skincare product, but it’s seriously been a decade at this point with no change (neutrogena salicylic acid wash, cera ve burns my skin, clearasil, benzoyl peroxide,0.1% adapalene cream (prescribed and made my skin burn) st Ives is just.. no)\n\n\\*\\*I have symptoms of hormonal imbalance and PCOS so I feel like this problem is less topical and maybe I just need to wait for my hormones to settle down ? This also causes things like increased hair growth so I shave/lazer that on my face. But I still want to see if maybe the products I’m using are doing more harm than good. I know Korean skincare is the biggest remedy right now, I have combination skin and Indian genetics so I’m not sure where to start. Aside from pimples I have pretty enlarged, clogged pores and redness. After I cleanse my skin feels very dry so I immediately put on my moisturizer. But then throughout the day my skin feels very oily especially on my cheeks, chin and the T zone. This is likely combination skin right ?\n\nMy morning and night skincare is just two products (with the right recommendations I’ll hopefully figure out a good routine) but it’s just the Neutrogena Salicylic Acid Oil Free Acne Wash (it’s the orange one) and Aveeno daily moisturizing face/body lotion. I use the face one usually but I could only find the body one this time. Sometimes I use the clearasil 5 in one and the freeman watermelon soothing gel mask when my skin breaks out more than usual, it feels like something’s happening but I’m worried it’s doing more harm to my skin barrier.\n\nMy skin is basically crying for help at this point. I feel bad even putting on makeup sometimes because I feel like I’m damaging it further. I’ve seen on TikTok people are using Dr melaxin and April skin to get their pores unclogged, I’m skeptical about whether or not to get them because I don’t know if they work or not. But after posting this I’m ready to just bite the bullet and get something new for a change.\n\nThank you guys so much for listening &lt;3 As I said this is my first Reddit post so please be understanding of that :)",

At night, I was washing, using prescription tretinoin, and following up with moisturizer.\n\nIt worked for me and I loved the tret; I have oily, acne-prone skin. I’m also in my early 30s and it was keeping some of the wrinkles at bay.\n\nI’ve dropped the tretinoin and want to keep the Cetaphil wash/lotion and the vitamin C.\n\nToday I picked up the Ordinary azelaic acid and glycolic acid after seeing them recommended during pregnancy and for acne. Are these best used at nighttime? Can both be used at the same time, or is it best to alternate?\n\nThank you!",

Then every night I also use prescription Epiduo forte (adapelene and benzoyl peroxide gel) that I normally just use in my forehead. I have tried using it on my nose because I have a lot of oil and sebaceous filaments and massive pores here and I’ve heard adapelene is a solution to this but it’s done absolutely nothing other then dry and make it flake off and make me look dirty. I’m super scared and hesitant to start any skin care because I’m worried it’s going to clog up my large open pores and make me get terrible acne and breakout. My skin is pretty reactive. So while I have upset, dry in some spots but extremely slick and oily, sun damaged, textured red skin it at least doesn’t have large acne that you can see from a far. But I think it’s time I try to take care of it right so I guess I am just hoping someone can help me find a good routine to target sebaceous filaments and broken capillaries, sun damage and fine lines and then I guess try to hydrate it? Or to let me know what to do based off what you see in the pics if you have a similar experience. Idek. I’m just worried of using moisturizer or any new products I get a ton of little bumps that then turns into a full forehead of acne. Thanks in advance.",
