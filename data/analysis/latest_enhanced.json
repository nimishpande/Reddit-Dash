I had no other option so I bought minimalists salicylic acid and a tranexamic acid serums separately, but ever since then a pimple or two repeatedly. I know it doesn’t sound like a huge deal after years of acne and being taunted for my skin, im extremely insecure of my skin and this has been bothering me way too much. PLEASE GUYS SUGGEST ME AN ALTERNATIVE, what do you think could be possibly breaking me out? I would’ve visited my dermatologist but im in college in a different city currently, please please suggest me alternatives, should i stop using tranexamic acid? or salicylic? ive posted the formulation of the serums in the succeeding slides.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I live in an area where it seems like a lot of girls are a lot more high maintenance about their hair (blowouts, daily heat-styling, lots of product etc), and I am pretty aware that wherever I go my hair is the worst-looking in the room my far unless I’m in a Walmart or something.\n\nThere’s also people who assume that I don’t know how to take care of it, and will give me unsolicited tips that I’ve already tried or are not helpful advice for my hair (for example lots of people think my hair is thick when really it’s just high-density). But i also understand that when I wear my hair this way, yea, it looks like I don’t know how to take care of it.\n\nSo here I am I guess looking for advice and reassurance.. not sure what kind of advice but does anyone else wear their natural frizzy hair out and about, and is not actively trying to fix it? Really really frizzy? What do people say about it? How do you deal with it in academic/professional settings?

      "title": "[Routine Help] Oily skin + Tretinoin",
      "content": "Oily skin + Tretinoin routine advice\n\nI struggle with oily skin and a strawberry seed nose because of my sebaceous filaments.\n\nI'm also curious if it's ok to just keep this routine and let the tretinoin work and have all these hydrating steps support it to balance out how the tret would dry me out.\n\nI was looking for advice on how to adjust my skincare routine.\n\nI asked AI and I got this response and was wondering how legit it is.\n\nQuestion: I want to check the products I use for compatibility with each other and also my oily skin.\n\nIn the morning, I use TIRTIR original milk toner, Aestura Atobarrier365 Hydro Essence, Aestura Atobarrier365 cream, and Skin 1004 Centella sunscreen.\n\nAt night, I double cleanse with Manyo pure cleansing oil, isntree yam root milk cleanser, then use the same toner and essence I used in the morning, then put cosrx snail mucin after that, then sandwich method .05 tretinoin gel with Real Barrier extreme cream, then after sandwiching I apply Aveeno Eczema Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Cream, La Roche Posay Cicaplast Balm B5, then slug with aquaphor at the end.\n\nAnswer: This routine contains some \"Hall of Fame\" Reddit favorites (Aestura, Cosrx, La Roche-Posay), but for oily skin, you are running a high risk of clogging your pores.\nYour routine is essentially designed for someone with extremely dry, dehydrated skin living in a desert. Since you have oily skin and concerns about \"strawberry nose\" (sebaceous filaments), this routine is likely working against you by trapping too much oil.\nHere is the breakdown of compatibility and risks.\nThe Major Flags\n1. The \"Lasagna\" Problem (PM)\nYou are applying 5 different moisturizing layers in the evening:\n * Real Barrier Extreme Cream (Under Tret)\n * Real Barrier Extreme Cream (Over Tret)\n * Aveeno Eczema Therapy\n * LRP Cicaplast Balm\n * Aquaphor\n * The Risk: This is total occlusion overkill. While \"sandwiching\" is good for Tretinoin, adding Aveeno + Cicaplast + Aquaphor on top creates a greenhouse effect. This traps heat and bacteria, which can actually worsen acne and prevent your sebaceous filaments from clearing out.\n * Tretinoin Gel Compatibility: You are using the Gel formulation. Tretinoin Gel is famously finicky; it forms a film. Layering heavy creams under it (like Real Barrier) significantly blocks absorption. Layering 3 heavy occlusives over it often causes the gel to \"pill\" (ball up like eraser shavings), meaning it isn't absorbing properly.\n2. The Strawberry Nose Conflict\n * Slugging (Aquaphor) on Oily Skin: While great for healing, slugging is the enemy of sebaceous filaments. Petrolatum traps the sebum in your nose pores. If you want your nose to look cleaner, stop slugging your nose.\n * TIRTIR Original (AM): As discussed, this is very rich. Using this + Essence + Aestura Cream in the morning is likely why you might look greasy by midday.\nOptimized Routine (Using what you have)\nYou don't need to throw these products away, but you should subtract steps to let your oily skin breathe and let the Tretinoin actually work.\nMorning: The \"Lighten Up\" Strategy\nGoal: Hydration without the grease.\n * Rinse with Water (Skip cleanser if you aren't sweating; your PM cleanse was heavy).\n * Toner: TIRTIR Original (Apply a light layer).\n * Essence: Aestura Hydro Essence.\n * Moisturizer: SKIP THIS.\n   * Why: The TIRTIR toner and Aestura essence are already moisturizing. Your sunscreen is the final layer. You do not need the heavy Aestura Cream in the morning for oily skin.\n * Sunscreen: Skin 1004 Centella (This acts as your AM moisturizer).\nEvening: The \"De-Clog\" Strategy\nGoal: Barrier support without suffocation.\n * Oil Cleanse: Manyo Pure Cleansing Oil (Great).\n * Second Cleanse: Isntree Yam Root Milk Cleanser.\n   * Note: Since you have oily skin, make sure you rinse this very thoroughly. Milk cleansers can leave a residue.\n * Hydration: TIRTIR Toner OR Snail Mucin.\n   * Why: You don't need Toner + Essence + Snail Mucin. Pick one or two. The Snail Mucin is great for Tretinoin hydration.\n * The Sandwich (Modified):\n   * Layer 1 (Buffer): Apply a thin layer of Aestura Atobarrier Cream (lighter than Real Barrier) or the Aveeno.\n   * Wait 10-20 mins: Let it dry.\n   * Layer 2: Tretinoin 0.05% Gel.\n   * Wait 20 mins: Let it dry completely.\n   * Layer 3 (Final): Real Barrier Extreme Cream.\n * STOP HERE.\n   * You do not need to add Aveeno OR Cicaplast OR Aquaphor on top of the Real Barrier. The Real Barrier cream is already an intense occlusive.\nWhen to use the \"Extras\"\n * LRP Cicaplast B5: Use this only as a \"spot treatment\" on nights you are not using Tretinoin, or if you have a specific irritated red patch. Do not use it all over your face every night; it is very pore-clogging for oily skin.\n * Aquaphor: Use this on your lips and around your eyes/nostrils (to protect them from Tretinoin migration), but do not put it over your T-Zone.\nSummary of Changes\n * AM: Drop the Aestura Cream. Rely on Toner + Essence + Sunscreen.\n * PM: Choose one final sealant (Real Barrier is the best one you have). Stop layering Aveeno + Cicaplast + Aquaphor on top of it.\n * Nose: Avoid putting the heavy creams (Real Barrier/Cicaplast/Aquaphor) directly on your nose to help with the filaments. Just use the toner and a light layer of Aveeno there.",

      "content": "Hi, in about 4 months it will be 3 years since I let my hair grow out completely, and I've started to see thin ends appearing. I haven't trimmed the ends in almost 2 years, and I'm thinking about trimming them, but I'm very afraid of leaving the salon with a much shorter length or with my hair having a different shape than before. How can I trim the ends myself at home? I'm terrified of cutting my hair and seeing a difference in length. I've always hated cutting my hair since I was a child, so my confidence in salons or barbers is very low. I would like some tips on how to trim the ends at home.\n\nNote: The hair in the photos is not in the best condition because I'm spending my vacation in a city that is dry and hot.\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. Wash and detangle on the same day (1-3 times) a week.\n2. Shampoo: Neutrox \"Curls and Waves\"\n3. Conditioner: Skala Curl Styling Cream\n4. Oil after washing: Salon Line \"S.O.S\" Curls\n5. Drying: Using a regular towel for a few minutes on the hair and then air drying.\n6. I don't use a satin bonnet before bed.\n\nThis is the routine I've maintained for a few years.\n\nBetween washes I don't do anything to my hair, I don't do any kind of styling.",

I started using SA cleanser (2%) about 2-3 years ago just once a day after getting up (I only wash my face one time, because I have seen better results with it), and it changed my life. I almost stopped getting acnes and my skin started getting clearer and smoother. But nowadays, I am seeing some acnes, and also although it almost stopped the acnes, still I get acnes every now and then and they leave scars that are getting harder to get rid of. I heard that BHA helps preventing acnes and getting rid of them, but AHA is better for getting rid of the scars. I was wondering if I can incorporate a Niacinamide+ Glycolic Acid serum to my AM routine immediately after washing my face with SA cleanser, or it will overly irritate my skin. Looking forward to hear about everyone's experience and suggestions.",

I’m nervous that getting it removed would leave a scar or mark that’s more noticeable than the mole itself, especially because it’s in my smile lines.\n\nI’m also not sure if it would be better to go to a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon.\n\nI would really appreciate if anyone with experience in this could help me.

      "content": "Hello! I was wondering if I could have some advice about cutting/styling my hair type. I currently have long hair - I got it cut into a non-layered bob in May of 2023 and have been getting trims every six months since then. I’ve been getting really sick of my length and I want to get it cut short into a more androgynous style.\n\nI think I have 2a-2b fine, thin, low porosity hair. In 2018, I cut it super short without a plan and felt like I didn’t know how to style it, so I was hoping to get some direction this time around about how to cut my hair short and make it look good and wavy.\n\nCurrent routine: wash with Trader Joe’s tea tree shampoo and condition with Trader Joe’s tea tree conditioner. Once a week, I clarify with V05 clarifying shampoo instead of the Trader Joe’s shampoo. Then, I put in curlsmith curl defining styling soufflé with prayer hands, scrunch not your mother’s curl talk mousse in the roots, and comb in a very light amount of curlsmith in-shower style fixer gel. After the shower, I plop with a microfiber towel and sometimes air dry, sometimes diffuse with medium heat and low air. Overnight I put my hair in a very loose, high ponytail with a silk scrunchie and sleep on a silk pillowcase.\n\nThese pictures span 2019-2025 - I tried to pick both good and bad hair days and varying lengths to represent how my hair acts. Without styling my hair is flat and frizzy with no curl definition.",

      "content": "First set of pictures (first 5) are from days before starting treatment 6 months ago. The second set (last 5) are from today, a bit over 6 months after starting treatment.\n\nI have seen no progress and continual loss. While it looks like my corners and my hairline are more aligned, don’t be fooled—this is because the middle/center part of my hairline moved backward, not that my corners moved forward. I am seeing continued diffuse thinning, so much so that my crown is now visibly thinning. The corners of my hairline are also moving further and further back, by the day it seems. My hair’s texture and consistency has completely changed in these 6 months and it is only going to get worse.\n\nI can’t grow a beard (probably the worst one I’ve ever seen in terms of density) and I’m only 20 so there really isn’t a good way to approach this. I’m kind of just holding on to what I have and will shave it off once it gets too bad. It’s hurting my confidence, ego, and self image in so many ways. My hair used to be one of my greatest features, and now it’s leaving me. I won’t get to enjoy my 20s with hair and will now be written off as an outcast. \n\nI have a girlfriend, but I feel that she won’t stick around once I become noticeably bald. She’s a wealthy gal and is quite pretty; there’s no reason why she’d stick around with a guy like me if I was bald. My thick, luscious Italian waves are rapidly leaving. I don’t know how to accept this and I am unsure of how I will be viewed when looking for jobs. I am already a very reserved and quiet person, but it’s okay because my hair has made me approachable and “normal” seeming. However, without this, I will surely have to try a lot harder and embrace being myself and get over my chronic anxiety.\n\nMy biggest fears are being consumed by anxiety and losing my girlfriend. She is so important to me but I feel like this will be a deal breaker, given that she is a little vain, worthy of better, and loves fashion and appearances. I’m already quite bad at socializing, so going through this might literally make or break me.\n\nI’m not sure what I should do in terms of other options. I’m afraid to start dutasteride because I’ve already been experiencing negative side effects from finasteride (ED, lowered libido, higher voice, etc) and I’m already afraid of PFS so I’m really unsure. I truly hope my symptoms subside if I choose to stop. If I opt for dutasteride, I’m afraid of my symptoms worsening and I just can’t handle even lowered libido or worsened ED—I’d be miserable. \n\nGiven that finasteride hasn’t even stabilized my hair, I don’t even think I’d qualify for a hair transplant at this point. I think I am ultimately out of luck and destined for baldness.\n\nAny words of affirmation? Any advice? Anything positive at all to pick me up off of the floor? Thanks everyone.",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I’m posting again to see if there is anyone who could help - I don’t know anyone in real life!\n\nI’m a little desperate. I got a haircut last summer which I didn’t like due to the blunt shape which I tried rectifying by trying this Wayne Tuggle 4 section haircut on YouTube. I assume this is what left me with a gap in the middle essentially. I then had a haircut at a curly hair stylist in the fall to fix all of it and we agreed not to completely trim it all in regards to the hole in the middle of the back since it seemed to camouflage well. I cut some curtain bags myself about a week later. I also started using a whole new line of products (Innersense).\n\nThat was end of October. Out of curiosity I filmed the back of my head yesterday and was shocked to see the bottom layers. I did notice that my hair seemed to be thinner at the bottom (especially when both parts are pulled to the front) which I chalked up to hormones/vitamin deficiencies and the face framing layers I got. But the videos seem to look even worse. A noticeable gap in the middle (prior to this hair cut I did have long hair with no gaps) and generally straggly bits at the bottom. I don’t even know what this from nor how to fix it. The stylist I saw is the only curly hair specialist in town. I’ve attached two videos (in one). I’d really appreciate any advice!\n\nRoutine:\n\nShampoo: Innersense Pure Harmony Hairbath and Vichy Dercos\n\nConditioner: Innersense Color Radiance\n\nStylers: a concoction of Sweet Spirit Leave in and I create volume as well as I create hold and I create lift (all from Innersense)\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- a little goes a long way; it was my first time doing this particular mix of products on this wash day and the hair seems to be good. I emulsify product with water and take it in wet hair. Then I scrunch and scrunch out excess water with microfiber towel. I let it sit like that for 5 minutes and then cup diffuse upside down and from side to side. I then fluff it out. Refresh is just taking a bit of water with sweet spirit leave in and coating frizzy, undefined strands with that as well as a bit of I create volume and then scrunching it up. Often I don’t need to do that. I sleep with my hair in a pineapple. Sometimes I use I create finish on dry hair.",

I stopped washing my face when I showered and instead was using a water bottle, wipes and micellar water. I also bought some acne products there that helped. Luckily my skin cleared up the rest of the trip but I’ve been home two days and have done a more deep cleaning. It seems my pores are clogged more than usual. I want to get a facial or professional treatment but would love some recommendations! I’ve done hydrating/extraction facials before.",

      "content": "hey all.  i’ve been using the neutrogena hydro boost water cream PLUS for at least a year now.  yes the ones from costco with the + sign at the end that has a different and shittier formula than the original one apparently.  i didn’t even know it was worse and was consistently using it because i liked it.  i still am using one and was going to stock up but was wondering if it is truly smth i should continue using.  i don’t know if it’s the one.  a pack of two also costs $37 without that sale, so it feels quite expensive imo.\n\nfor info i have dry skin with an oily t-zone.  i use it after washing my face in the morning and after a shower (i don’t dry my face with a towel after showering and my restroom has no windows so imagine it’s just super humid and wet in there).  i apply a very small amount i’m taking super small and apply it to my face.  this is my only step in my skincare routine for my face besides maybe sunscreen!!!!\n\nnow i’m not sure what exactly a well hydrated face is supposed to feel lie throughout the day, but i guess my face my get dry throughout….?  i’m not sure i’ve never noticed.\n\ni’m wondering if i should switch to the gel cream because it’s an actual formula and lighter than the water cream+ i’ve been using, so i may actually be able to apply some more and keep my face plump and hydrated for longer…?\n\nwhat are your thoughts?  should i try the gel cream?  ditch neutrogena altogether and try smth else?",
