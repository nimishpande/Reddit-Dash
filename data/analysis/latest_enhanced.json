      "content": "My hair has turned salt and pepper! (48F) I have naturally dark brown hair. I get stopped on the street by strangers asking if I got my color done at the salon. I don’t color my hair and usually do my own trims. \n\nI have medium/fine, low porosity, Irish curls- curlier underneath than on top. I think my grays are straighter than my other curls and they loosen up faster on day two.\n\nMy holy grail of products:\n\nShampoo &amp; Conditioner: Innersense Bright Balance (to keep grays from going yellow)\n\nProducts: A Curl Can Dream cream and gel- actually holds but is soft to the touch.\n\nRoutine: wash once or maybe twice a week. Apply a very small amount of the moisture definition cream throughout sopping wet hair. Flip head upside down, apply light hold gel to each section using a half pump of gel per section (really smoosh it in) and brush with Bounce curl define brush to the back of head starting at the base of the neck and doing several sections to the crown. Then head right side up, I do the tops and sides by sections, always brushing from the underside of the section, up and away from scalp. I let air dry about 50% and then finish with diffuser blow dryer. Sleep with silk bonnet and refresh each day with a continuous fine mister spray bottle and scrunch. Sometimes I’ll use a curling wand on the top layer to refresh flattened or wayward curls. I will use a heat protectant like Kenra Platinum Blow Dry Spray when I use the curling wand, but usually don’t when I blow dry bc I don’t use super high heat with the blow dryer.",

      "title": "[B&amp;A] How I got rid of Blackheads",
      "content": "Hi everyone!         \n\nI’m 28M. Like every human, I have sebaceous filaments but mine were more noticeable than “normal.” I also have some blackheads… after my ex made me self-conscious about it I dug deep into the hole and geeked out researching what I can actually do.                                                                                      \n\nOutside of clinical treatments, I’ve pretty much tried everything: clay masks, nose strips, BHAs, sulfur, niacinamide, azelaic acid, retinoids, you name it.             \n\nI wanted to share my progress after a couple months, my current routine, and a few tips I wish I’d known earlier. This will be a longer post, but hopefully it’s helpful. If you have questions lmk!           \n\n# Routine:            \n\n**Am**:           \n\n1.      Water rinse.         \n\n2.      Clinical Vit C + E + Ferulic Defend Serum.        \n\n3.      Skinfix: Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream.        \n\n4.      La Roche Posay Anthelios UVMUNE 400 invisble fluid SPF 50+.                \n\n**Pm**:           \n\n1.      The Ordinary: Glucoside Foaming Cleanser + a couple drops of 1% salicylic oil mixed in.             \n\n2.      Skinfix: Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream.              \n\n*(Mon, Wed, Fri)*              \n\n3.      CVS: Differin Adapalene Gel 0.1% (Entire face).              \n\n\\+ Dr Song 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Gel Treatment Lotion (Acne spot treatment)         \n\n*(Tue, Thu, Sat)*        \n\n3.      Murmure: Bisou clarifying oil 1% salicylic acid (Nose spot treatment).               \n\n**Sunday no actives!**              \n\n# Notes:       \n\n\\-         The Ordinary Cleanser - Skin-barrier friendly surfactants.       \n\n\\-          Clinical Vit C + E + Ferulic Defend Serum – Best Skinceuticals dupe.       \n\n\\-          CVS Differin + Dr Song - Epiduo equivalent but without the need of a prescription.       \n\n\\-          La Roche Posay Sunscreen - Non greasy, true protection.       \n\n\\-          Murmure Bisou - Salicylic acid in a lipid carrier.         \n\n# Blackheads vs. Sebaceous Filaments:        \n\nTurns out not every dark dot on your nose is a blackhead. Blackheads are actual clogs (oil + dead skin) and yes you can treat those.        \n\nSebaceous filaments, on the other hand are just pores doing thzir job. Totally normal. They just look worse when your skin gets irritated, oil production ramps up, oxidizes or when pores get stretched.         \n\n# Avoid: \n\nExtracting sebaceous filaments, inconsistent retinoid use, sleeping in makeup/sunscreen, flower/citrus essential oils, harsh cleansers that leave your skin “squeaky clean”, and pore strips or suction tools.

      "content": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26096578/\n\nThis study shows that among patients with other dermatological conditions, hair loss had a 10x high rate of BDD.\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4556261/\n\nBDD has a high correlation with OCD and su!c!d@lity as they frequently co-occur, with BDD present in roughly 12%–15% of OCD patients, while 25%–30% of individuals with BDD also meet criteria for OCD.\n\nhttps://bdd.iocdf.org/professionals\n\nThe international OCD foundation found that 80% of people with this issue reported su!c!d@l thoughts.\n\nObviously comorbid to OCD is depre$$ion. If you have an OCD due to hair loss induced BDD, you probably are already taking hair loss medications. The truth is, many people are in denial and are unaware of their own internal issues. So, they blame fin, dut, and even min for their problems.\n\nFinasteride Use Does Not Lead to Depre$$ion or su!c!d@l: Insights From a Large-Scale Cohort Study and Mendelian Randomization Analysis\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.70579\n\nAssociation of 5α-Reductase Inhibitors with Depre$$ion and su!c!de: A Mini Systematic Review and Meta-analysis\n\nhttp://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405456924000622\n\nThese two studies conclusively demonstrate that finasteride and dutasteride are not correlated with higher su!c!d@l risk factors so we have to ask if those with PF S are dealing with an extreme BDD? I think the signal in the literature suggests this as there’s more proof against P FS and favoring other issues like BDD/OCD.",

I was in a pretty bad place the last few years due to alcoholism and am now 8 months sober and really trying to take care of myself and treat my body with the kindness it deserves! Skincare has been a big part of that.\n\nI’ve always had a bit of acne here and there but when I was sick, my skin got quite bad and I am terrible for picking and popping things. I’ve definitely improved though.\n\nMy current routine is:\n\nAM\n\n\\- cetaphil face wash for dry sensitive skin\n\n\\- the ordinary hyaluronic acid\n\n\\- azaelic acid on red spots\n\n\\- vitamin c\n\n\\- vanicream sensitive skin\n\n\\- la Roche posh tinted SPF\n\nPM\n\n\\- cetaphil face wash for dry sensitive skin\n\n\\- hyaluronic acid the ordinary\n\n\\- tretinoin (3x a week)\n\n\\- vanicream sensitive skin\n\n\\- Squalene the ordinary\n\nI’m wondering if there’s anything I could do to make some of the scarring/red marks on my cheeks go away? I’m open to doing a treatment but I’m not really sure what’s best for that. Maybe microneedling?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated! Thank you.",

All this texture on the lower half of my skin was not there prior to halo, and at this point I don’t think it’s going to heal any more. I stopped all actives and have been using barrier supporting products for 2 months now since after a month post halo, the med spa that did my halo gave me a mixture of tret/hydroquinine/hydrocortisone 0.025% cream in hopes it would clear up the rest of the hyperpigmentation. After noticing my skin not reacting well to it, I stopped after 3 weeks, and have only been using these products as listed below.\n\nThis is my routine\n\nAM:\n\nCerave daily foaming face wash\n\nBeauty by joseon green tea panthenol serum\n\nCerave daily moisturizer\n\nSkin 1004 sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\nCerave daily foaming face wash\n\nBeauty by joseon green tea panthenol serum\n\nCerave daily moisturizer\n\nLa Roche posay cicaplast\n\nIdk what to do anymore. The med spa that did my halo suggested a few free moxi treatments to clear things up, but I no longer trust them.  Any suggestions? What can I add to help improve the texture? I’m open to peels, other actives but Idk where to start.",

After 4 months, the results were clear:  \n\n\nDensity: The combo group saw a +27.5 hairs/cm² increase (vs. +24 for Minoxidil alone).  \n\n\nDiameter: Significant hair thickening (+4.8 μm) was seen in the combo group, while the Minoxidil-only group saw no significant change.  \n\n\nSatisfaction: 95.9% of combo users were satisfied, compared to only 27.5% of those using just Minoxidil.  \nWhy it works: Minoxidil signals blood flow, while peptides like Procapil and Redensyl target follicle stem cells and \"anchor\" the hair into the scalp to stop shedding.",
