I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

      "content": "I went to derm last week for dull skin texture issues, brought my current routine which is like 8 products totaling $400 from sephora. she looked at it and said okay but how much water are you drinking daily lol\n\nI was like idk enough?? she said track it for 2 weeks and come back before we add any prescriptions. I was annoyed bc like I came for solutions not homework but started tracking with waterminder to prove I drink enough and turns out I average 30oz a day which is apparently nowhere close to adequate for skin health. She's recommending 80oz minimum before we discuss adding anything else to my routine.\n\nI've been hitting 70-80oz for past week and my skin already looks more plump, texture is smoothing out, that dull tired look is improving. Ofc Im still using my products but the internal hydration was clearly the missing piece\n\nI feel dumb for spending $400 when the solution was free tap water but at least I know now. If your skin looks dehydrated maybe check your actual water intake before buying more serums",

I have a total of 8 between both feet.\n\nMy dermatologist has treated me with cryo every visit, beetle juice in almost every visit, and she has tried Cimetidine, Bleomycin, Imiquimod, and most recently even did surgery to cut it out and cauterize the big one.\n\nDespite all of this, and seeing her almost every other month, there is little to no progress. I’m at my wit‘s end and don’t know what to do. It’s impacting my life massively and I don’t know if a different doctor is the move, a different type of specialist (Podiatrist maybe?), or if I should go more extreme and push for laser surgery.\n\nAny advice would be helpful. I don’t know what to do anymore.",

Ill post pics of what i use and my skin and if this isnt the right spot then ill find and post elsewhere. I wash my face once a day at night before I go to bed. I use a wet towel to wash the soap off my face and to dry my face because I get water all over the place when trying to wash the product off in the sink and its really frustrating. I cant use ceraVe stuff on my face since that made me itchy and didn't help my face at all. I try to avoid super expensive things because i just cant afford them. If someone can tell me what exactly could help then that would be great. ",

I also then look at it from different angles and I just think it looks nasty. I was wondering if anyone knows any hair styles that would go good or maybe even ways to style it? Even if you guys think it looks good I still don't think it suits me all that much and I'd wanna look into other styles. I don't really know what I want or how to figure out how to style and stuff, so that's why I'm asking. I know it might be a little farfetched but I don't like how flat and greasy some part of my hair look and was wondering if I could maybe cook something up that's a little curly like these photos from Pinterest. I was thinking maybe hair products like curl cream, texture powder, or maybe even a perm, but I just wanna know since I'm clueless. I'm really insecure about my hair so thanks a lot.",

(It also happens if try and blow dry a shape into it straight, just reverts back to its weird kink shape. It means  I dont want to wear it wavy, the rest I can pin back/ do half and half but Ive got a 5 head and so like to keep bits at the front but it just looks a mess. \nI have regular cuts etc and have tried finger coiling and using a denman brush to shape but doing that means im going against the curl halfway down because it changes direction and so it unravels and just looks a mess. My routine works for the rest of my hair but absolutely not the front. Any suggestions or people with similar issues? I want it to be fairly low maintenance so I dont tend to shape the rest of it, just brush through product and scrunch a bit.\n\nMy routine is ouai curl cream and gel then diffuser or leave to dry. ",

I know I need it and I know losing some length will help my curls bounce up :) \n\nAfter spending all of 2025 trying this that and the other I am realizing that everything I have tried (curl creams, mousse, foam, leave -in, gel) weighs down my hair- even watered down versions of leave-in and gel in a spray bottle which was hardly any product. Did a clarifying shampoo the other day and removed all silicones and my hair feels light and bouncy like it used to. Now I know my hair doesn’t like silicones so much and everything I’ve tried has weighed it down so I’m back to where I started a year ago. Can anyone recommend silicone free styling products that are truly lightweight? The lightest of the light weight!! I’d love more definition of my waves/curls, but I do still need to detangle at night so I’m happy to refresh on day 2.\n\nHair type: low porosity, fine, low density, 2b/2c/3a waves and curls \n\nCurrent routine:\n\nOdele clarifying shampoo\n\nAussie waves shampoo (for second shampoo)\n\nMaui hibiscus conditioner (and combing through my hair wet in the shower)\n\nDrying with t shirt wrapped around my head (plopping has always made my curls weird somehow)\n\nAir dry with roots clipped up or diffusing on no heat low speed\n\nVery gentle detangle at night and morning (I must do this to avoid very stressful matting)\n\nJojoba oil on ends and lengths\n\nProtective style with satin bonnet\n\nAny advice is appreciated thank you thank you !!

Not necessarily great, not necessarily terrible, just always slightly above or below the middle line.\n\nThe title of this asks about the frizz but I'm also looking for some critiques and general advice. \n\nIs the pictured average day one as good as I can realistically ask for? \n\nIs it normal for curly hair to look pretty good from a few feet away but bad up close in the light?\n\nAre my routine's products (which I had lying around for months already, and did not find through any sort of research) too much together for my hair?\n\n  \n**ROUTINE:**\n\n\\- At night, wash hair with Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo (every two weeks substitute with QUAI Detox Shampoo), letting shampoo soak down my strands\n\n\\- Condition everything past my scalp with Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Conditioner via praying hands\n\n\\- Use wide tooth comb to gently detangle bottom to top, then squish my hair (feeble attempt at squish to condish)\n\n\\- Out of shower, keep hair wet with continuous spray bottle\n\n\\- Apply Love Ur Curls Step 3 and a liberal amount of LA Looks\n\n\\- Use Denman brush to gently brush some product through my hair, but otherwise praying hands it again and try and get it into big clumps myself\n\n\\- Scrunch hair and plop with a cotton t-shirt for 20-30 mins\n\n\\- Take it out, let it air dry into a gel cast\n\n\\- Tie up in pineapple and wear bonnet to sleep\n\n\\- No refreshing anymore, hair is left totally dry until next wash (felt like trying to refresh it always made it look greasy, stringy, and overall worse than it would if I just left it as is)\n\nI do this routine every 72 hours.\n\nAs it stands, my day one usually looks pretty good. Day two it's a coin toss between good again or barely average. Day three is almost always mediocre, though the routine, in my opinion, never gives me hair that is so bad I don't want to wear it down in public.\n\nAny critiques would be greatly appreciated.",

I’ve never been so don’t know what’s normal.\n\nAre there estheticians that can help you with many different brands/recommend products outside of what they’re directly selling you? Something about this doesn’t sit quite right for me idk. Like surely one brand can’t work for every client. \n\nI have an appointment with an esthi and she has her own formulas that she’s made. I was kind of looking to have someone recommend things that aren’t all $100-$150 per product. That seems insane for a product I’m not even really able to read reviews on.  And a $400-600 skincare routine isn’t feasible for me. She also says if you’re her client, you have to be using her skincare and can’t use outside brands.\n\nI’d also rather have something that I don’t have to come directly to her for. Just something I can order routinely from Amazon or grab at Sephora if I run out.\n\nPeople get perfect skin with more reasonably priced things every day. I don’t have anything I feel is too hard to correct. No acne or anything.",
