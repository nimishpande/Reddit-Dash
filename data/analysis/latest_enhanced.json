Then try my best to diffuse it after I scrunched the product with a tshirt. Afterwards I let whatever is still wet dry and go from there",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I gave it all the studies, links and other important matter, so I believe all information is as factual as possible, and it's not some 'AI-slop', but actually the result of me talking and feeding the AI for hours.\n\nWe all saw the Cosmo Pharmaceuticals press release today claiming \"up to 539% relative improvement.\" While this sounds incredible, we need to look past the marketing fluff.\nI’ve done a deep dive into the numbers, comparing today’s press release with the hard data from Phase 2 (Hebert et al.), to figure out what this actually means for us.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the results, the timeline, and where this fits in a stack.\n\n1. The \"539% Improvement\" Explained (Don't let the math fool you)\n\nThe press release uses the term \"relative improvement vs. placebo.\" This is a classic statistical way to make numbers look bigger than they are. It does not mean you will grow 539% more hair.\n\nTo get a percentage this high, the placebo group must have lost ground. Here is the likely math behind the scenes:\n\n * Scenario: If the Drug group gained +13 hairs and the Placebo group lost -2.5 hairs.\n\n * The Math: The net difference is 15.5 hairs. If you divide that difference by the absolute loss of the placebo (15.5 / 2.5), you get roughly a ~600% relative difference.\n\nThe Reality: The actual hair count increase is likely modest and consistent with previous studies, not a miracle cure that gives you five times your density back.\n\n2. Anchoring with Phase 2 Data (What to actually expect)\nSince the Phase 3 topline numbers are vague, we have to look at the Phase 2 data (Hebert et al., 2020) to set realistic expectations. The Phase 3 results are likely very similar to the 5% BID (twice daily) results from Phase 2.\n\n * Phase 2 Result (5% BID): +14.3 hairs/cm² (Target Area Hair Count).\n\n * Comparison: This is roughly equivalent to Finasteride 1mg (+10-15 hairs) but lower than Minoxidil 5% (+15-20 hairs).\n\nCrucial Phase 2 Note: In Phase 2, the higher dose (7.5%) actually saw efficacy drop after month 6. The 5% dose remained stable.\n\n * Takeaway: This suggests receptor saturation is real. \"More is not better\" with this drug. The 5% concentration seems to be the sweet spot for long-term maintenance.\n\n3. The New Timeline (Good News)\nPreviously, we assumed we had to wait for the \"Long Term Safety\" data in Spring 2026 before they would even start the paperwork.\n\nHowever, the press release explicitly states: \"US and EU submissions are underway.\"\nThis accelerates the timeline significantly:\n * Old Prediction: 2028.\n * New Realistic Prediction: Late 2026 / Early 2027.\n\nBy starting the submission process now (likely a rolling submission), the FDA review clock is already ticking.\n\n4. The \"Triple Stack\" Synergy\nThe real value of Breezula isn't using it solo—it's the synergy. It is the missing link for a \"perfect\" protocol without nuking your hormones systemically.\n\n * Finasteride/Dutasteride: Lowers the army of enemies (Reduces Serum DHT).\n\n * Breezula: Locks the gate (Competes for the androgen receptor locally).\n\n * (Oral) Minoxidil: Steps on the gas (Growth agonist).\n\nThe Theory:\nCurrently, if you use (Oral) Minoxidil + Finasteride, you have growth + reduced suppression. The remaining 30% of DHT (and local scalp DHT) still fights against your Minoxidil gains.\n\nAdding Breezula in 2027 closes that last gap. It allows Minoxidil to work on follicles that were previously \"stalled\" by residual local DHT. This is, of course, just theory at this point.\n\nTL;DR\n * The 539% is statistical marketing. Expect roughly +14 hairs/cm² (similar to Finasteride efficacy).\n\n * It works. The Phase 3 data validates Phase 2: it is a functional topical anti-androgen.\n\n * Timeline accelerated. Submissions have started. Expect it on shelves (or via import) around Late 2026.\n\n * Best use case: It’s a shield, not a sword. Use it to protect your follicles from local DHT so your Minoxidil can work at 100% capacity.\n ",

It’s lightweight, absorbs quickly, and never feels greasy, which makes it great for daily use or under makeup. It’s gentle and affordable, so it’s one of those products you don’t feel bad slathering on. The downside is that it’s not super rich, so in colder weather it might not be enough on its own, and it definitely doesn’t help with oil control if you’re on the oilier side. But here’s what surprised me the most: whenever my skin suddenly gets red or irritated, I put two or three pumps on at night as a thick layer and seal it with Vaseline. Every time I do this, I wake up with the redness noticeably reduced. So overall, it’s a reliable, no-drama moisturizer that works well for everyday hydration, even if you might need something heavier for extreme dryness.",

For some context I’m 23 and I’ve been on FIN for 8 months and dut .5 mg everyday for 6 months. I’ve also been taking oral minoxidil for 11 months (2.5mg for 8 months then upped to 5mg for 3 months. While taking oral Min I have been noticing an increase in body hair and I’ve grown hair on parts of my body that literally never had hair before. I have pretty severe diffuse thinning and my scalp has pretty much stayed the same. I know I’m not unresponsive to minoxidil due to body hair growth so does this mean I am just sensitive to dht or my follicles are just permanently dead? I’ve only really experienced a shed when i introduced dut which then later stabilized. I recently buzzed my hair (last photos) but i included photos from before I buzzed it and from last year which was basically baseline for me. I am going to stay on treatment and see if dut can maybe gave some more regrowth but I’m starting to think a transplant is the only option for me. Has anyone had any growth past one year of oral minoxidil? ",

I’m also looking for moisturizer suggestions that would suit acne-prone, normal-to-dry skin. Do you guys think this routine makes sense, or is there something better he should use?

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

Man that carried out the treatment had good reviews. Unfortunately, it would appear he has scarred me and caused more broken capillaries.\n\nAdvised me that I could continue to use Finacea (15% azelaic acid) before and after treatment (basically do my usual skincare routine.) The scabs would drop off after about 7-10 days, pink skin for two weeks and then ta-dah! It would be perfect. He reassured me throughout no scarring. It has been a month and he is now backtracking and saying it will take a few months to heal or could be permanent.\n\nHe also caused damage on and around a mole (which I didn’t want treating anyways!) Pigmentation, broken capillaries and bumpy texture around the mole and lots of PIE and PIH on cheeks.\n\nI am continuing to use my azelaic acid to help fade pigmentation and reached out to a dermatologist too to get an appointment.\n\nI’ve enquired about IPL and Pico laser - neither can help me. The new capillaries and hyperpigmentation are too close together and fixing one will worsen the other. Both laser clinics were horrified when I said he told me I could use azelaic acid before and after treatment with no break.\n\nAnyone else had this happen to them? Did it ever return to normal? Are you scarred? Any advice in general would be much appreciated, even if you haven’t directly experienced this.",
