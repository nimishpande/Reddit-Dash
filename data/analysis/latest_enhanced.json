I only realised the connection after the course ended, when I finally began to feel like myself again. At the time, I was assured by the dermat that the acne would not return.\n\nHowever, it has come back, and this time, it feels worse. It seems hormonal, especially since I also have PCOS. I recently sprained my ankle as well, so my regular exercise routine has been disrupted, which may have contributed to the flare-up.\n\nRight now, I’m using the Effaclar serum from La Roche-Posay at night, along with a few topical creams prescribed by my dermatologist. She is now suggesting a chemical peel as the next step.\n\nTo be honest, I’m feeling quite exhausted and overwhelmed by the process. I double cleanse at night, religiously follow AM-PM skin care regimes - will this never go away?\n\nWhat has worked best for you if you have faced similar issues?\n\nTL;DR: Acne has returned after isotretinoin (which caused severe depression), likely hormonal due to PCOS. Current topicals aren’t helping much, dermatologist suggests a chemical peel. Feeling exhausted and unsure how to proceed.\n\nPS. Clicked this picture on one of the better days unfortunately ",

The replies to that post were very helpful and I wanted some help on choosing some alternate products or sticking to this routine.\n\n- Moisturizer: should I stick with the ponds or switch to minimalist b12 since I'm using niacinamide and need to protect my skin barrier?\n\n- Sunscreen: this is where I am facing the biggest confusion (so are others when I searched this sub lol), I initially decided to go with the regular minimalist spf 50 but then I found out it has retinol in it (seperate thread on that later, because that makes no sense) which is a big no no with the other actives I'm using so decided to switch to the light fluid one instead. I've also heard korean ones are good as well as reequil ultra dry matte but there's so many choices and not enough budget to go around so please help me choose one :\")\n\nI hope y'all can provide a overall verdict on my routine, I'm scared and excited to be starting this journey for the first time after decades of tanning and negligence of my skin \n\nSee you on the other side 🤎",

I think this is the best my hair has ever looked, really wish I had more pictures with it. Switched bc my hair started feeling really greasy and product heavy to the point I was washing nearly every day.\n\nPic 2: Cantu leave-in conditioning repair cream, Cantu coconut curling cream, and Aunt Jackie's flaxseed elongating curling gel.\n\nThought these products would stretch my curls more but somehow the opposite happened. Heavy, greasy feeling was even worse than previous routine. Look wasn't bad, tighter curls are just not what I'm going for personally so certainly not worth washing every day for.\n\nPic 3 (Current routine): Carol's Daughter devine strength leave-in cream, Not Your Mother's Curl Talk defining cream, and LA Looks extreme sport gel.\n\nGreasy feeling is gone and I'm back to only washing my hair once or twice a week. My hair is stringy and frizzy however. Any hold I get is lost within a few hours and my hair is left a frizzy mess because my gel won't leave a cast at all with these products under it.\n\nSo either my hair feels bad and I have to wash constantly but it looks the best it's ever looked, or my hair looks bad but feels okay. Do I just suck it up and accept the greasy hair? Any other product recommendations or styling tips?",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I’m also interested in whether this seems right for my skin (more details below and I’ve included a picture of my skin today).\n\nThe practitioner said my chin is quite clogged up, that I have mild rosacea (as I suspected) and that I do likely having perioral dermatitis around my nose (previously confirmed by an online doctor).\n\nAs you can see in the pictures in the morning, I have been advised to use the iS Clinical Cleansing Complex followed by iS Clinical Active Serum (every other day at the moment whilst I get used to it) on problem areas (chin, nose and part of forehead), La Roche-Posay Effaclar H ISO-Biome and lastly Anessa SPF50+ (I’ve been using this SPF daily since going to Japan in January 2025).\n\nIn the evenings, I’m using the iS Clinical Cleansing Complex, Azelaic Acid (finishing off the 15% before I move onto the 20% which I got this week - seeing every other night at the moment as I stopped consistently using the 15% around a month or two ago) and then La Roche-Posay Effaclar H ISO-Biome.\n\nThe practitioner I saw advised against using the Avene Cicalfate or the LRP Cicaplast as I’ve been using one of those every night - instead she recommended that I use it once a week if my skin is looking a bit dry or on areas such as around my nose as it can get quite dry as I seem to have perioral dermatitis around it which I’ve had for years.\n\nI’m in my mid 30s. Started Botox recently just in forehead and 11s. Do not want to use any type of retinol/vitamin A due to future fertility plans. Drink plenty of water, eat oily fish/take Omega 3, eat lots of vegetables…",

Before I started using it, I used to leave my face quite wet before moisturising because that makes it feel, and look best. Obviously I have to apply Vit C on dry skin, so I did for a few days and my skin felt overly dry, tried Vaseline but that clogs my pores and gives me acne. So I have recently tried applying it on dry face, giving my face 30 minutes and then moistening my face or ice water dunking (in the morning), after which I moisturise as I used to before. My question was, does this negate any of the effects of this serum? Is there a better way you would recommend? I use the La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ and a ceramide moisturiser, both. ",

I leave the conditioner on for a few minutes. I also detangle with my fingers in the shower.\n\nI just started using the Odele clarifying shampoo which I will use once a week. \n\nRinse out shampoo and conditioner \n\nThen I towel try my hair and with a paddle brush, brush my hair \n\nI use the Miss Jessie’s “Leave In Condish” product. This product is actually a 2 in 1 because not only does it soften your hair it does shape your curls.\n\nAfter that I put on curling gel, I specifically use Marc Anthony Strictly Curls gel. \n\nThen I diffuse. First I use the highest heat possible then when my hair is half dry I go to medium heat. This is to prevent my hair from getting too dry from being exposed from the highest heat for too long.\n\nThen to break up the case made from the gel I use Ciliganic Moringa oil. On the bottle it says\nIt’s for face and body, but it can absolutely be used for hair. \n\n\n\n",
