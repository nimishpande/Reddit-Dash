      "content": "Hello! I could only find one before and after on this topic, so l wanted to contribute and maybe help someone else out. \n\nI wanted to share what finally fixed my life long severe cracked lips. Nothing worked no matter what I did. I was pretty self conscious of them and felt bad kissing my girlfriend. My conclusion was that this *can’t* be normal. While desperately googling, I stumbled across a thread talking about a Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) toothpaste allergy.\n\nTwo main symptoms are dried lips with sheets of skin that slough off (exfoliating chelitis), and intense burning of the tongue when brushing. I always thought I was peppermint and that it was supposed to burn, especially when brushing your tongue. Turns out it's not supposed to be a 6/10 pain every time you brush! It was my \"bananas aren't supposed to be spicy\" moment.\n\nI switched an SLS free Sensodyne toothpaste starting the 9th, and the results have been immediate!! No more burning, and my lips have improved dramatically by Day 4, today!\n\nSince changing toothpaste, l've been religiously slathering my lip routine on multiple times a day. My lips no longer had open wounds and new sheets of skin weren't being produced, just older ones falling off. After reaching that point, I exfoliated this morning with some sugar and jojoba oil, which worked really well to get the last layers of skin.\n\nLip Triage Routine:\n\nMoisturizing\n\n\\- Get lips damp with water\n\n\\- Moisturizing serum\n\n\\- I use snail mucin but I read that an HA serum\n\nworks as well\n\n\\- Lighter moisturizer\n\n\\- I use Illyoon Ceramide Ato Cream, but I want to test out Laroche Posay Toleriance Fluide for this as well\n\n\\- Slug with Aquaphor (*specifically* Aquaphor)\n\nExfoliation\n\n\\_ *Only* when all wounds and irritation have healed)\n\n\\- Sugar and oil rubbed in with finger or very soft\n\ntoothbrush\n\nI want to pick up some Lanolips now to try it out, it sort of worked in the past so l'm optimistic that it could be a holy grail now that my lips aren't in active meltdown. Over the years I've always thought that lip products were just bunk snake oil, I didn't know any different!!\n\nI hope this helps someone out there!! Also—Any lip product recommendations?",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI (35F) have kind of a weird situation. I have a chronic disease (Addison’s) that, among many other things, means my body doesn’t make a hormone called DHEA. Don’t ask me to explain all the biochemistry, but basically it’s the precursor to making the small amount of testosterone that bio females have. So I haven’t had testosterone in me for a good 15 years at least.\n\nI started taking DHEA a few months ago. There are a ton of benefits to this med that make it absolutely worth taking, but…\n\nY’ALL IT FEELS LIKE I’M HITTING PUBERTY AGAIN.\n\nI sweat a lot. I smell bad. I have acne. That’s the part I need help with. I have no idea how to handle this.\n\nMy skincare routine for most of my life, if it could even be called a “routine” has been:\n\n\\- face wash (CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser) every couple of days\n\n\\- sometimes a refresher of micellar water to get the sleep off my face in the morning or take off makeup when I rarely wear it\n\n\\- popping zits and blackheads way more than I probably should but words cannot express how much not getting the nasty out grosses me out.\n\n\\- SPF moisturizer in the summer (CeraVe)\n\nSide notes:\n\n\\- I have dishydrotic eczema, so no scented products. CeraVe has always been a safe choice for me, but I’m open to trying other brands.\n\n\\- my skin tends to be dry\n\nWhat I’m hoping for is some advice on products and routine, for as simple and inexpensive of a routine as I can get away with. I really don’t have the time or inclination or money to get elaborate unless it’s some sort of miracle substance.\n\nI’m trying to get into the habit of at least washing my face properly every day. Habits are hard for me but I’m making progress!\n\nI would be grateful for any help.\n\nTL:DR: I have acne bc I have testosterone now. Previously I could get away with very sparse skincare, but now I have the acne of a 15-year old and I can’t figure out how to get rid of it.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I want to clean them all out and recycle them but I wanted to know if there were any rewards based recycling programs I could give them to. I plan to start collecting my empty products every month to recycle those too!\n\nI know I should recycle them even without the incentive but I’m not going to lie, it would still be nice. I plan to recycle them anyway even if I don’t find anything.\n\nThis is what I have found so far (just so people don’t suggest things I already found)\n\n• Pact - has a lot of locations, accepts a wide range of stuff, and seems reputable, but no rewards. (I think I will recycle here if I can’t find anything else)\n\n• Terracycle - Originally wanted to recycle with them because they said you can earn points towards charity which I really liked (I would rather donate to charity than get the points myself) BUT I heard it’s really scammy and does a lot of greenwashing\n\n• Credo - gives you store points for any empties but I don’t shop at Credo so that would be useless lol\n\n• Lush - only accepts lush products for points/a free mask I think? But I don’t shop at Lush either lol\n\n• Literally any store that only accepts their own products for points or rewards. - I don’t buy enough of one single brand to justify it\n\n• Boots - This seems like the kind of program I am looking for. They accept a wide range of empties for points BUT they’re UK based. I also found similar companies in Australia but nothing like this in the US.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Like I said, I’m still recycling them regardless, I just want to see if there’s any nice programs out there first.",

It seems my hair will curl but then it seems extra fluffy at the bottom and I would rather have more volume towards the front of my face and I top and how do I get the back of my head to curl more like the front?? Also - how in thr world do people get their hair to last longer than a day without loads of hairspray??? I resisted the urge and did NOT use hairspray today but the last two photo are now hair after only 8 hours and I was forced to pull up the front cause it was losing volume at the frontz\n\n\nMy routine: I use a suave shampoo and conditioner. This was a morning wash and I used the suave clarifying shampoo and basic suave conditioner. Then I put it up with a cotton tshirt for a few minutes. Then I put in tresemme extra strength (number 6) gel. I did it section by section and then brushed it with a wide tooth comb. I diffused it upside down, on the roots, moved the diffuser. I diffused it till about 80-90 dry and let the rest air dry and then I did SOTC with a bit of oil in my hands. The front looks decent, though usually by mid day I feel the back will be extra frizzy or fluffy and lose some curl- it def doesn’t stay for days like some people.\n\nSo my question is - how do I get more volume and/or face shaping to my hair and the back so it actually looks curly all around? Do I need layers? What kind of cut? Change my routine any??  How do I make my back not too boxy?",

      "title": "[Acne] Long post ahead – Benzoyl Peroxide 10% (short contact therapy) + hormonal acne / Mirena IUD",
      "content": "This is going to be long, but I’ll try to include as many details as possible because I know how helpful that can be when you’re desperate for answers.\n\nI’ve struggled with hormonal acne for years, ever since I started using the Mirena IUD at 22 (I’m 29 now). I know worsening acne is a known side effect, and for a long time I accepted it and tried to manage it with different skincare products. Over the years, my skin went through phases: sometimes extremely inflamed, sometimes completely clear. I had never seen a dermatologist specifically for acne.\n\nIn mid-2025, my skin got REALLY bad—the worst it’s ever been. I started researching treatments, read a lot about benzoyl peroxide, and decided to try it. My plan was: if this didn’t work, I would finally see a doctor and possibly change my IUD.\n\n**Product**\n\nI bought BENZAKNEN 10% Gel and started using it in September. I know most people recommend starting with 2% or 5%, but honestly, I was desperate and wanted to start with the strongest option.\n\nAt first, I applied it overnight: first the benzoyl peroxide gel, waited ten minutes for it to dry, and then applied a moisturizer (I use a very simple one, Vanicream). I did this for two days and absolutely hated it. My skin became EXTREMELY dry, and my pillowcase was completely ruined and stained. So I looked for alternative ways to apply the product and learned about short-contact therapy, which is what I’ve been doing ever since.\n\nWhen I get home from work, I cleanse my face and apply the benzoyl peroxide to the U-zone (cheeks, jawline, and chin—where hormonal acne usually appears). I leave it on for at least 30 minutes, but sometimes longer—one, two, or even three hours. Then I wash it off and apply moisturizer. I do this every single day.\n\n**The purge / timeline**\n\nI won’t lie: it was rough. For about two months, my acne got significantly worse. It was very inflamed and painful, and I seriously considered giving up many times. Trusting the process is extremely hard when your face looks worse every day. I knew it could get worse before getting better—but honestly, it got *really* bad.\n\nStill, I kept going. Around mid-November, I finally started seeing improvement. Since then, my skin has been getting better every day. For me, it took about 2.5 months to see real progress.\n\n**Doctor visit / spironolactone**\n\nIn early December, I went to my gynecologist. She noticed the hyperpigmentation on my face and asked about my acne. I explained my benzoyl peroxide routine, and she said it was a great treatment.\n\nShe also prescribed 100 mg of spironolactone per day for hormonal acne. I’ve been on it for about a month now, and since it takes longer to work, I won’t go into detail yet—maybe in another post or an update. Just leaving it here so you know that this exists (I didn't know) and it's also and option.\n\n**Results so far**\n\nGoing back to benzoyl peroxide: my experience with it has been absolutely positive. It takes time, and the journey is tough, but it’s worth it. My self-esteem was at its lowest point. I felt ashamed of how my face looked, and now I can finally look in the mirror again and feel good. I know no one *needs* to feel that way and that we’re all beautiful with or without acne—but unfortunately, it’s not that simple, especially with adult hormonal acne.\n\nI still use benzoyl peroxide every day, now combined with spironolactone. My skin is not completely clear yet. I still get acne sometimes, especially before my period, and I have some stubborn spots that always appear in the same place or very deep pimples that take a long time to heal. But I feel like I’m almost there, and I wanted to share my experience with benzoyl peroxide after four full months of use.\n\nAs for my skincare routine, I keep it very simple now. I only use sunscreen, benzoyl peroxide, moisturizer, and a cleansing gel. That’s it—no acids, no retinol, nothing else. I also don’t wear makeup.\n\n**Photos**\n\nI was taking weekly progress photos but stopped at some point, so I don’t have pictures from November and December. Still, I think what I have shows the progress clearly.\n\nFirst photo: September 8th 2025 (first day of BP)  \nLast photo: today, January 13th 2026\n\nI still have a lot of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (not treating it specifically right now), but almost no inflamed acne.\n\nI also attached a photo of the exact benzoyl peroxide product I use. I live in Germany and bought it on Amazon.\n\nThat’s it, I’m sorry for the massive post—I really wanted to include all the details I wish I had found when I was researching this months ago. Happy to answer any questions, I’m originally from Brazil, so feel free to ask in Portuguese if that’s easier.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x5xlpi2qv6dg1.jpg?width=2160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20039a29a66a8fa5cad7e405dcf4660517db3fe7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5b12x3frv6dg1.jpg?width=2160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5633a8bb4092c620a6bf785f17ae310b9688517f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0fwelebsv6dg1.jpg?width=1364&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a736213f90541808be6ead7d3efc4d3feb84434\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j37nx1usv6dg1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4599d601a782eea5152f7ad9b0ac018121abcaf9\n\n  \n",

I started to stick to this routine: \n\nIn the morning: \n- wash with water\n- Salmon Caring Centella Cream Heve Blue (PDRN)\n- (makeup): Purito Cica Clearing BB Cream \n\nNight / after I come home:\n- Dermacol Sensitive Micellar Water Lotion (wash off makeup)\n- Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence\n- Salmon Caring Centella Cream Heve Blue (PDRN)\n\nI just started sticking to this routine so nothing special happened. I still struggle with dry skin sometimes in the morning. But my biggest problem are the closed comedones or clogged pores on my cheeks.\n\nPlease help me to make a routine / get advice on this one. I am open to suggestions but I can't have a routine with loads of steps because my skin is very picky and gets irritated quickly. I also have these products at home so they could help with my routine:\n\n- SPF Relief Sun Rice + Probiotics Beauty of Joseon (I know I should use, but I don't know where in the routine and also I am scared of too many steps)\n- Numbuzin Toner 3 (I like this one)\n- Nivea regular cream (sometimes I use it locally because of dry skin)\n- La Roche Posay Effaclar Duo + M (sometimes used in summer)\n- Venira serum against imperfections (10% niacinamide + 1% zinc)\n- Vichy Normaderm Double Correction  Moisturizing Care (quite like this one)\n- Red Bean Refreshing Pore Mask of Beauty of Joseon (I use this like once every two weeks)\n- black coal facial soap (also used in summer but now it's sooo drying)\n- Skintra Brightoner (mandelic acid, tranexamic acid, kojic acid, vitamin C) (never used)\n\nIf you have any suggestions on what could be causing the closed comedones or help with my routine I would be very thankful :)",

      "content": "I (28M) have been dealing with rosacea for quite some time, and my dermatologist has been very helpful. Soolantra Ivermectin cream has made a huge difference, making my rosacea barely noticeable. I also have, for most of my life, never had many pimples at all. Lately, however, pimples have been appearing around my mouth and pretty much ONLY around my mouth, specifically in the corners on my lower lip. They don't even last that long, but are tenacious: whenever one disappears after a few days, another one pops right back up. Not only are they very noticeable and does it look like I constantly have cold sores (they are not cold sores), it's also painful. My dermatologist says it's another rosacea flare-up. He recently has put me on 40mg of doxycycline a day, and suggested 10% OTC azaelic acid (currently using the Ordinary).\n\nEvery night I wash my face with a cleanser, use my AA, and follow with a niacinamide face cream. In the morning I cleanse again, followed by the Soolantra and a moisturizer with SPF 30. I drink a lot of water, change my pillow case every night, use SLS-free toothpaste (Sensodyne) and wash my face AFTER brushing. This does work for my skin, because my skin does look healthy, even dewy and plump according to some, and the AA is already making it smoother, but the corners of my mouth remain **persistently pimpled**. It's frustrating. Anybody has any idea what I could do or what I might be doing wrong? Would be greatly appreciated!",

      "content": "Hi, I [20F, 21 very soon] have been struggling with acne since late 2024. During that time, I was incredibly stressed about multiple things and I am assuming that this must have negatively impacted either my body or my skin, as the skin on my face was completely clear prior to this and I would only get a pimple or two that would never scar. I also only used soap and moisturizer for skincare until late 2025, as well as occasional face masks. My dark spots were at their darkest during February 2025, and I do think that they look considerably lighter now, at least compared to how they looked back then. Regardless, I still get more pimples than I used to and they mostly appear along my cheeks, when the ones I used to get were mostly on my forehead. I do also struggle with back acne, but I have more scars than pimples on my back, as I used to pick at the ones on my back when I first started getting them in middle school.\n\nAt night, I use retinol for my dark spots, and I wash my face with soap prior to this. Then, I wash my face in the morning and apply sunscreen throughout the day. I also use moisturizer if I notice that my skin is dry. I also have pimple patches that have helped me with pimples! For water consumption, I know that I definitely don’t drink the exact amount that I need but I do try, and I’ve been wondering if that could have potentially contributed to this, especially because I was definitely crying a lot during the time before this started happening, and I question if the stress indirectly led to horrible dehydration.\n\nA few of the blemishes appeared after I extracted blackheads last summer, but that was entirely my fault and I only did it because a friend told me to, and I do wish that I never listened. Also, the images I’ve included were taken right after a shower. I find that my acne looks worse right after I shower.\n\nI will say, my face feels smooth to the touch, even in the areas where my face looks like it has little indents, but some of my dark spots alongside my cheekbones do feel a bit raised on my face. I’m mostly just wondering if anyone can identify the type of acne I might have, and if I should change my routine at all. And if anyone was in a similar situation as me, I’d like advice on what you did! I do intend to see a dermatologist, when I get the chance, but advice in the meantime would be helpful.",

      "content": "Hi. I’ve been using adapalene gel for 10 weeks now, and I’ve started to slowly see the results. Mainly fading of the acne marks, less clogged pores and over all improvement in skin quality, hydration etc. I am generally happy about the progress. I don’t get any side effect, but I do get some new clothes pores from time to time around my chin and jaw. Still nothing horrible. Over all it seems to be improving. \n\nMy routine:\n\nAM: \n\n1. Double cleanse \n\n\\- I start my wash with Aleppo Laurel Oil soap\n\n\\- then I follow by Gentle SA cleanser from Cetaphil\n\n2. Actives \n\n\\- I apply 20% Azaleic acid to my face and neck\n\n3. Moisturizer\n\n\\- I apply a moisturizer (pharmacy brand) with vitamins A, E, F, aloe vera extract, allantoin, and panthenol\n\n4. Sun protection \n\n\\- if it’s over 2 UV index I use spf from avene. So far it’s winter so the UV index is 0/1 so I don’t put sunscreen as it used to clogged my pores in the summer\n\nMy skin is quite oily so often I wash my face with the SA cleanser/ probiotic cleanser from Routines by Alkmie mid day and apply Azaleic acid again. \n\nPM:\n\n1. Double cleanse\n\n\\- same as AM\n\n2. Actives \n\n\\- I apply a thin layer of Differin 0.1 gel \n\n\\- then a thin layer of Azaleic acid 20 %\n\n3. Moisturizer\n\n\\- moisturizer, same as AM\n\nSO MY QUESTION IS. Should I change something? For example I heard many people use either BP or Nacinamide. I am wondering if I can improve my results with a change in some product, or should I stick with the product I’m using as it seems to be slowly getting better. ",
