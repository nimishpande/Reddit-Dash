      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

But it really is a struggle.\n\nWould love to get some advice on:  \n1. Maybe even getting more beautiful curls  \n2. How to deal with the knots. Do I need another comb? brush? something?

I would love some advice on how to make it more consistently lean into the more wrapped/defined curls.\n\nI believe I have medium porosity hair, as water does bead up some when first getting it wet. Takes a good couple minutes to get it fully soaked. Here are the products / routine I am using currently.\n\nI am washing my hair every 3-4 days depending on what’s going on/ how it’s looking.\n\nStep 1- Get in the shower, soak my hair and use a light detangling spray. Currently using the Marc Anthony Grow Long spray. Brush out my hair completely with a denman type wet brush.\n\nStep 2- Shampoo and condition hair. I was using the Kristin Ess curly S &amp; C, but recently just switched to Rizos Curl Biotin S&amp;C\n\nStep 3- Still in the shower, apply Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Cury Envy Cream. Brush through my hair, and then while under the water scrunch my hair with a bit more cream in my hands.\n\nStep 4- Get out of the shower, get dressed, and scrunch some of the excess water out of my hair with a micro fiber towel.\n\nStep 5- Prayer hands apply Cantù Wave Whip Curling Mousse. Scrunch in if needed but usually try to avoid that.\n\nI do not do any diffusing / drying of my hair, which I know I’ll get some flack about. But I’m a working mom of 2 and never have the time to do it given how thick my hair is.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions on what I could do differently without adding a ton of extra time to my routine that would be amazing. Open to product recommendations or answering questions to help determine what I should do.",

The first one is my acne now and the rest are photos from throughout the last 2 months. I only get acne on my forehead and it usually shows up like this always. My routine  consists of Panoxyl 10% every  night on my face and then when I wake up I shower to get the oil of my face. This has been my routine for 5 months. I recently had a derm appointment and was prescribed tretinoin 0.05% for my forehead acne. I have a few questions\n1. Does tretinoin actually work?\n2. Will my skin purge?\n3. Should I go light at first?\n4. Should I drop my Panoxyl 10% completely?\n5. What is a good moisturizer to pair with tret?\n6. Can someone recommend a routine?\n\nIf yall have any recommendations or anything at all that would help I would really appreciate it 🫶 feel free to ask questions!!",

      "content": "Backstory:\n\nI'm a 22yo F. I had never dealt with much acne, but have always had a pretty solid skincare routine. Late July '25 I suddenly started to get a TON of closed comedones (primarily on my chin and  left cheek). I saw a derm within the same week they started because it was so unusual and didn't seem correlated to anything (but then, I never got my period that month and have STILL not had a period). I was told that I had perioral derm and was rx metronidazole. I used it for 6 wks before desperately going back to the derm because it was not helping and I was getting significantly more closed comedones. When I went back, they decided it was not PD and rx me tret and doxy in early September. I ended up having to stop taking the doxy d/t experiencing eye swelling.\n\nMid-October, my chin started to purge and by late October my cheek began to purge like crazy too. My chin has wayyyy less cc's than it did when all of this started (still has some purging left to do), but leaving behind lots of PIE/PIH :/\n\nI've now been on 0.05% tret for just under 13 wks. I was rx clindamycin Nov 5th and Spiro 100mg Nov 11th since it's likely hormonal with my period having stopped. Rlly wish I had been put on spiro way back when this was starting and maybe it wouldn't be so bad now! Did not think I would still be dealing with this at this point. I guess closed comedones can take a long time to surface though?? I know many go through this, but it is so discouraging waking up each day with new inflamed areas, hating what I see in the mirror, doing skincare when my face hurts, and facing my peers when I just want to hide  until this it's over. Obviously I can't do that but good grief when will this end?!?! It's truly affecting every aspect of my life... my friendships, my relationship with my partner, my professional life, my academics... I'm a graduate student and I've been skipping class for the first time EVER. Anyways, could use some encouragement to keep going because shit's rough out here. Thoughts? Advice? Is this just the process and I need to just push through?\n\nAs far as my period goes, all of my blood work has come back normal (like how??), my gyno had me take progesterone for 10 days to induce a bleed which was unsuccessful, and now I'm taking birth control for 2 wks to try inducing a bleed again.\n\nMy routine:\n\nAM-\n\n1. TO glucoside foaming cleanser\n2. hypochlorous acid spray\n3. clindamycin 1% gel\n4. TO aloe+NAG serum\n5. TO beta glucan moisturizer (I was using la roche posay double repair but got nervous about the niacinamide since I keep reading on here that it can cause cc's for some?)\n6. currently not using SPF bc I haven't found one that my skin tolerates (i can only use mineral). would love recs\n\nPM-\n\n1. TO glucoside foaming cleanser\n2. hypochlorous acid spray\n3. clindamycin 1% gel\n4. TO aloe+NAG serum\n5. TO beta glucan moisturizer\n6. 0.05% Tret every other night\n7. usually moisturize again with the same beta glucan moisturizer depending on how my skin feels \n\n\\*\\*I also recently bought TO barrier serum but haven't been using it just bc I'm scared to add something new to my routine.

      "content": "My skin was totally clear until sixth grade. And ever since then I have had extremely deep and painful cystic acne all over my face. I went to a dermatologist whilst my face was full of deep red acne and the dermat said that in my age (14) it is normal and hormonal. She prescribed me ahaglow facewash and zitmoist as mousturizer. That was all. \n\nMy experience with both was very bad. Bad in the sense that neither of it did absolutely nothing for my acne. The facewash felt too drying for me and the zitmoist gel felt like nothing. It was not at all hydrating or moisturizing. \n\nI switched to a more hydrating moisturizer (Johnson's milk+rice cream) and a different gentler cleanser (Neutrogena extra gentle cleanser). I would say in terms of hydration these were better but my acne was still super bad. \n\nThen I began researching into skincare and nutrition. I cut down on dairy especially milk and sugar. And I decided that I had to use an active to target my acne. I ended up buying the Cosrx BHA serum. I used it for nearly 1.5 years and it did help with my acne to some extent. But it works extremely slow. Took me about 6 months to notice a reduction in my acne. I started using plum gel moisturizer also and Joy 5.5 hydrating gel face wash. \n\nAfter that I used tranexamic acid and alpha arbutin serum from minimalist for all the scars that had formed on my face. I absolutely love alpha arbutin for scars and hyperpigmentation. And for the active acne I started using The Ordinary glycolic acid. I had high hopes for it but it did not do anything for my acne. 😭 It had absolutely zero effect anywhere either on my face or body😢\n\nAnyways this is my current routine now which for me has been working absolutely fabulously. I only get a few acne during my periods, they are like surface level white heads and they just dry out in a day and pop on their own and don't leave scars. So I'm not really bothered by them. I'm very happy with how my skin looks and I'm going to stick to this routine.\n\nMy skin is by no means perfect. I have quite a few icepick scars from the acne plus there is hyperpigmentation as well. But imo those are part of my natural skin and this is just how I look and I'm totally okay with it. Acne is tough to live with, I know. You just have to be patient and find the products that works for you. It took me more than a decade to get here and who knows it might come back later too. But believe you me acne is not going to stop my life, nor has it ever😇\n\nCURRENT ROUTINE\n\nAM \n\n1. Simple barrier care replenishing cream cleanser\n2. Aziderm 10% gel \n3. Cosrx snail mucin. \n4. Cerave moisturizing cream \n5. UV Doux silicone sunscreen gel spf 50\n6. Foxtale lip balm\n\nPM \n\n1. Simple barrier care replenishing cream cleanser\n2. Benzac AC 5%\n3. Cosrx snail mucin\n4. Cerave moisturizing cream \n5. Boroline on lips\n\n",

      "content": "I am someone who grew up, thinking I head straight hair, though always had curls around my neck line. As I got older, I noticed when it was wet. It had some wave/curl to it, but this was during the era that straightening was very popular, so even if I didn’t blow dry I consistently used a flat iron. I got to a point where if I would let it air dry it definitely was not straight hair, but the last several years I have bleached it many times and then dyed it back to dark several times. My hair is very fine and I recently lost a lot presumably due to being postpartum and also on Ozempic with huge weight loss. I am wondering what the best way is to restore the natural texture? Would it be best to never brush it straight while wet and consistently do things that would encourage my curls? \n\nI am new to this sub and know more about managing curlier hair as my daughter’s have much tighter curls than I do. Unsure if I need to share my routine, but I generally wash it about 3 to 4 days a week, due to it being fine and getting oily around the roots easily, but the rest of it is very dry. Lately I have been using method, volumizing shampoo and method smoothing conditioner. It seems that a lot of more expensive shampoos and/or conditioners leave a weird film on my hair and the current combo at least makes it feel clean. I don’t condition up to my roots. I generally don’t use any products, but recently have tried Marc Anthony nourishing, curl cream, miss Jesse’s jelly soft curls, and not your mother’s curl talk frizz control sculpting gel. I have let it just air dry after the products and scrunched it and wrapped it in a soft wrap or a T-shirt for about 30 minutes. Adding these products has made a difference, especially if I make sure it’s fully tangled while still soaking wet, but I can’t seem to notice any significant difference in what product I use or whether I wrap it for a bit while wet or not. Any product recommendations are welcome and also wondering if just being consistent about letting it be natural and not doing any further bleach/die or consistent heat would help? Sorry for the long post.\n\nTL:DR: seeking advice on restoring my curl pattern after years of damaging and straightening. Fine hair, doesn’t do well with super heavy products.",
