      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I put on a timer to force myself to work as fast as possible I have super high density hair and the installation took an hour and 15 minutes in total. Then I proceeded to diffuse for 20 minutes, once I was done I just put my bonnet up and went to sleep, in the morning I diffused again for 20 minutes and took them out the next day. \n\nLittle tips : \n1. make sure your hair is 1000000% dry before unraveling\n\n2. Do NOT make that many flat twists if you have finer hair, you should try 4 in the back and 4 in the front if your hair is super fine and low density\n\n3. This style gave me a lot of volume, not poofy volume but defined volume, but if you're looking a flatter look, you should try doing 6 in back and 8 in the front. \n\n4. Personally damp hair works way better for me than wet hair but if the latter works better for you, then go for it, you know what's good for your hair. ",

So I washed my hair, brushed it out and perpetually put it in a pony tail wet. I’m trying to learn how to care for both of our hair so that my daughter grows up knowing how to take care of her hair. \n\nI’ve been doing a ton of research but am seeing a lot of conflicting things so I thought I’d come here to ask for some help/advice. \n\nThe picture is a few years old but shows how my daughter has stronger curls on the bottom and there is a distinct line for when the curl type changes. Now that she is older and has longer hair that line is more obvious as the hair on top is almost straight and then curls in the same way at the bottom as the photo. \n\nHere are a bunch of questions: \n- is there a way to get the top part to curl so it’s the same curl pattern all the way through (without heat) or is that just the way it is? ( like am I doing something wrong or not caring for it properly to cause such a distinction?)\n\n- how often should I wash her hair with shampoo/conditioner? I’ve seen very conflicting information. \n\n- how often to brush? I’ve seen some places say to brush as little as possible for curly hair but her hair is fine (I think) and gets tangled verrrrry easily. Especially at night. And then it takes forever to brush out if we miss a day or two. \n\n- what should a hair care routine look like for a curly hair kiddo? Products to use or avoid?\n\nAny suggestions for trusted websites or youtube channels would also be much appreciated!! ",

The hairdresser was not my cup of tea: as a matter of fact, she was not a huge curls fan (She got her own curls straightned). I still need to decide if I feel pretty or not... It's so annoying. I hate looking like a lovey-dovey sheep or a sort of grannie😅\n\nAlso, She noticed that I'm losing hair. Since It tends to have a'lively\" shape, I treat It kindly with my hands and little water instead of combing it. So, the reason She noticed the fall may be this...\n\nThoughts about this last point? Thanks in Advance :)\n\nPS. I use a silk pillow case when I sleep. As shampoo, I clean them with a combo shampoo/conditioner by L'Oreal (the brand Is \"Ultra Dolce\"... Yes, Greetings from Italy) and I style them with the Osis cream by Schwarzkopf.\n\nPS 2: any advice on How to keep them tidy?",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I’m honestly so upset and tired of looking the way I do — it affects me every single day.\n\nI drink plenty of water daily and I take vitamins, including extra vitamin D. I’ve always done that.\n\nI recently went on vacation to Egypt (I’m from Scandinavia), and while I was there, the under-eye issue almost disappeared. It was still visible, but the difference was honestly crazy — so much better than when I’m home. I can’t understand why it improved so much while I was away.\n\nI had a consultation about fillers, but I was told I’m not a good candidate because I have fat pads under my eyes, or a mix of hollowing and fat pads. They recommended surgery instead, which I’ve already been considering… but is there really nothing else that can be done?\n\nPlease help — I’m desperate.",

Gave up on everything and stopped any skincare, only washing with water morning and night and somehow it started clearing up. Now I'm 20F and it has really all disappeared except for the occasional odd pimple or hormonal acne when my period comes around... So I recently tried starting a \"proper\" skincare routine (introducing a bit more products) now that my skin has stabilised.\n\nCurrent routine in morning: \n- Cetaphil gentle cleanser\n- Sunscreen if I feel like it\n- Organic aloe gel\n\nRight before bed when I brush:\n- Cetaphil gentle cleanser\n- Anua heartleaf toner\n- organic aloe gel\n\nAs a homebody, that's my usual routine. The problem is that if I go out for the day, usually I get home around 8-10pm and idk whether I should wash my face with cleanser when I shower, since I sleep around 12-1am so I'd just be washing my face again within a few hours. I do occasionally wear makeup and I wipe it off with micellar wipes before I hop in the shower. Is that enough or do I have to use the cleanser in the shower too? \n\nI'm a little afraid that my skin might dry out if I wash it so often. Also, if I do cleanse it during the shower, do I leave my face naked afterwards?

      "content": "My current routine is simple - I wash with CeraVe SA cleanser AM and PM, followed by CeraVe SPF 30 UltraLight Moisturizing Lotion in the morning or CeraVe PM Lotion in the evening.\n\nPretty sure I have combination skin that is sometimes a bit dehydrated as my water intake is inconsistent. My skin often feels a bit tight, but I have larger pores on my nose and cheeks, in particular and get some acne (mostly blackheads and sebaceous filaments with the occasional pimple) around my nose, chin and cheeks (nothing severe). My nose tends to get pretty red, but I wouldn't say I have sensitive skin. Only other concern is eczema I get between my eyebrows and around my nostrils and scalp. Any flakiness tends to go away on my face when I'm using Head and Shoulders on my scalp, but i still get a bit more dry in those areas.\n\nThe AI bot on the website recommended the following:\n\nGlycolipid Cream Cleanser\n\nSoothing and Barrier Support Serum\n\nSalicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution\n\nNatural Moisturizing Factors + Beta Glucan\n\nThere are so many hydrating serums and such on the website that it's a bit overwhelming. Want to make sure I'm not overlooking something or that maybe there is a preferable cleanser or moisturizer based on people's experience here. I just find that the cleanser I'm using isn't doing much since the salicylic acid doesn't spend much time on my skin and that my face sometimes still feels like it could use more moisture after moisturizing, especially in winter. I don't dislike CeraVe.\n\nIn terms of the recommended routine, how frequently would you recommend i use the serums (particularly the salicylic acid)?\n\nThank you!",

Is it okay that i only wet it to reduce frizz after 48 hours? \n\nLastly, i’m very worried my curls wont take shape after my first shower because ive seen videos where it hasnt, so what can i do about that to prevent that from happening?\n",
