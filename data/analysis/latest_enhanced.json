Then I had a thought: What if I boofed it?\n\nTried for the first time last night. Not even 10 minutes later I started to see the walls 'breathe'. I thought it was weird, but nothing could've prepared me for what happened next: I was instantly launched into a kaleidoscopic hyperspace where I was greeted by interdimensional machine elves who convinced me to shave my head and just embrace it. I cried, thanked them, and just like that I was back in my room.\n\nTry 10mg in 1ml oral syringe and USE LUBE. I used rosemary oil because it's what I had but anything will work.\n\nWill try with LSD and update.\n\nEDIT: Checked my bottles and that *was* the LSD... Will boof actual RU 58841 and update. LABEL YOUR BOTTLES!!",

I have really thick curly (probably) heat damaged hair from when I used to flat iron my poor curls, i've been wearing my hair curly for about a year now and I still feel like my hair hasn't reached its full\npotential yet no matter what I do it feels big and dry and feels like straw 🥲 oh to have shiny soft curls. My curl routine is first I shampoo with Aussie miracle moist and wash just my roots. Then I rinse and usually use a hair mask instead of normal conditioner because my hair seems to struggle to keep moisture, the mask I use is shea moisture intensive hydration masqe. After brushing that through my hair I let it sit while I wash my body etc, when my hair is rinsed out and now soaking wet I detangle with a curl detangling brush and brush before applying Marc Anthonys curl envy cream, then I brush again to make curl clumps and scrunch in some eco gel. After the eco gel i spray in some leave in conditioner by Marc Anthony. Finally! I pray hands in some shea moisture curl mousse and plop for 10 minutes in a microfiber towel before diffusing for about 50 minutes.. also It seems I can never get the back to look as defined as the front. Last time I got a haircut was about 9 months ago. My hair rarely even gets past day 2 despite wearing a silk bonnet using the pineapple method to bed😅",

      "content": "The first picture is how my hair looks after I wash it and after it has fully dried. The second picture is how my hair looks less than 48 hours of not washing it later. I am genuinely feeling so hopeless that my hair can look any good for more than 12 hours. It tangles up so fast. Sometimes it feels like it tangles *as I'm detangling it in the shower*, I'd run my fingers through detangled areas and they'd already feel tangled again. I want my hair to remain in shape and obey gravity rather than poofing up (the individual hairs are extremely thin). And I don't want to expel *all* of my energy to do it and waste *all* of my money on just conditioner, as it takes me 40 minutes to shower *without detangling*, an hour with, and I have to use about half a bottle of conditioner per shower because of how much hair I have, how dense it is, and how hard it is to make sure everything is fully covered between the curls. I would really like to have some advice.\n\nAs for my routine, I usually use either \"conditioner for normal hair\" or \"clay conditioner\", although I do experiment with different conditioners too. But those two are the ones that have made detangling my hair the easiest. I usually use either \"clay shampoo\" or \"shampoo for curly hair\", but again I occasionally buy different types to experiment. I have looked for sulfate-free shampoos and products intended for detangling and felt little improvement. The brands are nothing special, just the ones I find in grocery stores and pharmacies. I wash every 2-4 days. Sometimes just conditioner and sometimes with shampoo as well, depending on how itchy my scalp feels. Sometimes I even do conditioner first to detangle, then shampoo, then conditioner again to soften. If my hair feels too tangled, I detangle it by brushing it with a handheld brush while the conditioner is still on (only way I'm able to brush at all), starting at the tips and working my way up to the scalp inch by inch. I occasionally detangle with my fingers instead but it's usually less efficient, more painful and feels like it results in more hairs falling off than with the brush. I usually wrap my head in a towel to soak most of the water then leave it to air dry the remaining moisture. I've tried just rubbing my hair quickly instead of wrapping, and I've tried using an old shirt for either one instead of a towel, the end result after fully drying looks the same. I don't use any leave-in products, as most of them give me sensory issues, make my scalp itchy, and/or make my hair look even worse. I do have spray serums that I use sometimes, and they have done the best job of slowing down the overpoofing of my hair and maintaining its oobedience to gravity, but they also accelerate getting itchy and needing shampoo again.\n\nAlso important to note: I have had chemical straightening before. I had even less of an idea of how to take care of my hair, so threw years ago I had a chemical straightening. A year later, two years ago, I had it renewed and it was botched and didnt stick, and even the attempt to fix it was imperfect and didn't last as long. I have since cut all the parts from the first straightening and grown out new roots, but I imagine I still have some damaged tips at the top layer of my hair.",

I've been able to recreate these curls two days in a row! This is like day 3 or 4 curls. \n\nEven though it seems like so much product (im learning thats necessary for curly hair) my hair doesnt feel weighed down or like my curls fall. They feel super touchable and secure yet soft. Im super happy\n\n\nPRODUCTS USED AND ORDER:\n\nouidad spiral curls shampoo\n\nOuidad spiral curls Conditioner\n\nNot your mothers leave in (only apply once when my hair is drenched wet after wash) \n\nScrunch excess off with microfiber towel\n\nCurlsmith Airdry curl cream\n\nOuidad thermal control gel (decent ammount has been KEY) \n\nOuidad spiral curls mousse \n\nDiffuse just to form cast\n\nNot your mothers oil to scrunch out cast \n\n\nKristin Ess Texture spray (use lightly)- this has been KEY in keeping definition,  helped me feel like if i pull my curls or run my hands through it it just stays well and defined.

      "content": "Hey everyone!\nFirst off, I rarely ever post on Reddit, so I hope I’m not breaking any rules 😅\n\nSome context:\nLast summer, I grew my hair out into a mullet, but I didn’t really like how it turned out. So, I decided to get a low taper fade instead.\nMy mistake was getting it done out of town — the barber completely messed it up. He even nicked my ear with the clippers and made it bleed😵‍💫.\n\nAfter that, I got super unmotivated to take care of my hair because I hated how it looked. I mostly just wore hats for a while.\nNow, about 3 months later, it’s grown out a bit, and I’m starting to like it again.\n\nSo, I want to get back into hair care and really take care of my curls — I think they have some real potential 🙃\nThe problem is, I don’t really know what I’m doing, and I’m honestly overwhelmed by all the advice out there.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\nEvery morning:\n\t1.\tRinse my hair with super cold water\n\t2.\tLet it air-dry a bit while I get dressed (I don’t use a towel)\n\t3.\tSpray some heat protectant\n\t4.\tGently separate my curls with my fingertips\n\t5.\tUse a blow dryer with a diffuser to dry my hair\n\nSometimes, if I’m going out later, I’ll do the same routine again.\nEvery couple of days, I use shampoo and conditioner.\n\nMy questions:\n\t•\tWhat should I change about my routine?\n\t•\tWhat kinds of products could/should I add to reduce frizz and make my curls look better?\n\nAny advice or product recs would be super appreciated 🙏\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR:\nGot a bad haircut months ago and stopped caring for my hair. Now it’s growing back and I want to take care of my curls again, but I’m overwhelmed by all the info out there. Here’s my basic routine (cold rinse + heat protectant + diffuser). What should I change or add to reduce frizz and enhance curls?\n",

Before that, I kept a pretty simple routine of adapalene, vitamin c, sunscreen, and a simple face wash. About two weeks ago I started to get these hideous break outs on the side of my cheeks, which take days to weeks to fully come out, and forever to fade. I know AA can cause purging, but five weeks into it I thought it was weird. Then I thought it might be acne caused by over exfoliation as I’ve been using the AA and adapalene every day (one in the AM and one in the PM), but every picture I’ve seen of over exfoliation acne looks different.\n\nIt might also be just a break out, though I haven’t had one in forever and I’m nowhere near to having my period. I’m thinking of stopping AA to see what happens, but I’m hesitant because reintroducing it might cause purging (if that’s what this is) again and I’ll have to go through the same ordeal. Anyone have any advice? 🥲",

      "content": "Hey guys, I need some advice.\n\nI got K-tips installed Thursday (10/30) by a stylist who just moved her setup to her house. It was a “model call,” so I paid for the hair (around $780) and still gave her $150 for her time. She had a lot going on and rescheduled me three times + did a full head in about 90 minutes.\n\nIt’s only been 5 days and several bonds have already slipped. My scalp feels sore and itchy (not chemical burn sore, just tight/pulling). Some bonds are really thin at the top and thicker at the bottom, others are flat (like the one pictured that slipped) I’ve only washed once and followed all the aftercare.\n\nI messaged her but haven’t heard back yet, and since she’s working from home, I can’t just stop by. She’s really nice and I’d still refer people to her if it gets fixed, but I’m not sure what’s fair to ask for.\n\nWould it be fair to ask her to redo the install since it’s only been a few days, or should I just expect her fix the ones that slipped? Does it look like an install issue or something I could’ve caused? And if I go somewhere else, would it be reasonable to ask for the rest of the unused hair?\n\nHonestly, I just did this as something for myself — I’ve been feeling down and thought it’d help me feel more confident. I’m not trying to spend another grand to fix it, but I also don’t want to ruin my hair.\n\nPhotos attached — any honest opinions or advice appreciated 🙏\n",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
