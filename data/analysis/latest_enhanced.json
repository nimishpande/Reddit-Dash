I’ve tried different curl creams, seasalt sprays etcetera, and they all seem to make my hair more frizzy, flat, dry,. Is there any recommendations for products (including shampoo and conditioners) suited for this type of hair? My current routine is just a regular vanilla shampoo (ogx) 3 times a week, and let airdry. I also feel like my curls are very forced, and i have to use a lot of water to make them pop, I’ve also switched to silk pillow recently which helps a bit i guess",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m looking for advice because I honestly have no idea where to start with my hair.\n\nI recently did a big chop (first image). My hair used to be mid-back length, but it was very damaged, so I cut it shorter to try and start fresh. I have not created a routine at all yet so I am unable to provide one I’ve been mix matching between creams, mousses, gels, oils and leave-ins trying to find something that works. The first picture is no product but it is diffused to the best of my ability. I hover dry for 15 minutes and pixie diffuse for another 5 minutes until completely dry. Other than that I use head and shoulders shampoo and conditioner as this is the only thing that has seemed to work for me.\n\nI’ve had curly and frizzy hair since I was a kid, but it was never really taken care of properly. Both my parents have straight hair, so no one really knew how to manage curls. It was almost always brushed out and pulled into a low ponytail or slicked-back ponytail, which definitely didn’t help.\n\nOn top of that, I started using heat on my hair every day from around age 13, and I’ve only just recently stopped at 21, so I’m sure that contributed a lot to the damage and loss of curl pattern.\n\nWhen I was younger, I did actually have spiral curls, and even recently my hair can still form curls, but they feel inconsistent and hard to maintain.\n\nI also went to a hairdresser for my 21st birthday hoping to get my curls styled and shaped properly, but it was honestly a terrible experience. Their website advertised curl-focused styling, but they barely put effort into defining or styling my curls, and the result didn’t reflect what I was hoping for at all (second image).\n\nRight now my biggest struggles are frizz, flat roots with no volume at the scalp, curls forming more on the ends but looking limp or weighed down at the top, and not knowing whether I should focus on moisture, protein, lighter products, or something else.\n\nEverything I’ve tried so far seems to either weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy and undefined.\n\nIf anyone has advice on how to help curls become healthier, how to get volume at the roots, what kind of routine or products might suit fine to medium curly hair, or even just where to start when you’ve never really learned curl care, I’d seriously appreciate it. Also I’m from Australia, so preferably Aussie products!\n\nAny advice is welcome because I feel pretty lost and overwhelmed. Thanks so much!",

Apologies for the quality of the pictures.\n\nThese past few weeks, she has been complaining that her skin feels really dry and that she would like to get rid of the hyperpigmentation on her face. \n\nHer face has been much darker than the rest of her body for over a decade now. Before bed, she uses a Vitamin C Serum, Arbutin 7.0+ TXA 4.0 Cream, and Naugé's Oatmeal Daily Moisturising Cream (not in order). I'm assuming its the same in the morning as well. \n\nFor the dryness, I advised her to put Vaseline on her face after applying the products just to reduce the feeling temporarily. And she bought the Arbutin 7.0+ TCA 4.0 Cream about a month and a half ago with the hope that it would help with her hyperpigmentation, but she stated that it hasn't really made a change.\n\nIf there is anything that you guys could recommend that she should use, I would really appreciate it.

      "content": "Hi everyone! A couple months ago skin on my arms and legs started to get really itchy and I had some bug bite like bumps that later turned into lesions and then eczematous patches. My arms are looking mostly normal now, but my legs still have patches of raised follicle type of thing. Both still itch but not as much.\n\nA little background which I suspect was the cause is I like to feel warm so in the winter I have the heater on, electric blanket on my lap when I work, and hot water bottle near me when I go to bed. My home was probably very low humidity and my skin barrier most likely got disrupted from all the heat and dryness.\n\nI had never have eczema ever and my lifestyle has not changed other than the winter season/heat stuff, etc.\n\nI’ve been prescribed with steroid cream as well as 8 days of oral steroids. It’s hard to tell if they worked or not- there was definitely a rebound after I stopped the oral steroids. I’m not using anything medicinal as of now but have been moisturizing as much as I can.\n\nI’m also taking Vitamin D, vitamin C, vitamin B12 as well as fish oil, in hope of repairing my skin barrier.\n\nI know this will take some time, but the itchiness is becoming tiring and Im wondering how much longer this is going to take.\n\nI also want to know if anyone has dealt with something similar. If so, what has helped you?\n\nI know people in this group are knowledgeable about this so given all this, would you suggest I get my autoimmune system, IgE/allegens (no food/airborne allergies as of a few years ago when I took the test) checked out?\n\nAny input is greatly appreciated!!",

Going forward now I had long 2a hair but eat very healthy and excercise, but i don't do anything special with my hair because the products seem too complex for me to work out what to do, I get a haircut a few weeks back and now my hair is much more curlier than it ever has been, like almost 3a hair while short, its considerably curlier to the point people think I did something special with my hair.\n\nSo that begs the question, can eating a healthy diet actually make your hair curlier, or is this some kind of cognitive bias I have and Im forgetting how curly it used to be?",
