      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi everyone, posting here hopefully to hear if someone had a similar experience or for advice. \n\nI’ve been growing my hair for a year… and was feeling good about it.. but then I went for a cut requesting only a small amount (1/4 inch) be taken off only the top layer and I completely froze. The stylist was moving/talking very quickly and used a razor on my hair to “debulk (my hair is not thick)…. I’ve had bad hair cut experiences in the past and I was traumatized and frozen… I couldn’t speak up to ask her to stop. She wound up taking off so much hair. I knew I didn’t want to use a razor on my hair but I was frozen.\n\nMy hair is 2b/2c and 3a in some places. It is feels very frizzy, coarse, and thin from the razor now. The internal layering has left shorter pieces all over the place and my hair doesn’t clump like it used to. It falls almost entirely straight in places now. \n\nI have to finger coil it over my entire head for it to even look kind of ok. I use Innersense shampoo and conditioner, Innersense Sweet Spirit leave in conditioner at ends and mid lengths and K18 mask every other week (routine). Air dry only, diffuser makes it fall straight (styling). Protein makes it fall flat so the coarseness is the only thing contributing to volume. The look of it isn’t bothering me as much as the feeling of it (though still don’t like the look at all). It feels so coarse and rough that I am very uncomfortable. She said she wasn’t going to take any significant length off the top layers but they ended up almost 3-4 inches shorter in some places. I’m still trying to grow it long so I don’t know what to do in the interim about the change in texture and thinness. \n\nIf anyone has advice on steps to take while growing it out, I’d love to hear. If this has happened to someone else, I wonder how long it took to grow out? I am wanting to grow it out so that it is very low maintenance. I used to be able to just comb it and walk out the door. Now it takes hours to do anything with it.\n\nPictures are: \n\n1. Current after 3 months growth (after finger coiling, trying really hard to style)\n2. Post haircut \n3. Pre haircut ",

No face wash, no nothing.\n\nMy skin has been super dry lately especially now that we're transitioning into winter. Any advice on how to help make my face not be so dry? I just tried the Naturium overnight cream and my whole face started burning and got red and blotchy. Doing research I think my skin barrier is damaged?

I tried doing finger coils but it took forever and seemed to pull my hair more straight. I also can't seem to keep the stray curls up (no volume) so it's constantly getting behind my glasses and in my eyes. I guess I'm a 3A with some tighter curls and some waviwr strands. But I'm not really certain. Any advice is welcome. \n\nMy routine:\n- sleep in a silk night cap\n- wash and condition with Pantene Bouncles\n- shake out the water and pat dry with a microfiber  towel\n- detangle with fingers and add Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Leave in Conditioner\n- scrunch and spritz with OGX nourishing + coconut oil\n- air dry\n\nI've tried using a diffuser but it seems to lead to more frizz than air drying. I've also tried various curl defining creams including Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Cream and OUAI Curl Creme. But the weight of the creams seems to pull my curls down into something more wavy. Gel and mousse seem to leave too much crunch and pull the hair down like defining cream.",

      "content": "Tried 5 different products and **still no glow**? Still breaking out even after \"**doing everything right**\"? Most people think the problem is the product....\n\nBut, often, the real issue is: you're using *products* meant for the ***wrong skin type***.\n\nSound familiar? Let's fix that today, safely &amp; scientifically.\n\n**1. The #1 Pillar of safe skincare: know your real skin type**  \nYour skin decides almost everything:\n\n* Which moisturisr nourishes you (or clogs you)\n* Which actives you can tolerate (or burn you)\n* Which ingredient will help or hurt\n* Why certain products break you out instantly\n* Accept or reject gel texture or creamy products in Indian weather\n\n**Memory bank:** **W**rong type + **W**rong product = **W**asted ₹^(+no result)\n\n**2. Understand the 3 pillars of your skin: A framework**\n\n* Skin type: Your baseline = oily, dry, sensitive, resistant\n* Skin condition:  Your temporary state = dehydrated, inflamed, flaky\n* Skin concern: Issues needing focus = acne-prone, redness, lifestyle issues that would need a safe &amp; fast path forward by medical professional, not social media guesswork.\n\n**Memory bank:** Type = **Baseline** **|** Condition = **State** **|** Concern = **Focus**\n\n**3. The science-based way to find your real skin type**\n\nI use the Baumann Skin Typing System, created by Dr. Leslie Baumann, MD, FAAD is a Board-Certified Dermatologist, educator, researcher and NYT bestselling author. She created a validated framework with 16 distinct precise skin types.\n\nDr. Baumann kindly gave permission for me to reference her patented system for this community. It is one of the most structured, dermatologist developed &amp; referenced framework to understand your skin type. In my opinion it's one of the best starting map.\n\nDr. Baumann, from India, **Dhanyawaad**.\n\n**Step 1: Safe, simple plan to find your real skin type**\n\n* Search SkinTypeSolutions Quiz; take the quiz\n* It will show a recommended routine, just learn from the structure\n* **Share** your skin type below &amp; comment if it actually feels accurate\n* Repeat the quiz at the start of each season\n* Your skin's behaviour in Chennai humidity is not the same in Delhi winters\n* When you know your skin type, you'll be empowered to see through the *marketing hype*\n\n**Step 2: Observe your skin like a scientist, it talks to you daily**  \nIndia's climate changes fast, your skin gives clues faster:\n\n* Oil patterns: Where do you get shine? When?\n* Sensitivity: What stings, burns or flakes?\n* Hydration: Skin feels tight, flaky or rough after washing?\n* Weather reaction: Humid monsoon, dry winter, excess pollution or UV\n\n**Memory bank:** **W**atch your skin, **I**nterpret signals, **N**avigate products  = **WIN** at Skincare.\n\n**Takeaway:** Products aren't magical, don't put them on a pedestal. They only work **if they match your skin's baseline (type)**. Once you get that right, everything else in skincare falls into place. You will start to focus on the mechanism of your skin rather than the ***popularity of a product***.\n\nA heartfelt thank you ❤️ to all who shared their skin type on my prelude post \"***Share your skin type. Let's see what this community looks like!***\" your responses helped shape this instalment.\n\nSo, next time when someone on Reddit asks you your skin type, you'll know exactly how to reply back.\n\nMe? I'm a **DRPW**  \n*Dry, Resistant, Pigmented, Wrinkle-prone with no condition or concern* \\- any recs? 😉\n\nBon SkinVoyage!\n\n**Missed previous knowledge, FOMO?**  \n**Search** this community for *Healthy Skin 101*:  \n*Which SPF fact surprised you the most in your skincare journey?*  \n*SPF &amp; PA explained? A simple guide for beginners.*\n\n**Coming soon:** The most important part of skincare you've never been taught. **Stay tuned.**",

There has been a lot of progress because at 18-20 my face was full of acne. My mother straight up took me to do a laser treatment from a cosmetologist without consulting a dermat when I was 18 which obviously reversed.\nThen I went to a top dermat at 22 in mumbai who helped me with medicines and chemical peels which solved a good chunk of my problem. I moved away to a different country and  my acne was back. I have since moved back to India and was diagnosed with PCOS and my acne is well gone and stable with the medications given by my gynac. I can finally touch my face and even discovered I have a dimple.\n\nNow I am looking to solve this acne scaring problem. Makeup does not help because it accentuates the pores. Anyone have any tips or knows affordable dermats in mumbai who can help me get my skin close to regular females my age? I sadly can no longer afford my original luxury dermat 🥲  and I feel super embarrased traveling in Mumbai with this issue. ",

      "content": "I’m 25 and I used to have extremely oily, acne prone skin. I was also starting to get hormonal acne because of my gut issues. I used every viral skincare product and my face only became worse. I first went to the doctor for my gut issues, I still have them but it’s better now. I then went to the dermatologist and got pharmacy skincare and was prescribed isotretinoin(please don’t take it without doctor’s advice) for a month, along with Moisturex Hydra. Was also given a face wash, but didn’t like it much. \n\nBut, one product I can recommend is the Moisturex Hydra face moisturiser. It’s the best for oily skin. I have used everything in the market, and everything sucks. This one doesn’t feel heavy at all. My skin is far less oily now, and feels and looks hydrated. So if you’re an oily skin person and are looking for a good budget friendly moisturiser, go for Moisturex Hydra. It’s available in pharmacies and on Amazon also. And my skin cleared! This is after 6 months of using this moisturiser. \n\nAlso attached my updated skincare routine. FYI I only use the AHA BHA PHA peel once in a week at night. Please use it after a patch test. And the Asaya serum at night. It has helped lighten my dark spots after 3 months of usage. You can use the toner spray both morning and night. Dot and key sunscreen is good. But if you use anything else, that is fine too. And simple is the only face wash that has worked for me. Literally so good. \n\nThis is just my personal experience, please don’t be mad if some of these don’t work for you. Use whatever suits your skin. Thanks!",

But the moment day 2 happens my curls lose their pattern and shape (see above). How do you go about refreshing and defining your curls after a wash day? \n\nMy current routine:\n\nI wash my hair every other day. First wash day in the week I use Ouai detox shampoo. The other 2 wash days I use Maui moisture shea butter shampoo (low poo option). Following the wash with shampoo I use Suave strawberry conditioner. I style my hair in the shower detangling it while it has conditioner in. I rinse most of the conditioner off, then I apply herbal essence volumizing mousse in my hair scrunching the crunch evenly and then after that I use Aussie instant freeze gel.\n\nI air dry because I find diffusing makes my hair frizzy. The reason why I wash my hair is so much is because I get build up very quickly, I go to the gym four times a week and I like to make sure I wash my har after each gym session. I find my hair looks bad after washing with conditioner only or even just wetting hair with no product. I just have to wash with the lowpoo but I don’t know if that’s damaging my hair\n",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
