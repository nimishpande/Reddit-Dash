At first everything was great — my pores and blackheads disappeared, I had some small breakouts but nothing major, and after that my skin looked amazing. But around July things started to get worse again: lots of texture, a lot of inflammation, and honestly my skin now looks even worse than before.\n\nAccording to my dermatologist, my treatment could have ended in July since I barely had any acne left on my face (most of it was on my body). So we began tapering down the dose: first three times a week, then once a week. But that’s when things really got worse. I went back to her, and she said she’s not entirely sure what it could be — it seems like follicular acne, not fungal, because there’s no flaking or signs of a compromised skin barrier. Her advice was to go back on daily Accutane and wait to see how things progress.\n\nShe even told me to buy two more boxes for the next two months. In total i have 2 months and 15 days of medication left. Do you think this will eventually resolve? I’ve already tried ceramides (thinking it was barrier related), azelaic acid to reduce redness, light moisturizers, heavy repairing moisturizers… but nothing seems to help.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar?\n",

      "content": "24F here currently dealing with the worst my skin has ever been. I have PCOS and assume much of this is hormonal acne. I’ve struggled with skin picking my whole life (getting better though!) and made it a long time without getting serious scarring, until this year when the texture of my skin got horrible, and I started getting scars even from pimples I let run their course without touching at all.\n\nSo I’ve never had big blackheads before, especially not on my face, and would like advice on how to get rid of this without leaving permanent damage. The blackhead has been here for about a month and it seems to be loosening up, but I’m worried that even if it comes out naturally it will leave a crater :( I’m not great at routine but I currently wash my face with Target’s Oil Free Acne Wash with Salicylic Acid 1-2x a day, and I’ve started applying Clean &amp; Clear spot treatment as well. I moisturize cautiously as I have yet to find something that doesn’t make me break out.\n\nAny advice about my skin in general would be helpful too, as I know I probably need a better routine. The texture, scarring, and CONSTANT irritation has been awful. Planning on seeing a dermatologist next month. Thanks everyone &lt;3",

This is what i use tho. My bang pieces are a bit frizzy and have a bit trouble forming curls like some other pieces of hair. I also want my hair to curl from the room and i lack a lot of volume i feel like. will finger curling help more??? and will diffusing my har also help??? should i start using hair masks?? recommend products PLEASEE!!! thank uuu :)) routine:\n1. recently started using l am shampoo and conditioner\n2. i section my hair and wet my hair with wayer and i use rizzo curl cream, camille rose honey leave in conditioner, marc anthony mousee, not your mothers gel\n3. scrunch my hair w a Tshirt and when dry (airdried) i use hairtage argan hair oil. 4.i sleep with a satin bonnet",

      "content": "Last Diwali I treated myself and picked up two Estee Lauder minis:\n\n✨ **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex Serum with Tripeptide-32 (7ml)** – around ₹1400, same price as the Snail Mucin.  \n✨ **Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Caffeine** – I grabbed the smallest pack of this one too (don’t remember the exact price).\n\nI only used them for 2 days, and wow… my skin felt *repaired, plumped, glowy, super alive*. Honestly, it was absolute magic. I really believe they work best when the serum and cream are used together.\n\nThe only downside — they’re quite expensive for such a small quantity, which is why I never continued. As a student, it just wasn’t sustainable for me.\n\nSo I’m curious — has anyone else here tried these? How was your experience?",

Shampoo once a week (Raw Sugar Moisture Smoothie) and condition daily (Raw Sugar Truly Unruly) and then rake through with a wide tooth comb\n\n2. Aveda daily moisturizer + Raw Sugar Leave in, also raked through. Then doux big poppa gel, scrunched through\n\n3. Wrap hair in a t shirt for 20 minutes, and then air dry\n\n4. I've started sleeping with it tied up in a silk scrunchie, but strands come loose throughout the night\n\nI get a ton of frizz and thin curls.
