      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Thank you in advance for all your help!!\n\nMy skincare journey started with moderate but stubborn acne which reacted to dust, dairy, nightshade plants— you name it!!!\nI tried switching up products, but what really helped was isotretin prescribed by my dermatologist.\n\nComing to my moisturizer issues, I have tried multiple moisturizers, but just about everything breaks me out.\n\nThe ones I have tried:\n1) Mary and May Idebenone Moisturizer \n2) Soon Jung Etude House 10 Free Emulsion\n3) Sebamed Clear Gel (possibly the citric acid in it)\n4) InTree Tea Tree \n5) Beplain Cicaful Calming Gel\n6) Sidmool 100 Honey Moisture\n7) Neutrogena 72 Hours Moisturizer \n\nOther things which broke me out-\n1) TO alpha arbutin but Cos de Baha arbutin didn’t— just to cross out ingredients\n2) Numbuzin number 5+\n\n\nThings that don’t break me out- \n1) Iunik beta glucan serum \n2) Cosrx full fit propolis ampoule\n3) plain old glycerine \n4) Purito Daily soft touch sunscreen\n5) Cosrx snail mucin (not sure about this one)\n6) skin1004 Centella ampoule\n\nI was hoping to find a decent moisturizer to help my skin restore its barrier given I have to use tretinoin and azelaic acid every day. \nI have been using tretinoin for about 3 years now. I started off with 0.5 but recently realized that my skin doesn’t handle it especially when I am using azelaic acid along with it, so I moved to 0.025%. While this has helped keep those skin flakes at bay, my skin still feels dry and I have mild acne/texture all over my face. \nI’m open to recommendations for moisturizers, ampoules, or in-office treatment.\n\nThank you!!\n",

I also have a big forehead lol and want wispy bangs but my hairstylist says my hair is too long to blend bangs into? \n\nMy routine is Not Your Mothers Shampoo and Conditioner and then I brush in IGK curl cream while it’s soaking wet and scrunch in IGK curl gel or Not Your Mothers Flash Freeze Gel after scrunching out with a cotton t shirt. I then plop for a few hours and then let it air dry! I’ve tried using claw clips to give me so volume while it’s drying and that gives me about 30 minutes of volume haha.",

Looking back on it now, it really wasn't that bad. This is much worse. The products instructions read to use twice a day, I did so for maybe a week? Or two? And then I took the second image (which was originally a video hence the poor quality) after stopping exfoliating because my face burned, you can see the grooves in my face, lines from exfoliating. Now those are gone after 4 whole months (now) but I am left with this orange peel texture (in the third picture), just look at the difference in the first and third photo. Ive ruined my skin, I hate myself more than i've ever hated myself before, I look like I have the skin of a 60 year old and I'm only 17. What makes this worse is l've struggled with BDD my whole life, and I was just starting to get used to my appearance and now l've gone and erased all the progress I had made seeking out the clear skin that I already had.\n\nIve tried all kinds of things: When I first discovered the damage I used dove soap only on my face for maybe a week or less \n\nThen I changed to just water and sunscreen until things got a little better \n\nThen I tried: All natural skincare: aloe Vera, 100% rose water for cleansing along with CeraveAM and Acenecide to clean out the pores hoping they'd be more likely to close \n\nInsane moisturising regime(recently made my face hot and burn): \nAcenecide beforehand Vichy mineral 89 + CervaPM + Cerave inthe tub\n\n\nIt has been 4 months between the 2nd and 3rd picture and there's been barely any change. Im starting to think this is permanent. I was honestly so stupid to use these in the first place and not think twice about how they could damade mv skin especially when the instructions told me to overuse. I really didn't need these products, my skin was practically perfect, making the consequences hurt even more because this really is the fault of my own stupidity and insecurity.\n\nIm desperate. I can't go into school. I can't look at myself without my heart sinking. I honestly don't think I can live looking like this, I sound insane but this has got me contemplating suicide almost everyday. I really need some advice and some reassurance that my skin will go back to normal.",

In India we have many oral sun protection supplements like Oscreen (which I used before). I understand tanning is inevitable if I step out at the beach at noon. But I want to know if you used any oral sunscreen that helped you along with topical sunscreen? \n\n\nEdit: I live near the beach and I am going through this tedious process of tanning and detanning every year. I love to swim during summers. I created this post for someone similar to me who do outdoor activities during summer and have used any oral sunscreen that worked for you. Hope my question is clear and I never implied in my question to replace topical sunscreen with oral sunscreen. ",

I have oily skin with some dry patches sometimes on my forehead. My nose is very very oily and has clogged pores. Like when I rub my nose the stuff in my pores fall out. I can’t even put foundation on my nose! It’s all patchy and looks bad. It used to look like that on my whole face but this face wash really helped. I exfoliate my face with a silicone scrubber. My skin is very sensitive and prone to eczema, the first bad flare I had my face was swollen. I was prescribed a cream for it and it got rid of the eczema. Some products I’ve tried have caused bad flares. So I can be scared of trying new products. I have bad dark circles under my eyes although there is no swelling, just darkness. My face is also pink but I wouldn’t classify it as rosacea, but my upper lip and chin aren’t pink so it’s like a mustache and goatee of my skin color haha. I wash my face in the shower which I know people don’t recommend but it makes it easier for me to do. I’m kind of lost on if the products I’m using are good and what products to add or change. If you can please give me some advice! I really dont have the money to go to a dermatologist. Thank you!\n\nTLDR: clueless on skincare, oily skin, clogged pores, sensitive skin prone to eczema.

People were more friendly, both men and women were nicer to me and I feel like maybe it was because I looked less alternative so people were less judgy. and also because blonde is perceived as less intimidating. Idk but it’s been bothering me because while I notice that some girls are nicer while I have the red as they compliment my hair and appearance, some talk to me more condescendingly like I’m weird and it’s been pissing me off. Men also hit on me less, which I honestly don’t mind as I was sick of the sexual attention. However, I feel ugly because of this, and the guy I previously dated (who I dropped now thank god) didn’t really compliment my change of color so I think he preferred the blonde. \n\nSo I don’t know if the red just doesn’t suite me or if I’m just being insecure because of not having that much positive reactions compared to the blonde. I also used to get bullied so I am kind of sensitive when it comes to being treated like an outcast when I know I should be treated by the way my personality is not by my hair. I have always been very confident since and am quite social/extroverted but yeah I can’t help but notice the weird judgy looks.  \n\nBoth slide 2 and 3 was the same hair except with different hairstyles. last slide was me with black hair. Wondering if I should just do black, or go a deeper red as I do also believe I am a deep winter. Or just keep it lol because I am not sure if I am overthinking it.",

      "content": "Could you advise me how to use this products in correct dosage to ensure I will not cause my skin any harm? I have oily skin with acne and a lot of scarring. Every little pimple is leaving a scar even if I am not touching or squeezing it.\n\nCURRENT ROUTINE: \n\nFace wash AM/PM\n1. Dermedic Hydrain3 Hialuro creamy cleansing gel\n2.  bean cleansing oil\n\nSPF\n1. Paula’s Choice Youth Extending Daily Hydrating Fluid SPF 50\n\nMoisturizer\n1. Cetaphil PS Lipoactive for dry and sensitive skin\n2. Avene Cicalfate+ repairing protective cream\n\nOnce or twice a week but never on the same week\n1. Ph Doctor RetinALL 0,05 by inti skin\n2. The ordinary salicylic acid 2% solution\n\nFor breakouts and as spot treatment\n1. The ordinary azelaic acid suspension 10%\n\nWhat works and what I think doesn’t: \nDOES HELP\n1. Salicylic acid and azelaic acid I think work well for me. I have used them in the past and they helped, the best for me was the previous formula of the ordinary salicylic acid.\n2. What did help but only temporarily are dermapen and acids treatments done by a certified skin professional. I have done many sessions and spent thousands on dermapen. The results were amazing and it did get rid of my scars. But after a few months acne came back and I have scars all over my cheeks and chin again. Doing these treatments every month would help but I would have to do that infinitely and they are very expensive and only give temporary results.\n\nDOES NOT HELP \n1. All retinols and retinals I have tried were causing breakouts and painful cystic acne even months into using it.\n2. Moisturizers I use I think are not great for my skin type. They make me very oily. I used to use snail mucin but it had a burning sensation and was not great for my skin.\n3. All dermatologists say that it’s acne vulgaris and no meds would help, they only give skin treatments based on benzoyl peroxide like Duac or Epiduo. They never work and I have tried multiple times. They only cause breakouts, my skin is very dry and sensitive and I am left with more scars and in worse condition every time after using it.\n\nNEW ROUTINE: \nThese are the products I want to incorporate in my skincare routine:\n1. The Ordinary Glucoside Foaming Cleanser – can be used daily, morning and evening\n2. The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG – can be used daily, morning and evening for eyes\n3. The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% – can be used daily, morning and evening\n4. The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% – use in the evening (not every day, may cause irritation)\n5. The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Masque – use once a week in the evening\n6. The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Beta Glucan – can be used daily, morning and evening\n7. La Roche Posay Effaclar H Iso-Biome (moisturizing cream) – can be used daily, morning and evening\n8. Avene Cleanance Aqua Gel (mattifying gel) – can be used daily, morning and evening on the entire face 9.Avene Cleanance Cleansing Mask – can be used 1–2 times a week, leave on for 5 minutes, then rinse off\n10. The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% – can be used daily, morning and evening\n\nWATCHOUTS: \nI know I should not use salicylic and azelaic acid together. As for Avene and Salicylic Acid masks - I think I will use them once a week and one week use the Avene one and the next week salicylic acid mask.\n\nWHY NEW ROUTINE:\nMy skin is sensitive so I don’t want to overdo it. I want to change my routine because over the last few months my skin has worsened. I have a lot of texture, bumps, whiteheads and scars. Every day I have at least one new pimple and they always leave scars and marks. All of the scars are bright red and even though I don’t have much inflammation it looks like I do because of my skin texture. I also want to finally deal with oily skin. My makeup looks bad and makes the texture very visible, it gets cakey after a few hours and just slides off my skin. I use Estée Lauder and setting powder so it’s not caused by bad makeup but by my skin.\n\nAny advice on this routine? Do you think it’s good? How can I make sure to not overdo it?\n\nI’m sorry for the long post! Wanted to share all context and products I have used",

It’s very possible, all of my products just say ‘moisturizing’. \nSo I’ve been trying to change my routine to help with this. I tried doing rice water, but that just made my hair all weird (might be a mistake on my part but I did watch like a hundred tutorials). \nI’ve bought a clarifying shampoo and the CurlSmith Bond salve rehab. That did work but only for day 1, my curls actually stayed, but day 2 and day 3 I noticed they are once again super limp, mushy, overly soft. I’ve also been diffusing instead of air drying. \n\nSo I need your help. What protein rich products/routine would you recommend? Styling products? I’ve ordered the CurlSmith protein enriched shampoo but it hasn’t arrived yet. (I know to be careful to not go straight into protein overload, but I swear that’s not happening anytime soon).

However, this time this application didnt really help, and im still struggling with extremely burning and tightness, and big pimples due to damaged skin barrier. I used to usually wake up with oil on my face but now i wake up with complete dry skin, hence I've stopped morning washes. I then heard that CebHydra moisturizer is really helpful. Using that religiously, but even that's not working. Its been over a week now and I don't know what to do. Ive stopped applying sunscreen as well, as it burns when I do so. My eyebrows have started to shed skin and it looks like I have eyebrow dandruff😃 Could yall give any advice or share your experience? It would be really helpful!",
