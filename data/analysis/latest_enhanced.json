      "content": "hey guys! i’m from sri lanka 🇱🇰 and 2024 September I discovered a 3rd-party seller who brings indian skincare here… and yeah, my skin AND bank account have not recovered since lol\n\nbefore that, i suddenly started getting major breakouts (pic 1). this was super frustrating because i had clear skin my entire life. so like many people here, i decided to self-prescribe 🙃\n\ni started tret 0.025% (cream only available here) and imported:\n\n* simple moisturiser cream\n* plum niacinamide toner\n* dot &amp; key sunscreen\n* TO niacinamide 10%\n\nfollowed this routine for 7-8 months with absolutely no improvement. tret irritated my skin SO badly but i kept telling myself to “trust the process” 😭  \n*(pics 2–3 are from this phase)*\n\neventually i gave up and saw a derm(in 2025 May). i was prescribed:\n\n* deriva-c gel (adapalene + clindamycin) – pm\n* aknix face wash\n* clindamycin gel – am\n* azithromycin 500 mg (3x/week)\n\ni swapped the face wash for minimalist SA cleanser because aknix was crazy expensive (\\~₹2400). this routine helped calm down my inflamed, angry acne (pic 4/5), but i was left with a face FULL of closed comedones and Acne marks.\n\nhonestly? i was just relieved. i accepted the bumpy texture because it was WAY better than the war zone i had before💀. so I sticked to that routine for about 5 months.\n\nthen i came across a post here about tazarotene and decided to give it a shot. amazon india only had 0.1%, so i went all in. I started taz in late October.\n\nand listen… this stuff is MAGICAL.  \ndespite being the *strongest retinoid* i’ve ever used, it has never irritated my skin. no burning, no peeling, nothing. within 1.5 months, i had the smoothest skin of my life. i still can’t believe how gentle yet effective it is for me.\n\ncurrent routine:\n\nam:\n\n* Minimalist SA cleanser\n* isntree green tea fresh toner\n* cosrx snail mucin\n* aquasoft ac moisturiser\n* Picspot gel\n* sundrink sunscreen\n\npm:\n\n* garnier micellar water\n* joy pH 5.5 face wash\n\ntaz days (mon/tue/wed/fri/sun):\n\n* aestura lotion *or* minimalist b12 cream\n* taz\n\nthursday (barrier day):\n\n* aestura lotion\n* b4 nappi cream\n\nsaturday:\n\n* formularx lactic acid\n* aquasoft ac\n\ntaz literally did what tret never could for me. if you’re struggling with closed comedones, texture, or tret intolerance, this might be worth looking into.",

Not only did I absolutely over wash it (I mean I would refresh it EVERY day for school), I also box dyed it twice and straightened it around 4 times last year 😭😭 rn it’s absolutely dead but I’m very lost on how to get my hair healthy again😢 my mom is kinda anti-curly hair so I get no support from her and I also can’t afford to see a professional or get any sort of curly hair treatment at the moment. \n\nas you can see in the pictures, I do have some layers which give me volume and shape i like in my hair, the problem is my hair is very thin and spaced out ish..? also I noticed my curls have NO bounce at all like genuinely they are stiff and dry no matter how much product they hold. the back of my head also is the main problem, as seen in the second pic it’s a HOT mess…🫩(third pic is the best reference I found of how juicier my ringlets were before last year)\n\n  \n!! for my routine I use marc anthony coconut and shea shampoo + conditioner, then on wet hair I rake in marc anthony strictly curls cream. After that I section my hair and brush style with the bounce curl brush. When I’m done with that I use not your mother’s gel and finally marc Anthony strictly curls mousse. I usually air dry my hair but I did diffuse it in the routine for these pics !!\n\nIs there anything I can do at all??🤧",

Nothing fancy. I've been doing this routine for over a decade. When I was a teenager, I made a mistake of getting my hair cut short and have been growing it out since, with trims in-between. Nothing against people with shorter hair, it just wasn't for me and I missed my long hair I had as a kid so I decided to regrow it.\n\nLong story short, I had to get hospital tests and was monitored for several days, basically bedridden. They also had to use medical glue on my scalp to connect cords and monitor brain activity. After everything, I was left with a HUGE matt in my hair. Two local salons turned me down. Then I went to a local beauty school which helped reduce the size of my matted hair ball but they couldn't get it out completely. The professor told me her students did their best, and I appreciated it so much. So the question is, what now? The picture on the right is after they reduced the size of the matted ball. Left side is what my hair usually looks like. It's at the end of my hair but all balled up which is why my hair looks a lot shorter than it actually is.",

It just turns into more of an afro (afro might be the wrong word, that’s just what my family calls it idk) and it goes on and it’s starting to become a big insecurity. I really need a haircut but every time it gets cut it just turns into a weird bubble until it grows out enough to have more weight, and then it turns back into this poofy mess with the flat spot at the top of my head when it’s dry. Can someone please help me keep it looking the way it does when its wet and not poof so much? Also does anyone else have any advice for haircuts? My hair just turned curly in the last year or so and I hate it, nobody in my life will give me any advice but “cut it short”, I feel really lost and have no sense of direction. Any advice helps, thank you!\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. Crew Daily Shampoo/Conditioner \n\n2. Nothing \n\n3. Towel dried\n\n4. I don’t do anything specific, just my normal pillowcase",

      "content": "My skin has been suffering for almost 6 months now where I literally cannot tolerate anything anymore on my cheeks and lower face. It started back in mid-August where I used a moisturizer on top of tretinoin which caused an intense burning, redness, and tight sensation. To the point where I could feel it in the nerves in my cheeks. Instead of washing it off, which I should have, I slept through it because it was getting late and I didn’t think much of it. The next day, m I woke up with continued red, burning cheeks and nerve sensitivity.\n\nSince this incident, I have not been able to tolerate anything. Even simple bland moisturizers and oils like Vanicream, zeroid soothing cream, and pure squalane oil have given me trouble. Same goes for Vaseline. I will get the same red, burning, tight sensation with hypersensitized nerves. And the more I use it each day by trying to push through, it will eventually lead to sandpaper texture with numbness in the cheeks until I stop. This predominantly happens to my cheeks and a little bit around the nasiolabal area. Forehead and neck are completely fine.\n\nI have had patch testing and I am only allergic to formaldehyde which is in none of my skincare products that I own, confirmed by dermatologist. I even used steroids for a very short period, and tacrolimus for 6 weeks( both of them prescribed by a dermatologist) Neither of them have helped. If anythib no tacrolimus just made my skin burn more. \n\nI have seen two dermatologists already, and have a follow up with the second one next week. Both of them have confirmed that I am suffering from irritant contact dermatitis. Unfortunately neither of their approaches have helped. The one I am seeing again has suggested cerave healing ointment and zinc oxide. As soon as I used it, it leads to the same incident as before: burning, tightness, nerve sensitivity, etc…\n\nI fear that I may be out of options and the only thing left for me might be zero therapy for awhile to let my skin calm down. In fact, I have already started it yesterday and my skin does feel better and calmer by not using anything. The only drawback is dryness and tightness. And I am still worried if it’s even sustainable long-term. And how would I know when it’s time for me to reintroduce something back into my skin? I’m really scared at this point and it’s affecting me mentally. I really want to cry. Please what do I even do? I can no longer distinguish right from wrong anymore :(",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "⏳Period of use: 1 Month\n\n👩🏻Skin type: dry, sensitive \n\n🧪 My Experience: \nI was really disappointed with this moisturizer. I had high hopes and was expecting something similar to the Bioderma Atoderm Baume, but it absolutely failed to deliver. It has the texture of a waxy lip balm that is really unpleasant to apply; it feels like I’ve put a film of beeswax on my face. Its claims of hydrating and replenishing the skin are overshadowed by the waxy texture and the difficulty of application. If you have damp skin, the product won’t even budge; you can actually scrape it off with your nails. \n\nI didn't find it moisturizing enough for winters, nor will I use it during humid summers (I can only imagine what a nightmare that would be). \n\n🔮Final verdict: The only \"pro\" is that it works as a tone-up cream for a quick brunch look. That’s it. I won’t be repurchasing this anytime soon.  ",

I've learnt not to touch their curls when is dry...\n\nAny help will be amazing!",

Scrunth and diffuse upside down \nI usually put it in a bun when sleeping or just chill \nShe suggested I not use any curl creams or gels or leave in conditioners, as well as moisturizing products because I have moisturizer hair enough.\nI'm wondering what products I should use then. Just a foam? \nDoes anyone have suggestions for light weight foams.\nAdditionally I have quit sensitive skin particularly to coconut products so preferable not really strong fruity ones! Also potentially budget friendly unless it's something that will last you a long time for a big price \n\nThanks xx",

      "content": "I have had acne my whole life and am seeking guidance. **The following is context, you can skip to the bottom for my question**. \n\nI got my period at 11 and began developing severe acne by age 12. Between the ages of 12 and 16, I was prescribed multiple acne treatments, both oral and topical, including doxycycline, tetracycline, tactupump, and tretinoin, though these are only the ones I can clearly remember.\n\nAt 17, I was referred to a dermatologist and began a full course of Accutane, which consisted of approximately 2.5 months at 20 mg, 2.5 months at 40 mg, and 3 months at 50 mg. While Accutane ultimately cleared my skin, it came with significant side effects—I previously had 20/20 vision, but Accutane blurred my vision, and it also caused my periods to become unbearably painful for the duration of treatment. Despite this, I completed the full course.\n\nMy skin remained clear afterward, but at 19, in 2023, I began experiencing mild breakouts and was prescribed Winlevi and tretinoin; both caused me to break out, and although I understand topicals often lead to purge periods, after having had great clear post-accutane skin, and after having endured horrible side effects because of accutane, I freaked out and stopped using the topicals. Eventually, my skin cleared on its own, and my breakouts remained minimal, so I moved on.\n\nIn April 2025, at age 21, during a very stressful academic period, my skin began breaking out severely again, and unlike previous flare-ups, it did not resolve on its own. From April onward, I have been breaking out consistently every month without fail. Considering the breakout occurred post-accutane and was triggered by stress, I know my acne is mostly hormonal.\n\nSo, today, January 2026, I visited my dermatologist. She said she wouldn't recommend spironactone because it takes too long to kick in, it is not worth the irregular periods, and I'd have to be on it for a long time. She said she wouldn't recommend accutane because it had bad side effects for me before. So, she prescribed me **Cabtreo** (she also prescribed Akleif and Differin, saying I could test them out and choose one of the three, but ultimately said Cabtreo seems best for my case.)\n\nI’ve dealt with acne my whole life. At this point, I’ve given up. \n\n**My Question:** If you've used Cabtreo, did it help you? If you've used Cabtreo post-accutane, could you share your experience? Does anyone have any general advice pertaining to my situation?",

      "content": "I have had acne my whole life and am seeking guidance. I got my period at 11 and began developing severe acne by age 12. Between the ages of 12 and 16, I was prescribed multiple acne treatments, both oral and topical, including doxycycline, tetracycline, tactupump, and tretinoin, though these are only the ones I can clearly remember.\n\nAt 17, I was referred to a dermatologist and began a full course of Accutane, which consisted of approximately 2.5 months at 20 mg, 2.5 months at 40 mg, and 3 months at 50 mg. While Accutane ultimately cleared my skin, it came with significant side effects—I previously had 20/20 vision, but Accutane blurred my vision, and it also caused my periods to become unbearably painful for the duration of treatment. Despite this, I completed the full course.\n\nMy skin remained clear afterward, but at 19, in 2023, I began experiencing mild breakouts and was prescribed Winlevi and tretinoin; both caused me to break out, and although I understand topicals often lead to purge periods, after having had great clear post-accutane skin, and after having endured horrible side effects because of accutane, I freaked out and stopped using the topicals. Eventually, my skin cleared on its own, and my breakouts remained minimal, so I moved on.\n\nIn April 2025, at age 21, during a very stressful academic period, my skin began breaking out severely again, and unlike previous flare-ups, it did not resolve on its own. From April onward, I have been breaking out consistently every month without fail. Considering the breakout occurred post-accutane and was triggered by stress, I know my acne is mostly hormonal.\n\nSo, today, January 2026, I visited my dermatologist. She said she wouldn't recommend spironactone because it takes too long to kick in, it is not worth the irregular periods, and i'd have to be on it for a long time. She said she wouldn't recommend accutane because it had bad side effects for me before. So, she prescribed me **Cabtreo** (she also prescribed Akleif and Differin, saying I could test them out and choose one of the three, but ultimately said Cabtreo seems best for my case.)\n\nI’ve dealt with acne my whole life. At this point, I’ve given up. If anyone who has had a similar experience, or has used Cabtreo, has any words of wisdom for me, I would appreciate literally anything.",
