      "title": "What is the science behind 'less damaging' hair dryers such as the Dyson?",
      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I wash my face, blink, and I’m shiny again. On top of that, my skin is **porous** (i.e., large-looking pores, textured, things seem to hold onto oil/sweat etc).\n\nSo I’m on the hunt for a **cleanser** that:\n\n* Helps control/seb-regulate the oil production (or at least reduce the slick-factor)\n* Doesn’t strip my skin so much that it freaks out or over-compensates by making even more oil\n* Works for porous skin / helps somehow with texture or visible pores\n* Preferably available in India (but if international, worth the buy)\n\nAlso: I know I’m “late” to actively caring for my skin — but is it *too late*? Can oily &amp; porous skin still be improved significantly even if I start now?\n\nWould love recommendations + your routine tweaks that you swear by. Thanks in advance! 🙏",

I already tried tretinoin and completed a full isotretinoin course, but my skin still breaks out mostly on my cheeks and jawline. I’d describe my skin type as combination with an oily T-zone, and I feel like my acne might be hormonal.\nMy routine is simple: a gentle cleanser each morning and night, a light moisturizer, and daily sunscreen. I’m careful with diet and don’t use many products. Still, the inflamed pimples keep coming.\nHas anyone experienced something similar or found a solution when topicals and isotretinoin haven’t worked? I’d appreciate any advice on what to try next or what might be the underlying cause.\nThanks in advance.\n",

      "content": "Hi there! This is a very unique situation, but I'm hoping someone can help.\nI work as a jeweler and my hands, arms, face, and neck get pretty dirty throughout the day due to a polishing compound we use, little pieces of metal flying everywhere, dust, etc. I love having good skin and had a great routine going before this job, but lately have been struggling with breakouts, clogged pores, dry skin, and fine lines because of how rough my work environment can be. I try to wear a mask and gloves when I can. I have found a good hand lotion which creates an invisible barrier so my hands are easier to get clean. I was wondering if there are some product suggestions people may have for my face and neck too.\nI'm looking for suggestions or ideas to keep my skin clean, make it easier to wipe dirt off, or keep skin plump and hydrated.\nI also noticed recently when I focus really hard I purse my lips and get kind of more noticeable laughing lines - would it be silly to wear something kind of similar to an under eye mask but on my laughing lines around my mouth underneath my N95 mask? Like a small collagen sheet mask? I don't care if it is silly...I'll try it!\n\nI use a Cetaphil moisturizing cream in the morning so it will last throughout the day, but my N95 mask will typically absorb some of it when it comes in contact with my face. I also worth with flames and chemicals that tend to dry out the air around me, so my moisturizer doesn't seem to go as far as it should.\nIt also doesn't seem to help much with preventing the dirt/soot from sticking to my face and I have to do a lot of tough scrubbing to get it off. \nWhen I come home I have to double cleanse even after wiping my face off and you'd be amazed how gross my washcloth looks! \n\nAny thoughts or tips are appreciated!",

I tried to strip the black from my har but I guess when I used the color stripper I didn’t have it evenly distributed and there is now a red section around the same height, all throughout my hair. I used color remover that contained liquid bleach. Didn’t realize the color stripper had bleach until after. then I used ash blond toner. The first picture is after coloring it with 6NN color. It was to light so I got 4NN after and haven’t used it yet. Since then I haven’t done anything with is because I don’t want to ruin my hair. It’s already a little damaged and doing the elastic stretching if that makes sense. I’ve used a blue hair packet thing from Sally’s and that’s it. I’m at a loss because I don’t want to bleach it again but I fear that’s my last option. Please help! ",

The curls get frizzy and stretched out, especially on the top layer.\n\nHere’s my routine:\n\t•\tWash and condition my hair\n\t•\tApply leave-in/cream\n\t•\tDetangle\n\t•\tScrunch\n\t•\tApply gel\n\t•\tScrunch again\nI let it dry naturally \n\nI used to use mousse before gel, but I didn’t really see any difference.\n\nAnother problem is that the hair on the top of my head is much less curly than the rest — it tends to stay flatter and frizzier.\n\nOn the last photo you can see the products I’m currently using.\n\nAny advice or product suggestions would be super appreciated.

So I looked up thick balms and landed on Laneige. \n\nI bought the Laneige lip sleeping mask in Gummy Bear on October 06 2025. I took the first picture before applying the mask for the first time.\n\nI religiously applied it every night and made a lot of effort to stop biting down on my lips again.\n\nThe second picture is from October 14 2025. In just a week I noticed that the pits were healing and my lips were feeling much healthier.\n\nNow I  have made it a habit to slather my lips with the mask whenever I feel like biting, and I must say it helps a lot. \n\nI saw a few posts on reddit subs about Laneige exacerbating rosacea around the lips and I'm a bit worried about tackling that if it happens to me. Otherwise I'm really happy with my results  ☺️ \n\nSharing in case there are other people out there suffering from my condition and wondering if a lip product might help.\n\n",

(only in the mornings) beauty of joseon rice + probiotics sunscreen\n\ni used to have more skincare products like cosrx snail muscin serum, the ordinary products, exfoliating scrubs, etc. but i didn't feel much of a difference from using them so i just stopped :/ i also recognize that i don't drink enough water every day and i've been tracking that better lately so hopefully that helps too. my biggest concerns are overall dullness later in the day and my dark circles. any tips/recommendations would be MUCH appreciated thank you !!!",

My hair dries fast, and I guess it's not \"waterproof\" (though it used to be, I dont know why it changed, I dont use heat or dye my hair)\n\nThe photo is my hair 2 days ago. My hair is currently very dry from overclarifying, but it originally became dry after I used the kundal protein bonding treatment for a bit more than 5 minutes. maybe 7 or 10.\n\nI have been deep conditioning and using a curl cream every wash day and its helping. I also use argan oil + olive oil serum spray from natur + regular castor oil for my ends (ive only done this once but it helped w frizz)\n\nOnce my hair has gone back to normal, would you guys recommend a gel for shine? I dont care much about it lasting more than 2 days because my scalp typically feels very dirty if I go beyond that.

      "content": "My hair is struggling to curl. It only curls at the ends, and i feel like for the most part it's because my haircut has no layers (i only have face framing pieces).\n\nHere's my issue : last time i went to the hairstylist (first pic is the most recent, 2 months after i went there), she refused to give me layers and told me my hair was too thin for that. Individual strands are indeed thin (would the right term be fine hair?) but i feel like my hair is still a bit dense, and with a blunt cut, i kinda look like a cocker dog. \nIs she right, or just lying to me cuz she wouldn't know how to style it?\n\nThen, she proceeded to cut it as straight as she could and for a few weeks even my ends stopped being curly.. She once tried a curl \"routine\" on my hair but just dried it, brushed it and then added a curl cream. The detangling part was really rough too. It obviously looked terrible.\n\nHere's my routine and what i know about my hair :\n- honestly any shampoo, sometimes a sulfate free one. doesn't seem to change a thing\n- sometimes garnier banana hair mask/cocoa butter\n- garnier avocado conditioner or energie fruit coco conditioner\nI add a very small amount of banana hair mask as a leave in after every wash. I make sure my hair is not stuck to my roots and i scrunch properly. When i refresh, i spray water mixed with my leave in. I wash every 4 to 5 days, and these days i sleep in a braid since my hair won't curl correctly anyway.\n\nI don't use a gel because i don't like how it feels; it's hard to remove the crunch and i mess it up most of the time. It looks better when i stop at the leave in.\nI just stick to drugstore products because i'm tired of buying stuff that doesn't seem to do anything.\n\nI think my hair is low porosity and it seems to be straight at the roots. I don't think it's a routine issue, it's just how my hair is supposed to be. It looks wavy overall but i can see small curls pretty much everywhere and if that matters, it's even curlier around the neck/ears. That's why i'm wondering if it could look curlier.\n\nShould i search for another hairstylist or should i stick with this hairstyle? If you have good reference pictures, i'd like to see them! btw i'd prefer it if i could keep my length.\nenglish is not my first language so i hope it wasn't too hard to read..",
