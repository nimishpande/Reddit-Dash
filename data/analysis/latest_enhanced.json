      "content": "hey guys! since my last post i’ve been getting a lot of dms/comments asking about my routine, so i thought i’d just address everything in one post🫶\n\ni did mention my current routine in the previous post, but i really want to clarify something important: that is NOT how i started my taz journey. please don’t jump straight into that 😭\n\neven though my skin was already familiar with retinoids (i’d been on adapalene + an SA cleanser for \\~5 months), i **cut out ALL actives** for a full month when i started taz.\n\nit was literally:  \n**me + taz + moisturiser vs the world.**\n\ni only used **taz twice a week** and focused entirely on barrier support.\n\n# how i started (first month):\n\n**AM:**\n\n* dot &amp; key barrier face wash\n* cosrx snail mucin (on damp skin)\n* Aquasoft AC moisturiser\n* sunscreen\n\n**PM:**\n\n* dot &amp; key barrier face wash\n* aestura lotion\n* **taz ONLY on monday &amp; thursday**\n\nthat’s it. no acids, no niacinamide, no “just one exfoliant.” nothing.\n\nplease **do NOT** start tret, taz, or even adapalene without proper dermatologist guidance. they can seriously mess up your skin if used incorrectly.(loot up what tret did to me🙃)\n\nand even *with* a derm’s okay, **do your own research**. read studies, read experiences here on reddit, understand side effects, and what barrier damage actually looks like. don’t blindly copy routines (including mine).\n\ni really can’t emphasize this enough:  \n**starting slowly + using a GOOD moisturiser is non-negotiable.**  \nno retinoid will work if your barrier is wrecked.\n\nalso, full disclosure; at that time i was studying for my university final exams, so i was basically in my dark dorm room all day with little to no sun exposure. that definitely helped too 😅\n\n**honorable mention:**  \nlater on, i read about diaper rash creams on reddit and started using b4 nappi cream on nights i wasn’t using taz to strengthen my barrier.\n\nand yeah… that stuff is the shit.\n\ni still get ONE painful hormonal cyst around my nose area near my period that lasts \\~2 weeks and leaves PIH forever. recently i discovered that if i apply a thick layer of diaper cream before it even fully forms (when you can just feel it under the skin), it goes away in 2 days with zero PIH. absolute game changer for me.\n\nso just to be clear again:  \ni added **all other actives VERY slowly, one by one**, and even now, on **taz nights i use nothing except moisturiser.**\n\nplease be patient with retinoids and protect your barrier. slow progress &gt;&gt;&gt; damaged skin 🫶",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I liked the convenience of it being delivered to me, but I know I've been overpaying and would like some alternatives! \n\nThe exfoliant is 8% glycolic acid, so thats an AHA right? Do I even need an AHA at this point? Do I need a BHA? \n\nI'd also be open to product recs for moisturizers! I have only been using Neutrogena water gel!\n\n  \nMy main goal is to get a new cleanser and exfoliant and then just figuring out where/when the tret fits in there.\n\n  \nTHANK YOU!!!!!!",

      "title": "[Acne] Normal to dry skin, help needed with forehead bumps that appeared quickly. Removed suspected triggers, but no improvement over a month later.",
      "content": "TLDR- normal/dry skin somewhat prone to ccs, got on with neutrogena gel and curel intensive moisture historically. I \\*suspect\\* film-formy sunscreens induced forehead CC explosion. Can’t get rid of it despite ceased use. \n\n\n\nI (25f) have normal-dehydrated/slightly dry skin. (Skin feels tight after cleansing or getting my face wet and the water drying off, but no dry patches, and I never seem to get oily (but my face sweats a lot).) I get hormonal spots around my mouth and usually have mild ccs on my forehead that come and go a little (better in the summer etc). \n\nNever been very consistent with skincare - for a year or two I was using \n\n\\- Neutrogena hydroboost water gel moisturiser and Superdrug me+ Salicylic acid cleanser, a few times a week (basically on hair wash days). Skin was pretty clear/good here. \n\n\\- Then I switched to curel intensive moisture cream as my moisturiser, used with similar frequency. I used it with beautyformulas HA moisturising serum. Found it a bit thick but did get on with it and skin was good. used for quite a while (long enough to replace a few times).\n\n\\- Then introduced spf - goodal heartleaf calming sun cream. Did not use as consistently or for as long as I should have, but frequently enough over late summer. Made my skin so beautiful in the mornings but I \\*think\\* I remember feeling a little bit more forehead texture as I put it on over time.\n\n\\- Then started using Rohto Skin Aqua (blue bottle) in like late November, because Goodal got compromised by being left open and I had it already from a YesStyle order. Used it almost daily for not very long at all, still using the SA cleanser as always, and I noticed a total explosion of tiny ccs on my forehead.\n\n\\- Stopped using Rohto \n\n\\-  Decided to go back to Neutrogena hydroboost water gel. I now find it not moisturising enough, ie I can actually feel TEWL after it dries down (I put on damp skin and use the HA serum on damp skin first). Ive stopped using the SA cleanser so often as well as of last week, fearing it’s not helping my barrier. \n\n\n\nNow it’s been over a month since I stopped skin Aqua (didn’t replace with any spf), and I’ve seen no improvement to the ccs apart from a slight initial calming maybe. I resisted the urge to introduce any actives, apart from TO lactic acid 5% like twice. \n\nIn the mornings now my skin looks glowy and plump, and ccs appear much flatter and minimal. Throughout the day though they gradually look worse, awful texture when I check at night.\n\nChatgpt suggested my skin doesn’t appreciate fatty esters and film forming occlusion. I just haven’t seen any improvement after stopping those sunscreens and the Curel, so not sure what to think. I’m also considering whether it could possibly be fungal acne? They’re on both my temples too, a little into my hairline, and don’t really itch but I can feel they’re there if that makes sense.\n\n\n\nI think maybe I should go back to Curel because it historically worked, and I think my barrier now needs it. Could this help the ccs, or will any heavier occlusion just make it worse? I feel pretty lost and anxious tbh. So scared of now making the wrong move and product hopping - but I’m really not enjoying Neutrogena anymore, it’s not enough for me now. \n\nOther details I can think of:\n\n* I use a random rotation of shampoo and conditioners, so nothing specific changed in that regard \n* Same with laundry detergents \n* I work in a kitchen where I have to wear a hairnet and a baseball cap but have done for a long time \n\nI wish I could be more specific with timelines but sadly I don’t remember things like that and foolishly didn’t make notes. Sorry for the long post!",

It is so horribly uneven to my other side of my face it’s making me very insecure and depressed. I do get botox but not often bc of the price. She said if i was able to come back every 6 months we can get it slimmed down. I probably won’t be able to go back in another 6m. She said all the clenching is making the muscle grow bigger\n\nIs there anything besides reducing stress that’s causing my clenching naturally or at home i can do to reverse this ? :( I refuse to even have my photo taken because it is so bad.

Neither oiliness nor dryness are major concerns.\n\nSkin concerns:\n\n* Some hormonal acne on face and upper back, which has largely cleared up due to Spiro but some persists, particularly closed comedones on my back and chin. Other acne sprinkled around my face at times but largely controlled.\n* Pores are looking larger these days - I know it is partially aging and cannot be helped, but I can also see that makeup \"sticks\" to stuff pooled in pores so I believe they are also clogged as well.\n* Redness at times, mainly just my nose and parts of my cheeks - this mostly just happens after I work an evening serving shift at my restaurant job, weirdly enough, but it'll get BRIGHT red at times.\n* Quite a few raised (I think keloid? All round, raised, smooth, pale bumps roughly the size of pimples, slightly bigger) scars on my upper back and chest from bad breakouts in these areas as a teen and in early 20's\n\nCurrent routine - AM:\n\n* Derm prescribed me clindamycin pads, and I started using 4% BP as a cleanser before using the pads since I read that is necessary (several times per week)\n* Spiro daily - this has been a huge help for acne!\n* Azelaic acid gel, 15% (trying for daily but have not been consistent, several times per week)\n* Purito Oat In Calming Gel Cream\n* Koolsol SPF\n* Silicone scar tape on areas with scars\n\nCurrent routine - PM:\n\n* Kose Speedy cleansing oil, and then Etude Soon Jung Whip Cleanser for double cleansing (several nights per week)\n* Red light mask 2-3 times per week\n* Purito Wonder Releaf Centella Toner\n* Tret 0.1% on back and upper chest, 0.05% on face (trying for daily, have been mostly consistent)\n* LPR Lipikar Triple Repair Moisturizing Cream - I am almost out of this and plan to get a different moisturizer for PM\n\nConcerns:\n\n* Yesterday I had a big reaction to the AM routine. I actually did it all, BP -&gt; clindamycin -&gt; azelaic acid -&gt; Purito oat gel, and then my skin freaked out. It stung, turned bright red and splotchy, and has been peeling and sensitive since then.\n   * Is it because it's winter and my skin is dryer than usual?\n   * Is it because I have actually been consistent with using tret every night recently?\n   * Is it too many actives for the AM? What can/should I cut from it?\n* I have not seen much improvement yet in my redness or pores\n\nThings I have considered adding:\n\n* As my next moisturizer, ANUA 3 Ceramide Panthenol Moisture Barrier Cream\n   * I used Naturium Barrier Bounce before and liked it, but want to combine two steps and have a barrier-focused moisturizer if I can\n* Vitamin C?\n* Peptides?\n* Paula's Choice BHA - this is the new addition I am most confident that I want to try, but in moderation\n\nI will bring these things up with my derm next time I get in, but wanted to ask here too!",

(this one specifically helps me a lot)\n\neveryone’s skin is different, and obviously formulation matters a lot too. this is in no way medical or professional advice, this is just what i think would be a good starting point for anyone trying to scale back and let their skin recover.\n\ni know getting into actives and skincare in general can be really scary as the skin changes so frequently, so i hope this helps someone who is feeling unsure or just getting started!",

I have included pics of wash day, waking up the day after, and after a full day. You can see that my hair loses so much definition and gains frizz.
