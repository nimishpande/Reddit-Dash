      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I always had deep temples and a pointed middle front - probably NW3 back then. Now, after all those years, I’m a NW3v. The shape is still the same, but the front middle has miniaturized badly. And now the crown starts to thin too.\n\nI only started treatment recently. Too late for big regrowth, probably. And if I could give two honest pieces of advice, they would be these:\n\n1) Don’t wait for the illusion to break.\n\nFor years I told myself, “It’s still fine, I can style it.” You lie to yourself, thinking the day you can’t hide it will never come. But it does. One morning, the mirror doesn’t lie anymore. If you know you wouldn’t be happy bald - act now, while you still can. What’s gone rarely comes back. Meds might stop the loss, but they won’t bring your old self back.\n\n2) Don’t confuse peace with comfort.\n\nFor a long time, I did nothing because I had someone who loved me. I thought that love would last, that it made me safe. But when that person leaves - and the hair’s gone too - you suddenly face yourself again, raw and unfiltered. It’s brutal. Don’t wait for that wake-up call.\nIf you’re not treating your loss because you feel “fine” right now - ask yourself if that peace really comes from within, or just from the people around you.",

I have fairly healthy hair with little damage, and can glide a fine-toothed comb through my wet hair right out of the shower, but it feels like a lot of gels just blast my hair's cuticle wide open.\n- Good hold - lots of gels that promise to be \"less drying\" also just have hold that sucks!\n\nI'm not super picky about it being \"no-crunch\", I love a good cast, but I think there's probably something to the crunch-free-ness that makes it more slippy.\n\nPlease help, this gel was perfect but I know there have got to be cheaper alternatives out there. 😭\n\nThe basics of my routine currently:\n- in the shower: Curl Keeper Treatment Shampoo, rinse, then Skala Mais Cachos (the blue one), rinsed about 80% out\n- gently comb to detangle\n- Curl Keeper Tweek\n- John Frieda Frizz Ease Dream Curls Mousse\n- gel (this is the step where the Ultra Defining Gel comes in)\n- section hair and brush style with the Denman (just pulling down with light tension, no brush curling or anything)\n- scrunch, air dry until about 50% dry and then diffuse the rest of the way",

These pictures were taken just a couple hours after soaking it like I do every morning, brushing, applying and scrunching product, and letting it air dry. For a little more context, I use ordinary shampoo (just on my scalp) twice a week and ordinary conditioner (on everything but my scalp) nightly.\n\n  \nI don't really have a concrete routine anymore since I've been trying different things every day, but here's what I did for the results pictured:\n\n  \n\\- Completely soaked\n\n\\- Very lightly dried with regular towel (just dabbed enough so it's not dripping everywhere)\n\n\\- Brushed it straight with a wet brush while spraying it with a spray bottle to keep it wet\n\n\\- Applied and brushed through some It's a 10 Miracle Leave-In Potion\n\n\\- Flipped head upside down, ran a palmful of LA Looks Extreme Sport through hair and scrunched all over\n\n\\- Left completely alone to air dry over my back\n\n  \nThe results of my hair feel inconsistent day-to-day. I think I have a straight bottom layer of hair, so I'll see little strands of straight/wavy hair frustratingly protruding from my curls. Frizz feels sporadic and seems to show up wherever it wants.\n\nI know I don't go above and beyond for my hair, so am I expecting too much? Is there really a normal amount of frizz in the photos? Any product or routine recommendations? Does my hair actually look okay?\n\nThanks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52gm9t8s9iuf1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dc93a593b391519e0b69e69db3a206142dbc2e8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o260614t9iuf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20b3219ad55412b6c9425e6c4f33742a5c90455b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4pb0ict9iuf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=436b80873b8bc729592243bf40bd5affb3512a5c\n\n",

That's been my routine the last 2 days.\n\nDon't know if bleaching my hair has weakened the curls as my mum has very naturally curly hair (to the point in some pictures of her it looks like she has a big Russian style hat on lol) and I do get ringlets at the sides of my head near my ears but also been having it straight for a long time. My hair is very thick and heavy so maybe a more layered style would help it's just I've been having one length cuts to keep it as long as possible. \n\nI don't use satin pillows/bonnets etc I did my hair the same yesterday (the first time I did this) and then as I know you're not really supposed to brush curly hair I thought I'd just rinse it in the shower today(proper wash was yesterday) and then redo it today as it had lost a lot of volume in the night.\n\nJust would be nice if it would be a bit more ringletty and actually keep the volume rather than losing it a little during the day.

      "title": "My little skincare and haircare routine 🩰✨🫧",
      "content": "🦋\nAbout me 🎀: My skintype is combination(oily on large areas and dry on another). I have large open pores and pigmentation. I easily get whiteheads and redheads if i don’t wash my face to reduce the oilyness. I have PCOS ⚡️and i go to gym like 2 days average in a week. I eat a lot of sugars, reduced carbs and take whey protein. I have facial hairs due to PCOS so i use  facial hair trimmer twice a week.\n\nAbout the products🦩:\n\nFacial Skincare🫧: \n1. Paknet (derma suggested)🪼: skin feels cleared and very smooth. I did a little research and got to know benzoyl peroxide reduces pimple causing bacteria. So i guess it helps reduce pimple. I gently move my hands in circular motion clockwise and upwards to let me skin absorb it and then wash. (AM PM)\n\n2. Acne oc- moisturiser (derma suggested)🪻: reduces pores and moisturise my face. Regulates oil production on face. I have seen some change in my pores and oiliness. I again apply it and move my hands upwards to let it soak in.(AM PM)\n\n3. Adapalene (derma suggested)🦥: it has benzoyl peroxide so it helps reduce pimple causing bacteria and in turn help prevent pimples. I take a very little of it and again in circular motion upwards apply it all over the skin but not on sides of nose, under/close to the eye and in sides of my mouth. Once in two days. Can irritate skin if over used.(AM -use sunscreen after)\n\n3. Moisurex-hydra (prev derma suggested) 🐚: i apply it same way , circular clockwise upwards till absorbs. Its water based so good if you have dry skin.  (AM PM)\n\n4. a. Aziderm (prev derma suggested)🐝: it reduces pigmentation, pimple and pimple marks. Also helps in detaning. My new derma hasn’t suggested it, but it works well so i’m using it. Same application - upwards and in circular motion. I use it as night as you need to save your skin from sun after these products. Use it a little like adapalene as it can irritate skin as well (PM)\n\n4. b. Clindamycin (derma suggested)🐥: no idea what it does but i have to apply it everyday in the morning. Doesnt irritate. Same application - circular, upwads) (AM PM)\n\n5. Deconstruct vitamin c serum ( self suggested) 🪽- my skin has got tanned so started using it recently. Still waiting to see if it works. Read application on the bottle(AM PM with sunscreen)\n\n5 b. Pixi toner -(nykaa gift) 👾- its good, no idea what it does but doesn’t do any harm so yeah, good so far. I apply it with cotton in circular upwards motion. (AM PM)\n\n6. Sunscreens 🌞-( all doc suggested current and prev) - uv doux is best but is tinted. It feels heavy so i will get the non silicone based on from uv doux. Others are fine. (Every two hours under sun, 2x pinky finger size)\n\n7. Vaseline (self suggested) 👄- i have pigmented lips, used it daily whenever i felt my lips have gotten dry, started observing them getting pink and less dark.\n\n8. Meds ( derma suggested) 💊- green one is omega - good for hair and skin. Black one is antioxidant, and peach one is for pimple reduction. I take them everyday\n\n9.shatavari juice (self suggested)🍶- i have pcos, so i take it every day after meal at night, helps with pcos and inflammation i guess. Im using everything so dont know how exactly is this working. I have to drink it for another month or so.\n\n10. Medicube collagen night mask, vlcc detan mask, detan scrub (self suggested)🎭- once a week for tanning.\n\n11. Turmeric and red sandal (self suggested)🎭- got them recently, good for face, clears , depigments brightens. I use it twice a week, it leaves yellowish color, so use it at night.\n\nHaircare:\n1. Ordinary 👩‍🦰: (self suggested): reduces hairfall and dandruff. Works like magic. I have seen hair fall reduction and new baby hairs (PM )\n\n2. Serum (self suggested) 🪮- makes hairs manageable inturn less breakage. After wash or whenever im using heat.\n\n3.  Soul flower serum (self suggested) 🫤- unsure, but i would bot recomment too many stuff ordinary is best.\n\n4. Soulflower oils 🛢️- (self suggested) - best ones for hair growth and thickness. (An hour before hairwash)\n\n\nAll these products are what i use, not suggesting that they work like magic or will work for everyone, but my face is now pimple free and when i touch my skin now, smooth and soft🥰. With PCOS your skin, mood and everything becomes twice complicated😅, i’ll aways suggest doctors when you think skincare and health🔎. If you are in bangalore and looking for the doctor, i have some names. I’m can help you🙃.\n\n\nThanks and have a great skin and hair ♥️🌸\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

My doctor hasn't prescribed me an antibiotic before tret to cure the current painful bumps.

Didn’t really do anything for odor.\n\t•\tDr. Teal’s Eucalyptus Deodorant – smells nice, but the baking soda and essential oils burned my skin.\n\t•\tSchmidt’s Sandalwood &amp; Citrus – easily the worst reaction. The baking soda, coconut oil, and fragrance oils made my skin peel and itch.\n\nI’m starting to think my skin just can’t handle baking soda, magnesium, or strong essential oils, but I still want to stay away from aluminum and harsh chemicals.\n\nHas anyone found a truly gentle natural deodorant that actually works for odor without darkening or irritating your armpits? Ingredient breakdowns or product recs would really help.\n\n⸻\n\nWould you like me to make it sound a bit more like a vent (casual, Reddit-style) or slightly more polished to encourage detailed replies?",

To cut straight to the chase i have hair down to my  hips, can't really hold shape , according to my hair style \"lot or hair but the strand is thin\". I've really wanted bangs for a long time , i thought it be cute especially when i hace it put up since my face is a basketball but the problem is my hairline. It's giving first stages of balding, not fully gone but very rare , that side doesn't grow past the half of my face and my hair lady said it won't look good , not only becouse of that but also my it would make me look aged. Last time i was there I've had her cut my ends and even it out a bit , i like the length and discuss this with her and the best she did was take a \"V\" and cut it down to my chin then styled it. It was fine but not quite , it looked pretty weird since it was the only part of my hair that was styled and looked unfinished but I'm not mad at her or anything since i totally understand my hair and face are hard to work with also I'm horrible at verbalizing anything at all so getting the wrong message from me does happend quite often. Does anyone have suggestions or deal with the same thing? I don't feel comfortable putting up pictures but if necessary i will. I just don't know what to do and I'm just tired of my eternal middle line.",

      "content": "Hi, I’ve never posted to this group but you all seem to be knowledgeable about DHT so here goes. I’m a female on TRT (along with other hormones) because of perimenopause. I’ve been on TRT alone in the past and had to quit due to hair loss. This time on TRT I started oral Minox prior to TRT (I’m also on Spironolactone for acne, been on that for years) and the Minox was working wonders for my hair but then I added T back in and after 2 months started losing hair despite being on Minox so I added in finasteride and it worked, my DHT is now below 5 however I’m still losing hair. I’m seeing comments/posts about DHT can still be on the scalp and cause hair loss, I’m also using Nizoral shampoo a couple times a week. Is there anything else you recommend to eliminate the scalp DHT? I’m trying my hardest not to come off the T because I felt like shit the last time I had to hence why I went back on it. Granted… it could be other things causing my hair loss (other hormones out of whack) but I’ve lost hair to T in the past so that’s why I’m trying to cover all my bases. Thanks. ",
