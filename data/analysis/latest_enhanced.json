      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I have been having a big issue with frizz for quite a while and I was wondering if anyone would be able to tell me why/give me some tips on how to fix it. My curls are usually shiny and decently defined in the front and then the back is almost always not defined and frizzy. The back of my hair seems to be more coarse as well. My routine is as follows:\n\n1. Shampoo with Tresemme Shampoo (it’s not always the same type but lately I’ve been liking the Keratin Smooth one in the red bottle). I use a silicone scalp brush to make sure I get rid of as much residue as possible from my scalp\n\n2. Condition with Tresemme conditioner as well (usually either the Rich Moisture one or the Bouncy Curls one). I comb through the conditioner with a wide tooth comb and then i usually do a loose braid and let the conditioner sit for a couple minutes\n\n3. For styling, I usually like to use LUS brands step 3 All-in-One leave in but I am currently out of that so for a while now I have been using Cantù Coconut Curling Cream. I use a brush to saturate it all in my hair. I use a microfibre towel to scrunch out excess water and then I use praying hands to apply medium hold gel (most of the time it’s Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel but recently I have been trying the Olaplex number 10 gel). \n\n4. I scrunch my hair again with the microfibre towel and air dry until almost fully dry and then I diffuse until it’s completely dry. After it’s dry, I add the Argon Oil of Morocco penetrating oil, scrunching in and loosening the cast of the gel. \n\nEven after all this, I almost always end up with frizzy hair in the back. I even try to take smaller strands in the back and spray them with more water and make sure they’re totally saturated with product but nothing seems to help. I can never get even definition around my head. Any help is welcome 💔",

I have changed my skincare routine for 3 years also.\n\nThe itch increased throughout the day and looked like a red rash on my forehead so I picked up a sulfur wash, suspecting it was fungal acne. The wash helped calm the itch but the spots are still persistent throughout the month, with more spots coming and the overall texture of my forehead feels bumpy.\n\nNow red dots have come out of the spots and I’m very anxious not knowing what it could be (fungal, demodex mites, dermatitis, …?). Any advice would be appreciated!",

      "content": "Hey guys just wanted to share the products that worked for me because I used this sub a lot in my skincare journey. I’ve also attached before and after pictures\n\nAround June of this year I damaged my skin barrier and started breaking out like crazy to the point where 2-3 pimples would pop up every day even when I used only gentle face wash. I have acne prone skin but somehow managed to keep it under control since 2022. But the damaged skin barrier triggered a lot of cystic and hormonal acne that I couldn’t control. After visiting multiple dermats and trying so many products this is the routine that finally helped me heal my acne and get rid of the scars.\n\nPrior to this I used to try products on my own. I used many products from the ordinary. Now I’m only using Indian pharmacy products that have honestly been my holy grail. I’ve gotten these products from my dermat but you can get them from any pharmacy without a prescription as well.\n\nThis is everything I’ve used and the procedures I’ve done to fix my skin:\n\nHealing skin barrier: \n\nAfter my skin barrier was damaged the first thing I was adviced to do was to stop using any products on my face. I did this for about 1.5 months until my skin stopped looking red and irritated. I only used face wash and moisturiser morning and night. \n\n* Gorgeous face cleansing gel- morning and night \n* Acne moist cream- morning and night\n\nFixing acne and marks: \n\nAfter my barrier was repaired I first did a microdermabrasion session to get rid of clogged pores and extract existing whiteheads and blackheads. This was the routine I used afterwards: \n\n* Gorgeous face cleansing gel - morning and night \n* Aziderm 10% - keep it on for 2-3 hours in the morning and wash off \n* Golite cream- every night for acne scars \n* Acne moist cream- morning and night\n* I have also done 3 rounds of microdermabrasion treatments with a month gap between each. MD really helped with unclogging pores and fading dark spots.\n\nHope this helps. I spent a lot of money and visited 3 dermats to finally figure it out. My skin isn’t perfect and I still have a few clogged pores and closed comedones but I’ve made a lot of progress! Hope this makes it easier for y’all!",

      "title": "1.5 Months on Tretinoin (0.025%): Smooth Sailing &amp; My \"No Purge\" Strategy for Beginners!",
      "content": "\n\nHie everyone, I just hit the 1.5 month mark using Tretinoin, and I am honestly still in shock. I started with 0.025% Tretinoin (Tretin 0.025) and, I have to knock on wood here, Seriously, no skin drying, no irritation, no burning, no awful purge. I think I might actually be God's favorite child, hahah!\n\nJokes apart, I've been on a long skincare journey. I've tried every active under the sun (kojic acid, glycolic acid, etc.), but nothing has given me this glassy, flawless, glowy, smooth skin like Tretinoin has. I seriously wish I'd started sooner.\n\nFor context, I have extremely oily skin and also deal with hyperhidrosis, but focusing on barrier health and diet seemed to be the winning combo.\n\nMy Winning Routine &amp; Key Factors\n\n• Amount: Use only a pea-sized amount for your whole face.\n\n * Application: I've been strictly using the sandwich method (moisturizer, Tret, moisturizer). \n\n* The Pressing Technique: DON’T rub it into your skin, PRESS it into your skin! I found that gently pressing the product in is WAY less irritating for me.\n\n * Moisturizer MVP: The Dot &amp; Key Barrier Repair Moisturiser has been an absolute game-changer. It's truly a godsend for barrier protection.\n\n* Eye Safety: Don’t get it in or too close to your eyes, as it can cause excessive eye dryness. I counter this by using gel drops before bed.\n\n * Internal Support: I've been focusing on a clean diet, packed with lots of fresh veggies and fruit, which definitely helps my skin from the inside out.\n\nI'll be continuing this routine consistently until mid-December to complete a full three-month run.\n\nA Word of Caution: Tretinoin Can Be Fickle!\nWhile my start has been great, I want to emphasize a serious point for everyone in the community. Tretinoin can be a very fickle product!\n\nThe possible downsides are often very dependent on a person's skin and are not necessarily universal. Tretinoin can cause skin sensitivity, redness, eye problems, perioral dermatitis, and lots of other things.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, 1.5 months is a very short amount of time. A lot of people don’t experience these issues until several months or even years into their Tret journey. That is to say, stay vigilant about keeping a healthy skin barrier and monitoring the condition of your skin closely. I love what Tret has done for me, but it demands respect!\n\nAdvice for Tretinoin Beginners: What I Learned: \n\nIf you're hesitant or scared about starting Tretinoin, here is the regimen and advice that worked for me:\n\nTLDR: My Top 3 Lessons\n\n * Start slow!! When I say slow, I mean SLOW, slower than you think you need to.\n * Simplify your routine and cut out all other actives. Let Tretinoin do the work.\n * Don’t overwash to keep your skin barrier intact and hydrated.\nUsage and Application Tips\n * Amount: Use only a pea-sized amount for your whole face. I dot it all over first, and then gently spread it in.\n * The Pressing Technique: DON’T rub it into your skin, PRESS it into your skin! I found that gently pressing the product in is WAY less irritating for me.\n * Eye Safety: Don’t get it in or too close to your eyes, as it can cause excessive eye dryness. I counter this by using gel drops before bed.\n\nGeneral Tretinoin Commandments\n\n * Waxing Warning: For gods sake, make sure to take a week off of it before waxing brows (or any facial hair). You will regret it otherwise!\n\n * Night Use Only: Tretinoin is very drying and irritating, so only use it at night.\n\n * SPF Mandatory: Wear SPF in the morning (and reapply!).\n\n * Moisturize: Give your skin a break whenever it needs it. Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!\n\n * Moisturizer Recommendations: If you need heavy-duty hydration, I recommend CeraVe. If you can get your hands on it, definitely try Vanicream—it’s excellent for sensitive and compromised barriers!\n\nConclusion\n\nFor me, the key was ramping up usage very slowly and keeping Tretinoin as the only active ingredient.\n\nHas anyone else had a smooth start like this that later changed? I'm curious to hear your long-term experiences! \n",

After rinsing my conditioner out it's all plastered to my skull/face. I'll try using a wide tooth comb to maintain curl clumps and get it to stop sticking to my head/give it some lift at the roots, but it always ends up being obvious which directions I combed it in, and the roots will be a little straightened out. If I try scrunching it bunches my hair into different obvious \"zones\" and exposes my scalp more. I've also tried shaking out my curls but it always looks weird and frizzy that way too. The shaking out bit might work better with gel but I struggle to get it to disperse when I scrunch because there's so little length and I end up with the \"zones\" again...\n\nI'm at a loss, any tips are super appreciated!

      "content": "Hi! So a new Chinese friend of mine is almost 40 years old, but she looks like she’s sixteen (and that’s not even an exaggeration). Whilst she has amazing skin, it’s not immune to blemishes and irritation, which means whatever she is doing to maintain the best version of her skin, she’s doing a freaking phenomenal job.\n\nShe’s told me she’s tried sooo many different avenues and these are the main findings she’s concluded to.\n\nSPF ALWAYS. NO TOUCHING THE SKIN WITH UR DIRTY NAILS. Face masks all the time. (She’s got the budget)\n\nNow this is where I wanted to hear other people’s opinions and stories…\n\nAfter I told her I use primarily Korean skin care, she said I need to switch to western ones. Why? Well because supposedly Korean skin care whilst good, is rather basic and good only if you get treatments often and then use it to maintain the skins health. BUT that western skin care is better for building up the quality and state of it, because it’s been around for much longer, and their clinical research has more backing. That’s as far as I know on that part, she’s of course not a skincare guru but rather an enthusiast (who’s cracked the code for her skin).\n\nSo two main important components she recommends is vitamin C in the morning (always concluded with spf), and retinol at night. Then two different kinds of moisturizers for morning and night. She swears by La Roche Posay Cicaplast B5 pro mask, she says it’s the only one she wears now.\n\nNow I was reeling after this conversation because I had the impression Korean skincare was better?! But apparently not? Depends on the products ofc and what type of skin you have (Japanese skincare for example is best suited for their type is skin type).\n\nWhat do you guys know about this comparison? Do you balance western vs eastern skincare in your own routines? I feel like I’ve had rose tinted glasses for Korean skincare. 🩵",

It kinda feels weird because I feel so insecure abt it especially the marks that just won't go away also I've already visited a dermat i spent like sm on skincare that she recommended but still ntg works \n\nAlso my skin is prone to cc and papular acne near my nose like close to my eye area but since I've started tret it's under control otherwise that was a headache,i have combination skin and like my T zone is prone to these bumps \n\nI’m already on tretinoin (since July) and using niacinamide + sunscreen daily, but these new pimples keep popping up and healing into dark spots. I’m guessing it might be hormonal, but not 100% sure.\n\nIf anyone’s gone through something similar what actually helped calm your breakouts and fade the marks?

I have completely straight hair that gets oily the day after showering, this is the first time I've had it cut about an inch in length on the top. Shorter on the sides. I've never used hair products or styled it ever.\n\n- What products will help it lay flat?\n- I towel dried it after cutting, bad idea. If I leave it wet and put a hat or wrap or something on it, will it eventually lie flat?\n- Could a barber thin it or shape it or fade it into a more appealing shape? My friend tried to get it as even as possible, but they have zero training beyond shaving their own head.\n\nAssistance appreciated! Right now I'm debating on cutting it shorter, wearing a hat till it grows longer, or finding a barber that can figure out how to shape it better if that is even possible.",

      "content": "generally my skin is pretty clear and my skincare regimen is just the cerave hydrating cleanser or the cerave salicylic acid cleanser plus ponds lotion and spf. about 2 weeks ago i started getting random deep pimples pimples popping up so i used benzoyl peroxide to spot treat them. after a few days i noticed a few more areas start to look like a pimple was coming so i decided to use benzoyl peroxide on my whole face for a few days, morning and night. i didnt have any problems with it but 3 days ago i spent all afternoon outside. i had spf on and reapplied after 2 or 3 hours. i felt fine until the next morning when i put on my regular moisturizer and spf and my skin was red and burning. also, i noticed some areas, mainly around my eyes seem to be sunburnt. i quickly washed it off with the cerave hydrating cleanser and only reapplied my ponds moisturizer. by the end of the workday my face still felt really dry and tight so i put on more moisturizer but it didn’t feel like it was hydrating enough. yesterday i went out and bought the cerave intensive moisturizer as well as the la roche posay triple repair cream. i’ve only been using the cerave one and last night i slugged with vaseline but my skin still felt dry and tight during the night. woke up this morning and rinsed my face with water and put on more of the cerave intensive moisturizer. does anyone have any recommendations on if anything else would be more soothing/help repair my skin quicker or is what im using fine and i just need to give it some more time? should i be using a cleanser at all or just water? also, how long would you expect it to take for my skin to be back to normal?",

Even without the back of head cowlicks, it’s persistently frizzy and only holds strong curls on the day I wash it (sometimes I can revive them by spraying with water, but I think I’m allergic to something in the tap water where I live, so I’ve been avoiding that as it makes my scalp itch). I also feel like the longest layer is weighed down and doesn’t curl up as much as the rest? But I would really like my hair to look more put together, ideally camouflaging the awkwardly short bits as they grow out and reducing the overall frizz that seems to like the sides/back of my hair. (Should I cut it? Can I just put products on it? I don’t even know lol)\n\nIn other words, im tired of my hair looking messy when I’ve just washed it!!! (Like in these pics!)\n\nCurrently my routine includes: Neutrogena TSal shampoo (not my fav ever but guys im desperate), a random tea tree oil conditioner I got at aldi, and one of three leave in conditioner products (today for these pics was a mousse by not your mother’s curls, but I also have a Shea moisture foam and miss jessie’s multicultural curls cream in rotation). And I 99% of the time just air dry my hair\n\nMy hair is medium thick, pretty low porosity, and the area where I live has hard water &amp; high humidity, in case those factors impact any recommendations for products/routine. I want to keep the routine low maintenance (even diffusing to dry is a big ask for me on a regular basis lol) but would appreciate advice!!! I was never really taught how to properly care for curls, so it’s all been trial and error. thanks in advance!!",
