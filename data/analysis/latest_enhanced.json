      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

It was a a few years long journey to figure it all out. Curlyhair helped me jump start my learning and now I’m just happy that I feel like I finally got there and I’m accepting my not perfectly defined hair. I got my first curly hair cut this year and it helped a lot. Thanks all and I’m glad y’all exist. \n\nMy routine: I use Prose Shampoo, Prose Conditioner, and then squeeze my hair out and then put Prose Hair crème. And I usually try to air dry, but waiting 2.5 hours is not always fun. These pictures are with only those products and air drying; sometimes I put in a bit of curl defining crème since my hair is rather fine and doesn’t do well with heavy products. ",

So clearly AHA alone isn't strong enough but that salicylic acid cleanser was way too strong. Anyone have product recommendations for me? It doesn't have to be from Ulta, it can be from anywhere. Is this cosrx toner good? I know sebaceous filaments can't ever fully go away and they'll always come back but they literally protrude out of my skin and make my makeup look all bumpy. Thank you!!!",

I also have pimples on my shoulders, upper back, and sometimes in the hair at the back of my neck.\n\nI mostly stay indoors, though I sometimes go out for work or errands. Currently, I don’t use any face washes or creams because I want a routine that’s affordable, simple, and doesn’t take too much time.\n\n**Photos:**\n\n\\- I’ll be sharing pics of both cheeks and my forehead (not my full face). The images are taken in bright light, but in indoor lighting the scars, marks, and tanning look more noticeable.\n\n**My goals:**\n\n* Reduce or remove red areas, dark spots, and pigmentation\n* Fade both old and newer acne scars\n* Prevent new breakouts (face, shoulders, neck)\n* Keep my routine basic and on a low budget\n\n**Extra info:**\n\n* Skin is oily, especially forehead and nose\n* New pimples appear less often now\n* Not sensitive, but avoid products that burn\n* Pimples also on shoulders, upper back, around neck/hairline\n* I have used benzoyl and tretinoin. Both works, but acne keep coming back. benzoyl did peel of skin, it's irritating, but I didn't monitor much, so don't know if it removed acne scars.\n\n**Product questions:**\n\n* I’m planning to buy the beminimalist Niacinamide 10% Face Serum (10ml to try first). Would it suit oily, acne-prone skin like mine? How should I use it, and how often?\n* And also thinking of buying a vitamin C serum for dark spots.\n* If you notice pigmentation or uneven tone in the images, which cream or serum should I use for that (and for tanning/dullness)?\n* I don’t want to go for brands or creams with a shady background or too much marketing hype. Please suggest genuinely good options.\n\n**What I need:**\n\n* Daily routine, max 2-3 steps (just cleanser, serum, moisturizer or SPF is ideal)\n* Affordable, India available options\n* Quick tips to reduce redness before events\n* **How to tackle pigmentation, dark spots, acne scars with budget products (if OTC works, or when to see a dermatologist)**\n* Suggestions for pigmentation/tan and dark spots (please mention 2-3 product options in different price ranges so I can pick based on my budget)\n\n**Thanks a lot for reading!**\n\nAny honest, practical advice, routines, or product suggestions are appreciated. I hope I’ve covered all details. Ask if you need more context.",

I am in a place where I just want my natural hair and I want to make my hair as healthy as possible. However I’m stuck with this awful color from what my last purple faded to. I can’t really afford to get professional hair cuts every few months at the moment to help my hair grow faster and just grow it out that way. So Is it a terrible idea to dye my hair dark brown (the closest to my natural hair color) and then leave it alone? My concern with this is the top half of my hair is grown out and my natural color and I don’t want to ruin what little progress I’ve made, but also what if the colors where it cuts off looks completely different? I don’t know enough about the color wheel and stuff like this. I would try to just dye the ends of my hair but I don’t know how to color match and can’t afford a salon or professional at the moment. Please any advice would be so appreciated I want my spark back, if you have any questions feel free to ask. Thank you &lt;3 ",

There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Okay so, it wasn't until I was 15 that my hair began to curl out of nowhere. I'm 26 now and I still haven't figured out what is it that my hair needs. I have a LOT of hair, and it has different textures. It curls a lot at the neck and also the texture in that section is drastically different from the rest, frizzier and dryer. Then the top layers always want to curl after I wash it but they become very subtle waves by the next day. Here the hair feels frizzy but not as much as the neck. Lastly, the crown area and the layers in between refuse to curl (I'm guessing that my hair is too heavy).\n\nWhen it comes to my hair routine, I've tried a lot of things since I discovered the curly girl method. I used to be more experimental at first: no shampoo for months (very bad idea), plopping, trying shampoos without sulfates nor silicones, extending the days between washes... I definitely saw some results at some point but I came to the conclusion that it was all too much effort and nowadays I don't have the time to do all that. As of now, I wash my hair every 3-4 days and I mainly use shampoo and conditioner, nothing else. I never use any heat, I let my hair air dry and I remove the excess water with a tshirt instead of a normal towel. In between washes, refresh my hair with water and comb it with a wide comb. And most nights I braid my hair but I doubt that does much since my hair is layered and isn't long enough to stay in the braid (I also move a lot when I sleep), and I sleep with a silk pillowcase.\n\nOn top of that, I don't even know what's the porosity of my hair and if whether it's thin or thick (I just know I have a lot of it so I always thought I had what people call \"thick hair\"). I'm trying not to comb my hair so much which I find challenging bc I feel like I need to comb it. It does get tangled a lot tbf, more than it used to. And lastly, I feel like my hair rejects any styling product, if I use more than usual I gets this stiff texture and it just looks bar, but if I try to use the recommended amount it either makes my hair flat or it's as if I haven't used anything. I feel like the less I do to it the more it curls but then, said curls don't hold and my hair ends up looking like a frizzy mess. \n\nAnyways, I think that's all the information I can provide in order to receive some proper advice. Pleaseeee I'm quite literally desperate!!!! \n\n(The first two attached pictures are from last year when it curled more easily and was longer and the last two are from this year after I cut my hair quite short and tends to dry flatter)\n",

I used to live in one town where this guy cut my hair like the top picture. I've now moved, but everywhere I go, I keep getting haircuts like the lower two pictures, even though I try to describe what I want and I even bring the picture. I also seem to end up always getting layers on the back long part of the hair that are like curtains, very solid, choppy bits and a kind of \"helmet\" of hair on the top, rather than layers being smoothly blended like the guy in my old town used to do- I think he said something about him using an \"angling\" technique but other people didn't?\n\nI also always ask for it to be able to be tied back, but the most recent one has lots of very short, heavier bits on top of my head which are really getting to me in sensory terms when I move (I'm autistic). I always seem to end up in a cycle of, go with picture and try to explain what I want, eventually stop explaining because I'm realising the more they try to fix it the more hair I'm losing, act happy and give a big tip because they seem like nice people and I don't want to upset them, and then go home and feel upset.\n\nCan anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? How do I need to describe things to get my old haircut? Or do I just need to accept that the guy in my old town was a fluke and dreading haircuts and then feeling terrible after is normal?",
