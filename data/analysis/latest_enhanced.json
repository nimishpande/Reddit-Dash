      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi, 3 days ago I started using Nizoral 2% on my chest for what I thought was fungal acne.\nThe first picture is from three days ago. I had small, superficial pustules with a red inflammatory halo around them. They weren’t itchy or painful.\n\nAfter about 72 hours (using Nizoral for 3 days), I noticed an increased number of lesions, as you can see in the photos. Now I’m starting to question whether it was fungal acne in the first place, and whether I should continue using Nizoral for 7–14 days to be sure it’s not effective, or stop right now.\n\nDoes this look like fungal or bacterial folliculitis to you?\n\nI’d also like to point out the small skin-colored bumps visible in the photos. I’m not sure if they’re closed comedones, but I’m certain the pustules arise from those bumps when they get inflamed.\n\nOther information that might be useful:\n- My skin doesn’t itch or feel painful (neither before nor now), and it doesn’t feel tight.\n- I work out 5 days a week, so that definitely contributes to the folliculitis. I switched to high-quality polyester fabric to help wick away sweat as much as possible.\n- I eat only healthy food.\n- My dermatologist recommended a chlorhexidine wash, but it wasn’t effective (I had been using it before starting Nizoral, so the results you see in the “before” photo were after using chlorhexidine).\n\nThis thing makes me really self-conscious and it bothers me a lot. I’ve been dealing with it for years. I really hope you can give me some advice. Thanks.",

This makes the lamination appointment not even worth it since with mascara and daily make up removal it makes the effect go away faster.\n\nWhat should i do? Or should i just let this beauty standard of unrealistic long eyelashes just go from my head. I expect to wake up in the morning like that when in reality is just because i see it everywhere on social media and now i want it too bcs my eyes feel naked.\n\nIf u do go to the salon and put eyelash extansions, do you just do it forever?

      "content": "Hi all! I have oily skin and have recently been dealing with a lot of acne and congestion (small bumps, no redness) on my cheeks and chin. It's been super frustrating as I've seen a few estheticians for help as well as simplifying my routine down to the very basics. I've been doing some research on my current skincare products in case something I'm using isn't helping/making it worse and a lot came up about the Cerave Gentle Foaming Cleanser. Apparently, a lot of people experience their acne worsening due to this specific product. I've been trying to do some research on new cleansers to look at including the Vanicream gentle cleanser. Has anyone with similar problems to mine found success with Vanicream? Or if anyone has other cleanser recommendations? I'd also love to hear if anyone has found other products that have worked well for them too!!\n\nTLDR: Dealing with acne and congestion, need new cleanser + any other product reccomendations that have helped others with similar skin problems.",
