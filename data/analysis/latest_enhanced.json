I’m trying to find the right products (&amp; routine) for me without trying a bunch because I just can’t afford it. Trial and error is totally part of the deal , but I’d love to get recommendations and avoid at least some heartache and unnecessary expense!\n\nPics for reference:\n\n1 - 4 are decent hair days \n\n5 &amp; 6 are styles but not good hair days\n\n7 is day 3 or 4 after brushing it before showering \n\nMe:\n\n\\- nonbinary, they/them pronouns (not a woman/girl/etc).\n\n\\- disabled and chronically ill with a weak neck, so I can’t tilt my head back to diffuse, do everything upside down, or do my whole routine standing\n\n\\- newly curly; my hair became wavy/curly a little less than 2 years ago\n\nMy hair:\n\n\\- Mid-back length \n\n\\- 2b/3b (I think)\n\n\\- medium/high porosity\n\n\\- medium/fine and medium density\n\n\\- smooth hair besides damage, very little coarseness/strand texture/hold\n\n\\- mixed healthiness and textures due to hormonal shifts; split ends and in need of a trim\n\nEnvironment:\n\n\\- I live in a high desert environment but use humidifiers inside and WFH, so low/medium (30% - 50%) humidity most of the time and then very low (like 15%) when I’m out. \n\n\\- very hard water (\\~120)\n\nCurrent products:\n\n\\- NYM Tahitian gardenia &amp; mango butter shampoo &amp; conditioner\n\n\\- NYM curl talk leave-in conditioner\n\n\\- NYM curl talk styling products that I use in different combos (obviously not all together), including flash freeze, hold, and spray gels, cream, mouses, and foam\n\n\\- NYM beach babe salt spray\n\nRoutine (\\~2x/week):\n\n\\- dry brush before showering\n\n\\- lightly scrub scalp &amp; then brush through shampoo\n\n\\- rinse\n\n\\- deep scrub scalp with shampoo\n\n\\- rinse\n\n\\- condition midlengths to ends thoroughly, brushing through; let sit while I shower the rest of me (\\~5 mins)\n\n\\- rinse\n\n\\- add leave-in while still soaking wet, brushing through &amp; scrunching\n\n\\- add styling products while still pretty wet, brush through, style, and scrunch lots; add water as necessary\n\n\\- air dry (sometimes I diffuse)\n\nI often try to refresh on day two to no avail and end up in braids.\n\nI use silk pillowcases but can never get a bonnet to stay on. \n\nWhat I’ve noticed:\n\n\\- creams seem too heavy\n\n\\- the flash freeze gel and mousse are sticky and hard for me to manage; the gel is okay when I get it into soaking hair but the mousse always seems heavy\n\n\\- the foam honestly works best, but I tend to use it on day 2 or as a touch up and I don’t like how it makes my hair feel\n\n\\- nothing ever holds all day\n\n\\- hover diffusing seems to do nothing other than speed up drying, but the finished look is the same \n\n\\- diffusing adds volume but messes up my curl pattern\n\n\\- roots are always flat\n\n\\- my hair is dry and frizzy by end of day and oily at the roots on day three\n\nI’ve tried a couple shea moisture products, all too heavy. \n\nPlease help!! And please be kind. ",

Looking for a moisturiser to use here, please suggest the best one.\n\nResults-\n\nCleanser: i’ve been using for about 6-7 months now and i dont know if it works but i have noticed that oil production has reduced in my T-zone. It has never broken my skin out or anything harsh like that so I’ll probably repurchase it and continue using it.\n\nSunscreen: Been using this since the start of summer this year so around March, and I quite like it. Again I honestly don’t know if it’s doing anything because I have fair skin with redness on my cheeks 😭. But I haven’t tanned so i guess it’s working? It’s light-weight, blends into my skin quick, no white-cast, and the texture is thin, not thick at all, hasn’t caused any breakouts so I have recently repurchased it and will continue using it.\n\nToner: Just bought it a week ago, no clue if it’s working or not, hasn’t caused a breakout, let’s see if it reduces pores as it claims. Will update in the comments if I notice improvements.\n\nSerum: Definitely noticed a difference from the first week itself, I used 5% for like 6 months and it hardly did anything so I started using 10%, I can see the redness reducing and other people have noticed it too so i’ll keep using this one.\n\nTLDR: Sharing my review of these 4 products &amp; Requesting y’all to drop some advice/comments about my routine, what other serums I can try to reduce redness and acne scars, and please suggest a good moisturiser for my skin type.",

      "content": "Hello Reddit! I’m a 27 year old female with terrible acne! I’ve had acne a lot over the years and have tried lots of different products and treatments to help with it. But just recently, over the last few months, my skin has gotten much worse. This is the worst it’s been in my whole life and I have no idea what’s making it so bad. I just got my iud taken out and switched over the birth control 2 weeks ago but that doesn’t seem to have helped at all either. I don’t think it’s making it worse either, it’s really just stayed the same. I tried using Tretinoin cream and that works for a little bit but then it makes my skin so dry it flakes off, so then I just have flaky acne instead. My gynecologist prescribed me metronidazole gel for it but I don’t know if it’ll work or not. Can anyone one this subreddit help me figure out what’s going on with my skin and maybe give me some suggestions for a good skincare routine to help with it? Thank you all for reading!!\n\nTldr - bad acne ouch any suggestions?",

Like most other people when I was younger and didn’t know any better I used to think my hair that was just the curse of curly hair but lately now that I’ve started taking care of my curls my moms been unbearable. I always try to convince her not to brush my hair but she keeps insisting and forcing me (and the result is always…bad like I have a bush on my hair bad and it’s so embarrassing). Like I remember this one time for a party I begged my mom not to brush my hair and she made fun of me for liking the “noodles” on my head and forcibly brushed it out and turned it into a frizzy ball of puff (humid climate + short hair was a recipe for disaster).\n\nI guess what makes it worse is she also has wavy/curly hair but when my moms hair is brushed out it just looks slightly more straight but mine becomes all puffy and horrible looking :((( Lately she’s also been telling me to get my hair rebonded again(which hurt case it took me two years to even grow back to shoulder length cause of shrinkage) and keeps telling me off for making it unhealthy by not brushing it but also compared me to a cousin who takes care of her curly hair??? (which she doesn’t let me do???) I guess I’m just asking for advice cause I’m at the end of my rope here.\n\nRoutine: At home nothing unfortunately :(( but at least college I just use a leave in + gel and that works pretty well",

I’d really appreciate some guidance from people who’ve actually been through this.\n\nShort background:\nGrowing up, I didn’t really take care of my skin — lots of sun exposure, stress, and inconsistent habits. Over time, my face became darker and uneven compared to my hands/legs, which still look closer to my original skin tone.\nNow I’m fixing things slowly and properly.\n\n(I’m also posting a leg photo for reference so you can see the tone difference.)\n\nCurrent routine (doctor recommended):\n\nGentle face wash\n\nBrightening / depigmentation serum\n\nBarrier-repair moisturizer\n\nSunscreen (this is where I need help)\n\n\nMy skin type:\nNormal to sensitive. Not naturally oily, but some products make my skin look shiny.\n\nMain question (sunscreen):\nWhich would be better for my skin?\n\n1. La Shield Lite SPF 40+ PA+++\n\n\n2. La Shield Fisico Matte Gel\n\n\n\nI’ve read mixed reviews. I even saw one girl mention that she experienced white cast, which made me a bit confused. Since sunscreen is something I’ll use daily, I want to choose carefully.\n\nAlso asking for advice 🙏:\n\nHow can I gradually get back my original skin tone (face matching body)?\n\nAny habits, ingredients, or mistakes I should be careful about?\n\nAnything you personally did that actually worked long-term?\n\n\nGoal:\nHealthy, even-toned skin nothing extreme, just consistency and patience ✨\n\nThank you so much for reading. I’d really value your honest experiences 💛\n",

I’d really appreciate some guidance from people who’ve actually been through this.\n\nShort background:\nGrowing up, I didn’t really take care of my skin  lots of sun exposure, stress, and inconsistent habits. Over time, my face became darker and uneven compared to my hands/legs, which still look closer to my original skin tone.\nNow I’m fixing things slowly and properly.\n\n(I’m also posting a leg photo for reference so you can see the tone difference.)\n\nCurrent routine (doctor recommended):\n\nGentle face wash\n\nBrightening / depigmentation serum\n\nBarrier-repair moisturizer\n\nSunscreen (this is where I need help)\n\n\nMy skin type:\nNormal to sensitive. Not naturally oily, but some products make my skin look shiny.\n\nMain question (sunscreen):\nWhich would be better for my skin?\n\n1. La Shield Lite SPF 40+ PA+++\n\n\n2. La Shield Fisico Matte Gel\n\n\n\nI’ve read mixed reviews. I even saw one girl mention that she experienced white cast, which made me a bit confused. Since sunscreen is something I’ll use daily, I want to choose carefully.\n\nAlso asking for advice 🙏:\n\nHow can I gradually get back my original skin tone (face matching body)?\n\nAny habits, ingredients, or mistakes I should be careful about?\n\nAnything you personally did that actually worked long-term?\n\n\nGoal:\nHealthy, even-toned skin \nnothing extreme, just consistency and patience ✨\n\nThank you so much for reading. I’d really value your honest experiences 💛",

Test one such viral, award-winning exfoliator and ended up with chemical burns (red, inflamed skin in patches, peeling, constant burning, extreme dryness). I won’t name the product as I run a brand myself, and I don’t want this to be seen as some sly form of marketing. But since I’ve been working to repair my barrier, I’m sharing some tips that are working for me - \n\n1. Stopped all skincare &amp; just sticking to Bioderma Atoderm face wash (as its mild). Avoiding sun exposure as much &amp; if I do step out, I apply Rivela Lite (basic, drugstore one that works for me) \n2. Need to restore ceramides &amp; lipids so I apply a thick layer of Physio gel (again, a no-BS drugstore barrier repair cream i swear by) AM &amp; PM \n3. This one’s been a trick chatgpt suggested which has worked wonders - sealing moisture with a layer of petroleum jelly at night - really helps speed up the repair. \n\nI’m 7 days in &amp; its honestly getting a lot better.
