      "content": "This might be a stupid post to make but I don’t know who else to ask. Whenever I go to the hairdresser I ask for rounded layers and lots of them. Recently I went to get a proper curly cut (only person in town who does it) after searching once again. I cannot for the life of me see layers except at the very bottom. My mom keeps telling me I need to get more layers than what I have right now. It’s just not round in the back the way I wanted it. On YouTube there’s a woman (Marina Ann - two of her videos showing what I mean: https://youtube.com/shorts/irIaGDE11MU?si=YV3Jr3KhkTdLAjx0\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/2fafQ4UEKlA?si=Gs_Tr6Cq0tXpPfXM) cutting her own hair with lots of layers and I always show her video and tons of pictures at every hair appointment but it just never translates. \n\nCan anyone help me out if these are lots of decent layers? The hairdresser took off so much of my hair last time and I feel like she gave me a cut she gives everyone else. I asked for curtain bangs and had to cut those myself afterwards essentially because she didn’t cut them short enough like the old picture of my curtain bangs I once had which I showed to her. From some angles the bottom looks a bit sparse. I was thinking I might just try and cut it myself next time considering that these cuts are expensive. I’m just a bit wary since I tried a Wayne Tuggle haircut on my own and the bottom was super uneven. First few pictures attached show my hair after the cut once I’ve been styling it myself and the last couple (where it’s more defined) show right at my hair appointment. \n\nRoutine (new one - I’m still figuring out how to use all of these but my hair does look better):\n\nShampoo: innersense pure radiance or clarity hairbath\nConditioner: innersense color radiance conditioner\nStylers: innersense quiet calm curl control, innersense I create volume and I create hold, sometimes I create finish as well. \n\nThese are all very concentrated so I only need to use a tiny amount. I usually just rake the products through with tons of water and then scrunch a bit and get the excess water out with a towel. I switch between air drying and diffusing. Now that it’s cold, I diffuse (definitely not as neat or methodically as others though). \n\nI’d really appreciate someone’s thoughts! \n\n",

      "content": "• the first two pictures is what my skin used to look like without a stable routine at 24 years old, I became fed up and went to see a dermatologist\n• the middle ones are during my isotretinoin treatment, I begun with 10mg, then 20mg and later 40mg, during a 10 moth period. During this I only used moisturiser and sunscreen\n• the later one is me now almost a year off the meds and I’m struggling to find a good routine. \n\nAs you can see I don’t have acne anymore and my pores are generally smaller. But I still have that annoying hyperpigmentation on my nose lol and most mornings I wake up with these small red dots around my eyes. They do not itch nor are they raised but they are annoying…\n\nMy AM routine is skin food carotene toner pads, vita-c dark spot cream and then the BOJ sunscreen.\n\nMy PM routine is double cleansing with a balm, then a regular mild face soap with nothing special in it. Then I use the AXIS-Y dark spot corrector, trying not to use around my eyes, and later I use the cicaplast cream.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n- what can I use around my eyes to prevent the red spots (my eyes are very teary as well)\n• what day moisturiser do you recommend? (my vita-c is almost finished)\n• what serums or products do you recommend for minimising my pores and/or general glow\n\nI’m also looking into micro needling for my acne scars around my chin.\n\nThank you in advance!!! :D",

I’ve done a lot of blood tests, everything is fine, no hormonal issues. I talk on the phone very rarely so I doubt its because of my potentially filthy phone. I was on accutane and it helped for a year, but it came back recently, but I cant keep drinking it forever because I can’t cross out a potential pregnancy soon. Any advice appreciated, if anyone here had the same skin and it improved, please share what helped you.\n\nCurrent routine:\nPM: Cerave cleanser + Epiduo every other night + moisturiser\nAM: just cerave cleanser\n",

I'm so so happy and in love with my hair right now 🥹 I had the \"I had pin straight hair my entire life so I thought my hair was just frizzy straight\" experience. After discovering it was wavy, trying to figure out what the hell to do with it has been a big struggle. I cut off most of my bleach damaged ends a couple weeks ago which I think also helped a ton. My hair has never looked this nice. It feels so amazing to not hate and be frustrated with it for once.\n \nMy routine:\n1. Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Defining Shampoo and Conditioner — shampoo twice, apply conditioner and brush through with a curl defining brush (the one w/ the slots on the sides), leave in for ~5 minutes while I do the rest of my shower stuff and space out lol. Rinse by scrunching with water.\n2. Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner — Apply on sopping wet hair w/ praying hands, brush through, *don't scrunch*.\n3. Not Your Mother's Activating Curl Talk Mousse — Apply (lots) using prayer hands, brush through, scrunch, then microplop until hair is no longer sopping.\n4. Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Sculpting Gel — Lightly glaze over hair upside down, then each side. Microplop until hair is damp.\n5. Hover diffuse (warm air, low speed) upside down, then start pixie diffusing. Flip to the side, pixie diffuse, then other side. Rightside up, pixie diffuse with cold air.

The texture is a bit sticky at first, kind of like a gel, but it spreads easily and absorbs after a minute or two. I started using it because my skin was getting red and flaky from the weather, and I noticed it really helped calm things down. My skin feels softer, looks smoother, and some of my old acne marks have started to fade. Makeup also goes on a lot better now.\n\nThe main pros are how gentle and hydrating it is. It helps repair irritation without stinging and works well even when my skin feels sensitive. The ingredient list is simple, and it layers nicely with other products. The downsides are that it takes time to see real results. It’s not a quick fix, and it can feel a little tacky, especially if you have oily skin or live in a humid climate. Overall, it’s a great option if you want to focus on hydration and barrier repair rather than aggressive acne treatment.",

Sarat Anandh, MD (DVL) — a Board-Certified Dermatologist and Double Gold Medalist 🏅🏅.\n\nMy heart truly pains to see so many people struggling with acne — often misled, mistreated, or losing confidence over something that’s completely treatable. That’s why I wanted to host this AMA — to give you honest, science-based answers and help you understand what really works.\n\nBefore founding my own clinic, I served as the Youngest Regional Medical Director for a leading national skin-clinic chain, where I designed Pan-India protocols for Laser Hair Reduction (LHR) and trained doctors across centers.\n\nOver the years, I’ve presented and published multiple research papers internationally — Acne management and Acne-scar treatment protocols as well. I’ve also conducted fellowships and workshops, teaching about lasers and energy-based devices.\n\nCurrently, I practice at The Derm Edit Clinic (Chennai) — a science-driven boutique equipped with Fotona SP Dynamis NX Line, Fotona StarWalker MaQX, HydraFacial MD, GFC, Exosome therapies and many more.\n\nFocus of this AMA\n\nDermatology is a vast field, so to keep this focused and useful, today’s AMA will be only about Acne &amp; Acne Scars — causes, treatments, lasers, peels, oral medications, and everything in between.\n\nTo make the discussion efficient:\n\nI’ll be answering the Top 20 upvoted questions in detail.\n\nAMA will stay open for 48 hours.\n\n*Will not be giving medical consultation/product recommendations*",

She bathes more than that but just gets her hair wet, so we apply leave in conditioner after. We never brush her hair dry. In the mornings I use water and a little leave in conditioner to style her hair. She usually requests some sort of braid to keep it out of her face. If she wears in down like in the last picture I add a small amount of curl cream. First two pictures show her hair after she’s woken up without styling it. \n\nI’m worried there is product build up and that her hair is just in general too dry. It now feels straw like when I wash it. Is this normal? \n\nI’m thinking I need to use a clarifying shampoo but don’t want to make the dryness worse. \n\nAny recommendations for a clarifying shampoo, how often to use it, and what moisturizing products to use between washes? Bonus if it’s low on fragrance. I don’t love the smell of most strong fragrances. \n\nShould I be getting her a silk pillow case or having her sleep with her hair a certain way? \n\nWe love her curls and want to start from a young age teaching her the proper maintenance. I research online but get overwhelmed with all the different possibilities and would love some guidance on simple routines that have worked for others. ",

My main issues are:\n\n· Very oily scalp\n· Persistent dandruff/flakes\n· Noticeable hair thinning\n\nI turned to ChatGPT for a starting point. It generated a detailed weekly routine for me, but I wanted to run it by this community before I invest in the products.\n\nHere's the routine ChatGPT suggested:\n\n· Day 1 (Deep Exfoliation): Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo. Massage in, leave for 3-5 mins, rinse. Condition only ends.\n\n· Day 3 (Antifungal): Nizoral (Ketoconazole 1% or 2%). Lather on scalp, leave for 3-5 mins, rinse. Condition only ends.\n\n· Day 5 (Gentle Cleanse): A mild tea tree shampoo (e.g., Paul Mitchell). Quick wash, condition only ends.\n\n· Day 7 (Antifungal): Nizoral again, same as Day 3.\n\nThe bot said to follow this for 3-4 weeks until flakes clear, then scale back Nizoral to once a week.\n\nMy questions for you:\n\n1. Does this routine seem logical and safe? \n2. Product Recommendations: Are Neutrogena T/Sal and Nizoral the gold standards here, or are there better alternatives I should consider?\n3. Thinning Hair: This is my biggest concern. Could this routine be too harsh and potentially worsen thinning?\n4. Personal Experience: Has anyone with a similar combo of oiliness, flakes, and thinning found a routine that actually worked?\n\nAny advive will be appreciated.\n\n\n",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
