I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

      "content": "(M-21) \nMore details -\nA pharmacist suggested me to use adapalene gel + one more tablet medicine (which I don't remember) and it made my some acne go away (after using for around 2 months). Using adapalene made my skin so much dry and caused burning like sensation. I did some research and bought Cerave Foaming Cleanser and kept on using Ponds Super light gel (which I've previously used for more than a year)\nThe texture of my skin improved a bit but there were many closed comedones and acne kept on coming back. Not very big, red ones but like normal small pimples. In January i switched from Cerave to Minimalist Salicylic acid face wash and started using Deconstruct oil free moisturizer. \nI was really irritated by my acne and went through the posts here and used google/chatgpt and learnt that adapalene would be a good treatment. I started using adapalene again (a pea sized amount) . Also, my moisturizer got empty and i changed my moisturizer to Minimalist B5 one. I used adapalene after washing my face and then immediately applied moisturizer layer on top of it. I did it for 2 nights, skipped a day, used again and then this pic is of yesterday. I really can't understand what to do and how to atleast look presentable. Also, if it helps, i shaved my beard too this week. My gf says that after I apply moisturizer, this much damaged skin (as in above pics) is not visible, only the inflammed/bumpy portion around nose is noticeable. And for the scar on my right cheek, that's due to chickenpox - not acne.\n I just really want to have a good skin texture, Any advices and suggestions would he helpful.",

The idea of having to reveal to an SO that your hair wasn't really your hair, is crazy and hurts to think about.\n\nWhat we need to bring back is UNREALISTIC ones, where it's clear they are fake and aren't even trying to be realistic. Think of the founding fathers of the US, with their white wigs, which aren't fooling anyone, and are just a display of status and dignity.\n\nTake the idea of \"fooling\" out of wigs.",

      "content": "All my life as a child and teenager, I have had very full and curly hair (pic 1). I never had to do much with it, in fact I did next to nothing to it. Everyday I shampooed and conditioned with supermarket products and let it air dry. That was it. Unfortunately, in my early adulthood my health took a massive nosedive and I noticed my hair starting to loose volume and become brittle (pic 2). This was the first time in my life that I took the initiative to intervene with my hair. In no particular order, over the span of 4 years there are the things I did, all of which to no avail:\n\n\\- Take supplements\n\n\\- Wash my hair every 3 days only\n\n\\- Stop washing my hair entirely for 3 months (didn't help at all and too unhygienic)\n\n\\- Wear my hair in plaits for 2 months (can't say this did much)\n\n\\- Use a bi-weekly homemade mask with aloe vera and avocado (short term results only)\n\n\\- Switch to salon grade shampoo and condition (I am still using this after 1 year)\n\n\\- Use the following products (did absolutely nothing to help and burned up my wallet)\n\n\\- CHI Silk Infusion\n\n\\- CHI Shine serum lightweight leave-in treatment\n\n\\- CHI Aloevera curls defined reactivating spray\n\n\\- Teknia Deep care drops\n\n\\- Kerastase 8H magic night serum\n\n\\- Pure Argan oil\n\nI have been to countless salons and none of them did anything other than ruin my hair. The advice I got was incredibly misguided and unhelpful. At best my hair looked nice for a day. My hair continued to deteriorate and I eventually lost so much. In pic 3 that is all of my hair pulled forward. There is nothing hiding behind my head. At this point I was loosing massive clumps at a time in the shower.\n\nToday my health is on the mend and I have gained some volume back but it is still problematic. I washed my hair this morning and pic 4 shows how much hair came out. Not terrible, a big improvement in fact. However, I want to know what to do to help my hair health improve. I have very fine hair by genetics. It seems like everything that promises to help is just another fad. Please can you help advise me. Thank you.",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

Over the past two years I have been trying to take better care of myself, which includes my hair, and now it curls like this. But for some reason, only half my hair does this and the other half stays straight?? \n\nWhile researching my question, I found that some people with wavy hair go their whole lives without knowing their hair was wavy because they weren't using the right products. I guess I was one of those people. My whole family has curly hair, and my sister has the prettiest ringlets. I always kinda felt left out. \n\nAnyways, my question is, why does some of my hair curl and some of it stay straight while most of it is wavy? Why is it so inconsistent?? And is there a way to keep all of my hair curly/wavy?? \n\nObligatory routine (please forgive me if I did anything wrong, this is my first time on this subreddit and I am still new to hair care!!):\n1. I used to use the crown hair society curl enhancing shampoo and conditioner, but after I moved states I am not allowed to buy anything for myself, so I have been using my mother's leftover 2-in-1 shampoo :(\n2. I use the herbal essences rose hips conditioner (also leftover from my mother :( ) \n3. I don't use any styling products\n4. I towel dry my hair. My sister taught me how to do the \"scrunch\" thing once my hair is semi-dry \n5. I don't protect my hair while sleeping. Would that help? /genq ",

It first occured when I tried to pinch/squeeze out the dark spots on my nose-bumps appeared right after and now it wouldn't leave. I've tried using a variety of products but mainly products like: benzoyl peroxide 5%, Oxecure sulfur soap (have stopped using this for half a year now) and nothing seemed to work.\n\n(The gel like substance seen on the spots is from foskina B an anti bacterial ointment/tropical corticosteroid)\n\nThe bumps never goes away and swole red or gets bigger here and there sometimes containing yellow pus.\n\nI usually just wash my face day and night with clean water and apply a celeteque facial moisturizer in the after wash (morning)\n\nI'd love to get it checked out but w school and poverty clinging to life I can barely spare cash unless it's a life threatening emergency. I can deal with it just enough to get by but I can't bring myself to join occasions as it affects my confidence drastically.\n\nPlease help me...",

(Happens around once every 4-6 weeks, lasts a few days) I have brought this up to my derm but she doesn’t really seem to care(she specializes in skin cancer removal so maybe that’s why)\n\nBasically this is the scenario. My nose will become very red, and it’s the left side of my nose 90% of the time. After a day or so I will develop white heads, I try not to have them pop but eventually the become very volatile and rupture with even the slightest movement. The white head can turn to a yellow almost green color especially when about to rupture. I get white heads in the crease of my nose too and it’s very painful. I have tried normal skin care products like cerave acne cleanser but nothing seems to help. I currently use cerave facial wash and cerave pm lotion but am willing to switch to anything to help this. I have also tried the “caveman” method and it didn’t help. Thanks in advanced! ",
