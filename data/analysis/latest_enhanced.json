Not totally sure though. I've heard i may need a clarifying shampoo, but im very uneducated about properly taking care of my curls, though I have tried with experimenting.

I see all this stuff about proteins and other elements, and I need to do more research, but im not sure where to look or even what my hair type actually is. \n\ncurious if anyone else would reccomend a clarifying shampoo, as im sure I have decent build up potentially. any advice would be great! tysm!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Oral treatment helped stop the severe breakouts, but it left behind stubborn acne marks and visible pores. After moving countries, my acne flared up again quite badly possibly due to diet, environment or hormonal changes.\n\nMy family doctor prescribed **Cabtreo (Clindamycin 1.2% + Adapalene 0.15% + Benzoyl Peroxide 3.1%)**, which has helped stop active breakouts. However, my skin is currently **very irritated and dry**, even though the acne itself has improved.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n**AM**\n\n* La Roche-Posay Effaclar Cleanser\n* La Roche-Posay Effaclar A.Z Gel\n* La Roche-Posay Ultra-Fluide Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n* La Roche-Posay Effaclar Cleanser\n* Cabtreo\n* Cetaphil Moisturizer\n\nIn the past year, I’ve occasionally used **CeraVe Retinol Serum**, but not consistently.\n\nI’d love advice on:\n\n* Whether I should use **Cabtreo every night or reduce frequency**\n* What other products (if any) I should add to my routine?\n* How to improve texture, pores, and acne marks without worsening irritation?\n* I recently got **LRP Hyalu B5** and **Mela B3 Serum** from LRP along with my order, can I use them to soothe my skin and if so, **when should I use them?**\n* Suggest me a gentle oil-free moisturizer.\n\nI’m still pretty naive when it comes to skincare routines and would really appreciate some guidance.

I was able to catch mine early and got decent results with finasteride, but my mom’s hair is thinning badly, similar to my grandmother’s. I understand that hair loss in women can be more complicated.\n\nLately, this has been affecting her emotionally a lot. She’s become afraid to even take a shower because of how much hair she sees falling out, and sometimes she cries because of it. Seeing her go through this honestly breaks my heart.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for what I could help her use? Would minoxidil or spironolactone be appropriate? Can they be used together? Or is there anything else she could try?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",

I have a red patch high on my cheek that always feels rough or scaly, no matter how much it’s moisturized. And I have a red patch under my eye, that I think may be spider veins and need laser treatment?

My hair is way thinner now, my scalp gets oily insanely fast and my hair fall is at an all time high. I can literally see white areas on my scalp and it’s freaking me out.\n\nI can’t go more than a day without washing my hair. If I skip a wash, my scalp gets greasy, my hair looks flat and clumpy and the thinning looks even worse. But at the same time, my hair is frizzy and dry on the ends?? Make it make sense 😩\n\nRight now I don’t really have a proper haircare routine and feel totally lost.\n\nLooking for advice on:\n\n* Shampoo/conditioner for oily scalp + thinning hair\n* Serums or treatments for hair fall\n* Thoughts on dry shampoo (helpful or harmful?)\n* Is washing every day actually bad or just a myth? How to skip washing everyday?\n\nIf anyone’s dealt with something similar or has product recs, I’d really appreciate it. My hair used to be something I loved and now it’s just stressing me out.\n\nThanks!",

      "content": "Hi! I’m a junior high school student about to graduate, and I honestly have zero knowledge when it comes to skincare, makeup, and even hair care. I don’t really know what products are good for someone who’s just starting out or which ones are actually worth buying.\n\nI’m also the only girl in our family aside from my mom, so I don’t really have anyone to ask or learn from. I’d love to start with basic skincare first—something effective but also affordable. As for makeup, I want to keep it super simple for now. I’m mainly interested in learning how to use powder, blush, and lippie, just to practice and get used to it.\n\nI also wanted to ask about hair care. My hair tends to get frizzy/buhaghag, and I want to make it look straighter, smoother, and just healthier overall (not necessarily salon-straight). Are there any beginner-friendly and affordable hair products—like shampoo, conditioner, hair oil, or treatments—that actually help with straightening and making hair look really good? I’ve heard keratin conditioners and anti-frizz products help, but I don’t know where to start .\n\nHow did you guys learn when you were beginners? Do you have any tips, hacks, or beginner mistakes to avoid—for skincare, makeup, and hair? Like small tricks that made things easier for you or things you wish you knew earlier (especially in a humid country like the PH 😭).\n\nAny advice, routines, or suggestions would mean a lot. Thank you so much in advance ",

I had done two previous subcision sessions (years ago) with a just standard cannula and I could definitely tell a stark difference when the pickle fork was doing the slicing and dicing!\n* This is my first time doing Sculptra or any other kind of biostimulator/filler, and I’m glad that I took to it well\n* I was taking Liposomal Vitamin C and Collagen supplements a few weeks before through a few weeks after treatment — no idea if it did anything but let’s pretend it helped :)\n* Downtime was a biiiiiiitch. I was out of public view for easily 12 days. Thank goodness I work from home.\n* I have a pretty high tolerance for pain but the CO2 was quite painful, even with numbing injections and topical numbing. It was also the third of three treatments so it may have hurt more because my skin was just over it at that point lol\n* I had it all done in one day, and I was in the office for about 4.5 hours total\n* I suffer from rosacea and the CO2 has left prolonged redness (but tbh I fully expected this and decided it was worth the tradeoff)\n\nFire away with any questions and I’ll be happy to answer!\n\np.s. What percentage would you give these results? I’m typically so over-critical of myself (as most of us scar bbs are) but I’m thinking this is like an 75% improvement in the scars..??",

I am concerned that the copper peptide in it will accelerate facial hair growth. Is there any truth to this with it being a facial serum formulated for skin ? I am also looking at the Nivea Epigenetics serum that Cheryl Tweedy advertises as an alternative but am unsure if this would be as effective as a copper peptide serum. Any advice would be greatly appreciated… much love ❤️ ",

Still oily, so i washed it for the third time 🥲 with clarifying, with redken mint shampoo and with elvital red one and it's still oily 😩 since then i have washed it everyday at least twice, except yesterday i didn't wash it because i felt like my hair needed a break, it was so dry from the roots. \n\nWashed it again today, i tried applying shampoo to dry hair, then wash it and then add shampoo twice. I feel like maybe it isn't as oily now? but it's still oily. Should i try this methid again tomorrow or the day after that? and because i have washed my hair so much past this week should i do some special treatments? I feel like maybe i have damaged it a lot 😬 or should i just get back to normal.",
