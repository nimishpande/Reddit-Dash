      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I also have pimples on my shoulders, upper back, and sometimes in the hair at the back of my neck.\n\nI mostly stay indoors, though I sometimes go out for work or errands. Currently, I don’t use any face washes or creams because I want a routine that’s affordable, simple, and doesn’t take too much time.\n\n**Photos:**\n\n\\- I’ll be sharing pics of both cheeks and my forehead (not my full face). The images are taken in bright light, but in indoor lighting the scars, marks, and tanning look more noticeable.\n\n**My goals:**\n\n* Reduce or remove red areas, dark spots, and pigmentation\n* Fade both old and newer acne scars\n* Prevent new breakouts (face, shoulders, neck)\n* Keep my routine basic and on a low budget\n\n**Extra info:**\n\n* Skin is oily, especially forehead and nose\n* New pimples appear less often now\n* Not sensitive, but avoid products that burn\n* Pimples also on shoulders, upper back, around neck/hairline\n* I have used benzoyl and tretinoin. Both works, but acne keep coming back. benzoyl did peel of skin, it's irritating, but I didn't monitor much, so don't know if it removed acne scars.\n\n**Product questions:**\n\n* I’m planning to buy the beminimalist Niacinamide 10% Face Serum (10ml to try first). Would it suit oily, acne-prone skin like mine? How should I use it, and how often?\n* And also thinking of buying a vitamin C serum for dark spots.\n* If you notice pigmentation or uneven tone in the images, which cream or serum should I use for that (and for tanning/dullness)?\n* I don’t want to go for brands or creams with a shady background or too much marketing hype. Please suggest genuinely good options.\n\n**What I need:**\n\n* Daily routine, max 2-3 steps (just cleanser, serum, moisturizer or SPF is ideal)\n* Affordable, India available options\n* Quick tips to reduce redness before events\n* **How to tackle pigmentation, dark spots, acne scars with budget products (if OTC works, or when to see a dermatologist)**\n* Suggestions for pigmentation/tan and dark spots (please mention 2-3 product options in different price ranges so I can pick based on my budget)\n\n**Thanks a lot for reading!**\n\nAny honest, practical advice, routines, or product suggestions are appreciated. I hope I’ve covered all details. Ask if you need more context.",

At first, I didn't mind but lately I've been noticing that the scar looks really bad under certain lightenings, especially if the lightening is unnatural. This has been affecting my confidence a lot since I feel like it's something everyone notices when seeing me and that people would consider me unattractive because of that. It went to the point where it's hard for me to leave house without makeup since I feel like it's the only thing people notice about me (I use matte sunscreen+ concealer + powder or just sunscreen+ powder but I sometimes feel like maybe the makeup makes the scar even more visible). I know it's been a while but I was wondering if there still was something I could do to make the scar look less shiny and visible? And maybe how to tell how visible the scar is to other people, when the scar looks different in different mirrors and under different lightenings? For reference, first two photos are under led lightening (where the scar looks the worst), the last photo is under daylight (where the scar is barely visible). Thank you for you advices and help, it really means much.",

There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine?

It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nI really want to help my wife with her acne issues. She has struggled with it the entire 7 years we've been together. she does her routine religiously, and has tried going to the dermatologist, not using any makeup for months at a time, and many other things.\n\nTo be clear, I dont think it takes away from her beauty - but she hates it and comments on it all the time. She is open to any suggestions and I thought maybe we could get some help here after cycling through a few derms now.\n\nPersonally I think the skin barrier might be damaged, but what do I know. Im willing to spend just about any amount of money if there is a sure fire way to help her.\n\ncurrently she is using  \nNIacinamide 4% plus Tretinoin .1%  \nIvermectin 1% + metronidazole 1% + niacinamide 4%  \nDapsone 8.5% + niacinamide 2% + spironolactone 5%\n\ncleanser  \nSalicylic acid 5% + sulfacetamide sodium monohydrate 10%\n\nshe also uses cera ve light to normal lotion\n\nshe doesnt wear a lot of makeup but will sometimes, lately shes using some typology stuff lately.\n\nher acne is around her cheeks/jaw and she has said its cycstic dermal - what she thinks is happening is that the medicine she is using dries her skin out too much and then she layers lotion on a bunch in between the medicines.\n\nthere have been times when her acne has cleared up but they were fleating and never lasted more than a month or so. and she is religious about her routine. \n\n  \nShe does say she needs to drink more water (she has maybe 500ml at the low end but more often 1l), but her diet is relatively clean - as far as we dont eat any fast food or soda. she does have packaged stuff from costco but we are pretty cocerned of what we are eating - we cook almost everything from scratch at home (aside from pasta which she does eat a lot of), she doesnt have an abundance of meat in her diet but still daily.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. shes struggled with this almost her whole adult life.",

      "content": "Okay so, it wasn't until I was 15 that my hair began to curl out of nowhere. I'm 26 now and I still haven't figured out what is it that my hair needs. I have a LOT of hair, and it has different textures. It curls a lot at the neck and also the texture in that section is drastically different from the rest, frizzier and dryer. Then the top layers always want to curl after I wash it but they become very subtle waves by the next day. Here the hair feels frizzy but not as much as the neck. Lastly, the crown area and the layers in between refuse to curl (I'm guessing that my hair is too heavy).\n\nWhen it comes to my hair routine, I've tried a lot of things since I discovered the curly girl method. I used to be more experimental at first: no shampoo for months (very bad idea), plopping, trying shampoos without sulfates nor silicones, extending the days between washes... I definitely saw some results at some point but I came to the conclusion that it was all too much effort and nowadays I don't have the time to do all that. As of now, I wash my hair every 3-4 days and I mainly use shampoo and conditioner, nothing else. I never use any heat, I let my hair air dry and I remove the excess water with a tshirt instead of a normal towel. In between washes, refresh my hair with water and comb it with a wide comb. And most nights I braid my hair but I doubt that does much since my hair is layered and isn't long enough to stay in the braid (I also move a lot when I sleep), and I sleep with a silk pillowcase.\n\nOn top of that, I don't even know what's the porosity of my hair and if whether it's thin or thick (I just know I have a lot of it so I always thought I had what people call \"thick hair\"). I'm trying not to comb my hair so much which I find challenging bc I feel like I need to comb it. It does get tangled a lot tbf, more than it used to. And lastly, I feel like my hair rejects any styling product, if I use more than usual I gets this stiff texture and it just looks bar, but if I try to use the recommended amount it either makes my hair flat or it's as if I haven't used anything. I feel like the less I do to it the more it curls but then, said curls don't hold and my hair ends up looking like a frizzy mess. \n\nAnyways, I think that's all the information I can provide in order to receive some proper advice. Pleaseeee I'm quite literally desperate!!!! \n\n(The first two attached pictures are from last year when it curled more easily and was longer and the last two are from this year after I cut my hair quite short and tends to dry flatter)\n",

I'm not sure if my hair is actually wavy. \n\nMy hair is a bit past shoulder-length, and pretty flat at the top and sides. But halfway down my head (around the ears/chin) it sort of begins to curve? I'd describe it as a big S with like, four curves in contrast to a bunch of little s stacked on top of one another, if that makes sense.\n\nTo be clear, I don't do anything with it. Most of the time, my hair 'routine' is just me showering, putting shampoo, and letting it airdry. It also tends to get really frizzy when I go out, and calm when I don't. The fact that my hair is flat at the top is what's making me really doubt if I do have wavy hair.\n\nSo, yeah. Don't have much experience with hair and how to style it, but the frizz is getting pretty noticeable. A friend told me to look up wavy hair, and here I am.",
