I feel like I have tried everything under the sun and am trying spirnolactone now but pretty much at my wits end if it doesn’t work well. \nIt became much worse and more cystic over the past 4-5 years, and especially over the past year. For a while I was getting regularly monthly facials from a med spa, usually alternating between hydro facials, biorepeels, and about once a year or so a chemical peel. I’ve always used cerave products and used olay moisturizer for years until I went to a derm 3 years ago and now use vanicream. My skin is uber sensitive. I used a gel clindamyacin and tret for about 2 years which was somewhat help at keeping things at bay but they never really got better. Eventually I got insane flare ups of cystic acne lasting weeks and all coming up in clumps around one another. I stopped everything and have essentially started from scratch again. My mom struggled with adult acne too, and my derm seems to think it’s more genetics than anything. Doesn’t think it’s food related whatsoever and my hormones are pretty consistently balanced. Obviously androgens do play a role. Just got started on 25 mg of spirnolactone. Current routine: double cleanse with cerave hydrating face wash at night, moisturizer, tret, sometimes a hydrating face mask or cell protection balm (glymed+). Sometimes for white heads (if ever, typically closed) I will put on a dab of eminence clay mask. \nMorning is typically just a rinse, face wash if I feel necessary, vanicream moisturizer, cell protection balm for extra moisture. My current state (pictured) is the best my skin has looked in honestly probably a year or so. I did start drinking peppermint tea every day for inflammation so maybe that is also helping??? \nI use an antibacterial facial mist sometimes. And every once in a while, pimple patches if coming to a head too or super inflamed. \nAny recs for all the dark/red spots? I’ve heard of a CO2 laser working wonders but I wonder how safe it is if you still have cystic acne? I don’t many esti’s wont touch cystic (for the best). I just feel defeated with my skin because I don’t feel confident in my relationships, personal and work. A lot of people think I’m younger (bc of my acne), which I try to take as a compliment :). \nTYIA! ",

      "content": "Took me a while, but I think I’ve finally figured out how to make my Dyson styling actually work — especially on my curly (2C/3A) hair.\n\nThis is the exact order I follow:\n\n• On damp hair, I apply a damage-repair leave-in. Currently using the Redken ABC leave-in.\n\n• Then I layer a small amount of L’Oréal Paris Hyaluron leave-in for extra moisture and the L’Oréal Extraordinary Oil serum for smoothness and shine.\n\n• I let my hair air dry a bit before using heat. If I’m in a hurry, I rough dry slightly first.\n\nFor styling:\n\nMost days, I either use just the round brush attachment for a simple blowout, or just the paddle brush if I want it straighter and sleeker.\n\nToday, I first used the paddle brush attachment to smooth everything out and create a base. After that, I switched to the round barrel attachment for volume and a soft 90s-style blowout.\n\nI work in smaller sections — around 3 seconds on high heat, followed by 4 seconds of cool shot to set.\n\nThe most important step: hairspray after finishing each section. I used Schwarzkopf Taft Ultra. That’s what actually makes the style last without making it stiff.\n\nPeople at work have been asking if I style my hair every day, but I don’t. I do this once a week and it lasts till my next wash.\n\nSharing pictures because this might be my best Dyson day so far.",

I’m getting fewer active breakouts, but my biggest issue now is dark spots.\n\nI currently use Aklief, which is a topical retinoid, along with azelaic acid. I’ve recently started lightly adding tranexamic acid from Good Molecules in the morning to help with hyperpigmentation.\n\nMy main concerns now are texture and occasional breakouts every few weeks that leave dark spots. I have many tiny bumps across my skin, and when squeezed, a thin white substance sometimes comes out. I’m not sure if these are sebaceous filaments. My skin is generally dry, though it can look oily after products. I also experience flaking under my eyebrows, but not significant irritation.\n\nRoutine:\nMorning: Vanicream gentle cleanser, CeraVe PM, Biore UV Aqua Rich SPF 50. \nNight: Same cleanser, Aklief, CeraVe PM, sometimes a thin layer of Vaseline.\n\nI’ve also improved my diet and am eating more vegetables, which seems to have reduced breakouts. I’m wondering if this is a long-term process. Any advice would be appreciated!!",

I practically shaved my head off and now only have 2-3 inches of growth.\n\nI live in Japan so its a bit harder to get products for curly hair. I think i have a good routine but i still have no idea what im doing. Whenever i look up videos to help they are all of girls with long curls and i cant do the stuff that they do yet.\n\nBecause of this I often leave the house with a lot of frizz, at first i was just so happy to finally have my natural hair I thought my frizz was cute and natural but many of my friends or people say stuff like\n\n“define it!”\n\n“It looks goofy when its frizzy-“\n\n“you dont know how to take care of your hair do you?”\n\n“You should use gels.”\n\nAnd because im a beginner i dont wanna just ignore them but they all have straight hair with little to no experience with hair like mine and often times it just feels like criticism without actual advice. It makes me irrationably angry sometimes.\n\nIve seen many people talk about frizz and i know that its normal and i see posts with girls with long curly hair with comments like\n\n“Love the normalization of frizz!”\n\nBut my hair isnt long. Its really short. I dont know if im allowed to have frizz.\n\nThis isnt a post asking for advice to get rid of frizz i just wanna know if you guys deal with this too. Do people often comment about your hair? Try to subtly touch your hair? Try to tell you how to fix it when you didnt even ask? Am i going to have to get used to these things?\n\nOf course any tips on taking care of hair is MORE than welcome too tho!\n\nMy routine..(if you can even call it a routine) 3b-3c\n\n1. Wash twice (dove shampoo intense repair)\n2. Rake Leave in through curls. (African pride olive miracle from amazon)\n3. Rake coil sculpting custard and finger curls some parts of the head (Mielle pomegranate and honey custard)\n4. Put bonnet on and sleep\n5. Wake up and shake my head a bit to loosen curls.\n\nPLEASE help. Anything. Tips on haircare, how to deal with people touching, if frizz is unhealthy, funny stories with your curls, im just so lost right now.",

      "content": "In October I read an article in the New York Times Wirecutter about the benefits of retinol serums. Wirecutter tested and recommended several brands. Because I am 35F and have worked outdoors for 15 years, I am starting to show some signs of damage, so I decided to try one of the mid-priced recommended brands. \n\nThe first time I used it, my whole face basically peeled off. Big patches of dry flakes that took a week of gentle washcloth exfoliation to eliminate. I had applied it at night before bed on clean, dry skin. I did some reading and started trying the \"sandwich\" method using Cetaphil moisturizer - moisturize, wait, retinol, wait, moisturize - and only using the serum about every 7-10 days. Still, the same thing keeps happening and I feel like my skin is in an eternal state of flakiness now. No broken skin or rash, just crazy flaky. I do use an SPF daily moisturizer as well.\n\nA coworker told me they only use retinol when they know it's going to be cloudy for multiple days. Is this true? If this part of my skincare routine involves long-range weather forecasting, I don't think it's for me. Or is it possible it's just not the right fit for my skin type? I don't usually have excessively dry skin (prior to using this product) and where I live, winter is actually the most humid time of year. I also consulted this Reddit's page on retinoids and while it had great information, it didn't seem like dandruff-face was a major concern. ",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Its just that people are not well informed on fin/min.\n\nI would like to reach more people and help them regain the hair they love.\n\nI am not sure how to proceed, since I currently have almost no advertising of this treatment.

I’ve tried everything to clear what I believe are closed comedones, and nothing seems to help.\n\nThey started about a year ago and have progressively gotten worse. They’re especially bad around my chin and temples. I came off hormonal birth control about 3 months ago after being on it for 10 years, and my skin has definitely worsened since stopping it.\n\nIt’s really hard to get in to see a dermatologist where I live, so I’ve been doing my own research. I keep seeing recommendations for Differin, but I can’t get that where I’m at.\n\nFor about 3 months, I used Paula’s Choice BHA (1–2x/week), but it absolutely wrecked my skin barrier — super drying and irritating — so I stopped.\n\nAbout a week ago, I introduced Good Molecules Gentle Retinol Cream after seeing lots of recommendations for retinol helping with cell turnover and texture.\n\nI have very sensitive, red, easily irritated skin, so I’m really trying not to constantly switch products or overload my routine. I honestly just feel defeated at this point.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nAM:\n\n• Rinse with warm water\n\n• Vanicream Daily Moisturizer\n\n• Tosowoong Ceramide Barrier Serum\n\n• La Roche-Posay SPF\n\nPM:\n\nEvery night before treatment:\n\n• Bioderma Micellar Water\n\n• CeraVe Gentle Cleanser\n\nAlternate nights:\n\nNight 1: Good Molecules Gentle Retinol Cream + Vanicream\n\nNight 2: Vanicream only\n\nIf anyone has dealt with similar bumps/texture/closed comedones and found something that helped — especially with sensitive skin — I would be so grateful for recommendations. 🙏",

It seems cheaper than other minoxidil brands I’ve seen, so I’m curious about a few things:\n\n\t•\tDoes it actually work for hair regrowth/thinning?\n\n\t•\tAny noticeable side effects (itching, dryness, shedding, irritation)?\n\n\t•\tHow does it compare with more popular brands?\n\n\t•\tIs the quality legit \n\nAny honest reviews or experiences would be super helpful!
