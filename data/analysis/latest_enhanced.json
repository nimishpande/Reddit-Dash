BOJ Aqua Fresh Sunscreen:\n- Very moisturizing  \n- Blends like magic, no white cast  \n- Not as glowy as Japanese sunscreens, better aesthetic, not matte either  \n- I also started using the OG BOJ sunscreen and surprisingly that is thinner and lighter than this, but takes more time and effort to blend. And that isn't as moisturizing, and gets off easier.  \n- No breakouts  \n- No tanning  \n- Sticking with Skin Aqua, no repurchase  \n- **9/10**\n\n---\n\n###2. Round Lab Dokdo Toner:\n- Hydrating  \n- Very safe ingredients  \n- Nothing special  \n- Too basic for that price  \n- **6/10**\n\n---\n\n###3. Torriden Skin Booster:\n- Looks like a milky toner  \n- Very hydrating  \n- Not moisturizing  \n- **7/10**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream:\n- Best summer/AM moisturizer I've ever used  \n- Extremely hydrating, a bit moisturizing  \n- Gave me a glass-like glow once my texture was fixed  \n- A bit pricey or would've repurchased  \n- **9/10**\n\n---\n\n### 5. Formularx Barrier Relief Moisturizer:\n- Decent barrier care moisturizer  \n- Good hydration-to-moisture ratio  \n- The new Minimalist B12 pink one is better in terms of price and feel  \n- **7/10**\n\n---\n\n### 6. Goodal Hyaluron Soothing Ampoule:\n- Best calming, soothing ampoule I've used  \n- Better than Skin1004 Probio Cica ampoule  \n- Makes my skin supple, soft, and healthy  \n- Beautiful bottle  \n- Would repurchase if I keep getting it around 1k  \n- **9.5/10**\n\n---\n\n### 7. Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner: \n- I've heard it's extremely good for sensitive skin  \n- Since I do not have sensitive skin, it just felt like water to me  \n- **3/10**\n\n---\n\n### 8. Haru Haru Wonder Black Rice Toner:\n- Most hydrating toner I've ever used  \n- Too pricey tho  \n- **8/10**\n\n---\n\n### 9. Plum Rice Water and Niacinamide Toner:\n- Bang for bucks  \n- Doesn't cause any issues for my skin  \n- Softening and hydrating effect  \n- Will keep repurchasing  \n- **10/10**\n",

For back story, I had dreadlocks for 10 years and recently cut out the parts that were damaged by bleaching/coloring and brushed out the rest to get a nice restart back into the curly girly lifestyle. Keeping length is really important to me as my curls are so tight, it takes a while to get any length. I feel like the hair dresser took off more than needed and my hair is shorter than when I first had it cut 6 months ago. \nI've uploaded two videos for reference, sorry if they're not that good, I barely take photos or videos 😭  the one posted is the current cut. I feel like it's very short and round. I'll post the other vid in the comments. It was from last week.

      "content": "I started losing my hair at 23. I’m 27 now and it’s noticeable enough that people politely pretend not to notice. I’ve tried everything you’re “supposed” to try minoxidil, finasteride, special shampoos, diet changes. Nothing has stopped it. I know looks aren’t everything, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m aging in fast forward while everyone else gets to look young a little longer. The vanity part stings, but honestly the confidence hit is worse\n\nDating apps made it very clear how much people care about hair. My matches dropped like 90% as soon as it started thinning. It’s depressing to realize how quickly you become “less attractive” over something you can’t control.\n\nI play battlefield with friends most nights and even in the chat, jokes get tossed around about my hairline like it’s just harmless fun. Maybe for them it is. For me it’s a constant reminder.\n\nSo I’m asking guys who’ve been through this:  \nDo I just shave it and move on?  \nDoes confidence really make that much of a difference?  \nHow do you accept a change you never wanted?\n\nI don’t want to feel embarrassed about something that’s just genetics but right now I do.",

      "content": "It’s been over a year now since my skin suddenly changed. A year and a few months ago, I started getting acne…small, closed comedones that slowly spread across my face. Back then, I had no idea what was causing it. I tried everything I could think of to fix it, but in the process, I damaged my skin even more.\n\nNow, over a year later, I’m dealing with new problems. My skin feels completely different from how it used to be. It used to be dry, but now it’s extremely oily. I don’t even understand why. There’s texture all over my face: tiny bumps that cover my forehead, temples, chin, jawline, and cheeks. The camera doesn’t even pick it up properly, but in real life, my skin is full of these little uneven spots.\n\nSometimes, those bumps get inflamed. They turn red and form crusts, just like in the picture. I still get closed comedones, and my skin often looks red and irritated. It gets red very easily, and it reacts to almost everything. My whole face feels rough and unbalanced.\n\nI’ve simplified my routine as much as possible a gentle cleanser in the morning, another cleanser in the evening, and a moisturizer. That’s it. But even with this minimal routine, my skin still won’t heal. I don’t know what it needs anymore.\n\nI’m mentally exhausted. I’ve been to multiple doctors (for my skin) and psychiatrists (for my mental health) because I can’t handle this constant struggle with my skin. It’s taken over my life. I barely leave my house, I don’t do the things I used to love, and I just feel stuck. Sad, defeated, and hopeless.\n\nAt this point, I want to ask for Accutane. I know it’s not an easy medication, but I’ve reached a point where I’m ready to try anything that might give me my confidence and peace back.\n\nI’m writing this with tears in my eyes because I don’t know what else to do. This is my cry for help. I just want to get rid of this acne and feel like myself again.",

My skin stayed clear and glowing for around 2 years, but now it’s back to being textured, dull, and full of breakouts again.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\nMorning: AHA Glow face wash → Hyaluronic acid → Azelaic acid → Acne-OC moisturizer → Sunscreen\nNight: Face wash → Adapalene → Moisturizer → (alternate nights with glycolic acid)\n\nI also eat healthy, avoid sugar, and take very few carbs, so I really don’t think it’s diet-related.\n\nI have very sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin, and nothing seems to calm it down anymore 😭\nAnyone else going through the same thing or found something that helped?
