I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Context: I’ve always kept my hair short as long as I’ve been alive. Longest I’ve had it was enough for a regular comb-over, however some friends encouraged me to grow my hair out so I decided to try it. I got a buzz cut in March of 2025 and since then I’ve been growing it out, and it turns out I have curly hair. I never knew this so all of this is new to me and I don’t really know what to do with it and I’ve got a lot of questions that have arose in my mind since I found out my hair is curly. So I’m hoping I can get some clarification from people who have more experience with this than myself. \n\n1. How often should I be shampooing and/or should I  be shampooing routinely? I’ve asked people and everyone has a  different answer. Some of the people I asked said they don’t really shampoo unless they’ve been using a lot of product and they feel the buildup or if they’ve sweat a lot and their hair feels dirty, while others say they shampoo once or twice a week. I also read the post in this subreddit saying it differs for everyone, but how do I figure out what is the correct shampoo schedule for me based on my hair? What signs should I look for and how do I know if the shampoo is damaging my hair? \n\n 2. How do you guys deal with cold weather? I live in a place that drastically experiences the 4 seasons. And now we’re in winter and I get cold. For a while I was just toughing it out and not covering my head or ears at all however I got sick and I’m not about to di that again, so I’ve started wearing a hood however if it’s on for more than 5 seconds my hair is ruined (it becomes very flat as if I have straight hair then water makes it curl back up again) so I just wear the hood all day at uni until I get home. Is there some substitute to this or do I have to choose between having nice hair and being warm? \n\n3. Should I be using product in my hair and if so what product should I be using? My current routine is shampoo once a week using the Function of Beauty curly hair shampoo that someone got me, and I’m conditioning every other day using ORIBE intense conditioner for moisture and control. For the most part that’s my hair care routine then when I want to go out and wet my hair and scrunch dry it and it usually looks pretty good imo. Someone recommended to me that I get the As I Am leave in conditioner which I bought however I only really use leave in conditioner like once a month I’ve I’m feeling special and I use moose (Functions of Beauty wavy hair zero gravity styling moose) even less than that. Most curly hair people I talk to seem like they’re using much more product or using it far more often than myself. So am I doing something wrong? I’ve also noticed that why I use leave in conditioner my curls are looser than when I just use water and scrunch my hair, is this expected or am I doing something wrong?\n\n4. Is there any other secrets I should know? Since I never actually knew I had curly hair I feel like maybe I missed the learning curve so I’m curious what are some tips or tricks that I could benefit from that I might not know since I’m new to all this?\n\nI think those are my main questions/concerns for now I apologize the long message and I would really appreciate any advice you guys have. I’m a guy btw incase that makes a difference. ",

I put moisturizer on when I need, and… I wash my face with Dove Sensitive Skin body wash in the shower, and I know that’s not really the BEST thing to do, but it’s worked for me so far.\n\nI just want to take better care of my skin and have a routine, I heard exfoliating is good for it, so I’d like to know which products work best for face and body. Also, recommend a good sunscreen I can put on for every day, and I’d like to start with some wrinkle prevention too. And please recommend any other products/things I should do, thank you!\n\nEdit to add: I forgot to mention I have tried some products in the past, I forget which ones, but some have made me break out. So, any products recommended maybe gentle on the skin? Thanks",

Nothing fancy. I've been doing this routine for over a decade. When I was a teenager, I made a mistake of getting my hair cut short and have been growing it out since, with trims in-between. Nothing against people with shorter hair, it just wasn't for me and I missed my long hair I had as a kid so I decided to regrow it.\n\nLong story short, I had to get hospital tests and was monitored for several days, basically bedridden. They also had to use medical glue on my scalp to connect cords and monitor brain activity. After everything, I was left with a HUGE matt in my hair. Two local salons turned me down. Then I went to a local beauty school which helped reduce the size of my matted hair ball but they couldn't get it out completely. The professor told me her students did their best, and I appreciated it so much. So the question is, what now? The picture on the right is after they reduced the size of the matted ball. Left side is what my hair usually looks like. It's at the end of my hair but all balled up which is why my hair looks a lot shorter than it actually is.",

I have not seen much density improvement in months (have been on for nearly a year now). I have fine blonde hair pre hair loss so that doesnt help. \n\nIs 0.5 still sufficient enough to block DHT levels and see some growth after a few years, or is if wishful thinking? Thanks",

Low force like scrunch with the defuse ( idk what the technique is called).\nI tried using a bonnet but it make my hair really yuck and like ice cream shaped?? So I've stopped and it hasent seemed to affect my hair as much. I use schwarzkopf shampoo and conditioner. And a kerastase hair mask. Fudge professional heat protection spray. Schwarzkopf curl gel. And the mousse was also a schwarzkopf volume mousse. I don't do any hair refreshing. \nCan anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?? I'm not sure what type my hair is or what the curl group is, I cut my hair every 2 months, and only wash my hair 2 times a week, any tips?? Or information that could help?? I've used these products the whole time so it's not a change in products, or any changes to the routine.",

I told myself this year I’d take care of my skin more which would include having a solid routine and avoid picking at my skin\n\nThe past week and a half my new routine has made me look glowy, confident and most definitely clear! Today however i woke up with a pimple brewing above my upper lip and after looking at it in the mirror i tried popping it (failed ofc) then ofc i looked at my clogged pores in the mirror and continued popping out my blackheads. Now i have 4 pimple patches on 4 sore places ive popped and picked at and am feeling discouraged.\n\nAny tips to stay away from damaging my skin from picking/popping at blackheads, and how to quickly reduce the redness from squeezing so hard? Thank you for any help!",

I have visible hyperpigmentation, breakouts, and acne scarring (mostly on my chin and forehead). My pores are visible on my cheeks and nose, but it’s not too bad.\n\nI recently started a routine consisting of:\\\n•Mixa Purifying Gel Wash Anti-Imperfections with Zinc\\\n•Tołpa Dermo Sebio+ Toner\\\n•Mixa Anti-Imperfection Moisturizing Cream\\\n•Isana Love Your Skin Azelaic Acid\\ Or Vichy Minéral 89\\\n•Eveline Cosmetics Facemed+\n\nAt first, I felt like it was improving—my skin looked better, and I had fewer active breakouts. But then, it just stopped working.\nOn Christmas Eve, I did a full makeup look after prepping my skin thoroughly. It looked great—better than usual because of the prep! However, the next day, I couldn’t apply anything because my face was BURNING. I couldn't even touch it. It was a nightmare for a week, and since then, I haven’t done anything except the occasional cleanse with micellar water. Right now, my skin is extremely dehydrated, and I can feel a constant \"tightness.\"\nI’m having a real crisis and I’m looking for an alternative routine and products that will actually help... Could you help me identify my skin type? I’m happy to answer any questions and can send photos of my skin privately if that helps.\\\nThank you!",

Scrunth and diffuse upside down \nI usually put it in a bun when sleeping or just chill \nShe suggested I not use any curl creams or gels or leave in conditioners, as well as moisturizing products because I have moisturizer hair enough.\nI'm wondering what products I should use then. Just a foam? \nDoes anyone have suggestions for light weight foams.\nAdditionally I have quit sensitive skin particularly to coconut products so preferable not really strong fruity ones! Also potentially budget friendly unless it's something that will last you a long time for a big price \n\nThanks xx",

I had high hopes and was expecting something similar to the Bioderma Atoderm Baume, but it absolutely failed to deliver. It has the texture of a waxy lip balm that is really unpleasant to apply; it feels like I’ve put a film of beeswax on my face. Its claims of hydrating and replenishing the skin are overshadowed by the waxy texture and the difficulty of application. If you have damp skin, the product won’t even budge; you can actually scrape it off with your nails. \n\nI didn't find it moisturizing enough for winters, nor will I use it during humid summers (I can only imagine what a nightmare that would be). \n\n🔮Final verdict: The only \"pro\" is that it works as a tone-up cream for a quick brunch look. That’s it. I won’t be repurchasing this anytime soon.  ",
