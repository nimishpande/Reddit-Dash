Its mainly a cosmetic issue (colour/texture change).\n\nI have been to three different dermatologists and got different opinions:\n\n* One diagnosed it as lichen amyloidosis\n* Another said its chronic inflammation\n* Another said its something that can’t really be “fixed” and is cosmetic\n\nI have been using prescribed creams and moisturisers, but I am not sure if its helping much.

I am using Minimalist Salicylic Acid Face Wash in the morning and at night, but it seems that my flaky skin may be due to using that face wash twice a day, according to Google. So, should I use a gentle cleanser at night? And what should I do about the white pimples?\n\n**My morning routine:**\n\n* Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash\n* (Adding Niacinamide 5% serum to my routine next week – Minimalist)\n* A bit of Minimalist B12 Moisturizer\n* Minimalist Light Fluid Sunscreen SPF 50\n\n**My night routine:**\n\n* Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash (but I’m changing to Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser due to dry, flaky skin after washing, especially near my cheeks and jaw)\n* Azelaic Acid Cream 10%\n* Minimalist B12 Moisturizer",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

      "content": "So after over 20 years of thinking I had straight hair, I found out I have natural waves! Did a huge chop and got some light layering to help bring out the texture, but I'm not 100% sure where my wave pattern falls as far as 2a/2b. I know my hair is very fine, high density, and low porosity, but wondering if I just need to give it time or if I could improve my routineto help my waves get tighter or more defined. I just barely started a curly/wavy hair routine a few days ago so current wash day routine is as follows:\n\n1. Wash with sulfate and silicone-free shampoo - currently trying Native coconut and vanilla\n\n2. Light condition on ends with Native coconut and vanilla, wet detangle with comb.\n\n3. Squeeze out excess water/scrunch lightly with cotton t shirt to get more out.\n\n4. Glaze on/use prayers hands to apply Garnier Fructis curl creation mousse. Lightly scrunch, then plop for 30 minutes.\n\n5. Diffuse on low heat to 90% dry. Tried air drying on day 1 but the weight of my wet hair pulled everything mostly straight.\n\nThis is the only routine I've tried so far, looking for high hold product recommendations/routine changes/really any advice on long term wavy hair care and things that might help with wave structure and retention. Thank you guys in advance, I'm so excited to begin my wavy hair journey!",

Now you’ve taken it to a whole new level.\n\nI’m curious who thought it was a good idea to utilize a 6-month-old baby in an ad called “slow hair growth” and showcase that same baby at 17 months with beautiful hair as though the baby’s hair actually flourished because of your oil?\n\nChildren grow. Their hair grows. It’s called science. You didn’t invent evolution.\n\nLet’s talk about your lack of common sense - you aren’t even a brand that specializes in children. What was the reason you used an infant in an advertisement, in order to have parents feel that their child is growing at an unacceptable rate?\n\nThis isn’t marketing, it’s desperation and to do so using an innocent infant.\n\nShould you, instead of using infants to gain emotional sympathy, focus your time on developing a solid product for adults? You already have a damaged reputation.\n\nSome brands really will stoop to any level to sell.",

PS: I shave my eyebrows and they come back thicker as before.\nI do want to get laser treatment eventually, but I’m a student right now so it’s not financially possible.\nFor now, what would you recommend?

A few years back I got layers which made me look old-lady like, and ever since I have been nervous to do anything other than a blunt cut given how long it took to grow to one length again. However, I really desire to change things up a little. \n\nThe first two photos are me, but my hair is about 6 inches longer now... I could just ask for a blunt style straight across (photos 3)? I hate the \"U\" hair looks, but the example pictures I posted on photos 4 - 6 look really cute to me. Would these cuts take a ton of maintenance? The last two photos are similar to what I want on my wedding day. I realize I am rambling a bit, but really hopeful or any advice. Hair appointment is tomorrow. ",

Over time, it has slowly expanded and now covers a larger part of my back and slightly towards my shoulders. It doesn’t itch and usually feels smooth, not rough or painful. Its mainly a cosmetic issue (colour/texture change).\n\nI have been to three different dermatologists and got different opinions:\n\n* One diagnosed it as lichen amyloidosis\n* Another said its chronic inflammation\n* Another said its something that can’t really be “fixed” and is cosmetic\n\nI have been using prescribed creams and moisturisers, but I am not sure if its helping much. It seems to slowly expand over time, which worries me.",

So thats why I want a Shampoo/Conditioner that can help me at least get it healthier/moisturize. No styling just basic.\n\nIve searched hours for products on reddit and each time i find something could work other people say it leave hair frizzy worse. Was about to buy Redken mega soft curls , but heard some people say their cheaper aussi miracle curl made the hair look better than the expensive Redken. And others said Aussi is bad and to use Not Your Mother or Aunt Jackies better cheaper alternative. So im confuse on what to buy now. Heard about aussi 3 minute deep Conditioner being a life saver from some but others say avoid aussi brand.\n\nSo all i want is people with my hair type 3C/3B experience that can give me a shampoo/Conditioner recommendation that works.\n\nRoutine:\nBeen using Shampoo Curl/Shine Shea Moisture 2 times a week. Had a conditionner but gave me itchy/dandruf so stop using it.\n",

To deal with gym anxiety I try to go at off hours, but sometimes I still end up staying longer than planned and getting really sweaty.\n\n  \nMy issue is that my face has started feeling tight and looking irritated around my nose and mouth, plus I am getting small bumps on my forehead that come and go. I do not want a diagnosis, just trying to figure out if my routine is too harsh or if I am missing something.\n\n  \nCurrent routine:\n\nAM\n\n\\- Rinse with water\n\n\\- Basic fragrance free moisturizer\n\n\\- Sunscreen if I am outside (I do not always reapply)\n\n  \nPM (after the gym)\n\n\\- Cleanser in the shower (I use it once, sometimes twice if I feel gross)\n\n\\- Moisturizer\n\n  \nExtra details:\n\n\\- I usually wipe my face with a towel mid workout, and sometimes I use the gym paper towels if I forget mine.\n\n\\- I shower at the gym about half the time. Other days I wait until I get home 45 to 60 minutes later.\n\n\\- I do not use any exfoliating acids or retinoids right now because I was worried about making the irritation worse.\n\n  \nQuestions:\n\n1) Is cleansing in the gym shower plus again at home too much, or should I just do one proper cleanse per day?\n\n2) Any tips for handling sweat without rubbing my face raw?\n\n3) If you think I should add something for the bumps, what would be the gentlest place to start without nuking my skin barrier?\n\n  \nHappy to adjust habits, I just need a simple plan I can stick to on busy days.",
