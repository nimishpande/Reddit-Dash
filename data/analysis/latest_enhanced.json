I thought it was over-exfoliating, so I stopped. No change. I thought it was my diet, my laundry detergent, my pillowcase lol üò≠\nI was so fed up I decided to get methodical. I started a \"skin diary\" in my skincare app and my Notes app. Every day, I'd list the AM/PM products and take a quick selfie in my bathroom mirror.\n\nAfter two weeks, I was looking back at the photos. The only days my skin looked red and extra bumpy were the days I used my calming K-beauty moisturizer.\n\nI looked at the ingredients. It was packed with Niacinamide. I thought, \"No, that's supposed to be good for your barrier.\"\nThen I looked at my other products. My toner? Niacinamide. My Brightening serum? Niacinamide. My sunscreen? Niacinamide.\nI was layering it 4x a day without even realizing it. I was overdoing it on a good ingredient.\nI cut everything with niacinamide out. I bought the most boring, simple ceramide cream from the drugstore.\nIt's been 10 days, and the bumps are 90% gone. The redness is gone. My skin is calm.\nI'm so mad I was blaming everything else.

      "content": "I don‚Äôt really know how much  scalp is ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù to show but I try to show as little as possible. The first 3 pictures are what my hair looks like on a good day. I tried showing my bathroom lighting as well as more natural lighting. As you can see it‚Äôs very frizzy. I‚Äôm told it doesn‚Äôt look good/could look better but idk how to style it cause whenever I try to style it like videos on YouTube or try methods I read from the wiki where you just scrunch it then let it air dry or use a diffuser then scrunch it after it just looks like my entire scalp is showing so I might be doing something wrong or using the wrong products. The last 2 pictures are what it looks like when I attempt that. Side note I was thinking of trying texturing powder. Now I think it‚Äôs gotta be how I style it cause I think my hair is fine but many people tell me it's thick but I personally think it's due to how much volumizing I do but there is the possibility of me just doing or using something wrong like I said.\n\nRoutine:\nI'll use this routine 6 out of 7 days of the week with the seventh day being my shampoo day and the only significant difference is I use ‚Äúhask argon oil shampoo‚Äù before everything else.\nI use two conditioners I swap between every other day. One I use is ‚Äúliving proof full conditioner‚Äù and the other is a protein focused conditioner called ‚Äúcurl smith multitasking 3 in 1 conditioner‚Äù and I‚Äôll just rake those in my wet hair. Then like I said I‚Äôll use the living proof one day then the next I‚Äôll use the other instead.\n\nPost shower:\nAfter the shower I‚Äôve tried many things but the most consistent thing I‚Äôve been doing is I‚Äôll use ‚ÄúKristen ess lightweight leave in conditioner‚Äù and use the praying hands method for apply that going mid to ends, then I‚Äôll comb my hair down with an oval brush. Then I use a small amount of ‚ÄúAussie instant freeze hair gel with jojoba oil and sea kelp‚Äù rub that in my hands apply from roots to ends raking in then scrunch my hair at the ends and shake my head up and down gently to make it more natural.\n\nDrying and styling:\nThen I‚Äôll sit and wait for it to be completely dry then scrunch it and my scalp will show really bad especially at the crown and hairline probably because of how short my hair is (due to being in the military I can‚Äôt grow it out so growing it more isn‚Äôt an option at the moment). After that I‚Äôll use a hair pick to pick at the roots to mid lengths to help separate them and volumize it to make it look like the pictures. I know that this is likely the culprit to my issue but I don‚Äôt know how I should style it otherwise as the alternative is I look like I raided a crack shack. \n\nAny recommendations on what I should do differently to avoid showing too much scalp but not creating so much frizz or any products I should try like texturizing powder and if I should replace certain products with ones you recommend?",

I've been told by stylists in the past that I have lots of very fine hair. I've tried sooo many products over the years and they either weighed my hair down, made it look oily or just didn't seem to do anything. No matter what I do, my hair almost always ends up looking frizzy within a couple hours and oily at the roots by the next morning. If\nanyone cares to share any advice with me, I'd greatly appreciate it! \n\nMy routine: Shampoo and condition every other day (usually at night) with Carina\nOrganics Citrus Daily moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. \nLive Clean Weightless Volume Clean Air\nshampoo once a week or so. \nBatiste Bare dry shampoo in between wash days\nTresemm√© heat protection spray when straightening\n\nThanks in advance for any recommendations!\n\n",

Recently she told me her skin is much dryer and therefore greasier so she's struggling with way more blackheads and how they leave long lasting marks on her face like sun spots. Her very long term aesthetician has recommended a quite expensive chemical peel and facial for this. \n\nNow please explain this to me slowly - is this a good idea? I feel like surely rather than hitting thinning skin with a harsh exfoliant chemical peel for $$$, it would make more sense and be more affordable to address the root hormonal issues through HRT + apply way heavier moisturizer to protect the skin.

      "title": "Dr Dennis Gross daily peel - universal vs ultra gentle",
      "content": "Hello!\n\nJust noticed that there were not any answered posts about the Dr Dennis Gross daily peels here and since I am an inconsistent user searching for some answers myself, thought I‚Äôd share my experience with you girlies ü•π\n\nSo they come in three types - ultra gentle, normal/universal, extra strength. I‚Äôve tried the first two types. Since I have sensitive skin I never thought of trying the extra strong ones. I would suggest to go for the normal one unless you have super sensitive skin (which I do) - then try the ultra gentle ones first.\n\nNow these are a two step routine thingy - steps are basically opening the pack and rubbing the cotton pad soaked in the essence on your face lol. So you wash your face, do first step (exfoliation), after couple of minutes do the second step (anti-ageing) and wait another two minutes before moisturizing.\n\nFirst off, yes, they are expensive. I have only gotten them by paying frens who have visited the States. But the only person I know IRL who uses them regularly is my best fren and she swears by it because she‚Äôs a PCOS girlie with angry skin. So I tried them and I am glad I did - even as someone who sucks at consistency, I do really like the effect it has on me even if I can use it for a few weeks on end. You can buy a ziploc pouch, cut each pad in half, and preserve the other half inside the package and ziploc for the next use. Cuz duh they‚Äôre expensive. \n\nSecondly, don‚Äôt start every day at first. Let your skin get used to it. When I used the orange peel for the first time I overexfoliated like a dumbass. Do it once or twice a week depending on how sensitive your skin is I guess at first. \n\nThird, don‚Äôt overdo rest of your actives. The peel pads contain Citric Acid, Lactic Acid, Malic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Retinol, Tocopheryl Acetate etc. Basically retinoids, AHA/BHA are already there in the peels so it might be wise not to use other exfoliants or strong acids in your routine if you‚Äôre using this! I didn‚Äôt realise this and coupled the peel with a cleanser that had AHA BHA PHA and my skin got so dry üò≠\n\nNext - ensure you use sunscreen! I can‚Äôt stress this enough. Because you _will_ get sunburnt if you don‚Äôt. I made this mistake once inspite of the packaging begging me to use sunscreen. Don‚Äôt be like me lol.\n\nLastly - MOISTURISE! The peel uses strong ingredients especially if you have sensitive skin like me so please for the love of god moisturise your skin girlllllll. I use 1.5-2x my usual moisturiser when I use the peel pads. \n\nAnyways, this was not a paid Dennis Gross advert lol. But I will try to be consistent and share the effects of the ultra gentle peel once I‚Äôve used it regularly for like a month or so. This is one of the only products where I‚Äôve felt a difference immediately after using it - almost feels like make up lol. The first set of photos is post using the normal peel and second set is using the ultra gentle peel. The rest of the steps were the same (washing face with a gentle cleanser like cetaphil then peel and then centella toner by skin1004 followed by bioderma sensibio pink moisturiser). Of course the quality of my skin is worse in the second set because the photos are taken months apart xD But I still wanted to share them for reference in case it might help somebody. ",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n¬†\n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n¬†\n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n¬†\n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n¬†\n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n¬†\n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you‚Äôve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you¬†\n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

I have long, mostly 2c/3a hair )with 3b mixed in sometimes) hair.\n\nI added a mousse and hair oil to my routine and that helped with the tangles in the back of my head, but not on top. However, I'm also using products less liberally on the top of my head in order to avoid my hair getting too greasy.\n\nI wash my hair every 2-4 days using an Aussie shampoo and use Aussie conditioner every time I shower. I use a Dove deep conditioner every so often, typically once a week or every two weeks. \n\nI keep my hair in a microfiber towel to dry. I've been scrunching in a hair oil (I forget the brand), Garnier Fructis leave in conditioner, Aussie mousse, and Aussie gel in that order. Previous routine had the leave in conditioner and gel, but not mousse and oil.\n\nI then put it in a loose bun (the kind where you kinda pull all your hair to the top of your head in a high pony, then fold it in half to make a bun) to sleep, and I sleep on a satin pillowcase. Truth be told, I usually end up laying on my arm over the pillowcase though. ü§£\n\nDuring the day I inevitably end up getting my hair out of my face with either a scrunchie or a claw clip. I think this is where the tangling comes into play.\n\nMy hair has also had much smaller clumps since adding the mousse and oil. I'd like to get the larger clumps back, but the tangling is a bigger issue. Any suggestions are appreciated!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
