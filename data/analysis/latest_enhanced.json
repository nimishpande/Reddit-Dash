But since this has raised doubts in me regarding the sun protection I sadly had to look for another option 🥲.\n\nBeauty of Joseon : This spreads beautifully and does not take time to blend like UV doux. No silicony texture which I miss. Cant say anything about sun protection as there was no prolonged exposure or harsh Sun in December. ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

Do I just leave it and keep growing? I’m worried if I leave it what it will look like in a few months as it grows out. Any advice is appreciated. This process sucks.\n\nMy routine: I wash and condition with Kenra volumizing shampoo. \nProducts: I don’t use any as they weight my hair down. \nStyling: I let it air dry\nI wash my hair everyday and use a satin pillowcase to protect it while sleeping.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

      "content": "Skin type : I have combination skin depending on the weather and the season, leaning towards oily, dry to normal in winters, I have pcos related cystic acne from time to time especially around my periods, and when I eat trash for a substantial period of time and don't manage my sugar and drink milk.\n\nProduct price : Sebamed clear face care gel details for about 450-560 rupees, I have not checked individual websites but I get it wherever I can get it for the cheapest.\n\nReview : the product is 5.5 ph and is targeted for people with sensitive skin and contains no fragrance or oils.\n\nI apply it when my face is still 30-40% wet, and it goes on smooth, it is calming on my skin and doesn't feel greasy when it goes on. I've realised from many years of using skincare that the less I do the better it is for me, and so most of the days I only use a moisturizer and sunscreen after washing my face (during the day) and just moisturizer at night (with spot treatment if I have a pimple). I try to be very gentle with washing my face too and try not to strip my skin dry as that leads to my skin reddening and becoming sensitive over time.\n\nThis is my 5-6th tube of this moisturizer and in the box there's another tube and I will forever use it unless I find an identical replacement that costs me a little bit less (open to suggestions please tell me if you have any), it does it's job and calms my skin as a plus, that's all I apparently need from a moisturizer, most of my skin conditions are cause by hormonal conditions or how my skin reacts to humidity and dryness in the air, so topical stuff can only do so much. Most of the moisturizers I have had apart from this one have never worked for me and I'd rather not use one than use one that just clogs my pores.\n\nSo if you have sensitive skin this is probably a safe choice.\n\nWRP",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

It’s exciting a new topical hairloss drug sounds amazing  but here’s the reality. It’s patented until 2036, which means there won’t be any cheap generics for a long time, and the estimated price is around €300 per month. Compare that to finasteride at €30/month, and you can see why most people won’t jump on it.\n\n300 x 12 = €3600 per year",

Mind you, they say cut it, not stop styling it or keep it under control. The thing is, whether you like it or not, when you hear the same thing over and over again, you start to question whether they're right.\n\nCurrently, my hair is styled like in the first two photos, but I would love to have it like in photo #3 again.\n\nAnother problem I have is that no matter what products I use or what kind of cut I ask for, I can't get my hair to look like that (and it's been almost four months since I've been to the salon to get it cut short, just to have it styled).\n\nAny suggestions, opinions, or comments?\n\n\nI almost forgot (because the sub asked for it), these are the products I use in my routine for reference:\n\n- Dove anti-frizz mousse\n- Sedal shampoo and conditioner for curly hair\n\n- Just cold water, nothing else",

I have very straight hair and never had to deal with detangling so I’m a bit lost.\n\nWe wash her hair once or twice a week with a kids shampoo for curly hair (Johnson’s Kids) and then use A LOT of conditioner and a tangle teaser to detangle. It’s quite unpleasant for her and it takes up to 30/45 minutes to do so.\n\nWe tried other dry hair detangler sprays but they just feel like scented water to be fair.\n\nDo you have any advice on a routine? Any product advice that would be suitable for a young child? Any help would be appreciated.",

The first few weeks were rough. My hair looked uneven, the texture felt unfamiliar and I honestly thought I had made a mistake. I realized I did not even know what my natural hair actually looked like.\n\nAfter a couple of months, things slowly changed. My hair started feeling softer and stronger with less breakage. The frizz did not disappear but it became more manageable. I also noticed that my natural texture started showing more definition instead of just looking “messy.”\n\nThe biggest change was not just physical  it was mental. Letting go of heat made me more patient with my hair and with myself. I stopped trying to force it into a specific look and started working with what I have. My routine is simpler now, and my hair feels healthier overall, even if it does not look “perfect” every day.\n\nI am curious **what happened when you stopped heat styling your hair or is it something you are thinking about trying?**",

      "content": "Hey all, I need help! I've had a look through posts but I'm specifically lookinging for UK products and couldn't really find what I needed.\n\nThis year, my hair has become really brittle. I am fairly sure it is linked to hormones, but getting that sorted is proving to be quite the battle. \n\nMy hair is naturally thin and fine, curly/wavy/frizzy, but I've also started growing thick black and white hairs over the last couple of years, entirely different texture. It's my fine hair that is suffering though. The two things combined are giving me a \"permanently frazzled\" look since the shorter, thicker hairs stick up and I have whole little sections of short, broken, fine hair. \n\nI have straightened my hair maybe 3 times in the last year, and use an argan oil heat protection spray when I do. I don't use a hairdryer. I have dyed it once in that time with box dye, about 5 months ago. I also take collagen every day and a B complex, including biotin, every other day.\n\nIf I put it up in a ponytail, it seems to create more breakage, but my hair is so big and frizzy right now that it's the only way I can look anything like presentable, and not like an eccentric wild woman (not that I'm against that, it's just not a look I want all the time 😂). \n\nThe breakage is mainly the top layers, which makes sense since it gets all the exposure to changing weather, heating etc, but it all feels pretty brittle. I do sometimes get ringlets in the bottom layers. I currently use Aussie moisturising shampoo and Garnier ultimate blends honey hair remedy, and neither seem to have made an improvement. Please give me your best suggestions on helping my poor hair? I don't suit shorter hairstyles but it's so bad right now! ",
