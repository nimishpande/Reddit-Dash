      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

It was a a few years long journey to figure it all out. Curlyhair helped me jump start my learning and now I’m just happy that I feel like I finally got there and I’m accepting my not perfectly defined hair. I got my first curly hair cut this year and it helped a lot. Thanks all and I’m glad y’all exist. \n\nMy routine: I use Prose Shampoo, Prose Conditioner, and then squeeze my hair out and then put Prose Hair crème. And I usually try to air dry, but waiting 2.5 hours is not always fun. These pictures are with only those products and air drying; sometimes I put in a bit of curl defining crème since my hair is rather fine and doesn’t do well with heavy products. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I'd like to ask your opinion on something I'm doing in my routine that I know isn't the norm.\n\nI've been using The Ordinary's AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, and although the official website and user reviews always recommend using it only 1-2 times a week, I'm using it every day: morning and night.\n\nThe reason is that I suffered from nodulocystic acne and had already tried many treatments without success: benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, tretinoin, azelaic acid, etc. Nothing worked well for me. When I started with this peel, I initially used it once a day and saw a small change; then I increased it to twice a day, and that's when I noticed a real improvement: less texture, fewer blackheads, and the pimples practically disappeared.\n\nI've been using it like this for two weeks now, and so far, I haven't had any visible irritation or side effects. My skin feels normal, and I'm actually seeing a significant improvement. I also want to clarify that my skin has always been super resilient: it stings a little, but it's a tolerable burn. And it's not a fake product; I bought it directly from The Ordinary's official website in the US.\n\nAnother detail that might be relevant: I have a dark olive skin tone, but not completely dark. I'm Latino (from Peru), so my skin falls within the medium-to-dark Latino skin tone range, in case that influences how well I tolerate acids.\n\nMy current routine is as follows:\n\nMorning:\n\nCleanser with 2% salicylic acid\n\nPeeling Solution AHA 30% + BHA 2%\n\nHydrating serum\n\nSunscreen\n\n\nNight:\n\nSoap with 4% benzoyl peroxide\n\nPeeling Solution AHA 30% + BHA 2%\n\nHydrating serum\n\nMoisturizer\n\nI know this isn't the recommended routine, but since my skin is tolerating it and I'm seeing results, I wanted to know what you think. Has anyone had a similar experience? Could it be damaging my skin even if I don't notice it yet?\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nI forgot to mention that my skin type is super oily",

For context, I ran out of my usual cleanser (Tatcha Rice Wash) and re-ordered it, but it wasn’t going to arrive for a while. So I ducked into my local chemist and grabbed the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Cleanser to use in the meantime. I used it the night before… and now my face looks like this. It’s red, blotchy, and really itchy.\n\nI’ve had a long journey with my skin — it used to be pretty bad and I was on Accutane for a year. I’ve been off it for a year now and my skin has been amazing ever since. Well… until now.\n\nAny advice or insight would be super appreciated. For reference, I only use a cleanser in my routine, and if I’m wearing makeup I’ll put moisturiser underneath.",

Works well for thick, slightly wavy hair growing out\n\n2. Reduces poofiness\n\n3. Won’t worsen seborrheic dermatitis\n\n4. Is good quality / premium\n\n5.

      "title": "My Theory Of Androgenic Alopecia",
      "content": "Please read and critique my theory down below please :)\n\n\nCD200 is an immune privilege protein that when bound to a hair follicle makes it immune to changes caused by inflammatory cascades from SMAD.   CD200 populations are completely if not almost completely absent in balding regions of the scalp. I am led to believe that hair folllicles prone to balding are programmed to have low CD200 via evolution itself.  when inflammation occurs it blocks CD34 from activating progenitor stem cells at the root of the shaft of the hair follicle, when this occurs anagen phase immediatly terminates and catagen occurs instead severing the hair follicle from its blood supply. In this case the cycle has been induced too early and the hair follicle has not reached its maximum potential making it shorter and thinner. As the next next cycle occurs and the inflammation is still present, it will occur again.  TWIST1 is a gene that controls CD34, if its on or off. TWIST1 is primarily raised by HIf-alpha 1 alpha and TGFB1, these occur in times of stress and hypoxia.   However TWIST1 can also be upregulated by IGF-1, in fact it needs to be turned on and off at the right times in order for CD34 to work properly, an imbalance between IGF-1 and TGF-B1 can cause this switching on and off cycle to a skewed, leaving TWIST1 on too long causing hair follicle minaturisation.  So why do balding prone follicles have no CD200? is it a mistake? No evolution designed it this way as a test to filter out the gene pool from bad health and good health. The real definition of health is how robust your cellular physiology truly is, in other words how low your inflammation is when your thyroid hormones are ramped up.   Thyroid has been shown to stimulate IGF-1 even in the scalp. TGF-B1 is part of the fibrosis process and an upregulation signifies stress and hypoixa for cells.   The ratio between the two is the deciding factor here. When a male goes through puberty there sex drive starts to increase due to testosterone and estrogen. DHT is a byproduct of testosterone and is known to contribute to the balding process, the actual reality of the situation though is DHT just moves the goal posts of the IGF-1 to TGF-B1 ratio, so isntead of your previous ratio being just fine to keep hair, it shrinks the threshold by a lot and suddenly you are playing outside the safety zone.   However you are only in the danger zone if your ratio was already messed up to begin with, AKA you already had cellular physiology issues to begin with. The DHT just reveals the damage in a sense by movign the goal posts a certain amount.   The reason for this is mate selection will change, once a women notices you are balding she will no longer be interested in you, because it is a sign of cellular weakness and disease. Evolution designed it this way to protect the gene pool and to actually make it better and better in a sense.\n\nI think I should add that time is the key factor here, if someone has superiour cellular physiology they will keep their hair and health for longer attracting more mates and offspring, thus biasing the geen pool as a whole more so than if a person with bad hair and health could\n\n",

Overall there were keratin plugs that were sometimes flat, deformed, conjoined, or large enough they can't exit the pore unless it gets cut open (done non-medically). The infection was always where shower water hits you the most (upper back, chest, face).\n\nUnfortunately I can't even keep from clawing at these because of the heat and the pain/pressure of them that I can't relieve easily. I have a dermatology appointment scheduled in January. Last time I had this, I was put on Acutane after seeing a dermatologist (which being approved to even SEE a dermatologist took forever despite how blatantly severe the skin issues were), which helped manage it, but at that time I didn't know of this and couldn't properly explain what was happening under my skin (I only just now learned what keratin plugs were). I hope to be put on Acutane again because the plugs eventually went away and I had regular acne that was minimal and normal for me afterwards. At least up until this came back.
