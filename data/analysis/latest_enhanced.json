I know that doesn’t make sense but every time I try, it’s a flop. I do it bottom, middle, top or atleast try to. Do you guys do the same or do u do front middle back (in terms of sections).Also how do you do it so the already product-ed hair sections don’t get in the way? I try to move it to the back but even with long hair it gets in the way and falls back. I swear every time I try and put it in a pony tail, it gets a ponytail dent and kind of clumps together. I hope this makes sense and I’m open to anything!\n\nHere’s my routine:\n1)detangle in the shower with ouidad curl quencher\n2)put in pattern moisture milk \nAnd not your mothers mousse\n3)use a curl comb (the one with ridges on the side)\nThat’s it (if you have suggestions please leave them!

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Long post ahead. FWIW, I think my hair is probably more wavy than curly, but I definitely have some curly pieces and I figured it would be better to post here than [r/wavyhair ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wavyhair/)because this sub seems to have more activity. Images above are my hair after getting wet and then air-drying with some scrunching, but no product.\n\n\n\nFor some background, I used to have very curly hair as a toddler but then it straightened out somewhat as I got older. My parents never really knew what to do with my hair, as it’s always been very thick and unruly— my mom’s hair has only the slightest wave and from what I’ve heard, my dad‘s used to be pretty curly, like perfect ringlets, but he grew up keeping his short and now doesn’t have any, so not much help. Basically I’ve gone through my whole life with my hair looking like a puffy mess— I regularly attack it with a plastic brush, and sometimes I use detangler too, but still it’s pretty much a pyramid of frizz by the time I get home every day. It also has a tendency to develop snags and tangles in specific patches— there’s a pretty nasty one in the back that always seems to develop no matter what I do. I’ve grown up being told by stylists that my hair has some natural curl to it, but I don’t know how to treat it so I just default to the treatment I was raised with meant for straight hair, and the cycle repeats itself. Until very recently, my routine has just been whatever shampoo and conditioner we keep in the shower, then brushing my hair out once it’s dry, but that hasn’t worked very well for me. For the past few weeks, I’ve been washing with Super Nature Aloe Shampoo (not specialized for curly hair, but the label says it is sulfate-free) and Aussie 3-Minute Miracle Moist Detangling Conditioner every couple days, going through with a wide-tooth comb in the shower, scrunching, and wearing a bonnet to bed, and that’s definitely made my hair easier to manage, but it’s still not quite where I want it to be. I just feel so overwhelmed with all the different products and routines and I’m not sure where to start.\n\n\n\nMy main goal is simply maintaining my hair health, as I think years of treating it like it’s straight have probably led to some damage, judging by how easily it gets frizzy and tangles. But I’m also hoping for a more defined wave or curl pattern. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to get it back to where it was when I was little, but as you can see from the pictures, it‘s pretty curly in the bottom layers and closer to my neck, then the outer layers are more limp, with just a few curly pieces. I’d like to get that same kind of definition on the outer layers too if possible, but I’m not really sure how to achieve this.\n\n\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

      "content": "I have a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn’t irritate my sensitive, hyper-reactive skin. I recently watched a dermatologist on YouTube talk about the benefits of urea, and it really caught my attention. Apparently, it’s extremely hydrating and can help soften uneven, textured skin. Since I have an impaired skin barrier and noticeable texture, it seems like something that could be beneficial for me.\n\nI also realized that I’ve never actually used a product containing urea. Most American skincare brands tend to rely on humectants like glycerin or hyaluronic acid instead. From what I’ve seen, urea seems to be much more common in European and Asian skincare.\n\nHas anyone here used products with urea? If so, did you notice an improvement in hydration, texture, or overall skin health?",

I really want to smell like a warm, elegant, orange-vanilla mocktail. However, I’ve run into a dilemma. I don’t have a budget, and I’ve been looking into higher-end products, but none of them seem to have good vanilla body washes that don’t have a million other scent in them that I don’t want. And when I look at cheaper options, they’re always sugary vanilla instead of warm/spicy vanilla. I don’t wanna smell like a sugar cookie! I hate sugar! I guess finding orange products is a little easier, but I still need recommendations. I can’t find any higher-end products with good orangey-citrus scents. Also, what types of things do I need to complete my routine? So far, I’ve only been searching for washes, oils, perfumes, and lotions. But is there anything else? The photos I’ve included are just there to provide a visual for the VIBE I’m going for, by the way. Other scents I enjoy include jasmine, lavender (slightly), and sometimes florals.",

I tend to scar easily and somehow I’m always hurting myself so consequently I have tons of scratch marks/scars on my legs and also a few burn marks on my arms. \n\nWhile I’m sure I can’t do anything about the burn marks, I would like to know which products would help with hyperpigmentation and other scars such as scratches and bug bites. I’ve bought the ordinary glycolic acid to give it a try but I’ve heard it best to pair exfoliants with some type of moisturizer, which I have no clue what to search for or what products help brighten skin. Though, I have heard about Alpha Arbutin, but I’m not sure if it’s actually good or what strength to get.\n\nTL;DR : I would love to hear recommendations such as serums, toners, lotions, or body washes for (kinda??) severe body hyperpigmentation and scarring.

      "content": "I’ve been avoiding layers because I usually keep my hair short and layers low key intimidate me lol. My hair seems to break off around this length so I’m going to see if frequent trims helps it get longer. But if I’m going to the salon, should I get some layers and if I do, how extreme should I go?\n\nLast pic is just to see what layers may look like. I don’t know if cutting the top layer super short will make the tops curly bc I think my hair grows kind of straight at the root. \n\nRoutine: \n\nWash: Suave clarifying shampoo 1x or more a week, tresemme shampoo and conditioner. Occasionally use Trader Joe’s hair mask. Would love recs for shampoo and conditioner but I def do better with some sulfates than none\n\nStyle: squish to condish, rinse up side down, add Kevin Murphy mousse to roots and scrunch, add quarter size of Not Your Mothers Curl Talk gel and scrunch. Spray with Not Your Mothers salt spray and diffuse (mostly right side up, but sometimes upside down) \n\nSleep/refresh: pineapple bun, sometimes a hair buff. Not ideal so I usually do a pretty heavy spray refresh every morning and diffuse to mostly dry. Occasionally use the vents in my car to dry the rest. Which is fun to see if you drive past me at a red light\n\nThanks!!",

I have almost no clue where to start though. \n\nMy current routine is: 1. Maui nourish and moisture shampoo and conditioner 2. Brush hair out of the shower 3. Add leyton house curl and smooth light hold to mids and ends 4. Brush design essentials natural almond and avocado curl enhancing mousse though hair 5. Scrunch with microfiber towel until damp dry 6. Air dry or sleep on it (and I don’t brush it unless I’m about to straighten, style, or wash my hair) I also have a silk bonnet I use sometimes, but it’s rare because it either falls off at night or feels way too tight.\n\nI also leave my hair natural about 75 percent of the time.\n\n\nMy hair is fairly thick, low porosity, and holds curls quite well. \n\nWhat I’m really looking for is a fairly simple and inexpensive routine that can create more definition in my hair.

Been doing everything I can: deep conditioning every week, consistent trims, a gentle shampoo + conditionner + leave-in that finally seems to work. I have even done some hot oil treatments, professional mask with essential oils, cornrows as protective styles, now finger coiling (because i have not had definition otherwise) over 6 years now. \n\nNow, I have seen SOME progress. But my hair has been consitently dim, stringy, dry to the touch, hard to get my fingers through, and has really bad breakage at the front and crown of my head. I also struggle with definition most times.\n\nFor context, i had an active lifestyle: i did kickboxing, and i like to go out whenever i need to on short notices. And I chose to go natural for one reason - to get healthier hair. \n\nNow, i need 5 hours​​ to style my hair, lasts me all week - BUT when i workout (no,  pineapples do not help) my hair becomes a sticky frizzy mess. It feels like weekly torture, because through it all I walk with unhealthy hair and cramped limbs... \n\nProfessionals, even the curly natural ones, have failed my hair, they always say it is heat/chemical damage, but i have not been using heat at all and have not used done relaxers since 6 years. They reccommend treatments that broke my bank, but have not changed my hair at all (but 2$ DIY treatments helped???)\n\nDoubts and stress have been getting to me and am about to consider protein treatment/keratin/silk presses - at least I can stop worrying about styling. But I am SO scared of going through damaged hair rehab AGAIN. \n\nWhat would you suggest? Thank you so much for reading through this.​\n\nMy current routine:  \n\n1. shea moisture curl n shine shampoo \n\n2. Shea M manuka honey &amp; yogurt hydrate + repair  conditionner \n\n3. Shea M jamaican black castor oil strengthen and restore curl cream​ \n\n4. Flaxseed gel (DIYed). \n\n5. Sometimes i use grapeseed oil on my scalp.\n\n6. I clarify using a sulfate based shampoo occaisionally (Le petit marseillais force et eclat)\n\n7.I blow dry with cool air\n\n8.i sleep in with a silk/satin bonnet and a satin pillowcase \n\n[9.No](http://9.No) refresh routines, curls refuse to revive if manipulated after styling\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ichsjvejlcg1.jpg?width=3456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d49ef1a166910c5d8567ae53a172694b3cb412ff\n\n",
