I really want to take care of my underarms. \n\nBackground:\n\n\t•\tI used razors only for several years (stopped \\~2 years ago)\n\n\t•\tAround a year ago, I had a wax burn from Rica wax\n\n\t•\tSince then, I switched to hard Brazilian wax, but I feel my underarm skin keeps getting worse\n\n\t•\tI have thick, coarse hair\n\n\t•\tMy skin is PIH-prone — even mosquito bites leave dark marks for months before fading\n\n\t•\tCurrently using Chemist at Play underarm roll-on\n\n\t•\tOccasionally used alum for odor\n\n\t•\tRarely used The Ordinary Glycolic Acid with a cotton pad\n\n\t•\tRecently exfoliated gently with Dove body polish (pink variant)\n\nCurrent issues:\n\n\t•\tPersistent dark pigmentation\n\n\t•\tUneven tone\n\n\t•\tBumps after waxing (they go away, but darkness doesn’t)\n\n\t•\tSkin gets irritated easily after hair removal\n\nWhat I’m confused about:\n\n\t•\tIs epilator better or worse than hard/Brazilian wax for someone like me?\n\n\t•\tShould I completely avoid root hair removal?\n\n\t•\tWould switching to a trimmer actually help pigmentation fade?\n\n\t•\tAny routines/products that helped you personally?\n\nLaser is not an option for me right now, so I’m looking for realistic, affordable solutions.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with similar underarm pigmentation or sensitive skin, I’d really appreciate your experience or advice 🙏\n\nPlease be kind — this is something I’m genuinely trying to fix.",

Run a little Cantu Cream Pomade and then a tiny drop of grapeseed oil through my hair brushingit backwards. Scrunch a little then dry with diffuser. When almost dry gently style with fingers if required.\nI wash hair every 3-4 days with a cgm friendly shampoo and dry with a t-shirt. Use Jesdicurl deep conditioner about once a month or when required.\n\n(Day 4) - I simply spray a tiny amount of water onto my hair then just 3 to 4 sprays of Clean Curls refresher spray, push hair backwards and Scrunch a little then quickly dry with diffuser. Style again with fingers.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I asked her directly if extensions would still work and blend well with that cut, and she assured me it would be fine.\n\nWhen I left the salon, I initially thought it looked okay, but once I washed and styled my hair myself, I realized the top layer is WAY too visible. It honestly looks ridiculous — you can clearly see where my natural hair ends and where the extensions start.\n\nI have a lot of natural hair, and it tends to puff up, get frizzy, and gain volume very easily. Because of that, it literally looks like I have my real hair on top and then two thin strips of hair hanging underneath from the extensions. There’s no blending at all.\n\nAnother issue is color. My natural hair has reddish/orange undertones, and while I do have blonde highlights, the extensions are more brown with blonde, and something about it just looks off and mismatched in real life.\n\nI already booked another appointment to add more hair, because that’s the only solution I could think of, but now I’m not even sure if adding more extensions will actually fix the problem — or if the cut itself is the real issue.\n\nHas anyone dealt with extensions not blending because of a butterfly cut or very short top layers?\nWould adding more hair help, or does this need a recut / different placement / different color match?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated. I’m feeling super frustrated and disappointed.",

      "content": "Basically title, I have a bunch of these red and faded acne marks all over the sides of my face (picture makes it look better than it actually is, it's more inflamed off camera) for like a few months now and I don't know how to get rid of them or what they even are. I know part of the problem is me touching or picking at my face, which I try very hard not to do but I'm hoping someone knows a product that can help with whatever's going on here. \n\nFor context, my current routine is: \n\nAnua Heartleaf Pore Control Oil Cleanser \nSana \nSana Nameraka Honpo Soy Milk Isoflavone Moist Cleansing Wash NC 150g (I've only recently started using this, before I used to use VT CICA mild foam cleanser but it made my skin very dry, the sana namerake isn't causing me any breakouts so far, and I've used it in the past) \nCorsx AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner \nDr Althea 345 Relief Cream \nMuji Moisturizing Milk \n\nI only double cleanse at night, and use cold water in the morning just to rinse my face. My skin barrier is definitely damaged and I'm 18, so I'm hoping for a product that isn't too harsh but still effective.\n\nAny advice or tips are appreciated!! I really want to fix my skin :( \n\n",

      "content": "Notes from a skin Cosmetologist\n\nWe hear “my skin is so sensitive” all the time, but actually, sensitive skin is quite rare.\n\nMost Indian skin is REACTIVE (aah, our love for drama goes all the way to our skin xD), not sensitive… and biologically, there’s a big difference.\n\nSensitive Skin (rare):\n\n• genetically thin barrier\n\n• chronic inflammation\n\n• nerve hypersensitivity\n\n• lifelong condition\n\nReactive Skin (super common in India):\n\nOur skin reacts when the barrier + microbiome get disrupted by:\n\n• heat, humidity\n\n• sweat\n\n• pollution\n\n• hard water\n\n• product overload &amp; too many actives\n\n• constant routine switching\n\nThis isn’t weak skin.\n\nIt’s skin that’s overstimulated.\n\nIndian skin is naturally more reactive because we have:\n\n• more active melanocytes\n\n• higher baseline inflammation\n\n• more active oil/sweat glands\n\n• fast response to UV &amp;heat\n\n• more TEWL from AC/humidity shifts\n\nSo what actually CALMS reactive skin?\n\nNot harsher actives! (Louder for the ones in the back) but barrier + hydration support.\n\nIngredients that help:\n\nHyaluronic Acid → hydrates, reduces tightness\n\nColloidal Oatmeal → beta-glucans soothe inflammation\n\nGotu Kola (Centella) → strengthens repair + reduces heat (my personal favourite!!)\n\nSqualane → replenishes lipids + restores flexibility\n\nIf your skin flares up easily but also calms down with gentle care → you have reactive skin, not sensitive skin.\n\nHope this helps someone who’s been confused by their skin’s behaviour!\n\n(Not medical advice,  just sharing what I see often in my practice)",

I'm interested in keeping it long enough to curl, at least. But my personal issue is that I have a narrow, very straight edged face. The sides of my hair grow straight out and curl stronger than anywhere else on my head, I hate it. I also have mixed pattern. I just feel like I look like a clown all the time. When my hair was really short, I looked good with short sides. But the second I grow it out the sides grow anti-gravity and it creates this strange shape. What should be goals be? I have fine hair so my hair also doesn't hold it's curl well, and I never mastered using gel. All product seems to weight it down.\n\n\nAny thoughts at all would be appreciated.\n\n\nRoutine: inconsistent. Wash every couple days with either heard water shampoo (ION) or regular generic moisturizing shampoo (any brand). Condition any brand. Nothing added after shower usually. Air drying makes the best curls but I have to wear a hat like half the year which crushes them flat. Blow dry with diffuser in the winter. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I am 20M and I have been dealing with acne since I first got it around 16. I have what I would consider moderate levels of cystic acne, that appear exclusively on my cheeks. I don’t have acne anywhere else on my face. \n\n  \nI am really getting a bit fed up of it, because it never stops. One pimple would die and then another would form the next day, I just can’t get to the bottom of what is causing this. I don’t think it’s hygiene, I don’t think it’s sugar or dairy as i’ve tried cutting out both to no avail, so I can only assume it’s hormonal. My mom had pretty bad hormonal acne as well if that means anything. \n\n  \nIve tried everything you can possibly mention and went to multiple derms, to no avail. I’ve tried Benzoyl Peroxide, Tretinoin, Azelaic acid, Niacinamide, and so on… My acne has been looking the exact same for the last year with no improvements at all. My biggest issue is scars and marks. My face doesn’t look that bad from the acne itself but it’s the scars that make it look very red and full of dots.\n\n  \nWhat would you guys recommend me to do? Is there any specific blood tests I should be getting to try see what the issue could be? Any other guys out there that have had the same issue and can give advice? Would appreciate it a lot",
