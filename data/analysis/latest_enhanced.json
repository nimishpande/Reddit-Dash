      "content": "My hair goes through a decent amount of curl shock when it gets cut. I want to keep it trimmed and healthy, but I got into a bad habit of getting my hair cut right when it starts to look really good, and seeing multiple different stylists 😬 2 hair cuts ago, my hair still hadn't recovered after a month. I managed to make little cuts myself and things were looking good (see last post :) \n\nThough it looked good, it was super uneven, so I went and got it cut again 😅 I went to my casual but badass friend who has really similar hair. She did my hair 4 times ago, and it grew out the BEST. So I went back to her. I always get a quick dry cut with no styling, so to be fair, the 1st picture isn't indicative of her technique, but just to show what I was working with.\n\nMy hair has been getting dry and frizzy quicker than normal. I was having a hard time styling it and the curls kept falling. I was worried I got another bad cut. Last night I gave it some extra love! Here is my routine:\n\nPaul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo on the scalp, NYM green tea shampoo on the ends. Squish to rinse. Then I brought back my fave DC, Curls Blueberry Bliss. Kept it on for 5 min. Combed it and squished to rinse. The curl clumps were INSANE! Added a tiny bit of NYM conditioner and rinsed, just for slip. MORE SQUISHING. Glazed on some Kinky Curly Knot Today leave in. \n\nI ran a wet brush through my face framing pieces to smooth them out. My hair is really fine. Spritzed with water. Smoothed in my #1 fave, Treluxe Styling Serum. Then slicked the clumps between my hands with Umberto Gianni Curl Jelly. Some gentle squishing. It was looking like a bit too much product, so I spritzed in more more. Maybe. Little too much lol. It is a delicate dance, water and product, but I ended completely frizz free. At the last second, I scrunched in a tiny bit of Curlsmith Featherlight Protein Cream. \n\nI know thats a lot, but my hair needed it! I diffused on high as long as I could. Pic 1- after hair cut 2nd- 90% dry 3rd/4th - curls in their fluffed and filtered glory. My hair is sooo soft, clean, and well defined. I'm in heaven! ✨️",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "I've been growing out my natural hair color since May (this year) and I have around 7-8cm (which is around 3 inches I think). And I'm getting seriously impatient (I'm generally a very impatient person lol) since my hair is really long (mid-back when curled, straightened almost at hips). I really don't know what to do. I've tried so many things but no hair dresser can get me back to my natural color. I've wasted so much time, tears and money.\n\nHere's a little backstory: I dyed my hair (mid to ends were bleach blonde, around 10cm of virgin hair) copper in December 2024. Had it colored copper again after some fading in March. In May I wanted to get back to my natural color and well...the hair salon had literally no clue. They didn't do a bleach wash or color remover and just dyed over the copper with a brown that was two level darker than my natural hair (which is a level 7 dark dishwater blonde/light mousy brown). The result was almost pitch black hair. Then a day after that I went to a different salon for a bleach wash. Since then I've gone twice to that same salon for a demi permanent toner. Last time was a month ago. And it was way too dark. I've done the vitamin c method twice since then and I got almost all of the too dark toner out of the mid lengths but it seems like the toner is stuck in the ends (around 5-7cm). So, now my hair is a faded copper with 7cm of mousy brown at the roots and the ends are almost black and I can't get the toner out. The Vitamin C also faded some of the copper but the ends didn't change a bit. \n\nI've talked to the salon about this and the hair dresser just said it should have been lighter by now. And that she can't do anything about it. \n\nI can't seem to find a hairdresser than can actually get me back to my natural hair color and I really don't know what I should do. I'm really frustrated and desperately need some good advice please. What should I do? I don't know if I have the patience to wait years till all the dye is grown out but I'm afraid if I go to another hair salon, they will ruin my hair even more. I don't understand why no hairdresser can get me back to my natural color. I've seen so many people on the internet that were able to dye their hair back to their natural color. Why can't I? What should I do?\n\nAny advice is appreciated ",

I don’t know what products or shampoos and things are best for my hair. My whole family has wavy or straight hair except my biological father who had almost Afro curly hair. I took after him but my hair isn’t as curly. My mom never knew what to do with my hair either so my childhood was filled with hours of straightening, just leaving it in a bun/ponytail or using products that chemically straightened my hair. I haven’t done any of that since I was about 16 however. I’ve let my hair do its thing since but I have no idea how to maintenance it. My hair curls nicely by itself on the lower layers but when it comes to the crown of my head, it seems to just frizzle and give up. \n\nMy Routine: I use the rawsugar brand of shampoo and conditioner (Restore and Clarify one), and have a leave in conditioner (By Marc Anthony) I put in after, typically letting my hair hair dry. I don’t have silk pillowcases or bonnets. I’m not even sure how to properly do all that 😅 I treated my hair as if it was wavy I guess. So I’m kinda starting fresh as I have no idea how this works. So any tips or advice would be awesome! ",

I left it short (and cut it myself) for most of my life, but have been growing it long the last 10 years... I'm not fully sure why since I'm so dissatisfied with it, but I think also because I've gained a lot of weight after some psychiatric issues and I always promised myself if I lost the weight, I'd lose the hair too - that would be my prize. \n\n**I would love ideas how to firm up the curls or make it not look like it looks now in the absolute easiest way possible**. It gets very frizzy (I don't mind some frizz tho), but it's the partial stringy curls that drive me crazy. I DO box dye my hair because I have very little money to spend on myself and not dyeing it monthly is *not* an option. \n\nI know myself and I will not spend a lot of time on my hair. A very solid 90% of the time, my hair is up in a bun because it looks like this.

I have no volume even though I use a volume brush and shake them out and do everything to avoid them being flat. I recently got some more layers hoping it would help but you cant even see them. The pieces above my ears are way less curly than the rest so when I put my hair in front it looks so weird. My curls constantly roll together into huge clumps. They don't last more than 3 days at most. I can't seem to feel comfortable with them no matter what routine or tip or trick I try.\n\nWould someone who has mastered their curls be willing to message me and try to help me out? I need to talk to someone who knows a lot about curly hair\n\nMy routine:\n\nI start when Im fresh out of the shower. I make sure my hair is really wet and section off the crown. I put a little bit of leave in conditioner and curl cream (I found that doing both works best for me) then brush style small sections with the Bounce Curl volume brush. I then do the same with the crown, going for a no part look but my hair isn't voluminous or short enough to actually pull it off. I then use mousse and gel on the entire head. I air dry for about 5-15 minutes then diffuse (hovering for about 5-10 minutes then pixie diffusing). I go to bed with the gel cast and shake/scrunch it out in the morning. I don't refresh in between wash days because it makes it ten times worse.",

      "content": "Hi!! This is my first post, I hope I’m doing this right.\n\nSo my whole life I thought I had pin-straight hair and was sooo jealous of my mom’s curls. Back in my teen years I tried every product and technique (thanks to OG YouTube) to get any kind of curl — and oh man, the results were awful. To be fair, I had absolutely no clue what I was doing and zero knowledge about hair care ahaha\n\nEventually I gave up and started heat-curling my hair almost every day for years. \n\nFast forward to now — I’m 28 and haven’t used any heat tools for 2–3 years, but I always do some kind of heatless curls method (my hair takes “shape” super easily and keeps it for days, if that makes sense).\n\nPIC 1: Hair air-dried with my normal routine (some kind of moisturizing serum, leave-in conditioner, and hair oil — I gently brush between each step to spread the product). It’s basically a bird’s nest. Straight but also so poofy and frizzy. Honestly could be cast as Hagrid.\n\nPIC 2: Next-day hair after my “heatless curls” method (aka a loose bun with a big scrunchie).\n\nPIC 3-4-5: Wash day (today). After seeing a post here — and still secretly hoping I might have a hidden wavy pattern — I decided not to brush after washing. I just sprayed some moisturizing stuff and scrunched in my leave-in conditioner. Air-dried (about 90% dry in the pics)...\nWHAT IN THE WORLD?? DO I ACTUALLY HAVE WAVY HAIR?!\n\nI’m so excited!!!! But I have no idea what to do next. I’m looking for any advice on how to build a routine and make the most of these waves. I know nothing. This is literally day one for me and I’m ready to learn \n\nWould also love product recs — affordable stuff I can find easily in Canada would be amazing!\n\nOther info:\n\n- My hair is very thick and there’s a ton of it\n\n- It’s always been dry and frizzy so I usually stick to hydrating products\n\n- I got highlights done (once) a few years ago, nothing else color-wise\n\n- I’ve got a couple split ends so I know it’s trim time, but honestly it’s pretty healthy despite it looking like a horse’s dinner\n\n**** I'm an autistic burned-out girlie that gets easily overwhelmed with online interaction so I promise I'll read every/any comment but may not be commenting a whole lot myself",

I think I have fungal acne on my forehead (it’s super itchy) and closed comedones on my cheeks.\n\nI’ve been using a salicylic acid cleanser (2x a week), BHA toner, and azelaic acid cream (from Paula’s Choice), but nothing seems to help. I’ve also tried extracting them with removal tools because yellow stuff comes out when I do — but it never fully goes away. I heard you’re supposed to extract them since my skin is oily and congested… but honestly, I have no idea anymore.\n\nMy skin doesn’t react well to harsh products, so I’m super confused about what to try next. Every product on TikTok has mixed reviews, some people swear by it, others say it ruined their skin. Do anti-dandruff shampoos actually work for this? Should I try Differin?\n\nI’m honestly so tired of dealing with this. Any advice, routines, or gentle products that actually help sensitive, acne-prone skin would mean the world right now. 🙏",

In this period, I've dated some people and the girl I'm seeing right now is a perfect fit for me. I've gotten compliments for my hair my whole life and to see it go is soul crushing. I will look like an infant if I go bald (have boyish features with large forehead). I'm trying to enjoy these moments of my youth, but its just so soul-crushing to lose it so young (not even close to 30). My hair now turns into a fucking tornado at a small gust of wind, while before it used to withstand a hurricane. I'm fully prepared to do a hair transplant, because I want to actually live and not be 100% invisible to women. The worst part of losing it young is that I don't have fucking money to do fin+min, dermarolling, a freaking 4k transplant. I'm applying everywhere, I'll work as a fucking janitor if I get money to save my freaking hair.",
