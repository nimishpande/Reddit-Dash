      "content": "\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm Suyog, 34 years old. I wanted to share my 5-month update after finally taking the plunge for a hair transplant earlier this year.\n\nBefore going ahead, I had actually consulted one of the top clinics in India ‚Äî the kind everyone recommends when you search online. But somehow, I wasn‚Äôt convinced with the cookie-cutter approach they suggested. My baldness had been stable for quite some time, and I wanted something customized and artistic, not just a generic dense-pack.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I came across some really honest and detailed discussions here on Reddit‚Äôs Hair Transplant community. Reading through patient feedback and doctor reviews gave me the confidence to look beyond the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù names and focus on skill, design sense, and ethics.\n\nLong story short ‚Äî I found a surgeon in Patna who completely understood what I wanted: a natural, 3-peaked frontal hairline with temporal point enhancement that would suit my face and age.\n\nüå± The Journey So Far\n\nIt‚Äôs been 5 months since the procedure, and I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm at about 60% growth right now. The remaining 40% should fill in over the next few months. Even at this stage, the hairline looks super natural, and the temporal points blend beautifully ‚Äî exactly what I hoped for.\n\nI‚Äôm honestly thrilled with the outcome so far, especially knowing this is just the partial result.\n\nüôè A Note of Gratitude\n\nA big shout-out to this Reddit community ‚Äî without your posts, before-after pictures, and candid feedback, I might have gone for marketing hype instead of real artistry. You guys unknowingly guided me toward the right hands.\n\nWill post my full 8‚Äì12 month update later with detailed pictures once the growth completes.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything about my experience ‚Äî happy to give back to the same community that helped me so much!\n\n",

      "content": "I have a curly cut coming up late November and I‚Äôm so excited! I usually get my hair cut for straight hair since I most often style it blown out. But I‚Äôve been diligently growing my hair out with the hopes of finally embracing the curls again (I prefer long curls on me)!\n\nMy one non-negotiable is keeping the length, no trim necessary quite yet. At this point when the curls are happy it looks good, I think I only need a little shaping, face framing, some curly curtain bangs and some layering around the cheek to eye level. What do you think would look best on me? I believe my head shape to be square-square/oval and feel a bit insecure about a fuller jaw area, so I feel that bringing more attention higher on my head will help with that? I do really like curly shags, especially more wolf cut less mullet for myself :) I love feminine, ethereal, natural, lived in vibes!\n\nThis routine was pretty simple, I washed with Garnier Whole Blends Honey Treasures shampoo and Camille Rose Guava Slip conditioner. I dried with a T-shirt then applied Ouai hair oil, finger coiled front an some other top pieces and diffused mostly dry, then air dried the rest of the way.",

Skincare product and routine recommendations, questions, random tips, even just helping me to figure out WHAT is wrong!!!\n\nThe red dots are not bumpy and they do not hurt. They are completely smooth all-over, and they don‚Äôt develop into acne (although I do GET real acne, but not nearly as much as I used to). They are just persistently *there* all over my cheeks and jawline. They don‚Äôt extend to the middle of my face, nose, or forehead (although those areas are still just a bit red in general).\n\nMy skin is combination, it is super oily along the T-zone (and also my cheeks) but my jawline extending into my cheeks, can be dry or regular. My skin is highly sensitive, and I believe I might have a damaged skin barrier??\n\nMy current skincare routine (all from The Ordinary) are:\n\nMORNING:\n- Cream cleanser\n- Milky toner\n- Cream moisturiser (first moisturiser that doesn‚Äôt make me break out)\n- Sunscreen (different brand, Australian)\n- LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING GOOD, BUT LOOKING VERY RED COMPARED TO WHEN I WOKE UP\n\nEVENING:\n- oil-to-balm makeup remover (Australian brand again)\n- oil-to-balm cleanser\n- salicylic acid serum\n- Cream moisturiser (stings when I use after the acid)\n\nI wear a lot of makeup, but these skin issues started well before that. Im only wearing makeup to cover the skin issues up. I am willing to buy more heavy duty serums, toners, whatever I need.",

      "title": "Found out my routine was weighing my (super) fine hair down, but not sure what and how to change it",
      "content": "Hi! I am currently SO lost in my hair care routine and would deeply appreciate any advice. Firstly, I think my hair is between a 2c and 3a, because my hair definitely isn't wavy but isn't as curly as some of the 3a photos I've seen. My hair is also ULTRA fine, and I realized I've been weighing it down w/ my old routine. Please don't judge the amount of products, I was trying all the things recommended to me in hopes that something would work out... \n\nFor more context, I wash my hair every 3rd day. I spent many years insisting my was straight and using straight hair products (it was a bird's nest but at least the curls were all brushed out right? /s). I've always thought my roots were VERY oily, but once I spaced out washes and started using shampoos for curly hair, it helped tremendously. Additionally, the very beginning of my roots are straight, so the hair starts to curl 1-2 fingers away (unless it is being weighed down). Now, my roots aren't dry but they aren't as oily -- they only start to get oily at the end of the 3rd day. \n\nPRODUCTS (and how I used them): \n\n* L√≥real Metal Detox shampoo (1x/month)\n* Aveda Be Curly Advanced shampoo, conditioner, curl enhancer cream, and gel. Plus the mask (substituting the conditioner) every once in a while. Here's how I use them: \n   * Shampoo twice, then conditioner paired with the Tangle Teezer Ultimate Detangler brush. After detangling, I pin my hair up while I wash my body etc, and later take out the clip to wash it off\n   * Right after I turn off the faucet, without squeezing any water out of my hair, I split it in half. Then, I split it in between the hair in front of and behind my ears. I pin the front part and brush the curl enhancer cream with my fingers on the back half. After that, I use the Bounce Curl Volume Edgelift brush and scrunch\n   * Repeat on the front part, and then apply gel and scrunch with my head down. Then I scrunch it a bit with a DevaCurl hair towel and then put it on my head\n* Styling mousse I bought in my area. I use it after I take off the hair towel and scrunch\n* Heat protecting, volumizing spray (used to be OUAI thickening spray but I started using the Olaplex volumizing blow dry mist)\n* Diffuse\n* Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Smooth Shine oil to break the cast afterwards\n\nAs you can probably imagine, all of this weighed down my hair. I had curl definition, but my roots seemed glued to my head. The curls would start to 'die' (can't find a better word) from the root down. Frustrated, I even bought a bunch of drugstore hair clips to try creating volume (after diffusing). I looked insane, and I was willing to keep doing that if it worked. It kinda worked, but only for a few hours.\n\nI gave up and decided my hair did not, and would not, ever have volume. Fast forward to one night when I started feeling off after I got out of the shower: I decided I would style it in the morning. The next day, when I took my hair out of the bonnet, it *magically* had volume I hadn't seen in ages. Plus, my curls were still pretty defined on their own (not as defined as they can get, but still pretty good). I did this a couple times, and it worked. Still, some of my curls weren't looking as good, specially my bangs (I have a curly cut w/ curtain bangs).\n\nYesterday, I tried washing my hair as normal, scrunching out the water, and then using a towel I got at the curly hair salon to scrunch and put up my hair to dry. After a bit, I put my hair down, used a water spray to get my hair soaking wet again (except the roots -- as suggested by a stylist). Then I split my hair into top &amp; bottom to try to give the roots and bangs 'special attention.' I used the *tiniest* amount of curl cream, the Bounce Curl brush, and another tiny amount of gel on all my hair. I then put it up to dry a bit with a 100% organic cotton t-shirt. Afterwards, to diffuse, I sprayed the smallest amount of the Olaplex spray I could use while still feeling confident about the heat protection. My hair looked good, but the next morning it still looked like it was weighed down (not as much as before though). The ends (&amp; most of the middle) of my hair had pretty defined curls, but some of the top and most of the front of my hair (specially my bangs) looked lifeless and limp, with my curls 'dying' (I hope this makes sense lol) starting from the top of my hair. \n\nSome more info that I'm not sure is relevant: sometimes my hair looks curlier and w/ more volume right after being twisted up in a bun for a while, and I don't understand why.\n\n",

Kinky Curly Custard and Curls Blueberry Bliss I‚Äôve been using ever since I started CGM in 2019.\nI have tried clarifying with Kinky Curly Come Clean, I‚Äôve also tried using Nizoral to try to clean my scalp (I use occasionally when my scalp gets itchy) I did a deep conditioner with Curlsmith Bond Curl Rehab Salve a week before I left because my hair was extremely frizzy. It didn‚Äôt seem to help too much.\n \nOnly thing I‚Äôve changed is that I live in Wisconsin and traveled to California for a week and got back Sunday.

      "content": "Okay now, my title is voluntarily provocative. For any newly balding young men, the recommended first line of action is still to try a 5ARI (the risk/benefit ratio now seems to be in favor of DUT from what I gathered from the recent literature) under the supervision of your GP or dermatologist and see how you react.\n\nNow, that being said, if you are a balding man in your 20s who has already tried 5ARI multiples times and experienced side effects that you do not want to bear with. Do you think it would be that crazy to pursue a hairtransplant under the supervision of a HT surgeon specialized in NW6-NW7 case?\n\nGo look at the results of these surgeons I have cited in the title (and there are probably others that I omitted). They have restored full NW7 to NW2. It means that, provided that you plan your HTs as if you were to progress to a NW7 with one of them, you would not risk the ridiculous results that are currently assumed as the norm if you do a HT without 5ARI. Of course you will perhaps have to accept less than ideal density, maybe a bit of thinning at the crown, but still, better than the power doughnut, no?\n\nAnd that is even leaving aside the non nil probability that we will have access to a new class of medication in the next 10 years due to the multiple treatments currently in clinical trials (PP045, ET02, AMP-303, GT20029, CB-03-01, etc.) (I know I know 5 years away‚Ä¶ but when in history did we have so many new treatments for AA in clinical trials at the same time?)\n\nSo as you‚Äôve probably understood by now, I am one these cases who has tried 5ARI in all available modalities (topical, oral, titration) and cannot support them. I am willing to start a conversation over this strategy, check what people versed in hair restoration think about it. ",
