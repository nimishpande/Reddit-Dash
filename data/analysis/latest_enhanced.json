      "title": "Curls are starting to go straight even with product / No consistency (UK)",
      "content": "Hair type: Low density, Course, High porosity 2c/3a (I think)\n\n\nHi, so I started growing my hair during Covid and by Oct 21 it was shoulder length (pic 1), and it looked pretty good considering I did nothing with it except wash (Aussie Miracle Moist) and condition (Tresemme rich moisture), then air dry.  I have satin pillowcase and a silk bonnet that I wear to bed.  I also turned 50 in October 25, and my hair has definitely got thinner in the last 5 years.\n\n\nAt some point in early 22 I had my hair done to make it lighter halfway down and the following year (2023 - pic2) I discovered Flora &amp; Curl curl lotion - I would use a blob of that after washing (hair still wet) and comb it through root to tip with a curly hair comb, then let it air dry which worked great for a while (pics 3-5).  Unfortunately at some point mid-late 2024/early 2025 F&amp;C changed the lotion in some way and it changed consistency.  After that it felt greasy and heavy, although it did still help a bit with the curl (pic 6).\n\n\nAfter that I noticed that intermittently my hair would go straight halfway down the strand, and be super frizzy and or lose definition (pics 7 &amp; 8).  After that point if I washed it and didn't use anything except shampoo &amp; conditioner + air dry it turned into a horrible frizzy mess (pic 9).\n\n\nI tried Curl Smith, Curl Show, Camille Rose, Only Curls, Cantu and some others but they all did the same thing as the single F&amp;C lotion after it changed, and some of them were really heavy.\n\n\nIn mid December (25) I had my hair coloured (just a dark red, no bleach) and just after I went and picked up the 3 stage F&amp;C line (lotion, gel and mousse) to see if those together would do anything.  For my work Xmas party I washed it the night before, and then used the F&amp;C lotion, then mousse, and then used my hands to remove excess water and then scrunched my hair for the first time ever, and did that for about 30 mins.  I then used a hairdryer on low blowing up at me to try with my head upside down to try and remove some moisture and add volume.  When it had finished and I took the picture the next day (pic 10) I had the best curls I've seen in years, and a ringlet one I could put a pencil up at the front.\n\n\nWeirdly I've not been able to recreate what I had at Xmas since - Over the holiday period I was told I should be using a defuser, so I brought one (Tresemme Pro Pure Curl Define).  Yesterday I tried using all 3 F&amp;C products + the defuser (watched some vids on how to use it) and it went horribly.  About £50 in product + defuser and to be honest it looks the worst it has in SO long I just want to give up (pic 11).\n\n\nIt looked so good right after I had it coloured and just using the lotion and mousse + hand scrunch, and now I'm wondering if the colouring is doing something to the hair that makes the product work better.  Of course as I'm washing it now no colour runs out so if that was the case that would help explain the texture change.  The last 2 pics don't even look like the same hair!\n\n\nI originally wrote this back in November 25 but with the colour and my lucky Xmas hair I thought I had cracked it, but that turned out to be a one off so here I am, asking for any hints or tips on what to do next.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "I have 3a/3b curls that used to easily retain moisture, were quite tight and lasted me 3-4 days. After a haircut in September, where my hair was sadly straightened,my curls started looking a lot looser and were not as nice looking. They started falling flat and limp, were frizzy and just looked way different than they used to. When they were straightened a heat protectant was used, however, I don’t know which one. I started using Rizos Curls Products after that haircut, which basically has no Protein as far as I know. So basically my hair wasn’t getting protein for almost 3 months straight. My hair dries different now and also feels different. I have no idea how to get them back.\n\nMy routine consisted of:\n\n\\- Shampoo and Conditioner by Jean&amp;Len\n\n\\- As I Am leave in classic\n\n\\- Rizos Curls Curl Defining Mousse\n\n\\- Rizos Curls Strong Hold gel\n\nI started with the leave in and raked that throughout my hair with my hands, just a quarter size. Then 3 pumps mousse, sometimes raked in sometimes scrunched. Then the gel, just a little bit also scrunched. After that I diffused and always slept with a bonnet.\n\nWhen I started researching why my hair was like this, I heard a lot about Protein, so I got the Rehab Salve from Curlsmith. I used this like 2 times now but it just looked better right after that but not long term. I’ve been trying for a month now to find the problem but I am clueless. I don’t know what to do and how to fix it and it’s really messing me up because I love my hair :(\n\nThe first 4 pics is my hair now using the same styling method, however, my curls look much looser now in my opinion.\n\nThe 5th and 6th pic is before the haircut, during that my hair was straightened and I wasn’t using any protein products. \n\nThe last two pics is my hair over a year ago where I was only using As I Am Long&amp;Luxe Curl Enhancing Smoothie.\n\nCould it be dead ends now that they grown out more? Is it the lack of protein over 3 months? Is it something else entirely? If you have any ideas please help me on how to fix this.\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "\nPictures with the White thing is the before pictures with the black thing is the after. ( i have more pictures if needed) \n\nI have voluminous hair.\nNot thick strands, thin but a lot of hair. Anyone who knows fine hair understands the paradox: volume like this is earned through years of discipline, patience, and sacrifice. It took me almost my entire 20s to build and protect this mass. Full cuts only..No thinning. Ever.\n\nI went to the hairdresser for something simple: bangs and a brushing.\nThat was it.\n\nI am extremely cautious with heat. I use it maybe twice a year. This appointment was one of those rare exceptions. I knew exactly what I wanted and, more importantly, what I absolutely did not want.\n\nFrom the beginning, he insisted on cutting the ends.\nHe literally begged me to let him cut “just one centimeter.” I refused. Over and over. I was very clear: no thinning, no layering, no effilage, no densifying techniques. Nothing inside the hair. Nothing beyond one centimeter, maximum, and only if absolutely necessary.\n\nHe kept pushing.\n\nAt some point, just to stop the pressure, I showed him a single strand. I showed him the exact length. I said: this, and nothing more. I repeated it several times.\n\nDuring the styling, he kept taking out the scissors. Cutting inside the hair. Again and again. I couldn’t see properly. Hair was falling all over me. I kept saying no. I kept asking him to stop. He laughed. He mocked me, acting as if I was paranoid, as if I should “just trust him.”\n\nEach time I protested, he did it again.\n\nAt some point, something inside me shut down. I dissociated. The stress became overwhelming. I had the very clear sensation of being violated, of someone forcing something onto my body against my will. It wasn’t “just a haircut” anymore. It was my boundaries being ignored while I was trapped in the chair.\n\nWhen I got home, reality hit.\n\nI had explicitly said: no thinning on the ends.\nAnd yet, he had thinned everything. My entire head. Hair that was already fine. Hair I had protected for years.\n\nOnce hair is thinned like that, it becomes fragile. Weak. It breaks. And that’s exactly what started happening. Every shower, more breakage. More loss. Even though I am obsessively gentle. Even though I do everything right.\n\nIt’s been a month now, and it’s getting worse.\n\nThe first time I dried my hair after that brushing, I saw it clearly:\nthe mass was gone.\nThere are holes everywhere.\nMy hair no longer falls together. It collapses.\n\nWhat hurts the most is that other hairdressers, before him, had complimented my hair. They admired the density, the length, the work it represented. And in one appointment, against my explicit consent, all of it was destroyed.\n\nI still don’t understand why he did it.\nI didn’t ask for it.\nI didn’t want it.\nI said no.\n\nAnd yet, he did it anyway\n\nWhat can I do please…? I need my hair back…i just wanted a fringe..",

I don't want build-up, anything that makes me hands feel gross after handling my hair (why I avoid styling gels and mousse(, or anything too heavy bc it will weigh down my hair and/or make it look dirty. \n\nIdeally inexpensive and accessible. \n\nAny recommendations?",

I want to start dut but I have 5.5 month supply of fin+min combined\n\nChatGPT suggests I start dut once a week while taking combined pill daily, after 4-6 weeks upping dut two twice a week and then after 10-16 weeks stay at 2-3 times a week + combined pill until I run out. At which point drop fin and continue with min and dut.\n\nDo you guys think this is the right route to take?",

I am so envious of people who can shower and walk away with no work! It made me want to have more days with less product/work. Does anyone have a single, light product they may use on these days? Like something I can just spray or rub through my hair quickly. I have thick, 3c curly hair.\n\nMy usual routine - \nWash 2x/wk - Aveda be curly shampoo (plus co wash) once and Aveda be curly co-wash only on the other \nCondition 2x/week on wash days (Ouai thick hair conditioner)\nOn wash days - I do Ecru curl cream and Aveda be curly gel, bounce curl brush. Diffuse for like 5 minutes (so it’s still pretty wet but not dripping at least). I used to do Aveda be curly primer but I left it at my parents so I didn’t use it recently and actually liked how my curls looked throughout the week better! So excited to get rid of 1 product lol\nOn non-wash days - wet it and spray Ecru curl refresh spray\nI also use a satin pillowcase.",

Condition with the Mielle pomegranate &amp; Honey conditioner (love it.) where I detangle, section and then twist the hair, wait 5 minutes and rinse. \n\n2x a month I do the same with the TGIN Honey miracle hair mask. \n\n3. Rinse with the twists still in. \n\n4. Dry hair until damp- out in the Mielle Hawaiian Ginger leave in (I hate this product) and then wrap it in a cotton T-shirt to dry \n\nAnd then I regularly do mini twists: \n\n1. If my hair is to dry I'll mist it\n\n2. And the Mielle Hawaiian ginger leave in\n\n3. Add a bit of Olive Oil \n\n4. Seal with the TAHA African Shea butter. \n\n(So basically the loc method)\n\nAnd then I'll braid at the root and twist the rest of the way down. \n\nIt's not the prettiest style, but for swim, I just need to make sure my hair is doing okay. \n\nAnd for swimming: \n\n1. Rinse hair with cold water before I put my cap on. \n\n2. After practice I rinse my hair out immediately\n\n2. Put in the Mielle pomegranate and honey conditioner\n\n3. Rinse\n\n4.
