      "content": "I got my first ever curly cut march this year and I absolutely loved it. My curls were healthy and I loved the shape. The curls in the first photo is from September this year so about 3 months ago, and the second photo I took at the beginning of this month. I’m extremely upset with the way my curls have been looking. I know that the longer your hair gets, the more the curl pattern stretches out. However, I don’t understand how so much can change in such little time. In the second photo the shape is off and my curls are really..thin? I’m not sure how to describe it. I’m noticing some pieces start really thick and then towards the bottom it really thins out. I’m not sure if this is breakage? I haven’t really done anything different so I don’t understand why this could be happening. I shampoo and condition once a week, I sleep with a silk bonnet, I detangle my hair with a detangling brush and lots of conditioner, I don’t use any heat besides diffusing, ect. I have always had the same routine and it has always worked for me. I just don’t understand why suddenly my hair appears so damaged. After my curly cut I wasn’t getting regular trims because my hair seemed to be growing healthy and I didn’t feel the need so I don’t know if that could be the reason? Now I’m thinking about doing a big chop but I’m not sure if there are anyways I can save my curls?",

There was also a time when my belly button became extremely itchy and smelled cheesy for days. This all began after a depressive period where I sometimes went days without showering. I’m now back to showering daily, but if I miss even 1-2 days, the smell returns. I never experienced this before, even in the past when I skipped showers.\n\nI’m trying to understand how to reset my skin/body back to normal.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I'm interested in keeping it long enough to curl, at least. But my personal issue is that I have a narrow, very straight edged face. The sides of my hair grow straight out and curl stronger than anywhere else on my head, I hate it. I also have mixed pattern. I just feel like I look like a clown all the time. When my hair was really short, I looked good with short sides. But the second I grow it out the sides grow anti-gravity and it creates this strange shape. What should be goals be? I have fine hair so my hair also doesn't hold it's curl well, and I never mastered using gel. All product seems to weight it down.\n\n\nAny thoughts at all would be appreciated.\n\n\nRoutine: inconsistent. Wash every couple days with either heard water shampoo (ION) or regular generic moisturizing shampoo (any brand). Condition any brand. Nothing added after shower usually. Air drying makes the best curls but I have to wear a hat like half the year which crushes them flat. Blow dry with diffuser in the winter. ",

I would want to have fuller hair. I have asked my barber if I can do anytbing to improve my hair. He said there is nothing i can do. I can only watch my hair go away and get bald.\n\nI refuse to beliehe thaz. I get loads of insta ads where people try to sell me some oils which are like 70€ but I know that this is most likely some bullshit.\n\nI have heard that Rosmarine oil can make yokr hair fuller, healthier and help against hair loss.\n\nPeople always tell me my hair look like I just woke up even tho it took me 20 mins to style it.\n\nDo you guys have any advice, any real advice (preferably with some real experience) on how to improve my hair growth, thickness and cleanliness?\n\nThsvk you!",

(Louder for the ones in the back) but barrier + hydration support.\n\nIngredients that help:\n\nHyaluronic Acid → hydrates, reduces tightness\n\nColloidal Oatmeal → beta-glucans soothe inflammation\n\nGotu Kola (Centella) → strengthens repair + reduces heat (my personal favourite!!)\n\nSqualane → replenishes lipids + restores flexibility\n\nIf your skin flares up easily but also calms down with gentle care → you have reactive skin, not sensitive skin.\n\nHope this helps someone who’s been confused by their skin’s behaviour!\n\n(Not medical advice,  just sharing what I see often in my practice)",

I’ve always had 3B hair, but after a boxed dye job and a lot of blow-drying, I’ve lost quite a bit of my curl definition. The damage happened slowly, so I didn’t really notice until recently.\n\nI don’t think my hair is damaged enough to need a big chop, so I’m planning to slowly cut it over time and experiment with lengths/styles till most of the “damage” is gone by midsummer. While I do miss my curls, I’m trying to embrace my looser pattern (around 2B/2C), and honestly I kind of like them.\n\nMy main issue right now is frizz/poofiness. When my hair was curlier, it was easier to accept frizz because the curls were more noticeable, but at its current state its much \"poofier\" and simply looks uncared for by Day 3..\n\nIs there anything I can do to make it look shinier and clumpier? I’ve been looking into products with a laminating effect, but I’m not sure how healthy that is long term. Has anyone tried hair gloss? Would love to hear any thoughts or suggestions.\n\n* *L'Oreal Paris EverPure Sulfate Free Hair Gloss Glossing Lamination Mask* \n* *Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray*\n\nRoutine: \n\n1. *Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean Shampoo*\n2. *Tresemme Moisture Rich with Vitamin E Conditioner*\n3. *Curlsmith Weightless Air-Dry Leave-in Conditioning Cream*\n4. *Olaplex No. 7 Bonding Oil + Jojoba Oil + Olive Oil*\n5. *Bumble and bumble Heat Shield Thermal Protection Hair Mist (New Addition &amp; Only If Using Hair Dryer)\\** \n\n* *Wash 1-2x Week; T-Shirt to Dry; Satin Scarf for Sleep; Trim \\~1” every 9-10 weeks* \n* *Products used occasionally: Bumble and bumble Hairdresser’s Invisible Oil Heat Protectant Leave In Conditioner Primer, Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Gel*",

I have watched a lot of makeup tutorials (some are helpful, others are not) and I am very overwhelmed. I have many questions, (some are stupid) for each makeup step and I hope I could get some answers/advice./help, Thank you in advance (it's a lot of questions, sorry in advance), My skin is combo in the summer/spring and dry in the winter/fall\n\n(When I ask \"How do I know it is blended\" I mean how do I know if there is a harsh line and if it looks even because after staring at myself for so long, my face kind of looks like one blob)\n\nOverall: What does patchy mean? What are some things that I should avoid while doing each makeup step? What is good lighting to do makeup in? What is the right steps to do makeup?\n\ntools: What are some brushes I need for good application? Brushes or sponges or other tool? What tools are the best for each step?\n\nskin prep: what are some good ingredients for skin prep?\n\nfoundation/concealer/skin tint: How do I know it is blended? How do I know it is the right shade? (if I step outside after applying, how do I know it will look the same/be the same shade?) What does \"cakey\" and \"creasing\" mean?\n\ncontour/bronzer: What is the difference? How do I know it is blended and doesn't look like mud? How do I choose the right shade? Are both necessary?\n\nblush: How do I know it is blended? How do I choose the right shade? How do I tell if it is emphasizing my texture? Should I do cream then powder or vice versa (and when in the routine)?\n\nhighlight: How do I know it is blended? How do I know if I put too much? How do I know choose the wrong/right shade?\n\neyeshadow: How do I choose the right pallet?\n\nmascara: Are falsies or mascara better? What does \"clumpy\" mean? Should I choose volume or length?\n\nbrows: How do I know if they look natural or \"blocky\"? What is a good natural brow routine?\n\nsetting powder/setting spray: Pressed or loose powder? Should I do setting power then setting spray or vice versa?\n\nlip: How do I choose a lip liner shade? How do I know if it looks good on me?\n\nThank you so much in advance, also please leave any makeup recommendations if you feel comfortable",

A few times a week, I use Paula’s Choice BHA, and I use CeraVe retinol every night.\n\nI remove my makeup with Bioderma micellar water and cleanse with a cleansing milk from Caudalie. Sometimes I also use the Propolis Cleanser from Apivita.\n\nI have recently bought TIRTIR Milk Skin Toner and the Oat Gel Cream from Purito, and now my questions are:\n\t•\tCan I still use hyaluronic acid, and should it be applied before or after the milk toner?\n\t•\tWhere can I improve my routine?",
