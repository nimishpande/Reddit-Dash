      "content": "\nHi everyone! I would say my skin type is combination-normal, not acne-prone or sensitive, but my face always feels tired, dull, and lacks energy.\n\nAbout a month ago, on a friend's recommendation, I started using Ulike Reglow LED face mask, usually the yellow + red + infrared light for around 10 minutes, three or four times a week. My usual nighttime skincare routine is double cleansing + Niacinamide serum + La Roche-Posay repair cream.\n\nDuring this time, I've noticed my skin becoming smoother and more hydrated but the dullness hasn't changed significantly. Has anyone seen real improvement in skin brightness with this mask? How long does it take to see results? Do I need to use it continuously? Should I increase the time or frequency? Any suggestions are super welcome 🙏",

      "content": "Basically the title. To my understanding, they both use an acid (citric ans glycolic, respectively) to repair hydrogen bonds. So what's the difference in the two chemistry? They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

I don’t plan to rebond again in the future I just tried it for a change and some fun. \n\nWhat do you think this is, and what would you suggest I do next?\n\nAlso I had an haircut like in 2024 when my hair were curly and i lost alot of hair that time...so is this new hair growth? Or split ends? I am planning on trimming the ends of my hair every three weeks. But how should i fix this problem now?!.\n",

Looked like a rough scab and it wouldn't go away no matter how much moisturiser I put on it.\n\nI decided to stop using all facial products, so no lotion, no face cream, no face wash, no soap with fragrance or acids in and no makeup. It's actually finally starting to heal a bit - but I'm worried when i reintroduce these things, it'll flare up again.\n\nAny suggestions for safer alternatives I suppose? I think it's become a sensitive area. I currently use Johnson's baby lotion and Cerave face wash and kojic acid + turmeric soap. Any good alternatives to these? And as for makeup, will it just be okay to reapply once its totally gone?",

For a week my face felt too oily and after that started purging. I gradually increased from 3 days a week to alternate days and also started aziderm on alternate days for acne marks. After a month and half I felt that purging but few days later it came back. This time I'm getting breakouts in the area near my mouth and area b/w nose and eyes. There isn't any reduction in cc either. Is it normal ? Should I continue or stop with tret ?\n\nI'm also facing flakiness. I've tried heavy moisturizer but it gives painful bumps. So recommend me something lightweight yet moisturizing or hydrating. ",
