I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

Most curlyheads rave on about getting a poofy mess in the morning after waking up when mines the complete opposite, I wake up with thin pin straight hair and if I don’t add water or some type of leave in conditioner, it will be stuck straight forever. Is my hair some type of hybrid???\n\nMy routine:\n\nI shampoo and condition once a week using the based shampoo and conditioner. Then I style with either the As I am bond leave-in or the based leave in followed by the based curl creme and gel. I usually like to switch it up and use different products such as multicultural curls or pillow soft curls from miss jessies or something like the bee girl gel from doux.\n\nI also co-wash once a week using the based conditioner and following it with the same routine above.\n\nFor every product I usually scrunch it in or brush style, but if I’m feeling fancy I’ll finger coil(this takes WAY too much time though).\n\nTo protect my hair while I sleep, I use a silk bonnet but sometimes I get lazy and just sleep without it, I don’t think this really matters because I also use a silk pillowcase.\n\nFor drying, I diffuse my hair until it’s a complete gel cast and I scrunch it out with this generic jojoba oil from my local dollar store. Sometimes if I’m in a rush, I just diffuse until its at least 50% dry and just it air dry for the rest of the time(still using oil after tho).",

Lanolin. Which is the main ingredient in a lot of Lanolips products. You just get it at Walmart even! In the baby area &amp; it’s labeled as nipple cream so don’t let that freak you out lol. It’s so smooth, moisturizing, &amp; actually cures. I use it on dry spots anywhere, my elbows, my eyelashes, for everything! It’s a MIRACLE! And it’s not expensive either. It lasts forever I’ve had mine for months &amp; use it everyday. The tube is big too when you use it as a lip product \n\nI didn’t wanna gatekeep this secret so please get some &amp; update me if you want even!! This is what it looks like &amp; this is what it makes your lips look like. Very shiny &amp; like you just used lanolips. It’s the same nice texture \n\nI hope this can at least help any of the girlies!! I’m trying! It really does make a difference!!!!",

Anyway I went a little too short so my hairdresser did a wavy cut initially and said we'd have to wait for it to grow before doing a proper curly cut at the roots as well.\n\nANYWAY, she put this product in my hair and said it would be enough (a curl activator she said which I have attached) and that products like clever curl would be too heavy for my hair. However, this product didn't really hold and dropped easily. I also didn't think it defined very well. I have had an issue with my curls holding especially while it's long. I had stopped my routine on my log hair purely because it just was not holding anymore but not that I've cut it I am looking for a good one.\n\nOn to my question I suppose, are there any recommendations as I am positively overwhelmed by all these options and terms even after reading the guides. I was thinking of trying a combo of the bounce curl light creme gel and kinky curly curl custard gel or jessicurl rocking ringlets and the kinky curly custard (I keep hearing lots of good things about it). Am I even mixing these products correctly? Any advice is much appreciated. I'm not too sure on my hair type as I have heard 2C and and 3A (sounds unlikely) but I am inclined to believe my hair is low porosity?\n\nShampoo: John Frieda Frizz ease dream curls\nConditioner: \"                                                          \"\nStyling: John Frieda curl definining cream and reviving moose\nI diffuse my hair on occasion and let the rest air dry\nI use a silk pillowcase",

Outwardly, i dont think people perceive my nose in a negative manner, in fact sometimes i get complimented on it. But i personally have never liked my nose, and i want to change it. I  dont want to undergo the surgical rhino route for various reasons (mainly cost), but i have heard negative talk around non-surgical/liquid rhinoplasties. I think nose filler would be more suitable for me in theory, because i dont mind increasing the volume within my nose (which is what filler would do) - i just want the change to be slightly different. \n\n  \nMy nose, and face, in general is super asymmetrical, so i was wondering if fillers would help with this? i have a very undefined nose tip, which i know would be better to undergo surgical rhino or nasal tip plasty - but again i do not have the funds or means for that. Overall i would just like a more defined look from the front, and a more lifted side profile (slight swoop from tip). If there are severe medical risks involved with this procedure, what should i know going moving forward, and are my requests even achievable??\n\n",

I’m about 70% sure I have curly hair. If that’s wrong, feel free to tell me straight up.\n\nRight now, I’ve been using Not Your Mother’s shampoo and conditioner. I also picked up VO5 shampoo for the co-wash, though I’m still not entirely sure how to use that properly. I’ve only used it once. I bought Eco hair gel and tried it yesterday by using two finger dabs and working it through my hair. I’ve been reading the beginner guides and trying basics like scrunching, but after showering I usually just let my hair air dry.Also, I was told to get curly mousse, can anyone explain how exactly this is different from a hair gel,(I'm an idiot cut me some slack). The order I apply is that typically I do conditioner  wash shampoo wash conditioner again wash then I dry my hair with a towel by patting my head then on non wash days I only apply conditioner.\n\nI’ve heard a lot about leave-in conditioner, and I’m wondering if I’m messing up by rinsing all the conditioner out instead of leaving some in. If I was to leave some in how much should I leave in or is leave in conditioner another different type of conditioner you are meant to apply only after the shower.\n\nMy main concern is that I’m planning to get a haircut in the next two weeks, and I’d really appreciate advice from people who know more about hair than I do. I don’t know much about it. Throughout high school I mostly got buzz cuts because my hair grew fast and my dad wanted to keep it simple.\n\nI’m in college now and want to try something that actually suits me. I don’t want it super long because I do not want frequently get a haircut, but I also really dislike extremely short hair. Buzz cuts especially. I always felt like I looked like an egg. In the past, I usually preferred my hair a bit longer than shorter for that reason because I didn't really feel insecure about it.\n\nOne friend suggested a fade, but he also said he is not really an authority on what to do here since he has wavy hair himself.If it helps after talking to same friend I've determined that my hair is 3A/3B in quality(correct me if I am wrong as always) and I have a rounded face type.\n\nAny suggestions for haircuts, routine changes, or things I’m doing wrong would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nTLDR Newbie to hair care, looked at curly girl, not sure about difference between stuff like curl mousse and hair gel. Plan on getting a haircut that is not a buzz cut for once and wanted some advice on what to do,how to cut it, what kid of looks/cuts to pursue, and look for.",

So since tomorrow is a very important day I figured id reach out for help today. For context I am a puerto rican male with short, 3c-4a i think, hair and according to the water cup test I have EXTREMELY low porosity hair. i do not have anyone at all to talk to about my hair so im kinda in this on my own. My dad is the only one who has kinda my hair type but he don’t know what he doing any more then me lol! (he literally uses relaxers as hair cream every day). I am also gonna try to put images below to give whoever is reading this a visual. So basically right now im tryna use the SKALA mais crespinhos (i think thats what its called) hair cream for leave in. the thing is i want my hair to be kinda defined and i honestly have no idea how to use it. I tried to search for so many videos of people using it but all of them either 1.dont have my hair type or 2. have long hair that they can section easily to get good curls. I also noticed though that when i kinda add regular conditioner when washing my hair and pick at it like a afro pick but with my hands, instead of like raking it, it looks not too bad. anyways latley I’ve been trying to follow this video i found with the SKALA.https://www.youtube.com/shorts/\\_6QTIT1jYsk ,But his hair is longer so he can section it and also whenever i try to finger curl my hair like that i can never seem to find my curls that easily since my hair is SUPER thick. anyways im sorry for rambling so much hopefully someone can understand this message, but what I mean to ask is if anyone has a routine i can do for tomorrow using the products I have which are the SKALA cream. echo styler gel and water ig. I don’t mind anyone recommending other products but again since I have to have my hair ready tomorrow I would appreciate a routine i can use with the stuff i have. \n\n\n\nOk so I just realized while reading this over that I didn’t really explain clearly what I need but im to lazy to edit all that so basically i just need someone to explain how I can use the products I have to actually make good defined nice curls (not wet curls). If anyone can reach out to me here i would appreciate it so much. Sorry for the long message too lol.",

(possible that they’re normal but high enough for me to cause bacne?? don’t know much about this sort of thing honestly).\n\nbut i am wondering what the likelihood of success might be with trying to apply something topically that blocks dht or that acts as an androgen receptor blocker at the skin level to reduce oil production. there seem to be some options like EGCG or i think funegreek that might do this. i am just wondering if this might be an easier and potentially less irritating option that tret. has anyone looked into this? is there any possibility something like this might work?",

I bought a nice silk tie on bonnet from a shop on Amazon with good reviews. It’s worked for a while but since I got a pixie cut recently, like a month ago, and I’ve noticed my hair falling flat, I used to have mid length hair for context. And I have no idea what a refresh routine is, I got curlier hair as I got older. \nI have a few questions since I don’t really know who to ask:\nMy first one is that I saw a TikTok where the size of the bonnet matters due to hair length, and that a small bonnet would suite shorter hair. Is that really true?\nMy second question is that does anyone have any bonnet recommendations for people who move around at night? I tried to tie my bonnet tighter but that just leaves migraines and red marks.\nThanks for the help!",

It gets to the point where the oil literally irritates my eyes and makes them feel uncomfortable.\n\nThe thing is, In the morning after cleansing, it feels very dry. It has that tight/itchy feeling like it’s dehydrated or stripped. But then it becomes super oily by the end of the day. I’ve tried following a gentle routine of using gentle cleansers and moisturizers but it doesn’t seem to be helping. If anything it’s worse when I have moisturizer on because then not only is the oil migrating into my eyes but the moisturizer is as well making them sting even more badly.\n\nI don’t think my skin is truly oily… it feels more like dry/dehydrated skin that’s overproducing oil to make up for the dryness. I hope this makes sense.\n\nAny advice?",

Even after straightening, it gets frizzy as soon as I go outside. I’ve tried sulfate-free shampoo, deep conditioning, leave-in products, and anti-frizz serums, but nothing works.\n\nMy classes are starting soon and I don’t want to cut my hair, but I really don’t know what to do.
