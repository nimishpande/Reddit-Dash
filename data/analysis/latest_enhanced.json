      "content": "To start off on routine, i have been using New Wash by hairstory as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner for about a year now. (I hadnt used shampoo and conditioner for a YEAR 😭)\n\nI would also use their balm to style. Occasionally i used curlsmith hold me softly and in shower gel, as well as not your mothers curl talk foam to refresh. Id let my hair air dry, sleep with it in a bun (which is why its so frizzy all the time), and rewet it every morning using a bit of the styling products. \n\nLast year, i went to a new hairdresser who recommended new wash to me. I liked what it did to my curls, so i got what she used on me. Unfortunately, she didnt explain that it was a cowash (hairstory doesnt really explain either) and essentially framed it as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner. I was not aware of how cowashes work or how they should be used (i am still confused tbh)\n\nHere i am, a year later, with insane scalp build up and significantly thinner hair (said hair dresser also decided to give me a mullet i did not ask for 🥲). \n\nBefore this, i was putting in a lot of effort into my hair. I used hairtage for shampoo and conditioner, would use not your mothers mousse, the curl smith products i mentioned, and Silk by biosilk. i cant remember if i air dried or diffused in the fourth photo. \n\nFirst photo is most recent using hairology, miss jessie’s leave in and a curl cream, and diffused. Second photo is when i still used just new wash and was after my most recent cut. Third is an average day side profile while still using new wash. Fourth is my routine before new wash. Fifth is what it looked like on an average day. \n\nI think my hair is 2c/3a high porosity(pls confirm or deny) and now it is low density (it used to be so thick 😭). \n\nIm looking for advice and recommendations for shampoo and conditioner. I need to tackle my scalp build up above everything else. \nI also want my curls to stay curled longer. I think i will try using mousse but maybe not gel due to the weight. I think i will get one of those curl shaping brushes as well.\nIve also never found a solution for sleeping with my hair. Every bonnet ive tried has scrunched up my hair or has slipped off at night, but putting it up is causing so much damage. I cant use a satin pillow case for sensory issues. \n\nSuggestions welcome ❤️\n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I have spent $100 at least on products. None of them are helping. This is my current showing routine. \n\nI wash my hair 2-3 times a week. I’ve tried showering more and less, that hasn’t helped. \n\nI section my hair. I start with the low back part and I scrub each side for 3-5mins and each section for 6-10mins total. When I do the sections towards the top I also comb them over to make sure I’m washing the bottom. \n\nProducts I use are clarifying shampoo 1x a week. I use Malibu. I normally use a silicone free water based shampoo or Pantene clean. I have the best luck with Pantene clean. \n\nNo matter how much or how little I scrub, section, or change products I see no change. My hairstylist is the only way I ever get my hair clean. \n\nAny advice is appreciated I’m desperate for answers. ",

      "content": "Hello! I need advice on my wavy hair. I know I have wavy hair, but have no clue how to style it to wear and keep it wavy. I’ve used curl products but they just make my hair look greasy. This is 75% dry after being air dried post-shower; no product. Any product recommendations or suggestions would be great. I have naturally frizzy hair too so I don’t know how that plays into it. Whenever I go out in the heat it almost immediately frizzes up somehow even if I style it smooth with a blow dryer. Also, I use a silk pillow case. I usually pull it up in a loose bun (if it’s not wet) to sleep at night with a scrunchie.Thank you and happy new year everyone 😌🫶🏼\n\nMy Hair Routine:\n\nProducts I use every other day or every 2 days on my hair:\n\n-Native shampoo and conditioner \n-Once a week “It’s a 10” leave in conditioner \n\nProducts used to try and style it wavy before:\n\n-OGX Curl cream\n-Curl mousse (can’t remember brand) \n-Diffuser attachment on wavy talk hair dryer ",

      "content": "21M with oily, acne-prone skin.\n\nMy skincare journey started around August 2023. I began using only **Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid Cleanser** and **Pilgrim Vitamin C serum**. I did **not** use any moisturizer or sunscreen at that time.\n\nAfter the Vitamin C finished, I switched to **Minimalist Niacinamide serum**, but I noticed my skin actually got worse. Over time, I kept starting and stopping skincare randomly. For almost 2 years, I was basically just using the salicylic acid cleanser without proper moisturizing or sun protection.\n\nAfter researching, I now realize that skipping **moisturizer and sunscreen** probably damaged my skin barrier.\n\nI stopped all skincare for 1–2 months and recently restarted. I don’t plan to visit a dermatologist due to bad past experiences and lack of good dermatologists in my city.\n\n# Current Routine:\n\n**AM**\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n* JOY Almond &amp; Honey Body Lotion (on face)\n* Deconstruct Gel Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n* JOY Almond &amp; Honey Body Lotion (on face)\n* Minimalist Vitamin K + Retinal Under Eye Cream (for dark circles)\n\nFrom my research, a **simple 3-step routine** seems best:\n\n* AM: Cleanser + Moisturizer + Sunscreen\n* PM: Cleanser + Moisturizer (+ retinol later)\n\nI’m thinking of **changing my moisturizer**, since I’m currently using a body lotion on my face.\n\nI’m not in a rush at all — even if it takes **1–2 years**, I just want my skin to heal properly.\n\n**Looking for suggestions on:**\n\n* Whether my current routine makes sense\n* If I should stop or limit salicylic acid\n* Moisturizer recommendations for oily, acne-prone skin\n* When (or if) I should introduce retinol\n\nAny help would be really appreciated 🙏",

The top really easily flattens the bottom. I’m not sure curl types are that helpful but identifying what’s going on here might be? \n\nIt used to be straight but now if I treat it like that, it gets super frizzy and still waves/curls randomly especially on top. \n\nRoutine:\n\n\\- L’Oréal bond shampoo/ouai fine hair shampoo, everyday or 2/oaui detox shampoo once a week. I use keracolor cleanditioner right now, usually I shampoo after conditioner to avoid weigh down.\n\n\\-scrunch in r+co high five shine and moisture cream and sometimes colorwow volume and texture spray, diffuse(mostly hover) or air dry. Diffusing makes it slightly curlier vs air dry.\n\n\\-I use aphogee protein treatment (the kind you don’t have to blow dry), my hair loves protein and is somewhat damaged. I’ve noticed it curls/waves more after that. I use olaplex no 3 and k18 leave in inconsistently.\n\n\\- I’ve been cutting my own hair for about a year. Going for a short wolf cut sort of thing.  ",

BUT IN THE END I STILL HAVE FRIZZ.\n\n( I tried using beaver tea tree conditioner aswell to my roots and to my ends it just made my hair softer)\n\nmy goal is to have a nice wolfcut when my hair gets long but Im trying make my medium lenght hair look healthy and good in the first place, Im worried that all this growing might go to waste because I couldn’t take care of my hair",
