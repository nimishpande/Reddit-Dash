      "title": "What is the science behind 'less damaging' hair dryers such as the Dyson?",
      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I put a small amount of leave in conditioner right after the shower, some heat protection spray, and a small amout of light hold mousse.

Pictures just taken with flash in sunlight (cheek, nose, forehead). I did my morning routine literally 2 hours ago and I’m already getting oily. This isn’t nearly as bad as it’ll be just an hour from now. It gets to where I can literally run my finger across my face and my fingertip comes back shiny and slick from the oil. I need it to stop, it looks and feels so gross.\n\nAlso, as you can see, I’m still getting breakouts at 27 years old. I know nothing can be done about the huge pores/orange peel skin, but I’d love to not break out like a teenager and minimize the appearance of the pores if I can. I also wouldn’t mind recommendations to minimize the appearance of the forehead wrinkles, because for as much as I feel too old for acne and oil, I feel too young to be walking around with deep lines. \n\nWhat should I add/get rid of/swap? It’s by my biggest insecurity to the point I don’t even like leaving the house when my skin breaks out. I wear makeup twice a month at most, and really nothing on my skin when I do except a little concealer if I have inflamed acne. I don’t have a huge budget for expensive products, so the cheaper the better as long as it’s still effective. But I’ll splurge if I absolutely must. ",

      "content": "I know it’s normal for curl patterns to change over time, but mine is happening VERY quickly over the course of the past month. Bear with me, the routine and situation is wordy\n\n*Photo 1 is my hair right now—it’s been finger combed, but not brushed. \nPhoto 2 is my hair before I finger combed it, after I’ve done more normal air drying routine\nPhoto 3 is what my hair looked like last month, before all of this started*\n\n1) I have historically had what my friend (who’s a stylist) and I understood to be 2b hair with some sections that looked a little more 2a (photo 3 is my hair literally last month)—we’ve had a running joke about how odd my hair is, because it responds *very* favorably to heavier products intended for natural textured coily and kinky hair…despite being fine and wavy. It has defied logic, in that way, because everything I’ve read would suggest that this should be “too heavy.”\n\n2) She gives me a blowout every time she dyes my roots, but I otherwise *seldom* blow dry and opt to air dry my hair. Sometimes I hit the roots with a diffuser after some air drying, but blow drying has historically made it *much* frizzier and appearing damaged, even with heat protection products. Standard 2b shit.\n\n3) I use EVO root lifter (I have both kinds), EVO liquid rollers curl cream, Joico color therapy leave-in spray and a small bit of emu oil on the ends. When my hair has fully dried in the curl casing, it usually looks a bit more like 2c hair; I brush it out with a boar bristle brush and tidy up with a smidge of Moroccanoil. If I don’t brush it out like that, my hair has a tendency to knot up into itself and brushing it out has been the only way to look like I meant for my hair to look this way\n\nTLDR is here: Suddenly, in the past four weeks or so, the under layer of my hair has decided to coil. **Hard.** Beyond the shape changing, it’s now behaving like properly curly hair—brushing it at all makes the texture feel wiry and it puffs up into a horrible mess. Air drying doesn’t appear to be a totally viable methodology now, either. This is entirely new and it appears to be spreading!\n\nNot only do I have no idea how to care for properly curly hair, but why is this happening so quickly? Am I missing something? How the hell do I take care of hair that’s half wavy, half curly? Someone recommended a Denman brush—which one?! HELP\n",

My question is at the end because I'm giving a lot of background info. \n\nCurrent routine: Shower 2-3x a week, Garnier Fructis Grow Strong shampoo (scalp) followed by Garnier Fructis Grow Strong conditioner (all hair), brushing while conditioned. After I wrap my hair in a towel (not microfiber yet) for a short while, then air dry.\n\nUntil recently (past 2 or 3 years until a couple weeks ago) I was not conditioning nearly enough and was dry brushing a lot especially on days I didn't shower. I thought that you only get nice curls on shower days lol.\n\nI think I need new products, some years back I was using different shampoo and conditioner (no other products) and got WAY nicer curls. \n\nHair is fine texture, medium density and my best guess is medium porosity. For a while my hair has been somewhat curly, somewhat wavy with a few coils here and there and a few wavy/straight limp bits sometimes. Depends on the wash. \n\nOther notes: I'm pretty sure I need a trim, haven't had one for a couple years as I've been growing it out. Haven't dyed my hair for a while, I'm pretty sure that everything that has been dyed has been cut off by now but I could be wrong. Have only used a weak hair dryer like 2 or 3 times in the past year.\n\nMy question is: My hair has been curling really well in the front (not as tightly as I think it can but well defined and looks healthy) but the back ALWAYS looks like a rat's nest. Scraggly, rough, frizzy, undefined. Is this because I'm not distributing the conditioner well enough, or some other reason? \n\nAlso, if anyone has any other recommendations for me I'd appreciate hearing them. Thank you!",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m hoping for some help and guidance as I start trying to embrace my natural curls after many years of straightening. I’ve been straightening my hair for about 20 years (usually around 3 times a week), and I think it’s finally time to step away from the heat and see what my curls can do.\n\nMy main goals right now are to improve the overall health of my hair and figure out how to manage and style my curls so I can feel more confident wearing them out. One thing I struggle with is that my hair has really thinned out since having my daughter 7 years ago. My hairline has receded a bit, and I find that it’s more noticeable when my hair is straight. I’d love to learn how to make my curls work in a way that helps disguise this a little more naturally.\n\nRight now, my curls are pretty inconsistent. I get ringlets underneath, but the top layer is mostly waves, and there’s very little curl from the roots. It also tends to look stringy and frizzy, and it always feels super knotted no matter what I do (especially on refresh days.) \n\nI’m still getting used to using products because my hair usually feels kind of dirty or weighed down after I put anything in it. I’m not sure if this is just what curly hair feels like or if I’m doing something wrong.\n\nI have a bunch of products already and would really love some help figuring out how to experiment with what I have before buying anything new. Here’s what I currently have:\n\t•\tShampoo \n\t•\tClarifying shampoo\n\t•\tConditioner\n\t•\tLeave-in conditioner\n\t•\tCurl cream\n\t•\tCurl defining lotion\n\t•\tMousse\n\t•\tGel (I don’t find gel works as well for me as mousse - volume wise)\n\t•\tAveda humectant oil\n\nMy usual routine is: wash and condition, apply either the cream or lotion plus mousse on soaking wet hair, plop for a bit, and then diffuse to about 90% dry. I sometimes use the aveda oil to break the cast. Sometimes I use a curl defining brush, but I’m still learning how to use it well. I often end up pinning my hair back because the top just doesn’t look as curly or nice as the bottom.\n\nIf anyone would be willing to help me come up with a plan to test and rotate through the products I already own, I’d be really grateful. I know everyone’s hair is different, but I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed and unsure of where to start.\n\nThanks so much for reading and for any advice you’re willing to share.\n",

      "content": "As recommended by a friend who used to work in skincare, my current routine is washing daily with the Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser (only once in the morning right now; trying to work up to twice a day but depression makes routines hard) I've been washing my face with this for about 3-4 weeks. Then about twice a week with The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution for 5 mins at a time, which I've been doing for about 2 weeks now. If I do the peel in the morning, I'll go in with a thin layer of up&amp;up Oil-Free Facial Moisturizer with Sunscreen (SPF 15) but if I do it in the evening, I go in again with the Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser before bed.\n\nMy skin has always been clear, never had serious problems with acne just tiny breakdowns (I'm talking one or two pimples) maybe 4-5 times a year. Oil was only a bit of a problem in my T zone but the Cerave product helped with that a lot. My main concern is evening out my facial discoloration (pink in the middle of my cheeks, brown in select areas near my mouth/chin and temples), but even more importantly, trying to get little bumps of skin off my face; they haven't budged since starting. These bumps manifest right under my eye bags going towards my nose but not reaching the bridge. I want my face to be as smooth and soft as possible, I can be fine with the discoloration as I'm also getting into makeup but the little bumps have always irritated me. Any advice, recommended routine changes, or product recommendations would be amazing! And please be kind, I'm in my early 20s, FTM, and only now starting to make a routine of washing my face/anything to do with skincare so I'm still a beginner.",

Some ringlets, some soft curls and some waves (it’s all over the place).\n\nShampoo and conditioner: Thirsty curls Umberto Giannini \nLeave in- cantu tub (can’t remember the name) it’s white with an orange lid\nCurl crème- a tiny bit of Umberto Giannini curl jelly cream  \nGel- cantu curl custard\n\nRoutine:\nHair is soaking wet. Section off my crown. Brush through leave in and curl cream with a denman brush. Then I use the bounce curl definition brush and squish. Repeat for the crown. Then I glaze over with my gel and squish. I diffuse my hair to like 80% dry then air dry. I sleep in my gel cast then scrunch in the morning with oil. \n\nThanks in advance! \n",

I started off with 0.5 but recently realized that my skin doesn’t handle it especially when I am using azelaic acid along with it, so I moved to 0.025%. While this has helped keep those skin flakes at bay, my skin still feels dry and I have mild acne/texture all over my face. \nI’m open to recommendations for moisturizers, ampoules, or in-office treatment.\n\n\nThank you!!\n",

My highlights are pretty warm toned right now and I don’t like warm blonde. A lot of my natural hair colour is still visible and I want to change my colour at home.\n\nI don’t have the time/money to go to a professional right now so I want to box dye it. I kind of want to keep the colour similar to my natural, or slightly darker. Getting rid of the warm blonde is my main concern. I don’t want to be too dark but idk if a lighter brown would cover the blonde?\n\nDoes anyone have advice on what brand or specific colours I should go for to achieve this?\n\nAppreciate any help!",

I’m not sure what’s causing them or how to treat them.\n\nMy skin is dry and sensitive, and I don’t use many products besides a basic cleanser and moisturizer. I’m also a teen, so I’m avoiding strong actives like retinol for now.\n\nI’ll attach a photo for reference. Can anyone tell what this might be or suggest something gentle that could help smooth it out?",
