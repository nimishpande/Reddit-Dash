      "content": "My hair goes through a decent amount of curl shock when it gets cut. I want to keep it trimmed and healthy, but I got into a bad habit of getting my hair cut right when it starts to look really good, and seeing multiple different stylists 😬 2 hair cuts ago, my hair still hadn't recovered after a month. I managed to make little cuts myself and things were looking good (see last post :) \n\nThough it looked good, it was super uneven, so I went and got it cut again 😅 I went to my casual but badass friend who has really similar hair. She did my hair 4 times ago, and it grew out the BEST. So I went back to her. I always get a quick dry cut with no styling, so to be fair, the 1st picture isn't indicative of her technique, but just to show what I was working with.\n\nMy hair has been getting dry and frizzy quicker than normal. I was having a hard time styling it and the curls kept falling. I was worried I got another bad cut. Last night I gave it some extra love! Here is my routine:\n\nPaul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo on the scalp, NYM green tea shampoo on the ends. Squish to rinse. Then I brought back my fave DC, Curls Blueberry Bliss. Kept it on for 5 min. Combed it and squished to rinse. The curl clumps were INSANE! Added a tiny bit of NYM conditioner and rinsed, just for slip. MORE SQUISHING. Glazed on some Kinky Curly Knot Today leave in. \n\nI ran a wet brush through my face framing pieces to smooth them out. My hair is really fine. Spritzed with water. Smoothed in my #1 fave, Treluxe Styling Serum. Then slicked the clumps between my hands with Umberto Gianni Curl Jelly. Some gentle squishing. It was looking like a bit too much product, so I spritzed in more more. Maybe. Little too much lol. It is a delicate dance, water and product, but I ended completely frizz free. At the last second, I scrunched in a tiny bit of Curlsmith Featherlight Protein Cream. \n\nI know thats a lot, but my hair needed it! I diffused on high as long as I could. Pic 1- after hair cut 2nd- 90% dry 3rd/4th - curls in their fluffed and filtered glory. My hair is sooo soft, clean, and well defined. I'm in heaven! ✨️",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

It tends to get worse right after shaving, but even when I have a bit of stubble, the redness and bumps are still noticeable.\n\nI shave traditionally with a straight razor and brush (two passes, lathered shaving cream), keep good hygiene, eat a healthy diet, drink mostly water, and live an active lifestyle.\nI already use aftershave, but my skin still gets irritated and red, and I’d like to calm it down and improve the overall texture.\n\nAny suggestions for products, ingredients, or routines that could help reduce redness and breakouts?\nThanks a lot in advance ",

      "content": "I am 23 years old and took a daily dose of finasteride 1mg for 4 months. During this time I felt that my anxiety had increased a lot. I decided to stop for 4 months, and despite still having a problem with anxiety, I felt an improvement. I reported this to my dermatologist, and she just said that she had never seen a case like this in her entire career and that it could be something else, etc. I asked about reducing the dose but she said it wouldn't have any effect and suggested that I resume the medication to test it, and that's what I did. However, I feel like my anxiety has increased again. Researching, I discovered that many people use smaller doses, such as 3mg per week, 0.5mg per day and others. Has anyone had a similar mental health experience that improved with dose reduction? I'm thinking about doing this mainly because I still have a lot of hair, it's just getting thinner and less dense than normal.",
