      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Nothing created lasting change. \nI wanted to share this because I wish someone had told me sooner. So I also could have saved all my savings🥲\n\nMy skin only started changing when I focused on the gut side of things. I didn’t do anything extreme. I just slowly added:\n\n• more balanced fiber each day (a mix of inulin, resistant starch, psyllium, baobab)\n• more water\n• short walks after meals\n• less snacking all day\n• cutting whey and artificial sweeteners\n\nIt took a few weeks, but my skin became calmer, less inflamed, and I stopped getting those deep, angry breakouts. The texture also evened out way more than I expected. And love the feeling on not having to worry about a new pimple everytime I wake up😭😅",

      "content": "I grew up where it is super dry and moved to a very humid area 5 years ago. I was honestly shocked to find that my hair was actually curly and not just a bit wavy. It's literally been 5 whole years of fighting the humidity, trying to style my hair the way I did growing up, accepting that my hair needs to be treated differently in the humidity, and then doing TONS of trial and error with products and methods and everything. But... I think I may have finally figured it out!\n\nPhoto order:\n\n* Pics 1–2: From about a month ago, feeling absolutely shocked at the curls.\n* Pics 3–4: Years 1 and 3, when I first discovered the curls but was still fighting it.\n* Pics 5–6: Years 4 and 5, embracing the curls stage, but still figuring out the right products and techniques.\n\nI’m still learning, but I finally feel like I’m working with the humidity instead of against it.\n\n(reposting cause I forgot to include my routine, adding below)\n\n# Current Routine\n\n**Wash Day**\n\n* **Shampoo:**\n   * First wash: *Suave Keratin Shampoo*\n   * Second wash: *Kérastase Genesis Shampoo*\n* **Conditioner:** *Kérastase Genesis Conditioner* on ends, fully rinsed\n\n**After Shower (on soaking wet hair)**\n\n* **Leave-In:** *Curlsmith Frizz Control Duo Conditioner* on ends\n* **Heat Protectant:** *Nexxus Heat Defense Spray* throughout\n* **Mousse (at roots):** Currently alternating between:\n   * *John Frieda Frizz Ease Dream Curls Curl Reviver Mousse*\n   * *Curlsmith Invincible Volume Hair Mousse*\n* **Distribution:** Brush products through, part hair, finger-separate large clumps, then scrunch until curls form\n* **Microfiber Towel:** Scrunch to damp using *The Perfect Haircare* towel\n\n**Styling**\n\n* **Gel:** *Curlsmith In-Shower Style Fixer* — applied with praying-hands method, then scrunched\n* **Drying:** Diffuse for a few minutes (mostly scrunch-diffusing up to roots) to set the gel, then air-dry the rest of the way\n\n**Finishing**\n\n* **Hairspray:** *SexyHair Big Spray*, lightly at the roots and around frizzy sections\n* **Break Cast / Soften:** Once fully dry, scrunch out the crunch with *Verb Ghost Oil*\n\n# Refresh Routine\n\nI definitely have NOT figured out a great refresh yet. Right now I just spray my hair damp and scrunch as needed. This re-activates the gel, which can make it crunchy again, so sometimes I use a bit more oil to break the cast.\n\n**Would love refresh tips if anyone has suggestions!**",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI went to the dermatologist today because I wanted to start finasteride. I’ve been using minoxidil for over half a year now with good results. In the Netherlands minoxidil is available without a prescription, but finasteride isn’t.\n\nI intentionally waited to start finasteride because my partner and I had a desire to have children. Now that this is no longer a concern, I figured it was time to finally begin.\n\nHowever, the dermatologist refused to prescribe it. He said that very recent research (&lt;1 year old) showed worrying results regarding male breast cancer as a side effect. According to him, depression was still “manageable” because they could monitor that, but the breast-cancer findings caused him — and apparently the entire medical team in my region — to completely stop prescribing finasteride.\n\nHe also mentioned hearing at a conference about a finasteride topical lotion that includes 15% minoxidil, which he suggested as an alternative. That sounded like overkill to me and honestly made me question his knowledge a bit. He also said there was no difference between dutasteride and finasteride in terms of side effects or their frequency, which added to my doubts.\n\nObviously I assume a doctor should know more than someone like me who gathers info online, but the whole consultation left me feeling like he might not be fully informed on hair loss treatments.\n\nMy question to you all:\nHas anyone heard about this supposed recent study linking finasteride to increased male breast cancer risk? I can’t find anything about it anywhere.\n\nThanks in advance.",

First of all, thank you for being on this sub, I come here regularly to get advice but now I'm at a loss.\n\nI've always had a ruddy complexion. This year, I've started to level up to improve my appearance. Although mostly it's fine, one thing that has eluded me is the redness in my face. I'm outdoors a lot, so during the summer I wear sunscreen and don't seem to have problems. Now that it's cold here (SE USA) and drier than usual (I like my humidity, and so does my skin!), I feel like my cheeks are out of control (and in a bad way).\n\nSo, I'm still outside a lot (walking, hiking, etc.), so I've started to wear sunscreen every day. My dermatologist recommend La Roche Posay moisturizer with SPF, so I added that to my routine. Additionally, I got the DearKlairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream to wear at night.\n\nThe problem is... the redness is worsening. I haven't had acne in years, and never on my forehead, and now all the sudden these red bumps are popping up on my forehead. Plus, it doesn't seem like either of these things is actually helping to moisturize. My skin still feels dry, inflamed, and is redder than it normally is.\n\nI guess my question is: those of you who have experienced this, what do you do? How do you calm reddened skin in the winter without breaking out too? Personally, it's seeming like my minimal skin care routine (castile soap with pure coconut oil after) was working better than the current one, despite not having sunscreen. Please help! What steps would you take? What would your routine look like? Thank you!",

Since it’s so recent, I know I’m limited in how much I can safely change without damage.\n\nFor anyone with color experience: what shades are the *easiest* to shift to from a fresh dark red/violet base?\n\nI’m ideally not looking to bleach but will if necessary. I just want something realistic that a stylist can do in one appointment.\n\nMy goal is to neutralize the violet tones and move into something more natural and flattering for my skin tone. I'm considering something like the last picture, but not sure if that's any easier of a shift than just going back to my natural brunette (medium brown).\n\nAny advice?",

One other time, I ended up with curls but only 2/3 of my hair fell out that time so I had some length. \n\n1- I do not know how to make these curls do individual and weigh them down. Is that even a thing I can hope for at this point? \n\n2- I am a Special Education Teacher and avoid biting my nails ….. so I’ve started spinning my hair when nervous, especially in the back. I don’t want a mullet and I’m afraid it’s getting there. Is this mullet-y?\n\n3-What type of cut can I ask for to make it even up more…. I’d like to have a curly bob in the beard future…. Maybe that will take a long time since it’s so curly though. \n\n4- I’m teaching elementary now and have to go out for recess. What is the best hat for the winter that will not ruin my curls? \n\n5- is there an elongation method for my hair? Can I twist it at night or something? What would that be called? \n\nRoutine- I wash it every other day with curl enhancing shampoo/conditioner. Daily- I spray it down. I use a leave-in conditioner, then a strong mousse, then use my hands to push the curls up. Next, I use a comb to part it and sometimes a little bit of gel to keep the part longer. \n\nPlease, take note of the images. Some are at the beginning of today’s work day (the bottom dries so fast and frizzes up but the rest doesn’t) and the other is after work. ",

I find it hard to find the balance between styling / protecting, heat damage, brushing wet / dry... I think it's mostly breakage, but I can't be sure it's the reason I have to tie my hair with more loops than before. Do you have any advice? Styling products that are not very heavy are super drying for my hair... 😭😭😭🤸‍♀️\n\nFirst photo is my hair just washed, brushed and leave in conditioner (pretty bad day, but well, it shows the damage), second one is my hair styled.\n\nMy routine is not consistent with products really, since I try to find what works... If I wash daily, I use a moisturising shampoo, when every two-three days, I use a stronger one. I use protein/humectant conditioners and curl creams. Mousse don't last, I recently quit gel because it dried my hair so much. I also have a hair oil for my ends. I think my hair is high porosity, it just poofs at the first drop of rain and drinks oils like crazy 🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "I am looking for skincare advice out of pure desperation at this point.\n\nI have had moderate-ish acne off and on since I was a kid (F, now early 20s, US), all in my T-zone with lots of redness. I have combination skin that leans more toward the oily side. My routine is pretty simple (by design) because I have touchy skin: I just use Vanicream Gentle facial cleanser and Cerave daily moisturizing lotion twice daily. I have an rx for tretinoin 0.1% that I use at night and have been prescribed for a couple years, but my skin basically refuses to respond to anything topical (unless it's pissing it off more). I tried using it before the moisturizer for a few days and that did not go well, so I'm doing cleanser, moisturizer, then tret at night currently.\n\nWhile some of it is definitely hormonal, my current birth control is not something that I'm willing to get off of in the near future because it has had such a tremendous impact on my mood and no *worsening* of my acne.\n\nAccutane was a godsend once my derm said she had no other options and I agreed to it. My skin looked GOOD for the first time in my adult life. It helped with oiliness and didn't dry me out too much, but a couple years after finishing the course, it feels like I'm back to square 1. I am looking into restarting it, but that's it's own struggle (gotta love American healthcare).\n\nNOTE that I have tried literally every topical treatment you can think of... adapalene, benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, salicylic acid... nothing touches it or even dries me out much. I've done spironolactone and antibiotics... and nothing works. My diet is considered healthy and I already have celiac so I can't afford to cut anything else out. At this point I'm just trying to not piss it off MORE because I've lost hope trying to treat it locally.\n\nIs there anything in my routine that could be improved considering I'm staying on tretinoin for the time being (so no other exfoliants)? I can't afford anything expensive but obviously what I'm doing now isn't working very well, so I'm open to ideas.\n\nThanks:)",
