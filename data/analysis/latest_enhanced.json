I've tried a few things, this is my current best, and wow it's an improvement. I'm low-key shocked that my hair is this curly??\n\nI'm trying my best to take care of my hair while also navigating what's bullshit or just OTT. I also don't actually know if I like how this looks? I feel like it looks straggely? Am I just not used to it yet or am I right that it's not as fluffy natural hair looking as I would expect?\n\nThis is about 5 mins after finishing my *new* routine:\nShampoo (kerastase oily roots dry ends) just roots X2\nConditioner (just used tresemme this time but ordinarily kerastase colour protect) mids to ends, let sit 5 mins.\nOnce a month I skip conditioner and do k18 leave in conditioner (sometimes I do it more rarely, p.s. it says on the bottle to skip conditioner)\nI then added Umberto Giannini curl jelly raked through my hair and then scrunched and diffused (high heat, low speed)\nThat's it. I usually spray a little hair oil (nix?) on the ends but this curl jelly has made all my hair look almost too shiny? Is that just me?? So I skipped the oil this time.\n\nThat's it. I struggle with hygiene so this is about my max for how much effort I can put in. I use a detangler/tangle teaser rip off hairbrush. And I get my colour done professional by a colour specialist. \n\nDoes this look good and I need to just adjust or am I right that something I can't put my finger on looks off?\n\nAlso hair cut advice please! Bangs looked BAD on me, so maybe don't suggest that (also too much maintenance), I recently got a shag cut which I think I love! But any advice on a cut for my curl type and face shape would be much appreciated!!\n\nThanks so much!!",

Air drying usually takes 2-3 hours which is strangely long for short hair with shaved sides and back.\n \n2nd pic: shampoo, conditioner, curl cream, diffused on medium heat medium intensity.\n\n3rd pic: I decided to add gel to the previous routine before diffusing, and what on earth did I just do? I tried to diffuse it, took me half an hour and it was still soggy in some places. It took me over 12 hours to air dry after that, then I scrunched it and it looked like this.\n\nBefore that (undocumented attempt) I tried using less gel and it did absolutely nothing except for make hair feel icky, no amount of scrunching helped.\n\nI applied gel the same way that I apply conditioner, kind of rake it through my hair with my fingers and then scrunch.\n\nProducts I use:\n\nShampoo: Redken All Soft Mega Curls, although I sometimes use Pirolam when my scalp condition flares up.\nConditioner: Novex Deep Conditioning Hair Mask (the instructions on the jar say it can be used as a conditioner, I tried keeping it on longer like a mask but there's no difference). I rake it through my hair and that's when I also use my fingers to gently detangle it (although it hardly ever gets tangled). Then I scrunch.\nCream: Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream,  applied to wet hair in the same way as conditioner.\n\nMonstrous gel: WS Academy Gel For Waves And Curls (Polish brand that's being marketed as kinda fancy). Applied in the same way as above.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the gel just has too much stuff in it and I would probably get better results with a simpler formulation. Or maybe I should ditch the curl cream and just try the gel alone. Honestly I'm losing my mind and feeling I'm throwing money into a black hole of pointless experimentation, please help me make the experimenting less pointless üòä\n\nBonus 4th pic: random cute pic of the \"protective\" topknot  I wear when cooking, painting, DIY, or when it's hot outside. I also sleep in it sometimes (the scrunchie is silk) . I generally do my best to sleep in a silk headscarf, it's life-changing because without it my head looks like an exploded pot of pasta on the next day.\n\nFun Fact: I also have a jar of Inebrya Ice Cream Keratin Restructuring Mask but it also does the opposite of what it's supposed to do, turns hair into straw. I guess my hair already has enough protein.",

Either way, I'm careful with my products and try to use items that won't irritate my skin. However I've run into an issue where I've tried as much as I can where I've tried cutting out parabens, fragrances, pore clogging ingredients, and use gentle cleansers after trying salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide products. None of these items have made a change as I have tried multiple moisturizers and cleansers over the years with little to no effect. This includes ones with and without ingredients listed above.\n\nThe only thing that seems to help is when I apply hydrocortisone (I know I'm not supposed to, I only do it when it's really bad and only for 2 days before waiting usually weeks to months before using it again). It does not stop the acne fully because I never use it long enough to do so, but it seems to drastically decrease it. Does anyone know why? Or an alternative I can use so I don't get TSW or thin my skin out.\n\nI'm on my last leg and going to very carefully try retinol but after this I'm at a loss.",

I tried so many anti-aging products, serums with peptides, retinoids, you name it, but I never saw the results I was hoping for, and sometimes it just irritated my skin.\n\nAbout three months ago, I decided to really focus on hydration and gentle anti-aging instead of constantly switching products. I wanted to keep things simple, no harsh actives, just soothing, repairing, and plumping ingredients.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been using:\n\n* La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser  \n* The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 (morning)  \n* Dr. Dennis Gross C+ Collagen Brighten &amp; Firm Vitamin C Serum (PM)  \n* First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Hydrating Serum  \n* Paula‚Äôs Choice Omega+ Complex Moisturizer (AM/PM)  \n* Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream (for extra hydration at night)  \n* EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 (AM)  \n\nIt‚Äôs been about three months, and I‚Äôve noticed my skin feels so much more plump, smooth, and radiant. Fine lines are definitely less noticeable and my skin feels deeply hydrated and healthy. I tracked everything with an app, mainly for photos and routine logs.

I‚Äôm not sure why . I visited a dermatologist, and she recommended minoxidil, saying I‚Äôd likely lose my hair anyway within five years.\n\nInstead of immediately addressing it, I decided to grow my hair long one last time and let it grow for a year. The first photo shows what my hair looked like during that time.\nHaving long hair made it easier to ignore the balding, but I noticed my hairline receding significantly. So, I spent two months researching extensively and finally decided to fully shave my head on June 30, 2025. I also started the following routine:\nFinasteride 1.25 mg/day\nKetoconazole 2% shampoo twice a week\nRosemary oil with a dermaroller once a week\nSupplements (biotin, zinc, magnesium)\nI haven‚Äôt experienced any shedding phase so far.

I never had any acne or severe pimples, nor did I faced any other major skin problems so I never thought there was a need for me to use skincare until recently. \nI might have gotten a slight tan cause it's been two months I started college so I have to face the harsh sun for long hours and everyone around me is saying my skin colour has gone 1 shade darker TT \nI even noticed very small bumps(?) on my forehead and cheeks. They are not visible but can be felt if I touch my face. \nI have tons of whiteheads on my nose too :( \nAnd lastly I have dark circles but I genuinely don't wanna use eye creams as I heard they're mainly for adults (?). So can someone just clear my doubt if I can leave my dark circles alone or should do something about it.\nI have combination skin btw. \nAn imp note, I'll prefer affordable recommendations as my dependent self doesn't have tons of money. \n\nMy main concerns are : \ntanning - a sunscreen \ndullness - a good cleanser/face wash\nwhiteheads and bumps - a serum perhaps?\nmoisturizer \n",

So that's what we should look for when buying a sunscreen.\n\nI'm not super rich so anything above Rs. 1000 is too expensive for me. I tried looking up but Minimalist Light Fluid Sunscreen and Lakm√© Sun Expert seem to be the only Indian sunscreens available on Nykaa that claim to be tested with the global standard.\n\nAre there any other sunscreens available that claim to be tested with the same standard? As consumers, we should demand for higher standards and transparency from companies.\n\nBackground: I personally use UV Doux as its highly recommended in this sub for oily skin but I checked and that doesn't post details about its testing either.",
      "content_preview": "I recently came across a post mentioning the globally accepted standard for sunscreen SPF testing is ISO 24444:2019. So that's what we should look for...",
