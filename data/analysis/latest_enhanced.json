      "content": "I feel like my whole life, curly hair isn't something that society deems professional or beautiful.\n\nGrowing up, my mum and other older adults in my life were constantly telling me to straighten my hair. Or like\"do you even brush your hair???\" Giving me endless products that stop frizz. Telling me how much nicer I looked when I straightened my hair. This still happens today.\n\nIt feels like looking after my curly hair takes so much effort just to make it even look presentable. A straight-haired goddess just walks out of bed with effortless-looking, shiny, smooth long locks. \n\nIt will take me half an hour to wash using my routine.  Pre-shampoo (Garnier Fructis Curls Method Shampoo), double shampoo. Conditioner (Natural Look curls boost). Leave-in Conditioner (Garnier Fructis, 3-in-1 Hair Mask). Mouse (SHEA MOISTURE Coconut and Hibiscus), then gel, scrunching and praying hands, and then diffusing (plus a few hours to dry since my hair is so thick). By the time it's all done, it's the evening, and it looks nice for a few hours. I use a stain pillow, but the next day it's all crumpled and sad looking, so it's like all the effort for nothing.\n\nI feel so self-conscious going out with my natural curls. I feel like people look at me as if I do not look after myself when my hair is naturally curly. For events, there is always pressure to straighten or heat-curl my hair.\n\nI do get comments from people who really like my natural curls, but I feel like the majority of people aren't impressed.\n\nJust wondering if it gets easier, and if you've found you sort of grown into your curls more. Thank you.",

      "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m 19M and I started getting random hives around my body starting about a week or two ago. I had a history when I was younger of getting hives, but it kinda just started going away from what I’m aware of. Now all of a sudden I started getting them again, but I have no idea why. Nothing in my diet has changed, I’m not overly stressed, and I haven’t been using any specific skincare solutions or products. It happens at random times of the day, on random parts of my body from my legs to lower back to wrists and arms.\n\nAny advice, help, or direction would be greatly appreciated because this is becoming a real annoyance in my day to day and ruining my comfortability when I try to go to sleep. I believe I also have seasonal allergies so maybe that has something to do with it? Or maybe the dryness in the air? It’s just weird because none of this occurred last year. Thank you",

I see the potential, but I have no idea what to do to elevate what my hair already wants to do lol\n\nThis is my hair now when it dries naturally. I showered last night and it air dried over a towel. I lift my hair up over the pillow/towel so it’s not under my head while I sleep. My hair is also layered. \n\nMy normal routine is:\nDove Shampoo with Dove conditioner. \nAn occasional hair mask for dry hair-just the ends (it’s been dyed a lot and the ends are the last of what’s left of my last dye job)\nEvery other evening I do overnight leave in conditioner (just the ends)\nIn the morning when I want it to curl a little more, I spray in leave in conditioner (just the ends) because when it gets wet it curls.\n\nHelp! ❤️\n\n",

I thought there might hopefully be some new products that have entered the market :)\n\nI’ve had keratosis pilaris on my legs and arms my entire life, have tried First aid beauty and Cerave SA, nothing works. I figured id try this amlactin thing  now that I’m in Canada for a few months. But im finding it hard to obtain (for a reasonable price) and was hoping anyone could recommend a similar product that works as well, or if amlactin is the holy grail, where to obtain? \n\nThank you all. Any other advice regarding KP is so appreciated, I have purchased those Korean Scrub mitts, hoping they will help a little at least\n\nIll insert a pic of my arm (im embarrassed to do so tbh), but my legs basically look the same, it just felt too intimate to post lol",

Around the 4 week mark on creatine, I have noticed improved mental clarity and calmness, as well as a small strength boost in the gym.\n\nI have however, noticed my hair texture is feeling thinner and flatter, as well as more hairs in my hand when I rub my head. I’ve taken photos of my hairline and crown each week, and comparing them it doesn’t look much different at all. I’m a bit unsure if I should continue taking creatine or not, considering the benefits I’m seeing from taking it.\n\nWhat is everyone else’s experiences here?",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

She even listed all the products so I could get them and recommend substitutes. So here is my current routine, the same routine she gave me to get these curls. 1)Wash: I use shea moisture shampoo and conditioner with warm but not hot water. 2) Style: I go section by section with a leave in, (curls smiths), a gel (innersence) and the wet brush. I can’t describe the motion I do with the brush but it s like brushing and twisting it at the same time. 3) Dry: She used a salon grade dryer but recommended I use a diffuser but not touch my hair with it just hover around it until it’s completely dry. 4)Serum: I break the gel cast with innersence serum. She was very specific about using a serum not an oil. I do all of this but my curls never come out like hers. Am I missing a step? Mine come out very frizzy no solid or strong curls. ",

I didn't visit any dermatologist for this; I knew what they would prescribe me and the expensive products. Being a teenager, not only do I not earn much (and that too is sometimes I do, sometimes I don't), but also I didn't want my parents to spend a luxury for my skincare. So I did my research, or whatever you'd like to call it, and started using my savings to purchase all these products one by one from a generic pharmacy. \n\n**Slide 1: Prior to May 17, 2025**  \nAM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra\n\n**Slide 2: Prior to August 26, 2025, till Sept 2, 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: AcMist  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nActive: Adapalene 0.1%\n\n**Slide 3: From Sep 3 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC (Using this as a moisturiser base provides better sun protection.)  \nActive: Azelskin - Azelaic Acid 10%  \nSunscreen: FixDerma Shadow SPF 30 (cheap and gets the job done for me)\n\nIn-between AM/PM (occasionally only if I am at home):  \nCleanser: Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC  \nActive: HQ 4%\n\nElse not at home:  \nSunscreen reapplication\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Minimalist B5 10% Moisturiser  \nActive: Melapik (0.0125% tretinoin, 2% HQ, 1% allantoin) **// Not a steroid cream**\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\nYes, I am aware of the ochronosis risk using HQ. But cycling it, 2 months use (alternative) and then stopping for a few weeks and then starting again will keep the melanocytes sensitive. So I will not encounter any of it, as most side effects happen due to long-term abuse without any protection and carelessness, and I am not at all careless.\n\nAll of the supplements I take are within the safe limits; I will mention the dosage and the frequency in the comments.\n\nI am looking forward to starting microdose isotretinoin. \\~7 mg / day.  \nEven weeks: 20 mg Thrice  \nOdd weeks: 20 mg twice\n\nAvg weekly intake: 50 mg\n\nWill be monitoring my lipid and liver panels every 3-4 months and ensuring they are within the ideal range.\n\nAny review and insights would be helpful.\n\nThank You",
