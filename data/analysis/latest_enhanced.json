Thank you so much for that. \n\nBut I also appreciate all the feedback and took the advise of those who said I probably needed more product in my routine to help hydrate my hair. \n\nI took the time to section my hair and apply leave in and gel to each section. \n\nI used miss jessies curly pudding for my leave in  and not your mother’s curl talk flash gel. I then used my bounce curl to curl each section and finished by defusing my hair. \n\nI still see a bit of frizz at my root so I probably needed a bit more gel there. But over all I’m happy with how my hair turned out for last nights event. \n\nI will say my day two hair is still struggling a bit especially at the root but it was extra foggy this morning and wet so that probably did me in.

I had grown up always just brushing my hair out and then I learned how to use a flat iron and never looked back.. Until I started bleaching my hair. So I decided to put down the heat tools and learn how to do my natural hair.\nMy routine: \n1. I wash and condition with Redken Extreme Length (struggling to grow my hair because with it becoming healthier it also shrinks a lot) and usually do a hair mask every other washday. \n2. I use Sun Bum Leave in Conditioner, Sun Bum Curl Cream, Not Your Mother’s Gel, and a Bounce Curl Volume Brush. I also diffuse my hair upside down (I ❤️ volume) \n3. I scrunch and shake out my hair with Mielle Hair Oil\nI don’t do refreshes, I wash my hair around 2x a week, usually oil everyday, and I sleep in a silk bonnet. I also usually only wear my hair down to avoid breakage. Would love any hair growth tips!! \n",

      "content": "Early male, 20s. I have two toned lips but nothing really helped with that pigmentation, so I'm not gonna talk about it and I made peace with it. I'll review the spf and non-spf ones separately:\n\n#SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Chaptex spf 15 🟢\n\n- My derm prescribed me this when I had extremely dry and cracked lips (turned out to be cheilitis)\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, no fragrance, doesn't taste bitter, has humectant (D-Panthenol)\n\n- Has only spf 15. I see most people suggesting to use at least spf 30 or higher. I wish they made a spf 30 version\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##2. NMFe spf 40 🟢\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, has slight fragrance (I like it), has humectant (aloe vera extract)\n\n- It tastes bitter, that's the only complaint I have\n\n- Overall: 9.5/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##3. Sebamed spf 30 🔴\n\n- Has slight fragrance (didn't like it), very expensive, wasn't that moisturizing\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##4. Minimalist spf 30 (not in the picture) 🟢\n\n- Super cute packaging (but the lid broke after a few months 🥲), fragrance free, has humectant (Hyaluronic acid)\n\n- it's waxy, not quite easy to spread\n\n- Overall: 8.5/10. Will probably repurchase.\n\n___\n\n___\n\n#Non-SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Vaseline lip therapy Creme Brulee 🔴🟢\n\n- The caption under it says *for deliciously kissable lips* which hurts even more because it reminds me I have no-one to kiss 😭💀\n\n- It smells exactly like the Vaseline lip therapy cocoa butter one, it's very hard to differentiate the smell. Quite moisturizing, love the smell obv\n\n- Little heavy on the pocket (probably because it's imported?)\n\n- Overall: 8/10 (subtracted 1 for the caption). WNRP\n\n___\n\n##2. Vaseline skin protecting jelly (indian version) 🟢\n\n- Almost every Indian household has it lol. It's good, does its job\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##3. Vaseline BLUESEAL pure petroleum jelly (imported) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT! I wish they sold this here in India everywhere instead of the skin protecting jelly\n\n- I bought it from Amazon but I was skeptical initially because of the picture the seller put on Amazon lol.\n\n- It's AMAZING! Seals the moisture very well and I also use it for slugging in the night. It's smoother and more buttery compared to the Indian version we get\n\n- I don't use it on the lips alone, I'll be mentioning my current routine which is helped me the most at the end of the post\n\n- Overall: 11/10. WRP! HG\n\n___\n\n##4. Nipcare 🔴\n\n- Bought it at the expense of weird looks from the pharmacy guy (didn't know it is used by lactating mothers for sore nipples)\n\n- It smells really awful (Lanolin, can't complain), didn't really do much for my lips and it's also not easy to spread it\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##5. Laneige Lip sleeping mask (berry) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT 🐐 helped me so much with my dry lips. Not a big fan of that smell but it doesn't bother me. Leaves a white film on lips and I rub the entire thing off in the morning after waking up and there you go, plumpy soft lips!\n\n- It's probably a little overpriced but it lasts really long so can't complain ig\n\n- Overall: 10/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##6. LRP Cicaplast B5 baume 🔴\n\n- I didn't know you can also use it as a lip balm until I read some of the comments here but it didn't do anything for my lips and they felt even more dry in the morning \n\n- it's good as a barrier repair cream tho, helped me with redness and irritation near nose corners when I increased my tret frequency \n\n- Overall: 0/10 for lips, 8.5/10 for barrier repair\n\n___\n\n##7. Vaseline lip therapy tin (cocoa &amp; original) 🟢\n\n- It was a pain in the a*s to open the packaging but I bought the original one recently and it was super easy to open. Glad they changed its packaging (not sure about the cocoa one tho)\n\n- It's thick, does its job as an occlusive\n\n- Both of them are good. The cocoa one smells heavenly but I personally found the original one to be better.\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##8. Vaseline lip care total moisture (tube) (not in the picture) 🟢🔴\n\n- I love the smell, it's amazing! Very glossy finish and hydrates well. Affordable!\n\n- Hard to apply with that spherical base and I don't like touching it \n\n- Overall: 7/10. WRP\n___\n\n##9. Nova ayurvedic cream 🔴\n\n- My grandma suggested me this one. It's good with the hydration part but the fragrance is veryyy heavy and the lips kinda burn initially after application \n\n- Overall: 3/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##Current routine:\n\nAM: NMFe\n\nPM: Laneige lip sleeping mask + Vaseline BLUESEAL \n\nThis routine helped me so much with dry lips. But not applying lip balm for even 1 day makes my lips dry again. My derm suggested that I use lip balm at least thrice a day and asked me to reapply whenever they felt dry. \n\n___\n\n##HONORARY MENTION: Brillare natural coconut lip balm \n\nWHAT DO I EVEN SAY? Hate is a strong word and I hate this lip balm with a passion. The texture of it is ugly af, it literally sticks to my finger. It smells like shit. I have tried applying it only once and was weirded out with the texture but still wanted to try and apply. This idiot doesn't even spread, it's that thick and sticky. THE WORST LIP BALM I'VE EVER SEEN 🏆",

I’ve been balding since I was 17 and now about to turn 26, was also born with a pretty wham forehead.\n\nI decided pretty quick I didn’t like it too much, started taking fin and minox orally from manual.\n\nThe progress has been really good I think, even though I thought this amount of time wouldn’t show much. In this time span I stopped taking creatine, less energy drinks and pre workout too.\n\nI’ve attached some photos of pre-bald and then right after so you can see where I’m at with ‘yesterday’ being the 13 December, both the first and last photo is wet hair.\n\nIn terms of sides, nothing to note. I thought my heart rate increased but my health app hasn’t noticed anything dramatic, maybe a beat or two.\n\n",

I’m a male in my 20s and I’ve always had oily skin and acne. (Though the acne has thankfully gotten a bit better recently after I got sober and changed my diet some.) I wash my pillow cases and sheets every 2-3 days; I never go past 3 days regardless of how busy I am. \n\nI was reading through the sub a bit and saw that too much salicylic acid could worsen it, and should be used with a hydrator as well. I worked at Target when I was younger and typically heard people speak highly of CeraVe. Are these 2 that I attached a good combo? \n\nI’d prefer to buy something in-store instead of waiting however long for something to be delivered. **I’m also looking for whatever I buy to be fragrance free.**\n\nI’m pretty clueless about the whole skin care routine stuff and would hate to worsen my acne buying stuff on a whim. So, I figured I’d ask people that are much more knowledgeable on the topic than myself. I’m open to all advice and would be very thankful. :) (I believe this is the correct post flair.

I don’t know what products actually matter for this style, and the only thing that’s easy for me to find are glitters, but they’re almost always too chunky. I’m specifically looking for that very fine, delicate shimmer, not big sparkles\n\nSo I wanted to ask:\n\nWhat kind of products are usually used for looks like this?\n\nIs it more about toppers, shimmery bases, pigments, or technique?\n\nAre there any key products to start with without buying a lot?\n\nAny advice, product recommendations, or even keywords to search would really help.

As soon as I get home and in the warmth my face starts getting itchy and red and sometimes swells a bit. Looks like super red blotches. Not necessarily a rash but just super irritated red spots. I notice if I cover my face while walking, those areas aren’t as red after, but it’s hard to have everything covered. Today was -12 celsius so it’s super cold but I had on a balaclava so most of the blotchy redness was just the apples of my cheeks where the fabric didn’t cover.\n\nI’m going to get something to wear with more coverage, but I can’t help to think that my skin barrier is just so damaged or something it can’t protect me from the cold/dry air.\n\nI use cetaphil cleanser with a silicone face scrubby, tatcha dewy skin moisturizer and alternate with the inky list ceramide lotion, Sephora brand caffein eye cream and the inky list vitamin c serum. I do shower and scrub my face (silicon scrubby thing) daily because I work out every day but idk if that matters.\n\nIs there anything I can add or replace my routine with to help? Should I see a derm?\n\nTo note I also have psoriasis but I don’t think that’s what this is.\n\nAny help or advice is much appreciated.",

      "content": "Posting in this in case it helps someone else! I have fine curls that when I followed a routine and thought I did everything right most of the time they would not clump, come out stringy, and fall flat and limp and thin. I tried different products in different orders,  on different levels of wetness, etc, and eventually chalked it up to humidity and things out of my control. \n\nI was under the impression that since my curls were fine it was very important to get as much water out of my hair as possible (I almost never diffuse, and airdry instead) as to not weigh them down. After applying my product on wet hair I would use a cotton shirt and scrunch upwards and pulse as much water out as possible. Doing this also removed a lot of product and therefore reduced the hold, and my clumps would get ruined. \n\nAnyone else find this to be the case? What I’m doing now is applying my product to super wet hair out of the shower, use a cotton shirt to scrunch and pulse upwards the same but this time only doing a couple passes, before I would do it continuously until I got it as dry as possible. So my hair now air dries more damp and my routine seems to be working alot better! Not perfect but a good improvement!\n\nHair type: fine, oily\n\nEvery other day: double shampoo roots with garnier curl nourish, (will sub out for Nizoral or ouai detox shampoo as needed based on buildup, usually atleast 1x/week) \n\nAs needed (maybe 1x/month): exfoliate with ouai scalp scrub and scalp brush\n\nOn soaking wet hair in order: Not your mothers leave in spray curl talk conditioner, tresseme extra hold volumizing mousse, and curlsmith in shower style fixer gel\n\nApplication method: with head tilted, rake in and praying hands with tension to form clumps, then gently scrunch upwards only a couple times. Use cotton shirt to scrunch upwards again to absorb some water but not all, and air dry damp, in the morning I scrunched out the cast. I didn’t pineapple or anything over night (it always gave me mixed results)",

My hair used to be huge and voluminous and amazing when it was curly and now it’s thin. My hair is so dry. I sometimes dye my hair dark brown. I cut it on my own because they only cut an inch which I’ve learned how to do on my own because I don’t want to pay $60 for a hair cut personally. It does grow a little bit it’s always damaged and very thin. I lose a little bit of hair whenever I shower. I used to take Nutrafol but it’s so expensive. \n\nIt feels like no matter what I do, it looks like I got electrocuted. I do a hair mask twice weekly, I wash my hair only once a week. I only blow dry my hair once a week, it’s the only thing I do to my hair. The second any humidity hits my hair, the bottom curls. It poofs up the second I go outside and I can’t be in the rain. \n\nI use heat protector, anti humidity spray, smoothing spray before blow drying.\n\nNexus epic shine anti humidity spray, xmondo forcefield heat spray, igk good behavior spirulina protein smoothing spray.\n\nAlso, my hair is thinning and I’m losing hair.

I read that the shampoo I’ve been using isn’t great for everyday washing (I work in a barn and my hair gets disgusting and stinks of horses if I don’t wash it everyday) due to excessive protein. I’m not sure how true it is, but I was hoping to get some advice on different types of shampoo &amp; conditioners that help with growing out my hair, breakage, and shedding. I don’t know what is and isn’t “safe” products, I’ve heard of products leaving harmful films on hair so I would like to steer clear of them. Any suggestions and recommendations would help :) Thank you!",

I have recently met with a curl specialist and she's getting me on the right track, but I won't see her again until February. The sides of my hair are shorter because I used to do burst fades.\n\nThe back curls are chefs kiss and I love them and they're perfect and I wish they were all over. The top of my head...not so much. They are thinner and have a different curl pattern, which causes it to look like I have a piece of lettuce on my head (in my mind). Any thoughts on how to give the top curls more lift? \n\nPics are on wash day, fully dried. Product applied.\n\nLocation: Florida. Hard water. High humidity. Heat.\n\nRoutine: wash every 2-3 days with Innersense Pure Harmony Hairbath. Condition with Innersense Pure Inspiration daily conditioner (only when I wash). A baby spray of Innersense Sweet Spirit Leave In. Then Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Featherlight Volumizing Foam. Diffuse on high heat, low speed hovering the hair. Then scrunch with a tiny bit of Verb Ghost Oil if I feel I need it. If I don't diffuse, I just air dry and scrunch. Sometimes I do a \"raw\" day where I don't put anything in my hair after a wash. Idk if that's allowed Imao, but I do it.\n\nRoutine Bonus: clarify once a month with K18 peptide prep shampoo and innersense detox hair",

We asked her hair stylist and she just said to put leave in conditioner after we washed her but that really hasn't help. Our routine is: regular shampoo and conditioner and then we use a spray leave in conditioner to brush it. Then she goes to sleep and we wake up to a mess of tangles. I have braided it to help mangle the tangles but then her curls dont shine through as well. \n\nI am kind of at a loss for how to manage hair like this and would appreciate any advice. I want her to love her natural hair when she grows up but that tears from the tangles make her want to cut the curls off completely.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
