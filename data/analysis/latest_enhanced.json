I have tried every single type of extension and I have now accepted that my hair needs time to grow. In the meantime, I’d like to wear a wig. My hair is absolutely impossible to style without extensions as it’s flat frizzy broken etc and I’ve seen different hairdressers and I still hate it. \n\nI originally ordered a platinum blonde wig, as this was always my dream to have blonde hair but it looks awful on me. Black is NOT my natural colour - it’s a neutral warm brown. I don’t like honey blonde and would prefer a more alternative look. I feel my undertones are quite yellow which makes it harder for me to choose a colour. Please send suggestions but nothing too plain :) ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I didn't use conditioner back than, so they were very dry.\n\nBUT: Sometimes it really gets on my nerves. If they are open, they tend to hang in my face. I cannot see anything left and right of me and it is annoying in my opinion. It also is not good in my job (videographer, I have to often change my head position, put on headphones etc.). That's why I have them to a half bun like seen in the pictures most of the time. This was also my main goal a while ago: The Jon Snow style. And I think I wear it pretty well. They are just way too long in the back, right? I also think the top might be too long, because the bun is very big (but that could be because of the curls?). \n\nMy problem is, that I tend to look too female with longer hair. I am thin and also big. With long hair, I often get the feeling of not beeing looked at as a man and that's making me feel uncomfortable (especially with open hair).\n\nMy routine:\n\n\\- Wash 2x per week\n\n\\- I use shampoo 2x (Alverde, a cheap one from DM in Germany without any bad things in it)\n\n\\- Conditioner (also the same company) and brush my hair with it in\n\n\\- Dry it a bit with a t-shirt or microfibre\n\n\\- Put in Aloe Vera leave in conditioner (Herbal Essences)\n\n\\- Put in gel and scrunch (I now have one of Rossmann, Isana)\n\n\\- Dry with a diffusor and I try to keep my hair not in the face but back. I sometimes put in a hair band)\n\n\\- I don't dry it completely because I tend to get frizz that way. So I let it air dry the rest.\n\n\\- I sleep with not fully dry hai and I do not use a satin pillow, but I don't think that makes any big problems here.\n\n\\- Sometimes I make them wet and use a product like leave in in the morning.\n\nSo here comes my question:\n\nDo these long hair suit me better than the short ones? Are they TOO long? Should I just cut those in the back a bit more? \n\nOr should I shorten them even more? \n\nThank you everyone!",

The domestic treatment market is already worth roughly **₩188 billion**, which means people are paying anyway; just privately, unevenly, and often late.\n\nFor me what’s interesting is not whether hair loss *should* be covered but what this debate reveals about how we still frame hair loss.\n\nMost healthcare systems treat hair loss as “cosmetic,” even though:\n\n* stress-induced shedding is linked to systemic illness and inflammation  \n* [autoimmune hair loss is, by definition, a medical condition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430848/)\n* [androgenetic alopecia correlates with mental health burden](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10084176/), especially in younger men  \n\nWhen hair loss is ignored, people don’t stop suffering. They just self-medicate, delay diagnosis, or seek care only after damage is harder to reverse.\n\nOf course, South Korea isn’t saying hair loss is fatal but at the same tinme it’s acknowledging that in real life, **biology and social pressure interact**, and pretending otherwise doesn’t make the problem disappear.\n\nWhether public coverage is the right solution is debatable. But the fact that a head of state is even framing [hair loss as a quality-of-life and mental health issue](https://www.washingtontimes.com/sponsored/bullying-acceptance-hair-transplant-changed-life/) is a signal worth paying attention to.\n\nCurious how people here feel:  \n*Is hair loss still “cosmetic,” or are we overdue for a more honest medical classification?*\n\n***References:*** \n\n* *Telogen Effluvium – StatPearls (NIH) — reactive hair shedding after physical or metabolic stress.* \n* *Aukerman EL &amp; Jafferany M.

All the while she is threading my eyebrows she always complain about how thick my hair is. I mean girl that is why I'm here! \n\nThen she'll suggest I just thread my upper lips also. But I tell her to wax it only. Guess what she did today. She was melting the wax for half an hour. Without waiting for the wax to cool down or anything she applied the hot boiling wax on my face. Oh my god it hurt and stung like crazy. And because the wax was too liquid-y, it slipped and fell on my chest. I'm so annoyed rn. I was not crying but tears kept falling out of my eyes. \n\nMY SKIN PEELED OFF BECAUSE OF HOW HOT THE WAX WAS!! \n\nI'm never going back again. I'm going to learn how to take care of my face myself.

      "content": "Hey guys! Just a little rant about my hair journey. Advice is appreciated! Also I just wanted to put this one product out there because I have NEVER seen anyone talk about it!!!!\n\nI have been straightening my hair, or at least neglecting my curly hair almost all my life. I used to be a 3A pattern. There was a very short period of time when I was 12 where I tried to take care of it naturally, and as far as growing up, I was always in braids because my mom didn’t really know what to do with it. In the last 2 years, I have lost a substantial amount of hair due to health reasons—and I lost a a significant amount particularly at the nape/neck area bottom of my hair and following up to my ears. and on top of this I bleached it, so the thought of trying to wear my hair curly scared me even more because its so thin I thought I would look like a scraggly old dog (I kinda do lol).\n\nFor 5 weeks now, I am heat free and trying to get my natural hair back. Ive made good progress! I would say I currently have 2C hair (on a good day where it behaves) when at the start it barely held a curl. Ive changed alot of my habits, I no longer sleep with it down, I oil my hair, dermaroll, braid it, have a silk scarf, silk pillowcase + bonnet, rosemary water, scalp massages, and taking Omega 3 supplements, prenatals (Im serious, they help! Look it up haha), and pumpkin seed + saw palmetto oil. Ive started to only brush my hair in the shower with conditioner in it. I wash my hair with Marc anthony shampoo and condition with marc anthony light volume conditioner, and love your curls deep conditioner once in a while, and i bought a buuuuuunch of hairmasks im cycling through. I have cut my ends and gave myself some face framing layers.\n\nBecause my hair is thin AND fine, it gets weighed down easily. I bought an insane amount of new products to cycle through and figure out what my hair likes. My current Routine and products is as follows:\n\n\\-Pea sized Marc anthony leave in (if i feel that my hair is dry, otherwise the conditioner in the shower will do because my hair is quite soft/soft finish)\n\n\\-Alberto European extra hold styling gel (NOT ALBERTO BALSAM! THIS IS THE PRODUCT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT!)\n\n\\-Love your curls mousse in my roots, and marc anthony mousse for lengths. Yes I do gel before mousse.\n\nI section the crown of my head and brush style, while the rest of my hair i just simply rake and scrunch, then i flip over all sides and just scrunch scrunch scrunch, microfiber towel, and then straight to cup diffusing upside down and then flipping side to side, then finally upright (I find hover diffusing doesnt work out too well for me).\n\nThese are the products that I find work for me out of the other ones I have cycled through and by the way spent so much money on.\n\nI tried A LOT of popular gels. All of them. And then I found the Alberto european one at the bottom of one of my vanity drawers. I must have picked it up 6 years ago when I was trying to take care of my hair and just took the first gel I saw off the shelves.\n\nWhen I tell you, this gel does NOT weigh my hair down (Which, by the way, is INCREDIBLE, because my hair gets weighed down even just by the lightest leave ins ?!) AND it gives me such an amazing hold AND a gel cast if I wish to have one !!!! Wow. Like, I promise, this is a gel thats unheard of and you cant find a single search result for it, but trust me! I love it. It may work for you if you have fine thin hair like me, and it worked well even at the beginning when my hair barely wanted to hold a damn thing. Ill provide a picture.\n\nAnyways, I’m still trying to figure my hair out and I definitely still have a long way to recovering it. Any advice for repairing damaged curls would be soososososo greatly appreciated, and tips for fine/thin curly hair haha still not super mastered at that.\n\n ",

      "content": "I started getting these bumps on my forehead starting this summer. it started off as just one small bump which was very unusual for me as my forehead was never a problem for me. Its been gradually getting worse and I’m not sure what to do. \n\nMy current routine is the Pretty Skin Mugwort toner, anua niacinamide, and anua ceramide moisturize. I’ve been using these products since before my forehead started breaking out. I also use the Cetaphil Salicylic Acid face wash and have been leaving the face wash on my forehead for about 30 seconds per ChatGPT advice. Ive been doing that for about a month and the bumps have gotten worse. I’m not sure if that’s a purging stage and I should continue doing this. \n\nI’ve seen videos about Differin Adapalene Gel and I’m not sure if it would help my skin. I understand that Differin definitely has a bit of a purging stage but I’m not sure if it is right for my skin. The rest of my face is perfectly normal besides my forehead, so I would only apply the Differin to my forehead starting off once or twice a week. I don’t know if this is right for my skin and I don’t want to mess anything up or waste money on unnecessary products.",

I'm finally starting to leave the house again after years of COVID-induced remote work and social isolation, and I'm trying to level myself up. My hair is a similar length and colored similarly to hers, though I'm not sure how close we are in terms of texture and thickness. \n\nI'm obsessed with the wavy hairstyle in these screenshots (in the light blue/purple sweater). How would I get my hair to look like this? I bought one of those three-barrel wavers, and while it gets close, it's not exactly right, but that might be user error. From wet hair--how do I get her look?\n\nI also like the look in the third picture (flannel shirt). Similarly, how do I get this look? I can curl my hair...but I'm not sure I'm placing the curls right or have the right size curler to get this look. What do you recommend?\n\nAlso, if you're feeling generous--how do I maintain throughout the week? Even if I style one day, I don't know how to keep it up the next day. I often end up straightening (because it's fast and easy) or putting it back in a claw clip. \n\nThank you for helping this clueless Redditor with any hair help!\n\n",

Please let me know what you know!\n\n\nImage 1:Darkcircles\n\nIve had them even before but it has increased now. I’m not sure what type of darkscircles they are. Dehydrated? Pigmented? Can it be improved? My dermat suggested a serum but it didn’t work much too.\n\nImage 2:Blackheads, Pores and the dot dot stuff\n\nAll these occurred only in the past year!! I never had them before. The pores and blackheads are very visible irl. The dot dot stuff? I mentioned it and my dermat said it’s milia and it needs to be surgically removed as they are for cosmetic purposes only but other than milia, I have another dot dot that simply lies below my skin and can easily be pricked, I know that’s not the case with milia.\n\nHow can I improve all this? I barely have food from outside so I don’t understand these changes, ive even started getting boils and pimples which are painful ):\n\nMy face overall looks really really dull and there’s no glow to it.\n\nMy dermat had given me a facewash, a moisturizer, a sunscreen, a serum, a cream for pimples and ive been using them in the mornings and at night too. But I don’t think either of them worked for my face tho, I see no improvements.",

      "content": "Hi guys I'm Julie. believe it or not I never knew how reddit worked. My friend got me onto it now it's my second time posting. \n\na couple days ago I posted about finding the right sunscreen and I loved the recommendations I received. I ordered a few on Amazon and some from the websites directly. I'll be trying them out and putting up my honest review on the them. \n\nmy question was this. I tan frequently and my original sunscreen would fade out my tan and leave a white cast. I was given recommendations on Korean sunscreen a lot and a few others. I finally caved after researching them and ended up ordering 3. I'll put them in the next post I do soon. \n\nso I got a lot of questions of my own skincare routine so I hope it's ok to share if not please let me know. \n\nfor context I'm mid 30's 3 children, I work in finance, I have a high stress job, I balance my family life and work as best as I can. my skin was dry, I had fine lines, and I had a stubborn dark patch I got after my second pregnancy also working under stress it showed up especially in my forehead and my smile lines.  \n\nmy routine is basic but it works for me. I use Cetaphil cleanser, then my go to Serum from derma-code as well as their moisturizer. \n\nSo before this serum and moisturizer I tried all the viral stuff on tiktok and some worked a little but nothing great. I looked into best products for aging skin and found out about advanced biotechnology skincare. I went down the rabbit hole to say the least. long story short I found a brand called derma-code they only have 2 products so I got them. after about 3 weeks I noticed a lot of dark patch had faded I didn't realize it because it wasn't overnight or a coverup. then I looked deeper and found my smile lines, and forehead lines weren't really visible anymore. I've never been good at accepting compliments but I'd get them often but would brush them off. this stuff truly helped and it's been consistent ever since. If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask. \n\nalso no medical advice these are simply my own personal outcomes. \n\nagain sorry if this isn't something I can share here. ",

This has been going on for months now and I can’t seem to get rid of them. I have overall really good skin and only get one or two pimples around my menstrual cycle.\n\nThese started around November and won’t go away. I am currently using ceraVe hydrating facial cleanser,  medicube zero pore toner pad and medicube overnight collagen night wrapping mask. The BHA toner pads seem to be helping a little but they still won’t budge. I used to get fungal acne and this doesn’t seem to be it. I used anti fungal cream and that only made my skin upset. I have no idea what to do! I have been a little stressed out with personal life matters and work. Stressing about these bumps probably isn’t helping either. If you have any suggestions please help a girl out!!! My self esteem has taken a toll.",

I’d like to tackle all of these ‘issues’ but I also understand that may not be the best idea. However I just don’t know what I’m doing when it comes to skincare. How to layer the products properly so that they’re actually able to do what they’re supposed to do. If I’m able to use multiple serums and toners at once. I truly just don’t know. \nI’ve been reading up on some ingredients and products that may help with some of the skin issues that I have but then I still wouldn’t know how to create a good routine for my skin. I’d appreciate it very much if someone would be able to help me build a skin care routine❤️",
