My main concern right now is dehydration. no matter how much water I drink, my skin still feels tight and looks a little dull.\n\nI’d love to hear your recommendations for products or routines that have actually worked for you when it comes to improving hydration and overall skin health. I’m open to serums, moisturizers, masks, or even treatments, but would prefer to stick to skincare over in-clinic procedures for now.\n\nIf it helps, my skin type is normal/ acne-prone. My goal is plump, glowing skin that looks good both on and off camera.\n\nAny suggestions (or even brands you swear by) would be super appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance 💕",

I’m a November bride and looking to amp up my at-home skincare routine for this final month.\n\nI have oily, acne-prone skin and for the past 3 months, I’ve been following a simple yet consistent routine:  \n\n- Salicylic acid on alternate days  \n- Retinol (3x a week)  \n\nThe above along with cleanser, moisturiser and sunscreen. \n\nThis has definitely helped! My skin feels more glowy and I’ve even received compliments. However, I still have some texture and tiny bumps that I’d love to smooth out before the big day.\n\nI live in a small town, so I don’t really trust the parlours here for facials or skin treatments — I’d prefer sticking to DIY/home-based remedies that are gentle and effective.\n\nWould love suggestions on:\n\n- Hydrating and glow-boosting home remedies\n  \n- Any simple masks or treatments (kitchen-friendly is a bonus!)  \n\n- Ways to calm texture and keep the skin looking healthy and fresh  \n\nCalling on brides and skincare pros, please share your secrets if you’ve got them.\n\nI’m not looking to overhaul my routine, just small additions that will help me feel my best on the day.
