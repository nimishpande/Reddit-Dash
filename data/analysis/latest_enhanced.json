I think I can do a great job at home but it does hurt my back 😅. \n\nI just feel like no matter where I go, the pedicures I get are such a disappointment. Am I a perfectionist? Not exactly, but I would hope you’d do a better job than me. \n\nEvery single time: \n- Cold water\n- Cut, scraped, or pinched\n- Polish on my cuticles\n- Constantly fixing the paint job after the fact\n\nI’m always polite and tip well. $10 for a $50 pedi. I never say anything about this stuff. But like - come on? I hate shelling out my hard earned bucks for such a consistently awful experience. \n\nIs it that the people can’t see? They don’t care? \n\nI’m literally currently leaving an appt with a scrape on my toe from the nail file… I think that’s the third appt in a row where I’ve left bleeding. \n\nI’m about to buy some of those magnifying glasses so I can start doing my pedis at home. \n\nAnyone else???",

Some products have heat protectant claims \"up to X degree\" on their label, while other products with the same silicones do not. Could I just use the product without those claims on the label? Is it just marketing? Are there silicones that are better heat protectants than others?",

I’ve always had issues with frizz and getting my hair to cooperate, but I feel like it’s finally time to ask for help, lol. \n\nHere is my routine: \n\n1. I wash my hair every other day. In the shower I use Pantene pro-v repair and protect shampoo. Once that’s washed out I use Monday curl define conditioner, and I brush it through my hair with a wet brush. I let it sit while I soap/shave and washing it out is the last thing I do before I get out of the shower. \n\n2. I dry it with a microfiber towel until it’s just damp, then I use Jamaican black castor oil leave in conditioner from the body shop. I get a blueberry/grape sized glob, rub it on my fingers, and then do my best to spread it through my hair without running my fingers through it to mess up the curls. \n\n3. Once it’s all spread through I scrunch my hair up with my hands for a bit, and then I let it air dry. I don’t brush or comb my hair unless I’m in the shower with conditioner in it. \n\n4. I typically only use the leave in conditioner when I’m planning on going out somewhere, but I get frizz whether or not I use it. I’d really love to see my hair with more defined curls, especially at the top of my head, with less of the frizz of course!! Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ",

(advice on this would be great i can’t figure out what it is). have tried using selenium sulfide every other day to get rid of the suspected fungal acne. i think i have what are closed comedomes on my chin that are driving me absolutely insane.\n\nright now my routine for the last 6ish days has been qv gentle cleanser, az clear 20, then qv ceramides moisturizer morning and night. and then every other day selenium sulfide shampoo on the face. az 20 has been making my face itch all day so i’m considering replacing it with the ordinary one that is less strong. i was also planning on introducing TO nicinamide and HA serum into my routine. i’m worried the 20 percent azealic acid is too harsh given the itching. any advice on how to structure a routine using these products would really help.\n\nplease help i feel so horrible about my skin, i’ve never had it be this bad and im desperate for help figuring out what the issue is and how to fix it asap 😭",

      "content": "This is my first post and I hope I’ve used the right tag/flair, I wasn’t sure what to post this under. I’m using ChatGPT to sum this up for more immediate help lol.\n\nTL;DR: I used a 5-year-old Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion on under-the-skin acne out of desperation and reapplied it nightly for several days. It initially helped, but then caused severe irritation—dryness, burning, pain, and clusters of small white bumps. I didn’t realize it was the cause at first and kept using it, which made things worse. Now my skin stings even with gentle cleanser, feels like it’s burning, and the only relief is tons of Aquaphor, which I can’t keep on overnight. I’m looking for urgent advice on how to heal my damaged skin barrier quickly because it’s painful &amp; horrible looking.\n\nI’m in some desperate need of help. I am completely at fault due to not only using old product, but overapplying it. But at the end of the day, I need some relief 🥲 \n\nLast week, I had several blemishes that I felt the need to rid myself of ASAP. They were those stubborn, under the skin bumps. I did some research &amp; found that the Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion helps a lot with those blemishes that are beneath the skin. I saw a pic of the bottle on one of the sub-Reddits I was browsing &amp; I was like I think I actually HAVE this somewhere?!? Lo and behold, I did! I know it’s at least 5 years old and I haven’t used it, but I was desperate (stupid, I know). I applied it &amp; all was well, my blemishes were going down. Went to work the next day, things were still fine but the 3 areas I put this on were drier, and I noticed one of the blemishes kinda started to surface during the day. Long story short, I had been reapplying it either once or twice a night for at least 4 days (at night). On the morning of the 5th day, I didn’t apply it, but I randomly had what I thought was a rash appear on my cheek. I thought I could have possibly gotten some sort of chemical on my hands and then touched my face, so I chalked it up as that &amp; proceeded to use the buffering lotion again the next 2 nights. That’s when I put two and two together, when I woke up and my skin had a bunch of white bumps, not necessarily whiteheads, but almost like tiny little bites or something. To not make this longer than need be, I’m now left with skin that is not only very dry in those areas, but HURTS. I feel like I’ve been repeatedly slapped in the face for hours and it burns sooo bad. I am trying to avoid using any products, but with the dryness and winter, it’s like that makes it worse. Even my sensitive skin La Roche Possay cleanser stings. My literal only sense of relief has been from lathering my face in Aquaphor &amp; I don’t want to sleep with it like that and get it all over my hair and pillowcases (I have to work and dont have the time to redo my hair in the mornings).\n\nI’m seeking some serious help to try to heal this immediately bc it not only looks bad, but it’s very uncomfortable as well.

      "content": "Wanted to ask a question based on a strong personal belief I’ve developed. I’ve noticed that right after ejaculation, my scalp follicles start tingling, and hair fall seems to increase. Continuous ejaculation over consecutive days appears to lead to excessive hair loss. It also seems to alleviate sebum production, acne, dandruff, excess body odor, and sweating.\n\nI’ve been trying to identify the vitamins and nutrients lost during ejaculation and have experimented with supplementing them—mainly zinc, magnesium, amino acids, etc. I’ve also noticed that cardio and exercise help me recover more quickly from the post-ejaculatory phase.\n\nMy question is: Has there been any study on what happens in the male body immediately after ejaculation?\n\nAdditionally, hair loss has historically been a male-specific issue, and it is mostly men who lose semen/energy during reproduction, whereas women do not. Also relevant is sexual dimorphism—men tend to have more body hair, and perhaps cannot “afford” to maintain scalp hair, as it is anatomically expensive. Hair loss also appears more prevalent in Caucasian men, who generally have higher body hair density compared to many Asian populations.\n\nSorry for the rant.\n",
