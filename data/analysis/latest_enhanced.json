      "content": "Seven years ago I hopped on this sub just to read what people were saying about curly hair. I always had curly hair but grew up in southern Oklahoma and they’re definitely not training boys on their curly hair. This sub came in clutch in helping me explore what works best for my hair. \n\nAnywho, here’s where I am seven years later, before and after. :) \n\nWearing a bonnet to sleep was the most impactful routine change I made. It took awhile to adjust to it; I had to try different ones until it worked right. But eventually it worked. \n\nI cowash about once a week. Always diffuse. Aunt Jackie’s product has been the most consistent product for me to use. I started with their leave in conditioner and slowly bought their mouse and gel. It’s worked perfect for my hair. I use a clarifying shampoo about once a month or less. Post clarifying shampoo, I do a longer hair mask. \n\nAnywho, anyone doubting their hair; KEEP AT IT AND TRUST THE PROCESS! Seriously. Trust the process and just know you’re going to go through a lot of different trial and error. But the more you do it, the more you’ll fall in love with yourself. Anywho, first pic is about 7 years ago and last pic is today. \n\n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

That's been my routine the last 2 days.\n\nDon't know if bleaching my hair has weakened the curls as my mum has very naturally curly hair (to the point in some pictures of her it looks like she has a big Russian style hat on lol) and I do get ringlets at the sides of my head near my ears but also been having it straight for a long time. My hair is very thick and heavy so maybe a more layered style would help it's just I've been having one length cuts to keep it as long as possible. \n\nI don't use satin pillows/bonnets etc I did my hair the same yesterday (the first time I did this) and then as I know you're not really supposed to brush curly hair I thought I'd just rinse it in the shower today(proper wash was yesterday) and then redo it today as it had lost a lot of volume in the night.\n\nJust would be nice if it would be a bit more ringletty and actually keep the volume rather than losing it a little during the day.

I always had deep temples and a pointed middle front - probably NW3 back then. Now, after all those years, I’m a NW3v. The shape is still the same, but the front middle has miniaturized badly. And now the crown starts to thin too.\n\nI only started treatment recently. Too late for big regrowth, probably. And if I could give two honest pieces of advice, they would be these:\n\n1) Don’t wait for the illusion to break.\n\nFor years I told myself, “It’s still fine, I can style it.” You lie to yourself, thinking the day you can’t hide it will never come. But it does. One morning, the mirror doesn’t lie anymore. If you know you wouldn’t be happy bald - act now, while you still can. What’s gone rarely comes back. Meds might stop the loss, but they won’t bring your old self back.\n\n2) Don’t confuse peace with comfort.\n\nFor a long time, I did nothing because I had someone who loved me. I thought that love would last, that it made me safe. But when that person leaves - and the hair’s gone too - you suddenly face yourself again, raw and unfiltered. It’s brutal. Don’t wait for that wake-up call.\nIf you’re not treating your loss because you feel “fine” right now - ask yourself if that peace really comes from within, or just from the people around you.",

My hair still curls and looks pretty good, but after a couple of days of styling it, not only is it dry, but it feels like Sandpaper. I’ve tried many leave ins, a few from walmart, Skala Maracuja Brazilian one, Olaplex, Briogeo and nothing seems to help it. The only think that really helps keep my hair soft is the Kids Conditioner from Aussie and that’s really it.\n\nHere’s my routine for my 3A-3B hair:\n\n1. I use a shampoo that my mom brings from morocco, it helps with other aspects which is good.\n2. I then go in with the Kids Conditioner from Aussie. It’s the only conditioner that leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft.\n3. I then put Almond Oil in my hair, brush it and put it in a braid (this is where I’d like to incorporate a leave in conditioner but they all leave my hair dry asf)\n4. Then when i’m styling it, I use first the leave in conditioner from Miss Jessie’s (I use it but for styling purposes only), then I use a bit of purple bottle Skala for wavy hair, then Blueberry Bliss Styling gel.\n\nI genuinely need some advice cause my hair within 2 days of styling it, the curls go away, the hair stays in these dry bundles of dryness and not only does it look terrible but it so sandpaper-like I hate it. \n\nI’ve tried the deep hair mask conditioners like the one from Briogeo, Olaplex and Shea Moisture (Jamaican castor oil one) and they leave my hair feeling dry as hell after I hop out the shower, so I avoid them.\n\nAny help/recommendations would be greatly appreciated!!!",

      "content": "My two primary concerns are frizz (especially how quickly it appears after soaking my hair) and how well my curls/ringlets actually come out. These pictures were taken just a couple hours after soaking it like I do every morning, brushing, applying and scrunching product, and letting it air dry. For a little more context, I use ordinary shampoo (just on my scalp) twice a week and ordinary conditioner (on everything but my scalp) nightly.\n\n  \nI don't really have a concrete routine anymore since I've been trying different things every day, but here's what I did for the results pictured:\n\n  \n\\- Completely soaked\n\n\\- Very lightly dried with regular towel (just dabbed enough so it's not dripping everywhere)\n\n\\- Brushed it straight with a wet brush while spraying it with a spray bottle to keep it wet\n\n\\- Applied and brushed through some It's a 10 Miracle Leave-In Potion\n\n\\- Flipped head upside down, ran a palmful of LA Looks Extreme Sport through hair and scrunched all over\n\n\\- Left completely alone to air dry over my back\n\n  \nThe results of my hair feel inconsistent day-to-day. I think I have a straight bottom layer of hair, so I'll see little strands of straight/wavy hair frustratingly protruding from my curls. Frizz feels sporadic and seems to show up wherever it wants.\n\nI know I don't go above and beyond for my hair, so am I expecting too much? Is there really a normal amount of frizz in the photos? Any product or routine recommendations? Does my hair actually look okay?\n\nThanks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52gm9t8s9iuf1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dc93a593b391519e0b69e69db3a206142dbc2e8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o260614t9iuf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20b3219ad55412b6c9425e6c4f33742a5c90455b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4pb0ict9iuf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=436b80873b8bc729592243bf40bd5affb3512a5c\n\n",

      "content": "🦋\nAbout me 🎀: My skintype is combination(oily on large areas and dry on another). I have large open pores and pigmentation. I easily get whiteheads and redheads if i don’t wash my face to reduce the oilyness. I have PCOS ⚡️and i go to gym like 2 days average in a week. I eat a lot of sugars, reduced carbs and take whey protein. I have facial hairs due to PCOS so i use  facial hair trimmer twice a week.\n\nAbout the products🦩:\n\nFacial Skincare🫧: \n1. Paknet (derma suggested)🪼: skin feels cleared and very smooth. I did a little research and got to know benzoyl peroxide reduces pimple causing bacteria. So i guess it helps reduce pimple. I gently move my hands in circular motion clockwise and upwards to let me skin absorb it and then wash. (AM PM)\n\n2. Acne oc- moisturiser (derma suggested)🪻: reduces pores and moisturise my face. Regulates oil production on face. I have seen some change in my pores and oiliness. I again apply it and move my hands upwards to let it soak in.(AM PM)\n\n3. Adapalene (derma suggested)🦥: it has benzoyl peroxide so it helps reduce pimple causing bacteria and in turn help prevent pimples. I take a very little of it and again in circular motion upwards apply it all over the skin but not on sides of nose, under/close to the eye and in sides of my mouth. Once in two days. Can irritate skin if over used.(AM -use sunscreen after)\n\n3. Moisurex-hydra (prev derma suggested) 🐚: i apply it same way , circular clockwise upwards till absorbs. Its water based so good if you have dry skin.  (AM PM)\n\n4. a. Aziderm (prev derma suggested)🐝: it reduces pigmentation, pimple and pimple marks. Also helps in detaning. My new derma hasn’t suggested it, but it works well so i’m using it. Same application - upwards and in circular motion. I use it as night as you need to save your skin from sun after these products. Use it a little like adapalene as it can irritate skin as well (PM)\n\n4. b. Clindamycin (derma suggested)🐥: no idea what it does but i have to apply it everyday in the morning. Doesnt irritate. Same application - circular, upwads) (AM PM)\n\n5. Deconstruct vitamin c serum ( self suggested) 🪽- my skin has got tanned so started using it recently. Still waiting to see if it works. Read application on the bottle(AM PM with sunscreen)\n\n5 b. Pixi toner -(nykaa gift) 👾- its good, no idea what it does but doesn’t do any harm so yeah, good so far. I apply it with cotton in circular upwards motion. (AM PM)\n\n6. Sunscreens 🌞-( all doc suggested current and prev) - uv doux is best but is tinted. It feels heavy so i will get the non silicone based on from uv doux. Others are fine. (Every two hours under sun, 2x pinky finger size)\n\n7. Vaseline (self suggested) 👄- i have pigmented lips, used it daily whenever i felt my lips have gotten dry, started observing them getting pink and less dark.\n\n8. Meds ( derma suggested) 💊- green one is omega - good for hair and skin. Black one is antioxidant, and peach one is for pimple reduction. I take them everyday\n\n9.shatavari juice (self suggested)🍶- i have pcos, so i take it every day after meal at night, helps with pcos and inflammation i guess. Im using everything so dont know how exactly is this working. I have to drink it for another month or so.\n\n10. Medicube collagen night mask, vlcc detan mask, detan scrub (self suggested)🎭- once a week for tanning.\n\n11. Turmeric and red sandal (self suggested)🎭- got them recently, good for face, clears , depigments brightens. I use it twice a week, it leaves yellowish color, so use it at night.\n\nHaircare:\n1. Ordinary 👩‍🦰: (self suggested): reduces hairfall and dandruff. Works like magic. I have seen hair fall reduction and new baby hairs (PM )\n\n2. Serum (self suggested) 🪮- makes hairs manageable inturn less breakage. After wash or whenever im using heat.\n\n3.  Soul flower serum (self suggested) 🫤- unsure, but i would bot recomment too many stuff ordinary is best.\n\n4. Soulflower oils 🛢️- (self suggested) - best ones for hair growth and thickness. (An hour before hairwash)\n\n\nAll these products are what i use, not suggesting that they work like magic or will work for everyone, but my face is now pimple free and when i touch my skin now, smooth and soft🥰. With PCOS your skin, mood and everything becomes twice complicated😅, i’ll aways suggest doctors when you think skincare and health🔎. If you are in bangalore and looking for the doctor, i have some names. I’m can help you🙃.\n\n\nThanks and have a great skin and hair ♥️🌸\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

To cut straight to the chase i have hair down to my  hips, can't really hold shape , according to my hair style \"lot or hair but the strand is thin\". I've really wanted bangs for a long time , i thought it be cute especially when i hace it put up since my face is a basketball but the problem is my hairline. It's giving first stages of balding, not fully gone but very rare , that side doesn't grow past the half of my face and my hair lady said it won't look good , not only becouse of that but also my it would make me look aged. Last time i was there I've had her cut my ends and even it out a bit , i like the length and discuss this with her and the best she did was take a \"V\" and cut it down to my chin then styled it. It was fine but not quite , it looked pretty weird since it was the only part of my hair that was styled and looked unfinished but I'm not mad at her or anything since i totally understand my hair and face are hard to work with also I'm horrible at verbalizing anything at all so getting the wrong message from me does happend quite often. Does anyone have suggestions or deal with the same thing? I don't feel comfortable putting up pictures but if necessary i will. I just don't know what to do and I'm just tired of my eternal middle line.",

Ever since I did it, I’m presuming these are the result (razer burns?). They are huge and used to be extremely red and burn a lot. But now, they are more brownish and just dry/peeling. It still hurts to move my elbow in/bend my legs when they’re dry, but I’ve been putting vaseline and afterwards I can move fine. I used to use hydrocortisone but I think I was getting steroid withdrawal, as every time I applied, it made it red, burned and peeled. Any fixes? They look disgusting and are just rough/crackly itchy patches right now…And they’re only on the 4 spots of my body (joint between elbow and bicep and joint between calf and thigh). ",

I’ve been doing Tallow. Tried Egyptian Magic. And I have castor oil on right now. \n\nI don’t want to go buy a ton of products, but what can get the swelling and reduce the atrocious, bright red!
