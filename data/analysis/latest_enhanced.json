I don't know whether this will work for others, but here's the routine she did for me:\n\nShe began styling my hair when it was extremely wet.\n\nShe used much more product than I typically use. I have fine hair, so I always went easy on the product. She went section by section and coated that hair thoroughly. (It was a light foam for my fine hair, but could be heavier based on texture.) Each section of hair was carefully coated root to ends.\n\nShe applied some Innersense finishing spray to reduce drying time. I'm not sure all finishing sprays can be used this way - probably not - but I found several blow dry sprays on Amazon that are designed to cut dry time (e.g. Kenra,  Colorwow, Redken).\n\nShe finger combed it with a focus on creating ribboned clumps. (This was not tedious finger curling, just raking section by section to clump and ribbon the hair. She said anything that looks sloppy and haphazard while wet will become frizz when dry.\n\nOnce I had some ribboned clumps, she carefully scrunched the ribbons in her hand once, held the hair close to the head, and pulsed a few times. If you've ever \"squished to condish,\" it was just like that.\n\nShe used to diffuser for several minutes to hover over the hair and dry it a bit without touching it.\n\nOnce a cast started setting up, she gently picked up sections of the hair and put just the ends in the bowl of the diffuser. The goal was to dry the ends without disturbing the hair too much.\n\nFinally, when it was maybe 80% dry, she started to pixie dry the hair and scrunch it right up to the roots with the bowl of the diffuser. She had me tip my head to one side and then to the other to get a little volume toward the roots. She advised *not* to tip fully upside down, as it would disturb the hair too much.\n\nAt the end, she used some serum to break the cast. (I don't have serum at home, so I used a drop of LUS oil.)\n\nI've been sleeping in a bonnet at night, and my hair looks perfect the next day. The curls really hold.\n\nAll products at the salon were Innersense. I use LUS at home. ",

I cant remember the last time I could put my face on a pillow without pain, the last time I did my skincare without chunks of dead skin coming off, the last time I could apply makeup normally, the last time Icould put lotion on without my whole face burning, or the last time I could smile without being in pain because of the 10 cysts always present on both of my cheeks. I tried really hard to heal this without going on Accutane. I tried dapsone, winlevi, spironolactone, and tretinoin. Spironolactone was the only thing that worked for me, and I even had to stop that because it was giving me the worst side effects in my life. Right now, my skincare routine takes so fucking long, I have to plan ahead to make sure I do it. I use what my derm prescribed me, dapsone and winlevi in am followed by byoma serum, cerave pm moisturizer and sunscreen. then at night I do winlevi, tretinoin (every other night), serum and moisturizer. STILL HAVE DRY SKIN. I had to throw away so many skincare products and now I am so strict about my routine. I only use water-based products, and don't wear makeup on days I don't have to. I used to have porcelain skin, and now it's so fucked up. I don't feel beautiful anymore, and I didn't even realize it, but I'm becoming a shell of a person. And I can't stop picking my skin, and when I do its like so bad, the cysts erupt with so much force out of my face its insane. I get scared myself. I am so tired of this, and I also randomly developed perioral dermatitis too, so I'm on doxycycline for it, and it's helping a little bit, but my acne is RAGING. I feel like the PD will just come back as soon as I get off Doxy. And I am so fucking tired of making so many lifestyle changes for my skin. I just want to live like a normal person, and I can't even do that. After so long of not wanting to go on birth control, but my derm pushing Accutane for 2 years, I finally caved. But the worst part is that I am getting my consultation on Dec 29 and I won't even be able to start the Accutane until February because my fucking OBGYN QUIT AND MY PCP QUIT AND MY PSYCHIATRIST QUIT literally all in the same month, I shit you not, and I can't even get a goddamn IUD until February. SO Ihave to continue being tortured by my skin for another 3 months. I'm so sick and tired of going everywhere and constantly avoiding overhead lighting because it accentuates my acne. I sometimes catch glimpses of myself in the mirror and am horrified at what I see. I can't even get close to my boyfriend's face because I get so insecure about what he sees on my face. Its getting to the point where it's causing issues with me being close to him in our relationship. I feel so self-conscious that I will see someone from high school and they will see how terrible my skin has become. I try so hard to fix it Itry the spearmint tea, and destressing and avoid sugar and dairy blah blah , and I dont know what I did to deserve this. And the number of people who just blatantly tell me oh your skin looks pretty bad is insane. Like, do you think I don't know? I also developed the worst habit of picking at my skin every night. If Isee a whitehead, I HAVE TO POP IT, or if I even see a small opening to any of my cysts, I have to pop it. I KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE, but in my head, if I pop it, it means it will go away. I am very sad now because I feel like I have so many FUCKING HOLES in my face and theyre turnihng into CRATER-SIZED SCARS and I am so fucking depressed but I cant stop picking . On top of that, my period has not come this month, and my boobs hurt so bad (this has happened to me many times, not pregnant) because I have fibrocystic breast disease. its like as soon as I started college, my whole life fell apart. I have no energy for anything anymore. ANd its christmas, and I have to go to my boyfriends and I dont want his family to see my face, like I this its making myself want to end my self. I sound so superficial, but nobody understands me because it's not their face its mine, and I have been struggling with this acne for almost 3 years, and I am SO GODDAMN EXHAUSTED. bro I can't do this anymore. I don't want to cake my face in makeup every day im so sick of it. its ruining my life, and I'm so angry at my body. AND I AM A VERY STRESSED AND ANXIOUS PERSON, and there is not much I can do to change that, I take meds.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

You can tell a lot of my hair wants to be a ringlet but I don’t know how to help it get there. I’ve tried plopping damp hair for sleeping but it didn’t work great. I also tried pineapple bun with bamboo bonnet while dry which worked better but still came out funky. \n\nMy main questions: How can I give my roots more volume and hide my scalp? How are people preserving their hair at night so beautifully? How can I train my ringlets to come back out? ",

I’ve immediately stopped using it and hoping the damage isn’t permanent. Any advice on how to repair the damage? I actually don’t have much of a sophisticated “routine” really but getting to the age where I stupidly thought I should start looking after my skin better only for this to happen! \n\nI use a face roller kept in the freezer under my eyes in the morning and apply Hyaluronic serum on my slightly wet face and use Estee Lauder DayWear moisturiser with SPF on top. That’s it really. I’ve also started to use the same moisturiser before bed since this damage happened and apply Vaseline on top to try to “lock in” the moisture. Once a week, I use a sheet mask or more of a deep cleanse though I haven’t done this since this occurred. \n\nI actually didn’t have much problems with my skin before starting this product so this is really stressful and disheartening! I was hoping to have a lower bleph procedure with fat transfer in the coming months too but not sure if this issue will make it more difficult. Please help! \n\nMerry Christmas to all. Thanks ",

So i keep my hair short. \nI brush my hair fully flat and sleep on it flat because thats what my mom thought me to do to keep it straight. \nIt takes my hair like 6 hours to dry fully even when its this short. \n\n\nNow I tryed useing mose and scrunching my hair and you can see the result of that. I used the curl girl mose and the assie shampoo and conditioner. I typically use this brand because it keeps my hair fresh for longer. I do not own a hair dryer and air drying takes to long.\n\n\nI got my friend to do my hair about a year ago with some mose and defuseing it. No other products where used\n\n \nMy hair is very healthy now days. \n\nI haven't noticed fuzz more just extreme fluff and when I was younger and had longer hair my hair whould get tangled by literally sitting. Idk if thats relevant.  My mom has straight hair. My father no idea. My grandmother has curly and my brother has super curly hair. \n\n  \nSorry if im a mother white girl convinced my hair is not straight. Just trying to get a good routine for my hair and figure it out.\n\nI also included a picture of my hair a few years back when it was longer and kept straight. \n\n  \nWhat shall I do next what do I do from here to figure out what my hair is?

      "content": "* Before\n   *  So in 2019, I used to weigh around 100 kg and I was on a really bad routine of eating a lot of junk food and not working out a single hour a week. And had no information about skincare routine. I used to apply Vaseline on my face as a moisturizer and used to use really bad face washes like Garnier Acne fight etc. \n* After\n   * So, on **1 October 2020**, I started my fitness journey, and since then, have lost around **25 kg of weight.** \n   * Currently, I weigh around **75 kgs**, though I am skinny fat, but gained a lot of muscles in the last 4 to 5 months, and if everything goes well, I'll be shredded\n   * Now I follow a **minimal yet consistent skin routine**, so I use the following three items on a daily basis:\n   1. For face wash, I use a benzoyl peroxide gel cleanser\n   2. For face cream, I use an Episoft AC, which is a combination of moisturizer plus sunscreen\n   3. I also have a benzoyl peroxide gel, which I use on my pimples because even now I get a lot of pimples if I don't properly follow my skincare routine and if I eat out a lot of junk food\n\n**Things which worked for me as a person who has an acne-prone face genetically not just a teenage puberty phase.**\n\n1. Following a proper skincare routine with **cleanser**, **moisturizer** (since my moisturizer is a combination of sunscreen and moisturizer, so I don't use a separate sunscreen at least for now.) \n\n2. Working out and losing excess fat. \n\n3. Not going out in direct sun and using an umbrella as much as possible.   \n  \n **things to avoid** \n\n1. never use hard face washes that strip out all the oils from your body. Always use a very light and non-invasive face wash like Cetaphil or Benzoyl Peroxide Gel \n\n2.  if your face is very oily, always use moisturizers which are very light and don't have oils in them. Basically, you can figure this out by testing out the consistency. If the viscosity of the moisturizer is very high, then it has oil, and if it is very drain kind of, then it is oil-free.  \n  \n3. figure out your trigger points for acne. I have realized that if I eat too much sugar or eat a lot of food, then I get acne the next day, and it can be different for different people, but you must have to figure out and identify various triggers that are there in your body that cause acne ",
