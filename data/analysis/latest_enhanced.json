I also feel like my curls are very forced, and i have to use a lot of water to make them pop, I’ve also switched to silk pillow recently which helps a bit i guess",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "Hi! For context, my skin above my lip and below my nose is quite damaged and has a lot of post-inflammation hyperpigmentation (PIH) due to skin picking disorder. That area is particularly dry, in that after applying moisturizer, it becomes dry in an hour.\n\nOne week ago I began to introduce TO’s Niacinamide (10%) and Skinoren’s Azelaic Acid (20%). My daily routine for morning and night was this for the whole face:\n\n1. Cleanser - INNISFREE [Green Tea Amino Hydrating Cleansing Foam](https://sg.innisfree.com/products/green-tea-amino-hydrating-cleansing-foam-150g)\n2. TO Niacinamide (10%)\n3. Skinoren Aza (20%)\n4. AQUAREA Urea cream (10%)\n5. Sunscreen, SPF 50 (morning)\n\nAfter a week, while Aza had always stung, it began to burn and the area above my lip became very red and slightly raised / swollen (a bit like a welt). My skin also became very dry and peeled.\n\nI stopped Aza for a few days while continuing Niacinamide, and my skin settled down quickly, and I noticed my PIH faded a bit. It looked brighter too. Can’t tell if it’s because of Niac or Aza.\n\nI want to reintroduce Aza back to test which one was effective (or maybe both), but I tried to put it after my Urea cream and just on my PIH, but it still stings.\n\nAny advice? Do I just have to lower the concentration? I’d rather not buy another Aza since it’s more a trial than anything… Thanks!",

Everything was fine for like 2 months then all hell broke loose, my hair started falling out and my skin went crazy. Now I’m constantly fighting never ending acne and texture. It has been the most embarrassing thing and killing my confidence. \n\nI’ve tried so many different things and nothing helps and my skin seems to hate everything (I’ve never had sensitive skin but now any time I put anything on it it freaks out.) I literally use to only use makeup wipes for years and never had any problems (bad I know.)\n\nI’ve been trying a super simple routine because I thought maybe I messed up my skin barrier from trying different things. \n\nMy Skin is combination with more oily on my t-zone and dry on cheeks. My skin always looks dehydrated no matter what I use to try to help it. I’ve been getting horrible texture, closed comedones, and regular pimples all over my forehead and hairline. My checks get regular pimples and deep painful hormonal acne. My chin gets tons of closed comedones and deep painful hormonal acne.\n\nMy morning: \n\nUsually just wash with water and apply Avene Tolerance Control Skin Recovery Cream before my makeup.\n\nNight: \n\n• I will wash with Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Lotion Cleanser\n\n• Apply Avene Tolerance Control Skin Recovery Cream \n\n(The Avene products at least don’t make things as bad as other things but nothing is getting better and I never feel like my skin feels hydrated)\n\nAs Needed: \n\n• Murad Deep Relief Acne Treatment for when I get deep painful hormonal acne - (the only thing that seems to get them to calm down some)\n\n• Pimple Patches for when I get pimples that have stuff in them \n\nI’ve tried:\n\n• Cetaphil and Cerave cleansers and got super deep painful acne \n\n• Eradikate sulfur wash - didn’t really do anything\n\n• Elf Holy Hydration and Cetaphil moisturizing cream gave me a lot of closed comedones \n\n• Benzoyl Peroxide and Clindamycin didn’t really do anything \n\n• Panoxyl caused texture on my forehead\n\nMy doctor gave me tretinoin gel 0.025% to start using and I’ve used it one night so far this week and did the sandwich method.\n\nI’m just so lost, upset, never dealt with acne before and feel so insecure. Please give me all the advice, recommendations, tips, observations. Thank you so much you beautiful people. ",

She also told me to moisturise properly.\n\nNow I had never applied any kind of acne cream before although I do have a skincare routine of toner, serums and all.\n\nAfter like 2-3 days of applying the gel and cleaning with face wash. My face started to burn particularly my eye lids and under eye and the skin started to get flaky.I had to cut my other skin care products also and just apply sunscreen and moisturiser.\n\nAfter that I wasn’t regular in applying for a week so my skin got better.\n\nBy this week I started to apply it again and again it’s happening and now around my mouth too, when I apply sunscreen, moisturisers. Even after I apply a good amount of moisturiser it still stays dry.\n\nSo I just want to ask a few questions\n\ndoes this happen usually?\n\nIs the acne gel and CeraVe face wash clashing?\n\nIf not then please suggest a weekly routine to follow to apply this gel and face wash :)\n\nAnd Could you suggest a good moisturiser for when applying acne creams..",

      "content": "I've never used toners so I have no idea how to use them or for what purpose. I'd only heard of them being used for making bleached hair a nicer shade of blonde, but I saw someone talking about using toner on salt and pepper hair before dyeing it with bright colours like Arctic Fox/Manic Panic which wouldn't normally work on naturally white/grey hair. Is this a thing? \n\nIf so, what effect would toner have on natural or dyed dark brown hair, would it make it lighter or would it only have an effect on the white/grey hairs? What happens if you bleach over hair that has already had toner on it? \n\nI have naturally dark brown hair, with a lot of white and grey in some places. I have sections that were bleached and currently dyed pink and blue, and I use a dark brown box dye on the rest to cover the grey roots. My hair grows fast so I redo the brown every 3 weeks, but I daren't bleach it myself and my hairdresser won't bleach it until the roots are a certain length. I wish I had some way of covering the roots of the pink and blue parts myself, it looks awful when the roots are getting longer, but none of the dyes I've tried will stick to grey hair. I'm wondering if toner would help with this - can anyone advise? ",

These are my natural curls that I am now tired of taming and maintaining. Its a struggle to even ride a two wheeler or a rickshaw without absolutely ruining my hair within a minute of some wind. I tried the hair wax and gel, and the 5 step processes that ChatGPT told me to do, but nothing works. Would love some suggestions or help here.\n\nMy hair routine, for context, is weekly to oil it (with a local business' herbal oil) moderately and keep it for half a day, shampoo it with a sulphate free ocean kelp shampoo (Biotique), and then a hyaluronic acid conditioner (Loreal) for 5-10 mins. I let them air dry on hair wash days. On normal days I either soak them in the shower or spray water on them to detangle my curls before wiping them almost dry with a towel. They dont get completely dry ever even with a towel. I use the hair wax (Bare Anatomy) here and there occasionally but honestly there's no difference. \n\nAll I want is for them to look fluffy with volume while looking decent and tame enough at work or outdoors. Thanks for reading this much lol... ",
