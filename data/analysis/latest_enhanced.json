      "content": "My hair loss was something which affected me for more than 20 years. Hair transplant were not succesful 20 yrs back and I had Norwood Grade 7 at 25 yrs of age. Today I m nearing 45 yrs . \n\nI did a ton of research about hair transplant  in last 10 yrs and was with a hair patch for last 15 yrs. \n\nIt affected my confidence . In 2024 I finally decided to give hair transplant  a good chance and decided to use my scalp,  beard and chest .\n\n During my research in Patna , where I resided , I found my doctor through a google search. I was mentally prepared to go to Delhi. Seeing his past affiliation of doc , I decided to meet. \n\n He said \" you are my second patient in the city where I have newly moved in and we both have nothing to loose as you go back to the hair patch if the transplant fails , but if it is successful , it can be life changing. We will have a 3 to 4 Surgical  sitting  approach over next 1.5 yrs to protect donor aesthetics of scalp and body. We will use your beard in the hairline and crown over multiple sittings  and beard in the rest. He put his bet on my beard which is extremely good. I linked his multi step approach with a conservative hairline initially.\n\nSurgical procedure breakdown:\n\n• 1st procedure - total of 3300 grafts- 1300 from scalp ( very thin donor ), 2000 from beard ( He extracted beard below jawline and side locks ) . This covered my conservative hairline and mid scalp.\n\n• 2nd procedure-total of 2300 grafts- about 1500 from beard and about 800 chest( Further extraction from beard below jawline  and from cheek, 800 from chest 70% of which failed ) . This was used to construct my crown and back part of the head.\n\n• 3rd procedure-total of 2000 grafts- about 1000 from the scalp( these were finasteride dependent hair which thickened with 1 year of finasteride  and about 1000 from beard ( from neck, cheek ) \n\nTotal number of grafts so far = \\~7600 grafts\n\nA primary reason for this approach in regards to procedure was to manage the existing donor hair as well as achieve realistic density. \n\nExperience and recovery:\n\nMy 3 surgeries took 1 year and were placed 6 months apart. The approach was always conservative to slightly aggresive. There was risk of scarring on my cheek and practically after 3 times extraction from my cheek , sidelocks and below neck , there are virtually no visible scar, thanks to excellent post op care guided by the doc and executed my me.\n\n My final results is still 4 months away and last surgery was done in September 2025.\n\nResults (so far): \n\nI’m not trying to boast or claim that I have a “celebrity hairline”, but my observations indicate that hair growth is naturally improving, and I am beginning to feel comfortable again with my hairline as my confidence grows.\n\n I feel confident to go out without a hair fibres or a wig now. Doctor has suggested to go for scalp micropigmentation to further reduce the contrast and recommended use of chest hair to improve my mid scalp  if have he stamina to go for a 4th surgery from chest .\n\nMy advice to anyone considering an HT for extreme high grade baldness with poor donor : \n\n1. Find a doctor who is capable of scalp and body hair transplant.\n\n2. Find a doctor whose approach is conservative to aggresive , rather than vice-versa ( else a failed surgery can't be rectified ) . Even the best donors can fail to grow and worst donor hair can grow.\n\n \n\n3. Wait for your baldness to stablize before surgery and stick to medications like finasteride and minoxidil .\n\n4. People who have good body hair especially beard ( it gave me 80% of the density over 3 surgeries ) should get a good coverage .\n\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to ask I mainly posted this in hopes of providing some insight or motivation to people who have virtually no hair..",

The second picture is from a while ago but is more how my hair used to look. \n\nMy hair is long, fine, medium density, and I think low porosity, so it’s easily weighed down. I’ve always struggled with hold but not usually to this extent. I live in Canada so I think the dry winter might be part of it, but it hasn’t been this bad in the past. \n\nCurrent routine:\n\nWash with Pantene volume shampoo\n\nCondition with a small amount of pattern detangling nectar or herbal essences nourishing detangling spray\n\nScrunch out excess water\n\nApply Harry’s gel in sections and brush style\n\nHover diffuse (don’t usually pixie diffuse as I find it gives me wonky curls)\n\nSilk scarf to sleep\n\nI recently changed gels because I felt like my usual got2b gel was drying out my hair in the winter, so I switched to Giovanni LA hold, which made my hair feel even drier and had pretty weak hold, so I switched to Harry’s which gives a good cast but once I scrunch it out it’s like I have no hold. \n\nI’ve also been experimenting with different conditioners since my hair has been staticky (so I assume dry?), but they all just seem to make my hair even more limp. \n\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated, I’m at my wit’s end and my straightener is beckoning to me.

I’ve been a long time lurker on this sub and have done my fair share of research on finasteride. I’ve always been a little scared to try it but now I’m going to give it a go at a smaller dose to see if I can tolerate it. \n\nI spoke to my dermatologist about hair loss options and he suggested I first try oral minoxidil for 2-3 months before starting finasteride. His rationale was that if oral minoxidil leads to good gains then we can hold off on finasteride for a little longer. I was a little confused by this because the two medications are completely different mechanisms of treatment. I’ve done topical minoxidil for over 10 years now and the results have started to wane. The point of trying oral minoxidil was to see if it could help me more than topical is at the moment. Obviously not being on a DHT blocker all these years has led to a lot more loss.\n\nIs what my derm saying sound? I know there are plenty of people who take both oral minoxidil and finasteride at the same time. ",

      "content": "hi everyone! I wanted to ask what are the best cleansers and moisturizers for combination skin type. I would say my forehead will be oily yet my eyebrows can be a little dry sometimes. the sides of my nostrils will dry out and be flaky, but my nose can be a tiny bit oily occasionally.\n\nI only get hormonal acne once a month (iykyk). I rarely get any acne that turn into whiteheads. when I do have the hormonal acne, it may be 2-3 around my chin. I’ve noticed lately I’ve had a few on my cheeks and under my eye. I’m not sure why or what could be causing them. If you have any thoughts, please let me know. I did switch from my previous moisturizer drunk elephant to good molecule since DE can be expensive (I also would use the DE vitamin C serum but ran out). I’m not sure if that’s what’s causing the acne on my cheeks and if good molecule isn’t right for me.\n\nI do have bumps on my forehead that don’t really clear up. they never form whiteheads or anything. they’ll just be red for a day. does anyone have any recommendations on how to clear them up? also my pores on my nose for sure need to be cleansed. I’ve seen TikTok’s on oil cleanser/emulsify with water then going in with a water based cleanser. does this work?\n\nI currently use exuviance to wash my face. I initially had the gentle cleanser and it never broke me out. I couldn’t find it at Ulta and grabbed the AHA cleanser. not sure if this is something I should use or if you’d recommend it?\n\nany help and recommendations are much appreciated!",

      "content": "I was hoping to get some advice for how to manage or at least find the culprit to my acne breakouts. Some important things to mention are that I got off BC in August 2025, I’ve been experiencing on and off acid reflux, I started Tretinoin over a month ago (every other day at 0.025), and just recently started using the Ordinary’s Azelaic Acid cream (morning and night). Everyday I use the Panoxyl Benzyl Peroxide acne wash and let it sit for a few minutes in the shower.\n\nSo my breakouts weren’t too bad before I started Tretinoin, but the breakouts have gotten significantly worse once I started. I recognize that Tretinoin has a purging period, so this could potentially be related, maybe? Honestly I can’t tell what’s purging vs regular breaking out. I have a history of cystic acne in my 20s (I’m 31 now) and so I can’t help but feel pretty fearful that it’s just going to get significantly worse. My stress levels are significantly lower now, but I think it’s one of those, if you’ve had cystic acne, you know the feeling.\n\nThe times that I am breaking out are before and during my period, as well as during my ovulation. So it’s pretty constant, it seems.\n\nI’ve been drinking spearmint tea once a day for about the same amount of time that I’ve been off BC, but not sure I’ve noticed a difference. Given my history of acne, when getting off BC, I tried to prepare by taking omega 3, magnesium, and prenatal vitamins. I recently stopped prenatal vitamins since I got freaked that maybe biotin can be contributing, also heard like B12 can have an effect? I also read that Zinc can help acne so wondering if that’s worth trying at least days leading up to the consistent breakout periods.\n\nSo I recognize there’s a lot happening here and I’ve been noticing more dryness in my skin so I try to take some days where I just hydrate with hylauronic acid and moisturizer even if it’s supposed to be a Tretinoin day, but I don’t want to not use the Tretinoin for more than 3-4 days.\n\nI’ve also started using high frequency wand a few times a week when I can.\n\nAny advice or even just picking out any patterns that make sense would be appreciated!

I go to the salon every three/four months to get an acid perm and it always comes out good.

I have a picture for reference and here’s my current routine: \n\nWashing hair every 2-3 days: \n\nOlaplex no.4 shampoo\n\nOlaplex no.5 conditioner \n\nAfter washing: \n\nUsing cotton hair turban + air drying, will sometimes put leave in conditioner: Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Leave In Conditioner \n\nIf Styling Hair, I use: \n\nKent’s Volume Mousse Extra 17\n\nOuidad Heat &amp; Humidity Gel ",

I never had issues like this before so I can pretty much link this to the usage of Finasteride.\n\nI don't really want to try Minoxidil topical because I just know I wouldn't be consistent with it and it would be kind of a hassle for me. At the same time, I don't really feel like risking all the side effects of oral Minoxidil.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts and thank you for your time!",

I would say that I have wavy and potentially thick and dense hair, but I know fuck all about hair. Please give me some recommendations for products and for my hair care routine\n\nMy current routine consists of me washing my hair two times a week and sometimes three. I’ve just been using shea moisture products for my conditioner, shampoo, leave-in conditioner, and curling cream. I also used a wide tooth comb to get knots out of my hair and I use coconut oil randomly to help with frizz. That frizz is a big issue on my list and it has been terrible in these colder months. So again I would appreciate any help I can from y’all 🙏\n\nTL;DR I need product and routine recommendations for wavy hair with a lot of frizz. (2nd photo taken after detangling hair)",
