      "content": "My darling beautiful 4 year old has started puberty early (medically diagnosed) This of course is accompanied by body odour. It’s kinda hard to manage, she obviously runs around like a four year old but unlike a teen it doesn’t even cross her mind to re apply after becoming hot and sweaty. We try to shower daily but those with four year olds know the battle. I desperately don’t want her to be the smelly kid in school. (She also has autism and Poland syndrome so already has things to mark her as different, and now this 😭) \n\nI need a deodorant that seriously works, like will last all day without needing to re apply. Works after running around outside in SoCal weather wearing a polyester Spider-Man costume. \n\nIt also needs to look fun. Again getting her to wear deodorant is a serious battle, I can tempt her if it’s something fun looking. (Also I kinda hate applying something to her that looks like it’s marketed to 30 year olds women) \n\nFinally it needs to be “cool”. If she does have it in her school bag and another kid spots it the brand is considered “cool”. I don’t care if I have to spend stupid money. Even if it’s tried and true but it’s like old lady deodorant it’s no good. \n\nI feel sad and stressed about this situation. Of course I don’t let any of this on to her. We all remember we the stinky kid at school. She is the most beautiful being in the world to me and she is kind and gentle and sweet. I just really want to prevent this one other thing marking her out as different. \n\nAny recommendations will be greatly appreciated. ",

There's clearly something we've been missing. Are they NW0 because they're homeless or are they homeless because they're NW0?\n\nSo here is the new hypothesis:   \nNo mirrors, no grooming routines, no showers, no job. only eating what you'd usually throw away\n\nThe theory is simple: hair follicles thrive when you completely abandon self-awareness and aesthetic concern. Stress, mirrors, and microneedling are the opponent. Let your scalp believe it’s safe, and your temples may just follow suit.\n\nAnother benefit is that since you grow out your hair, no one will think you're balding.\n\nI haven’t tested this personally. This is purely theoretical but the evidence from observations is… compelling.\n\nThoughts? Has any one of you ever been homeless and if so, did you notice any regrowth?",

Wanting skin needling to help with my small acne scars. \n\nSecond photo: My skin after my third lactic acid peel. This happens after every peel and has been ongoing since starting in late October. The clinician said I needed to “remove buildup” with 2–3 peels before moving on to microneedling. She told me my skin wasn’t hydrated enough prior to peels and still states this. \n\nI asked whether I could be allergic to the peel, but didn’t get a clear answer. Instead, she keeps saying my skin isn’t hydrated enough. I’ve followed all her hydration recommendations, but the issue continues. Some breakouts are deep and hurt as they come to the surface. \n\nAt this point, my skin is worse than before I started treatment. I’m seriously considering not returning and getting a second opinion as I feel that I’m going backwards… \n\nAny advice would be appreciated, thank you.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "Hey guys, just wanted to share my experience and what worked for me.\n\nSo I started getting this reddish dry patch under my eye, which would then spread to the area just above the eyelid. Over the course of 2-3 days, this would turn into flaky dry skin which was visible even with no makeup.\n\nI had never in my life experienced this before, but it started happening to me right after I met my new flatmate who had a lot of skin concerns and used to get this same eye dryness issue since her childhood. I researched a bit and it doesn't seem to be contagious, but I don't have any other explanation as to why I started getting this all of a sudden.\n\nShe told me her derma suggested her to use [La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume](https://www.boots.ie/la-roche-posay-cicaplast-baume-b5-soothing-repairing-balm-100ml-10149155?srsltid=AfmBOopoV9I2wUuQ1z44iYm1ua358hCHEMOxs-4bCdphy9Vq2ciJ7mfP), but this would take a whole week to fix the dryness around my eyes. This had become like a cycle where the red patch appeared and the whole thing was fixed after 1 week, and right after 2 days the red patch would appear again. One time it got so bad that it spread to around my lips and the doctor prescribed Calvepen 666mg tablets.\n\nHe suggested me to wipe my table, computer accessories and specs frame regularly. After reading multiple reddit threads, I started using [Blepharitis Eye Lid Foam](https://www.boots.ie/boots-pharmaceuticals-blepharitis-eye-lid-foam-100-ml-10205857) to clean my eyes every morning. Every time I could see the dryness starting even a bit, I would immediately apply [Eucerin Aquaphor](https://www.boots.ie/eucerin-aquaphor-soothing-skin-balm-40ml-10131555) multiple times throughout the day. This routine has thankfully stopped the cycle, and I haven't gotten it for 1.5 months now. I will update if anything changes.\n\nI deal with wrinkles under the eyes and dark circles around my eyes for which I am using [Eucerin Anti-Pigment Eye Care Cream](https://www.boots.ie/eucerin-anti-pigment-dark-circle-illuminating-eye-care-cream-15ml-10323699) in the morning, [Estée Lauder Gel Eye Cream](https://www.boots.ie/estÉe-lauder-advanced-night-repair-eye-supercharged-gel-creme-15ml-10316434) in the night and [Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum](https://www.boots.ie/beauty-of-joseon-revive-eye-serum-ginseng-and-retinal-30ml-10348093)on alternate nights. If you guys have any better routines that worked for you, please feel free to leave your suggestions!",
