The explanation is gonna be long bc i had to spend so long perfecting my hair bc it's SOOOO picky.\n\nI didn't really unclump the bottom parts so ignore the uneven lengths.\n\nRoutine: \n\nShampoo and conditioner: Marc Anthony triple moisturizing \n\nLeave in conditioner: As I am Leave in \n\nCurl cream: Miss Jessie's Multicultural Curl Cream\n\nGel: The Doux Big Poppa Gel\n\nBrushes: Tangle Teezer and Knock off bounce curl brush \n\nFor each small section: Wet hair. Apply leave in. Wet again. Brush . Add curl cream. Massage. Brush. Wet. Add gel. Massage. Brush with knock off curl brush. Repeat for every section .  If my hair did not feel silky after this I'd wet it again and add some more gel LOL. I have a lot of hair so it took a long time. \n\nBlow drying it took even longer. If i try air drying or scrunching with a microfiber towel before diffusing, my hair will throw a fit and then frizz up. I hover and blow dry on high until there's a lot of casting and definition, then with medium heat i put the diffuser to the bottom of my hair and blow dry up. I flip my head side to side doing this. Then after i see more definition and it begins to dry i switch to cold and scrunch the hair till its half its length and just repeat that. It was still damp when i stopped so i let it air dry for a few hours.\n\nLast week I washed my hair and used Loreals glossing shampoo and conditioner. Before that I used loreals clarifying shampoo and conditioner and mielles babusu and mint deep contioner. I use those three in a cycle.\n\nWhen i sleep i normally wrap it in a silk scarf and then put  a bonnet on over that. I'm a crazy sleeper and it works.\n\nI normally hate doing my hair because of how soaked i get but i cant function with a towel over my shoulders. It's overstimulating and i hate it lmfao. But i made myself power through it and here we go! Pretty sure this is the most perfected my routine has gotten. But there's still some frizz so who knows...\n\nLOL i love it tho. So cute. I have curtain bangs too.",

      "content": " \nI was using minimalist and plum sunscreens last year and they just felt very sticky, greasy or just uncomfortable out in the sun. But this sunscoop actually feels like a proper body lotion that just happens to have SPF 50+ PA++++ in it. Like i just get out of the shower, pump it out like a normal body lotion which acts as a sunscreen too 😭\n\n**Texture and feel**\nVery smooth lotion texture. Not runny, not thick and spreads easily and absorbs pretty fast. After it settles, it doesn’t feel heavy or oily. My skin just feels normal and soft. I can get dressed in a few minutes without that sticky sunscreen feeling.\n\nIt’s SPF 50+ PA++++ with broad spectrum UVA and UVB protection. I’ve worn it out in proper sun and didn’t notice tanning or redness. \n\n**Ingredients I liked**\nWhat makes it better than basic sunscreens is the added skincare.\n5 percent Niacinamide to help with pigmentation and even skin tone.\nIt has 5 Essential Ceramides too.\n\n**Full ingredient list on the bottle:**\nPurified Water, Octocrylene, Niacinamide, Octyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Trehalose, Methylene Bis Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Avena Sativa Oat Kernel Extract, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Aloe Vera Extract, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Propanediol, 1,2 Hexanediol, Hexyldecanol, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Ceramide AS, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide NG, Sodium Acrylate Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, C15 19 Alkane, Fragrance, Sodium Polyacrylate, PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer 6, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium EDTA, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum.\n\nIt’s also free from Benzophenone, Formaldehyde &amp; Oxybenzone, atleast that's what the bottle says.\n\n**Hydration**\nIt actually feels moisturizing. I’ve skipped my regular body lotion a few times and this alone was enough. No dryness, no tightness.\n\nI do not write such long reviews but i am fr in love with this Sunscoop sunscreen body lotion and is honestly the most comfortable body sunscreen I’ve used. High protection, good ingredients, lightweight feel and no greasy mess. For daily use, it’s a solid 10 for me. \n\nDefinitely repurchasing!!!",

      "content": "Hair loss is extremely depressing, especially if you're struggling with it at a young age like me. So, I'm making this post to hopefully help some folks keep good spirits about this whole thing. Especially as talk of new treatments is all the rave right now.\n\nI just want to start right away with saying that regardless of who you are, you aren't alone in the slightest. Hair loss is a very common condition, and there is no shame in being upset about it. You're not bad or worth and less just because your hair is losing density or is receding (or both). It's not your fault, nor really anyone's fault.\n\nIn the modern age, there are a plethora of treatments available to you. From Fin and Dut, to Minox and dermarolling. These aren't universal remedies though, sadly, and won't work for everyone. If these don't work for you, don't beat yourself up for it. The fact that you are trying is more than enough; hell, most folks don't even know they can stop / slow down hairloss in the first place. If worst comes to worst, you can always try wigs / hair systems, and you shouldn't feel bad for doing so. You can also get a hair transplant, given that the medications helped stabilize your loss. Plenty of sources on reputable surgeons and clinics out there. Caring about how you look isn't something to be ashamed about, especially if you're more masculine leaning. \n\nOf course, you might not want to wear wigs, which is more than fair. I could literally feel my wallet die when looking at some of those prices lol. That and the upkeep for those things seems about on par with something in a museum.\n\nRegardless, you don't have to be bald if you don't want to, especially in this day and age (given you are willing to spend a lot of money on this stuff lmao). And even if you do go completely bald, you aren't any less you than you were when you first started losing it. You still have value, regardless of how you look. \n\nNow regarding the future, I'm pretty optimistic. It's a common trope to say that it'll just be five years away (regarding any type of cure), but it seems like things are definitely rolling right now in a good direction. Technology will continue to advance and with that, more R&amp;D regarding this issue and funding pertaining. Now, I don't necessarily believe things like PP405 or VDPHL01 will be our true panaceas, but from what we know about them, they'll certainly help us down the line regarding our hair loss. The future is very uncertain, but it doesn't come all at once; just a day at a time. Patience is key.\n\nRemember, we're all in this game together whether we wanted to be or not. The best thing we can do is keep our spirits up and support each other when we can. ",

My hair is rather long/medium, straight and very thick.\n\nI would like to try something along the lines of the last 3 images.\n\n I don’t rly know much about hair terminology (sorry) nor have I ever done anything particularly special with my hair before but- layers that could frame my face nicely and a side fringe (I’m rly interested in trying out a side fringe as something different, although I am worried it might not suit me) \n\nI just feel like my hair at the moment is kinda bleh. Nothing special about it and I want to try something different.\n\nI was speaking to my mother about this and she is adamant I’d be unable to achieve this cut as my hair is so thick and straight and thinks I should just stick to a few small layers. \n\nSo just wanted some advice! \n\nThank you ",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",
