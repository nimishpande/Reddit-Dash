For gel and mousse I use the kinky curls gel and texture ID mousse and that’s the exact routine I had when my hair was voluminous).

Yeah so Tretinoin really does work if used according to your skins needs. (If you want to ask about peeling, then yes it peeled for first one year and now also it peels but significantly low peeling, and strangely the peeling kinda reduced when I jumped from 0.05% to 0.1%, so yeah it might take different durations for your skin to adapt to the peeling). If you have acne like me just know that tret can fix this, you just gotta trust the process.",

My hair is extremely frizzy, and whenever I wash it gets super dried out. It only looks okay if I haven't washed it for a few days. It also grows very slowly, if thats anything. \n\nDoes anybody have any advice for this kind of badly damaged hair? Should I lob it all off and start fresh? What kind of products do you recommend to keep it smooth/shiny without losing my curls? Any aftercare rituals? ",

      "content": "Hey folks,  \nLooking for some opinions (or better yet personal experiences) on whether using minoxidil twice a day is actually worth it compared to once. Here is what I gathered so far:\n\n* HairLoss Channel on YouTube says once daily is fine.\n* Some studies suggest twice daily is “optimal” and can give \\~20% better regrowth\n* Some users argue minoxidil stays active on the scalp for \\~22 hours, so once should be enough.\n* But then I’ve seen comments saying that by the end of the day, the concentration is too low if you only apply once so twice would be better.\n\n**My routine:**\n\n* Dutasteride daily\n* Finasteride daily\n* Minoxidil once daily (with 0.25 dermastamping EOD \\~30 mins before application)\n* 1.5 dermastamping once every 2 weeks and skip minox that day\n* PS: Where I live - Tretionion and oral minox are unavailable\n\nBeen consistent for 5+ years. My scalp skin is pretty thick from all the dermastamping lol so I rarely bleed, just some redness. Started late in my hair loss journey (around Norwood 3) since I always had thin hair and my temples were pretty high since young age, and nobody told me about thinning crown. Treatments have helped me a lot, I managed to keep what I have, thicken things up, and get some regrowth, but not enough to cover everything properly without using styling/masking products.\n\nIf I can expect around 20% improvement, I’d go for it. If it's none or lower than 20% I would skip it since all these meds are pretty pricey.\n\n  \nEdit: Some errors about my routine",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I go through phases of having it naturally wavy, but each time it comes out differently - sometimes the way I want it, and other times it’s just a pain (like fluffy/frizzy on top, just not as nice as the curls/waves underneath) - and I guess this is where I need advice on how to avoid this and what styling products to use! I am open to trying mousse/gels etc but worried about it looking hard and sticky? \n\nI will try my best to explain my routine and also put pics up. I wash my hair with redken all soft, and brush it with a wet brush as soon as I get out. I then use ‘as I am’ leave in hair conditioner cream for curls. I also add a small bit of macadamia oil. Then I leave it to dry naturally, and I found what works better for me if sort of twisting sections and then leaving it. When it’s dry I then shake my hair upside down etc so it goes more volume. As it’s winter sometimes to hurry it up I do use diffuser right at the end but in the summer I can leave it to dry fast. \n\nSo the first pic is my hair today (bad hair day lol) fluffy on top etc. 2nd pic is what I do when my hair is wet, I twist it like that (I did used to scrunch it, not sure why I do this now lol maybe to avoid frizz) and 3rd pic is a better hair day, but it’s rare lol.\n\nAny advice etc is much appreciated!

My budget is limited, which makes this even harder\n\nEstenove keeps popping up in ads. Their videos look solid and they have tons of positive Google and Trustpilot reviews, which is reassuring. Fuecapilar gets recommended everywhere, but it’s a bit expensive. Dr. Turan seems very legit, but I’m not sure if the difference is worth going into debt for. I’ve also seen some mixed Google reviews, even though the good results look really great. I had a video consult with Dr. Mesut and everything felt very positive. I like that it’s a boutique clinic and they only do one operation per day and I’ve found some positive real patient reviews online. On the other hand, Estenove and especially Dr. Serkan Aygin have thousands of reviews, which feels safer in a different way. With Dr. Serkan Aygin there’s so much content out there that my brain is kind of fried at this point.\n\nI really don’t want to add more clinics and confuse more. Any honest advice?",

I washed my hair with Luseta Beauty Curl Enhancing Coconut Oil shampoo (just something I pick up at tj maxx, conditioning with Renpure Coconut &amp; Vitamin E Moisturize and Replenish Conditioner, then after I got out of the shower (when my hair was still wet but not dripping) divided the hair into sections and applied through raking Kenra Curl Creme 5 and Paul Mitchell Invisiblewear Memory Shaper hair gel. I lightly scrunch with my hair upside down with a cotton t shirt to remove excess water and diffuse with heat on low, flip style hair with drying the roots first and, at the end, lightly give the roots a lift with the diffuser (functional frizz for lift). After I feel the gel has cast, I lightly cup the strands with the diffuser, following my natural curl pattern.  \n  \nAnd that was it! My hair lasted a solid 5-6 days, with occasional touch-up using argon oil for any frizz at around day 3.    \n  \nI’ve been using Paul Mitchell Invisiblewear Memory Shaper hair gel for years. I loved how it wasn’t sticky in my hair, clumped my waves and curls for several days, and they stayed soft.\n\nAnd then it got discontinued.\n\nI was wondering if anyone here knows a good replacement for the hair gel? That works similarly?  I have fine-medium thickness hair (maybe more to fine), naturally curly/wavy hair if that helps (I think 2A-3B?)  ",

      "content": "I used to use CeraVe products until I started breaking out all the time. Ever since then, about 1 and a half years ago, I have always at least had one active breakout on my face. I went to the dermatologist who put me on tret .05 and clindamycin. It partially worked for a little while, but recently it has completely stopped working and actually seems to be exacerbating my acne, so I decided to take a break from it. My face looks dull and irritated, I have deep smile lines (seemingly out of nowhere) that points to dehydration, I have small pimples and acne scars all over my face. I figured at this point that the tret had destroyed my skin barrier and soaked up all the moisture from my skin. My acne is most likely hormonal or diet-based. I started eating heathy, going to the gym regularly, and drinking a lot more water. The irritation seems to have gone down a little bit, but my skin just looks so…bad and dehydrated I guess. I look three years older than I am, and I feel like it JUST started looking like this. I am not even sure what my skin type is..my dermatologist kind of failed me lol. I think it’s combination…\n\nMy current routine\n\nAM: Micellar water and then rinse, Clinique moisture surge \n\nPM: Micellar water, then Burt’s Bees aloe cleanser, some aloe vera gel and LaRoche Posay toleraine double repair matte moisturizer \n\nCould somebody help tweak my routine if it looks like anything might be making my skin worse? What are some products that might help bring the hydration back to my face? How can I repair my skin barrier? Do my symptoms even point to a damaged skin barrier, or something else? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
