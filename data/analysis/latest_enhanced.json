      "content": "So I’m seeing a lot of people in this subreddit recommending and using Honasa-owned brand sunscreens (Mamaearth / Derma Co / Aqualogica / Dr. Sheth / Dot &amp; key  etc.) without knowing the full picture.\n\n\nRecent independent tests have raised serious concerns about whether many of these sunscreens actually deliver the SPF protection they claim. In several cases, the protection was found to be much lower than what’s written on the label.\nHonestly, a lot of these products work more like moisturizers with sunscreen-like texture, not real sun protection.\n\nI know some people will say:\n\n“But I love the texture”\n\n“It suits my skin”\n\n“I don’t tan when I use it”\n\n\nBut liking the feel ≠ getting actual UV protection.\nWith summer coming and harsh sun exposure, low or unreliable SPF can still lead to tanning, pigmentation, and long-term damage.\n\nI’m saying this from personal experience too.\nA few months ago, I also used some Honasa sunscreens because influencers hyped them so much. Now I’m stuck trying to reverse my tan , which is way harder than preventing it in the first place.\n\n\nThis isn’t brand hate, just a warning.\nPlease don’t blindly trust influencer marketing and don’t waste your money on sunscreens that may not protect you properly. Invest in tested, reliable sunscreens, especially if you’re outdoors a lot.\n\nLearn from my mistake. Skin damage is expensive and slow to fix.",

Most curlyheads rave on about getting a poofy mess in the morning after waking up when mines the complete opposite, I wake up with thin pin straight hair and if I don’t add water or some type of leave in conditioner, it will be stuck straight forever. Is my hair some type of hybrid???\n\nMy routine:\n\nI shampoo and condition once a week using the based shampoo and conditioner. Then I style with either the As I am bond leave-in or the based leave in followed by the based curl creme and gel. I usually like to switch it up and use different products such as multicultural curls or pillow soft curls from miss jessies or something like the bee girl gel from doux.\n\nI also co-wash once a week using the based conditioner and following it with the same routine above.\n\nFor every product I usually scrunch it in or brush style, but if I’m feeling fancy I’ll finger coil(this takes WAY too much time though).\n\nTo protect my hair while I sleep, I use a silk bonnet but sometimes I get lazy and just sleep without it, I don’t think this really matters because I also use a silk pillowcase.\n\nFor drying, I diffuse my hair until it’s a complete gel cast and I scrunch it out with this generic jojoba oil from my local dollar store. Sometimes if I’m in a rush, I just diffuse until its at least 50% dry and just it air dry for the rest of the time(still using oil after tho).",

It’s so smooth, moisturizing, &amp; actually cures. I use it on dry spots anywhere, my elbows, my eyelashes, for everything! It’s a MIRACLE! And it’s not expensive either. It lasts forever I’ve had mine for months &amp; use it everyday. The tube is big too when you use it as a lip product \n\nI didn’t wanna gatekeep this secret so please get some &amp; update me if you want even!!

Dermat  suggested this one shampoo.He said dandruff feels like the main issue and lets get bloodwork done if this doesnt resolve the problem.I feel after two washes this shampoo has increased my hairfall.This shampoo first gives a colling effect and then a irritation/burning sensation.Might be because of my sensitive scalp.Although i cannot say with surity as the past two weeks i have been able to wash my hair at far gaps and this increases the hairfall during shampoo as ive heard.\n\nso please help me. i need help regarding two things.\n\n1. Are the ingredients of this shampoo that bad? As per my basic research they arent that harmful. They are a bit medical and thats the reason behind them smelling a particular way too.\n\n2. Knowing stress and diet are some major reasons, But if you can please suggest some shampoo/oil which has soothed your dandruff or hairfall previously.\n\nany advice would be of great help.🤍",

There are acne, acne marks, visible pores, redness around the nose, etc.\n\nMy current skincare routine is quite basic: Simple Gentle Cleanser + Minimalist Moisturizer + Neutrogena Sunscreen. I skip the sunscreen at nighttime. I also use benzoyl peroxide for spot treatment.\n\nShould I change these products and/or add to this routine?\n\nPS I’m really hoping to get some advice on this community-based group because, other than going to a dermatologist which I might still do, I don’t know where else I can get personal advice like this.

But even with all this, the pigmentation is still really stubborn and it’s lowkey frustrating\n\nI’ve been seeing people talk about so many different things like TXA, niacinamide, Thiamidol, etc and honestly it’s just made me more confused. I’m not planning to buy anything immediately, just trying to understand what actually helped people over time and what ended up being mostly hype\n\nIf you’ve dealt with acne marks/PIH that took forever to fade, I’d love to hear your experience-what you tried, what helped, or what didn’t\n\nSkincare online feels overwhelming af 😭",

Outwardly, i dont think people perceive my nose in a negative manner, in fact sometimes i get complimented on it. But i personally have never liked my nose, and i want to change it. I  dont want to undergo the surgical rhino route for various reasons (mainly cost), but i have heard negative talk around non-surgical/liquid rhinoplasties. I think nose filler would be more suitable for me in theory, because i dont mind increasing the volume within my nose (which is what filler would do) - i just want the change to be slightly different. \n\n  \nMy nose, and face, in general is super asymmetrical, so i was wondering if fillers would help with this? i have a very undefined nose tip, which i know would be better to undergo surgical rhino or nasal tip plasty - but again i do not have the funds or means for that. Overall i would just like a more defined look from the front, and a more lifted side profile (slight swoop from tip). If there are severe medical risks involved with this procedure, what should i know going moving forward, and are my requests even achievable??\n\n",
