      "content": "I have always been afraid of expressing myself as my mom and uncles used to tease me for how my hair curled and I became embarrased by it (it was just teasing but I took it to heart because I THOUGHT curls were \"feminine\" and I wanted to be a big strong man in a rural area. I know curls aren't a feminine thing btw) anyway my friend encouraged me to grow my hair out at the beginning of 2024 and I'm so grateful. People always compliment my hair, and I hate that it took me so long to embrace a part of me. The last photo is from May of this year when I had a different method so you can see the difference. Thank you to everyone who commented on my last curly hair post and gave me tips!! Have a great holiday season everyone 💖\n\nProducts listed at bottom.\nRoutine:\nI wash my hair two times a week. For one wash just shampoo and conditioner.\nOnce a week: wash with clarifying shampoo, then shampoo, then conditioner then conditioning treatment\nWith still dripping wet hair, apply curl creme then scrunch, then apply mousse and scrunch thoroughly, then gel and scrunch.\nDiffuse hair. Scrunch out crunch or use hair oil\n\n\nShampoo: not your mother's curl defining shampoo\nConditioner: not your mother's curl defining conditioner\nDeep conditioning treatment: Mielle Organics Babassu Oil and Mint Deep Conditioner (5-15 minutes) rinse out\nCurl creme: Briogeo Curl Charisma Rice Amino + Avocado Leave–In Defining Cream\nMousse:Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Activating Mousse\nCurl Gel: Briogeo Curl Charisma Rice Amino + Quinoa Frizz Control Gel\nOil: Oaui hair oil\n I wear a satin bonnet to bed every night, and use satin pillowcases and do not do a refresh routine.

      "content": "Notes from a skin cosmetologist.\n\nIndian skin tans easily, marks easily, and holds onto pigmentation longer. Ik, it's a little sad. Mostly because our melanin response is very active (thanks to sun + heat + inflammation).\n\nIf you're dealing with tanning, dark spots, or acne marks, here are ingredients that actually work, and (istg this is more important) how they work:\n\n1. Mulberry Extract\nA gentle tyrosinase inhibitor. What this does is it slows the enzyme that makes excess pigment. Good for people who want brightening without irritation.\n\n2. Niacinamide\nDoesn’t lighten melanin!\nInstead, it reduces melanosome transfer, which means less pigment gets passed to the surface layers.\nAmazing for acne marks, PIH\n\n3. Alpha Arbutin\nA stable brightening ingredient that also inhibits tyrosinase, but gradually\nGreat for uneven tone without harshness.\n\n4. Licorice Extract\nContains glabridin + liquiritin. Magical as they are, both work as tyrosinase suppressors + anti-inflammatory... Licorice is giving 😌\nSo it treats dark spots and the inflammation causing them.\n\n5. Centella (Cica)\nMy favourite when it comes to formulating! Not a brightener by itself, but reduces inflammation + oxidative stress, which are major triggers for pigmentation.\n\nBiggest rule for pigmentation :\nREDUCE INFLAMMATION FIRST.\nBrightening only works when the skin is calm.\n\nHope this helps!",

However, I got on it as soon as I got home. \n\nAfter going on fin for 3 to 4 months, I realised my hair was no longer brittle. My hair grew back nicely in the transplant area and all my hair felt less brittle. In 2023, I was happy and added oral minoxidil to the mix. I definitely felt some more thickness after the first shed, but not as much as I had hoped for.\n\nAbout 5 months ago, I added dutasteride to the mix three times a week, still taking the full dose of fin to try and avoid a shed. I am not quite sure why, but adding this has had an absolutely insane effect on my hair. I am in my 40s and have been thinning since I was 17. I would say my hair is now thicker than when I was 18. Loads of small hairs.\n\nAt the barbers today, I looked in the mirror and with my wet hair I could not see any scalp. I honestly cannot remember the last time I saw that. I have come home and shone my phone light on my scalp looking in the mirror and there are so many new short hairs with fresh regrowth. I was planning to ditch fin after six months, but I might just keep this stack now as it is working so well.\n\nI just wanted to give a perspective from someone who has taken fin and min for a long time, and the thing that worked the most in the mix several years later has been Dutasteride.\n",

      "content": "Im going to try to summarize as best as I can....\n\nIve been struggling with acne for my entire adult life (10 years) pregnancy/post partum hormones shifted and this last year ive been back on a trying to figure out my skin because its terrible to have massive scarred acne as an adult game. Nutrition/supplement wise i take beef liver and methyfolate daily and avoid processed sugars, gluten and dairy. This seemingly helped some inflammation in the warmer months.\n\nThe other thing that was helpful for a time was... get this... I stopped washing it! Physical exfoliating scrub once every other day and then a natural organic plant based balm twice a day. That was it and it was working. Until winter hit and my skin is screaming profanities while simultaneously giving me the middle finger. This is my forehead currently. I can not in any combination figure out a moisturizer that actually moistures and routine that hydrates my skin. Ive tried LRP cicafalate, LRP lipikar and daily moisturizer, cerave night cream, round lab, snail mucin, oils, HA, avene mineral spray, more not mentioned. I recently added a humidifier. I just cant do this anymore, derms just want to put me on Accutane and im currently paused on my tret because my skin is, im learning, very reactive and dry. Also have had patches of eczema since pregnancy. So im sending this out in to the universe hoping, praying, some skin gurus will be able to help me.\n\nThe rest of my skin is scarred, cratered and covered in post inflammation hyperpigmentation marks. The cysts and hormonal acne along my jaw line has resolved since the diet changes and supplements but my barrier is f\\*d. My texture is horrible, fine lines, for a time putting anything on my skin would burn even things approved for literal chemo patients. Like wtf is wrong with me. How do actually cleanse and shrink pores, add hydration to my skin in the winter without making it react, even my tone and smooth texture?? I will take all the advice &lt;3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m967zwrin98g1.jpg?width=1017&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a61f16551f01af2e6ec21e3de153e4d769b78b15\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hcfrbzgis98g1.jpg?width=3216&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=512d478d2b6b8374d81f67a30dffd2b245dd46da\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6pa7lzgis98g1.jpg?width=1488&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e532fca2d97c0112c5fdf70eef4c78461b5fd83\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d8w5u5his98g1.jpg?width=1488&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df706977716788bc719dab8b21b42a59a3b0f3b6\n\nedit: medically ive r/o thyroid, cortisol, PCOS, and DM.

I keep seeing mixed reviews about the shark flexfusion and need your advice! Is it worth it? Also saw a Babyliss 5 in one, but the reviews were low on that. Definitely dont want to break the bank with a dyson but could MAYBE be swayed since holiday deals are happening.

I asked ChatGPT to build me a weekly routine and I’ve attached the schedule image it gave me, but I’d really like real‑world opinions from this sub.\n\nI have a few questions:\n\n1. Does this kind of weekly structure with separate retinol, peptide, and barrier‑support nights actually make sense for someone my age with dry skin, or is it overkill and risking my barrier?  \n\n2. What specific products would you recommend?\n\n3. How would you tweak this routine to keep the anti‑aging benefits while minimizing dryness or irritation (for example, changing retinol frequency, simplifying steps on active nights, or changing how I layer products)?  \n\n4. If you had dry skin and starting to see fine lines, what would your core night routine look like?\n\nI’d really appreciate product recs and any changes you’d make to the schedule ChatGPT gave me so it’s more realistic and skin‑barrier friendly.\n\nThanks a lot! 😊",

I’m addressing the source now, and it should be improving eventually, but I’m having a really hard time not hating my hair. I miss my old hair. It defined easily with minimal product and effort and pretty much always looked good. Now I put in 3x the effort for 1/3 of the results, and they’re inconsistent too. I don’t know how to have anything but resentment towards my hair for reflecting health issues that could’ve been caught earlier if healthcare professionals bothered to check anything. It’s also been falling out since February and isn’t stopping. I rarely like how my hair looks now, and I don’t know what to do about it. It is not a length thing, as my hair was starting to loosen up when it was still shorter too. I’ll list my routine, so really anything helps. Maybe from people who have my current hair type? I haven’t felt compelled to give up on caring for my hair in a long time, but this has definitely taken me there. \n\nHair type now: wavy, coarse, medium density \nHair type before: curly, coarse, high density \n\nCurrent routine: Innersense clarity hair bath and hydrating cream conditioner. Styler is usually 1 lightweight foam and 1 gel,  ex. the tgin miracle foam + innersense I create curl memory. Usually brush styled with a denman or bounce curl definition brush, scrunched, diffused.

I thought it would go away as i got older but it never did and it kills all my self confidence. It’s there on my back (very severe), chest, shoulders and upper arms too.\n\nI tried multiple things last year, benzoyl peroxide spray + body wash and SA spray + body wash and nothing seems to work. Currently I’m just using a SA body wash but it doesn’t change a thing.\n\nChatGPT suggests me to use a Ketoconazole Shampoo like Nizoral on my body. I asked chatgpt if i should rather go with a Sulphur Soap bar as i saw many people recommending it but it said it’d be too drying and won’t be as effective as Nizoral.\n\nNeed desperate help and guidance 😭 Thank you :)",

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
