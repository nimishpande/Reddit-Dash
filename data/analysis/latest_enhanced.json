      "content": "The first clip is from 2024, and I considered that a good hair day. The second clip (black shirt) is from today’s hair wash. I went to a curly hair stylist that helped me blend my layers together more. I’m due for a hair cut soon to add shape back into my hair. When I started my hair journey back 2021, I tried everything, from brush styling to the bowl method and spending a lot of money on too many hair products. Then one day I just started a simple routine with 1-2 styling product (that’s how I learned what my hair likes.). I noticed since my hair is fine, I need texture styling products. I had to learn to love my hair, since my hair has so many patterns. I used to be so envious of people with perfect curls/waves. My straight bottom hair used to be my biggest insecurity about my hair. Once I started noticing more people that had hair like mine, it helped me accept my hair. And taking pictures along the way while trying to figure it out, helped majorly and keeping track of which products work and didn’t work. If you have been on your curly/wavy hair journey or just started, don’t stop. I know it can be frustrating, but keep going, it’s worth it. \n\nRoutine: \n\n1. Shampoo - Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat (wash x2 since I wash every 2-3 days) \n\n2. Conditioner - Giovanni 50:50 Balance \n\n3. Wet plop for about 10 minutes \n\n4. Take my hair out of towel and shake my head side to side, then take my fingers and shake my hair roots that are stuck to my scalp. \n\n5. Scrunch Not Your Mother’s Beach Babe Foam, one side at a time. Making sure I get the back of my head ask well. then wait 10-15 minutes. Then defuse with hair dryer. ",

My hair is naturally super super thin but frizzy, I have the same hair as my mom but she gets it straightened with keratin. \n\nSo for funsies I decided not to brush my hair after the shower and used a conditioner ( shea moisture)  and did the bowl method, followed by texturizing spray (bed head) and curl mouse (pattern) . I also “ plopped” my hair for a bit and then diffused it and it turned out like this ( will attach pics). My curly haired friend said that I don’t actually have wavy hair, that anyone with straight hair can use a few curling products and end up with the same hair. Do I actually have wavy hair? Or am I just gaslighting myself? If I do have wavy hair I can imagine i’ve damaged it quite a lot over the years by not taking care of it properly. Please help! \n\nRoutine: \n\n1. Revlon Gloss shampoo and conditioner \n\n2. leave in: shea moisture hydrate manuka honey \n\n3. bed head texturing spray \n\n4. pattern mouse \n\n5. plop\n\n6. diffuse ",

Being a competitive swimmer left my hair damaged and broken. Long story short, I buzzed it and then grew it back out. \n\nFast forward to now: the first picture is my hair after oil and a diffuser (my sister who has VERY curly hair recommend I try the diffuser) and it worked! However, the second picture is after sleeping on a satin pillowcase and having it in a large claw clip all day (I work in food service so it has to be put up). My bangs are dried with a round brush. \n\nRoutine:\n\n1) Aussie miracle shampoo and conditioner (finger combing in the shower) \n\n2) scrunching with a towel and adding Aussie leave-in conditioner (not in this photo since i’m out of it), then Palmer’s amino binding complex hair oil, and lastly i tired Aussie (can you tell i like the way their products smell? xD) mousse. And lastly argon oil heat shield. \n\n3) I used a cheap diffuser from Amazon (hey, it had good reviews!) and dried my roots a bit before the rest if my hair flipped over the top of my head, then flipped on either side, then established a part standing straight. \n\nI basically want to know how to keep the curls looking curly if it’s possible with my lifestyle. I love the way they look, but they keep falling out. \n\nAlso, it’s hard to tell in the photos, but the bottom layer of my hair wants to be straight. Any advice on how to handle that with curlier top pieces? And if anyone could tell me what type of curls I have that would be appreciated! Because I have no idea. \n\nThanks for reading this far! ❤️",

Over the past several months, I’ve been trying samples of k-beauty skincare and I've been really enjoying using them. The samples I've tried include Mixsoon bean and sentella essences, most of Peach and Lily’s line, Aestura deluxe sample from Sephora, innisfree green tea moisturizer and spf and, most recently samples from HaruHaru’s hyaluronic acid toner and milky essence. These samples helped me decide what my routine will look like.\n\nI'm 33F have dehydrated combo skin and my concerns are texture and anti aging (no wrinkles, but fine lines are starting to form). My skin can get sensitive \\*sometimes\\*.\n\nDay:\n\n\\- Wash with warm water or use a Peach &amp; Lily Lazy Day pad \n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice Hyaluronic Toner for Sensitive Skin\n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice Probiotic Barrier\n\nEssence\n\n\\- Peach &amp; Lily Rescue Party Barrier Serum\n\n\\- Aestura Atobarrier 365 Lotion\n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice Bakuchiol Eye Cream\n\n\\- Innisfree Daily UV Defense Invisible Korean Broad Spectrum SPF 36 Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice Moisture Cleansing\n\nGel\n\n\\- TIRTIR Milk Skin Toner\n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice Probiotic Barrier\n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice Night Knight Retinol\n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice 5 Ceramide Barrier\n\nMoisturizing Cream\n\n\\- HaruHaru Wonder Black Rice Bakuchiol Eye Cream\n\n\\- erborian 17 ingredients Night Perfecting Oil\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or comments about any of the products? Does anyone have a good dupe for Tatcha the Indigo Night Cream? I'll miss that in my routine, but it's out of my budget now. Also looking for good K-beauty masks or treatments! I know medicube is popular, but they have really mixed reviews on Ulta. So far I just have Peach &amp; Lily Cryo Reset Calming Mask Pads and other non K-beauty masks/scrubs/treatments.\n\nTLDR: Most of my routine is now K-beauty, looking for a thicker night cream and any K-beauty treatments/ masks/exfoliators for sometimes sensitive, dehydrated/combo aging skin. 🙏 ",
