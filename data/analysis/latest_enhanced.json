      "content": "Hi everyone. About six months ago I posted here in a pretty desperate mood and shared a picture of what I thought was my completely unrully hair. Even back then some people were sceptical, because my hair can look good sometimes, but the issue was always that it only lasted for a day. After that the curls disappeared and I had to redo everything every single morning, which was exhausting.\n\nFor context, I straightened my hair from around age 13 for almost ten years. I have only been properly embracing my natural curls for about a year and a half, so I am definitely still figuring things out.\n\nA few months ago I got the full Bali Curls line as a gift, and since then I have actually stuck to one routine. I now wash my hair with the Bali Curls Nourishing Shampoo and Bali Curls Nourishing Conditioner, brush it while it is wet, then comb through a small amount of Bali Curls Curl Cream. After that I apply a generous but not excessive amount of the Bali Curls Curl Defining Gel. I learned the hard way that too much gel just makes my hair feel heavy and lifeless (even though a lot of peole commented on my last post that theres no such a thing as too much gel, thats just not how it works for me)\n\nI scrunch with a cotton T shirt, plop for a few minutes, then diffuse. I start diffusing without touching my hair and only scrunch later. I never fully dry it because that would take forever. After about half an hour I scrunch in a bit of hair oil (honetsly I just use whatever brand is at my hands) and that is usually when things start looking good. I also use the Bali Curls Heat Protection Spray whenever I diffuse.\n\nOn non wash days I refresh with water from a spray bottle and usually diffuse a little in the morning if I am going out. I do not add extra product. The biggest change is that my hair now actually lasts. It still needs refreshing, but it does not completely fall apart anymore, and it finally looks like curls instead of a daily mystery.\n\nThanks again to everyone who commented on my original post. You were more right than I wanted to admit.",

      "title": "Trying to grow hair long, but thinking I’m ready to call it quits. Any insight?",
      "content": "Photos 1, 2, 3, 4: From today. A decent hair day, where I styled my hair with kinky curly knot today leave in. aussie instant freeze gel, and diffused it. Not the BEST hair day I’ve had, but good. Also showing it in the bun that I like to wear.\n\nPhoto 5: The other day. Styled my hair, but you can see how dry and wispy it can look.\n\nPhotos 6, 7(😛): Hair without products or styling, air dried. VERY soft and fine and loose waves, but the next day without products, it is nearly straight, and very flat and limp, hence why I need to often style with gel.\n\nPhoto 8: Another day without products… you can see how thin my ends are. I hate how I can see my back THROUGH my hair!!!\n\nPhoto 9: An example styled of how curly my hair can get at this length when styled well, but also the thinness of the ends. \n\nPhotos 10, 11, 12: Hair when it was short with choppy layers. I loved the bounce, fullness and curl. I feel it looks healthiest here, ans maybe I could have done more style wise (updos with small claw clips, etc? at the time to scratch the itch I have to put it up lol)\n\nPhoto 13: Kind of in between. Grown out from the short hair of the previous photos, but still not even touching my shoulders. Love this length also. \n\nHonestly, I’m just very tired of attempting to grow my hair out and I’m about to give up, book a hair appointment, and get it cut back to a short bob. I LOVED my short bob, anywhere between chin length to just above shoulders, my hair is curly, bouncy and full. I’ve been attempting to grow my hair out for a year or so at this point, with 2-3 small trims in 2025. But as its gotten to collar length, it just gets SO wispy. My hair doesn’t curl like it did, and even good hair days are mainly flocked with rough ones. My ends get thin and wispy no matter what, I hate that I can see through them. My hair grows very slow, and I’m starting to wonder if this is even worth it. Sure, I love the look of long wavy hair, but even if I get there, it won’t be thick and lucsious. I’m already getting frustrated with the increased need for product, upkeep, how dry it gets, and the main things tethering me to keep on trying is the idea that I just need to “push through” the wispiness at this length so the fuller hair can catch up, AND that I love that I can put it in a messy updo finally… but again, is it worth it if I end up crying at how thin it looks most days? My hair has looked visually very much similar over the last year despite growth, you can go back and check my post from a bunch of months ago. \n\nI guess I’m just asking, does this even seem worth it for me? I was happier with short hair, but I also yearn for long hair, but frankly, I KNOW its a huge time commitment, energy commitment, etc etc that maybe I just don’t have. I dont even know what I’d do if it did get long - I don’t know how to braid, I know I won’t want to learn elaborate hairstyles or oil anyway. I just feel conflicted bc I keep getting pulled in by yayy messy bun!! Urghh i dont know what to do, I wish my hair wasn’t so fine and wispy and fragile!!😭\n\nMy CURRENT hair routine:\n\n\\- Wash and condition with herbal essence grapefruit shampoo and chamomile conditioner\n\n\\- Glaze and scrunch in kinky curly knot today leave in conditioner in shower\n\n\\- Out of shower, I lightly scrunch out excess water and glaze and scrunch in big quarter sized globs of aussie instant freeze gel\n\n\\- Scrunch hair and plop with microfiber headwrap\n\n\\- Remove wrap after I get dressed, add two more dime sized amounts of gel\n\n\\- Hover Diffuse on high heat high speed till cast forms, then low heat high speed diffuse by cupping my hair into sections\n\n\\- Scrunch out crunch and fluff. My routine has been very similar with random experimentations throughout the years, but it usually always comes back to this. \n\nWhile sleeping, if I don’t plan on showering the next day, I will sleep with my hair in a loose ponytail with a satin scrunchie on top of my head, and then glaze some water over it the next morning for an alright refresh with less defined but still voluminous curls.

I have some pimple patches on in the pictures.\n\nI've been on and off a few things, as recommended by a derm- tretinoin, clindamycin wipes, using sunscreen, not using sunscreen, Winlevi, and several different brands of cleansers.

That seems to not aggravate it, but not improve it, either. Eating healthier and increasing water intake helps, but my face still looks pretty much the same. Any ideas? Very desperate, lol",

Then I diffuse to 90 to dry.\n\nI'm just not happy with the results and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. My hair has gotten more dry and brittle with these two products - I can feel that as it dries. It doesn't feel hydrated ,in fact I feel Innersense producta seem to \"suck\" water out of my hair.

Especially the sides of my nose, if you look close — it’s oily. I can’t even cover that up with foundation without looking cakey because of the pores.\n\nMy current routine is very simple and I only use gentle products, with no parabens, fragrance, etc. I also don’t wear makeup.\n\n☀️ Morning\n\n1. Facial wash (gentle and moisturizing)\n\n2. Moisturizer (water based)\n\n3. Mineral subscreen (with niacinamide)\n\n4. Skintint (only occasionally)\n\n🌙 Night\n\n1.

      "content": "# TL;DR\n\n* **Holy Grails:** Minimalist SA Cleanser, Minimalist B12 Moisturiser, Minimalist Light Fluid Sunscreen, Cicaplast Baume B5+, Laneige Lip Mask, Minimalist Ceramides 0.3% + Madecassoside Moisturiser\n* **Will Repurchase:** Everything except the eye cream\n* **Will Not Repurchase:** The Derma Co Eye Cream\n\nSome products here contain denatured alcohol. My skin tolerates them well, but I avoid such formulations around my eyelids.\n\n \n\n# About me:\n\n29, combination skin (mostly dry with an oily T-zone). Acne-prone with noticeable Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, especially from adult acne that started in my late 20s. My skin isn’t barrier-damaged and can generally tolerate different products. My eyelids are very sensitive and can peel and dry out easily. I am also on a low dose oral isotretinoin treatment right now, so absolutely no topical Retinoids in my routine. I live in a city with hot weather most of the year and fairly humid.\n\n \n\n# AM ROUTINE\n\n**1. Cleanser**\n\n**Minimalist Salicylic Acid + LHA Cleanser (0.2%)**\n\nBeen using this for years at this point. I am so glad they are selling it in a larger size now. Gel-based, non-stripping cleanser with no fragrance. Keeps acne in check without drying out my cheeks. Works well even with daily use.\n\nVerdict: **Holy Grail. Will Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**2. Toner**\n\n**Minimalist Vitamin B12 + NMF Toner**\n\nSlightly thicker in consistency compared to your average toner with no fragrance. It is not watery or runny. It is a new launch, hence based on the couple of weeks I’ve used, it is very hydrating and calming. Makes my skin feel plump without any stickiness. Early days, but first impressions are excellent.\n\nVerdict: **Will Repurchase**\n\n \n\n**3. Serum**\n\n**Eucerin Anti-Pigment Dual Serum (with patented Thiamidol)**\n\nLets start by saying that this serum is EXPENSIVE. Its MRP is Rs. 3780 but I managed to buy it during a sale (still expensive). Did quite a bit of research before buying this. I was confused between the “La Roche-Posay Mela B3 Serum” and this one. I was looking for new age ingredients for pigmentation. Did a lot of comparison between the patented ingredients - Melasyl &amp; Thiamidol. I went ahead with Thiamidol because it has more clinical studies. It is a lightweight serum and has a very noticeable fragrance (which I don’t mind if it can do its job). Slow but noticeable improvement in pigmentation. Not drying despite having denatured alcohol, but I avoid using it on my eyelids. Too early to call HG but promising so far.\n\nVerdict: **Will Repurchase (tentatively)**\n\n \n\n**4. Moisturiser**\n\n**Minimalist B12 + Repair Complex 5.5% Moisturiser**\n\nFeels slightly thick initially but spreads and absorbs beautifully. It has no fragrance and is pink in colour, but I see no hue on my face once it gets absorbed. It is lightweight yet nourishing and soothes irritation.\n\nVerdict: **Holy Grail. Will Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**5. Sunscreen (one of the three depending on the day and my mood)**\n\n**Minimalist Light Fluid SPF 50 PA++++**\n\nIt is a lightweight, fluid sunscreen with no fragrance. My go-to sunscreen all year round and I have been using this for a long time now. Comfortable, no heaviness, and gentle enough for my eyelids, which are sensitive. Provides good sun protection and probably my favourite Indian sunscreen. I have never experienced pilling with this product.\n\nVerdict: **Holy Grail. Will Repurchase. Permanent place in my shelf.**\n\n \n\n**La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMUNE400 Anti-Dark Spot Fluid SPF50+ Sunscreen with Melasyl**\n\nIt has a Fluid with a smooth finish, but it can feel heavy. I enjoy using this in winter when the weather is more forgiving. However, it stings my eyelids (I guess due to denatured alcohol), so I avoid that area and stick to my Minimalist sunscreen for eyelids all the time. It is pricey but a very good product with excellent sun protection and no pilling.\n\nVerdict: **Will Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Spray SPF 50+**\n\nPurchased this from a pharmacy is France. Available in India from some websites. I use it mainly for body and exposed areas like hands and feet. Very similar to the UVMUNE 400 if function and feel. This is pricey and I purchased it only because I got a very good deal (5 euros).\n\nVerdict: **Repurchase possibility is less. Will Repurchase only if there is a good deal.**\n\n \n\n**6. Lip Balm**\n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask (Berry)**\n\nAbsolute game changer for my lips. Deeply nourishing and keeps them soft for hours. Nothing has worked as well as this lip balm. It’s more expensive than the typical lip balm but totally worth it. Has a pleasant fragrance which I personally enjoy.\n\nVerdict: **Holy Grail. Will Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n# PM ROUTINE\n\n**1a. Balm Cleanse**\n\n**Deconstruct Soothing Cleansing Balm**\n\nBalm texture that emulsifies well and has no fragrance. Been using this for ages. Removes sunscreen and makeup gently without drying out my skin. Does its job well while being gentle on the skin. It’s almost always on discount so it is a good deal as well.\n\nVerdict: **Will Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**1b. Cleanser**\n\n**Minimalist Salicylic Acid + LHA Cleanser**\n\n \n\n**2. Toner**\n\n**Minimalist Vitamin B12 + NMF Toner**\n\n \n\n**3. Serum**\n\n**Eucerin Anti-Pigment Dual Serum**\n\n \n\n**4. Eye Cream**\n\n**The Derma Co Snail Peptide 96 Under Eye Repair Cream**\n\nI’m not convinced it does much. Planning to stop and just moisturise my under-eye area instead. Too many steps tend to put me off consistency as well.\n\nVerdict: **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**5. Moisturiser &amp; Barrier Care**\n\n**Minimalist B12 + Repair Complex Moisturiser**\n\n(Same thoughts as AM)\n\n \n\n**La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+**\n\nHoly grail for sensitive areas, especially eyelids. A bit heavy for summer but amazing in winter as a sealant and calming balm. I wish I tried this sooner. The price was off putting but it is absolutely worth it. Initially got this at a great discount but I don’t mind paying the pricing mentioned in Nykaa.\n\nVerdict: **Holy Grail. Will Repurchase. Permanent place in my shelf.**\n\n \n\n**6. Lip Balm**\n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask**  \n(Same thoughts as AM)\n\n \n\n# OTHER / OCCASIONAL PRODUCTS\n\n**Exfoliant (Monthly)**\n\n**Minimalist Glycolic Acid 8% Exfoliating Liquid**\n\nUsed once or twice a month, depending on how my skin feels. Gentle yet effective. Doesn’t feel harsh and works well even for skin that leans dry. Also, more economical than The Ordinary one. Definitely something I’ll keep repurchasing because it does improve skin texture while note being too stingy or harsh.\n\nVerdict: **Will Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**Clay Mask (Weekly)**\n\n**Foxtale Skin Radiance Mask**\n\nUsed weekly or as needed. A standard clay mask. Does what most clay masks do like helping with congestion and pore cleansing, but nothing standout. If you find a cheaper alternative, you’re not missing out by switching. Decent enough, but I’m open to trying other options.\n\nVerdict: **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**Powder Cleanser (Occasional)**\n\n**TIRTIR Hydro Boost Enzyme Powder Wash**\n\nOccasional use. Cleanses very well and leaves the skin feeling extremely smooth. A little goes a long way, so it lasts forever. That said, it’s pricier than regular cleansers, and I’m too comfortable with my existing ones to justify repurchasing. Nice, but not essential. But a unique product.\n\nVerdict: **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**Moisturiser (Backup HG)**\n\n**Minimalist Ceramides 0.3% + Madecassoside Moisturiser**\n\nI’ve been using this since 2022; I’m not using it daily at the moment only because I’m enjoying other moisturisers and don’t want my routine to feel too heavy. Gone through countless tubes of this product. Whenever I want that glazed donut, deeply moisturised feel, I reach for this. It will always have a place in my routine.\n\nVerdict: **Holy Grail. Will Repurchase. Permanent place in my shelf.**",

I’m getting back into it now but I’m afraid it’s going to totally fry my hair. (During my break, after a lifetime of not knowing, I finally figured out how to do my hair.) The heat/exercise makes my roots greasy and makes the rest have a weird texture (borderline crunchy). Also, this forces me to brush my hair after taking it out of a bun, which messes up the curl pattern. I have tried using a spray bottle with water afterwards so I can do a mini reset, but that makes my hair \\*really\\* frizzy. I’ve tried looking for things I can put over my hair/head while sweating but nothing is really jumping out to me. I love my silk cap for sleeping and there doesn’t seem to be an equivalent for working out.\n\nRoutine: I wash once a week and air dry. (I might bump this to every 3 or 4 days because I’m working out again.) I use\n\nOribe color safe shampoo \n\nSachajuan color protect conditioner\n\nK18 leave-in hair mask\n\nOlaplex no. 10 curl shaper gel\n\nI also bought Olaplex no. 9 (nourishing hair serum) and no. 7 (bonding oil) but I wasn’t too impressed with either.

      "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore anyone jumps in with “confidence is attractive” or “personality matters,” let me stop you right there. Yes, people like me. I make friends easily. I’m respected at work. People enjoy talking to me, hanging out with me, opening up to me. I’m treated well as a human being. But love? Desire? Romantic interest? That’s where the story changes. Being a man is never easy.\n\nBecause I don’t fit the Indian beauty standard for men.\n\nI don’t have that “clean,” “bright,” “presentable” look our society is obsessed with. No matter how well I dress or groom myself, how articulate I am, my skin tone quietly disqualifies me before my personality even gets a chance. It’s always subtle, never openly cruel but it’s there. You can feel it in the hesitation, the polite rejection, the “you are such a nice guy” energy.\n\nDating apps make this even worse. Swipe culture reduces you to a photo, and Indian swipe culture reduces you further to skin tone. You can literally feel that people appreciate you but don’t want you. They will talk, laugh and they will say that you are amazing, then choose someone lighter without a second thought.\n\nWhat hurts the most is that I actually like who I am. I have worked on myself. I’m confident without being arrogant. I’m emotionally aware. I’m stable. I know I’d be a good partner. I don’t hate myself. I just hate that society keeps telling me indirectly, that I’m lovable but not desirable.\n\nAnd no, this isn’t about wanting validation from everyone. I just wish someone would love me for who I am, without subconsciously wishing I looked different. I wish attraction wasn’t so tightly tied to colonial hangovers and fairness ads disguised as “preferences.”\n\nI’m tired of pretending this doesn’t affect me. It does. You can be strong and still feel unwanted. You can be confident and still wish, quietly, that someone chose you without compromise.\n\nI don’t want to be everyone’s favorite friend. I want to be someone’s first choice.\n\nThat’s it. That’s the rant. Thank you for reading. I wish I had someone in my life but it seems like a far fetched dream. I wish someone talks to me or love me at least",

I turned 20 a month ago and ever since I've started oral fin.\n\nI'm now 20, and already on oral min+fin which if you ask me, is an overkill. I'm aware that stopping oral min abruptly will cause me to lose most my progress? But what about the overlap with fin? I would also rather just be on fin but I'm not sure if that's enough, I clearly responded well to min but who knows with fin.\n\nIs my safest bet is to stay on fin+min for maybe another year, then taper off min while using topical? Or I'll introduce topical a couple of months before I started tapering off min?",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",
