      "title": "Don't give up!!!! My 2 year progress in pictures.",
      "content": "In case you are thinking of giving up (because I was SO close to that at many points over the past 2 years) please don't! \n\nI grew up in the 90s before anyone knew how to properly care of curly hair, and I'm also Korean so I resented the fact that my hair was not slick, shiny, and straight like the other Korean girls I knew.  My mom used to scrunch my hair with mousse and air dry and send me to school with big, frizzy, triangle hair.  I hated it.  So in high school I started flat ironing my hair straight and also had various relaxing treatments done over the years. My hair was always in a state of incredible heat damage and I didn't even realize how bad it was. \n\nAny attempts in my pre-curly era to wear my hair naturally ended in huge fails because of the heat damage, lack of a good curly cut, and lack of proper know-how for product applications and styling techniques. I had lost hope I'd ever be able to figure it out. \n\n2 years ago something snapped and I decided to finally REALLY go for it.  I stopped flat ironing my hair completely. Cold turkey. At first it was bad. Really bad. As my new growth came in I had 2 vastly different textures and it looked awful. I had no clue how to apply products correctly for my hair texture. Every single wash day was a new trial and error. But I stuck it out. \n\nThis past January I got a good curly haircut and removed ALL of the heat damaged length.  They cut off about 10 inches. After that the remaining hair became SO curly. I was shocked. What I thought was more of a crimpy curl pattern had turned into actual tight ringlet curls.\n\nMy dream is to have long hair again but this time with curls. Now for the first time in my life I feel confident that I can actually get there and am so happy I stuck it out to this point and excited for the future. It's not perfect and I'm still learning more all the time but looking back I'm happy I didn't give up early on when it was so tempting to do so. I usually don't post anything online but I so badly wanted all the curlies out there who are thinking of giving up to know that you are not alone, and it will be SO worth it in the end. \n\npic 1 - Aug 2023 - the day I decided to go for it!\n\npic 2 - Mar 2024 - new growth with more curly texture\n\npic 3&amp;4 - Nov 2024 - new growth continues\n\npic 5 - Jan 2025 - after big curly cut\n\npic 6 - Jul 2025 - growing out, curls galore!\n\npic 7 - Sep 2025 - most recent progress\n\n\n\nCurrent products I use:\n\nCurlsmith Essential Moisture Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, Curl Reset Detox Shampoo, Double Cream Deep Quencher, Weightless Air Dry Cream, Hold Me Softly Style Balm, Curl Defining Souffle, Bonding Oil.\\* \n\n\\*I really think that the styling technique matters MUCH more than the specific product used, and while I like Curlsmith I'm sure I would get similar results with many other product brands and types.  \n\nRoutine:\n\nI alternate using the moisture shampoo and detox shampoo each wash, which is typically about every 5 days.  Out of the shower while soaking wet I put in a little air dry cream and then the style balm I brush in sections so that product is evenly distributed.  Then in small sections I apply the curl souffle with a bounce curl brush.  I plop for a few minutes then diffuse until I get tired or run out of time (usually 15 minutes) and let it air dry the rest.  Once completely dry and crunchy I scrunch out the crunch with the bonding oil. ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Immediately after leaving the salon, I was disappointed, but hopeful that after the first wash (48 hours after) that it would look better. It’s now Thursday, and this is the state of my hair. This is after the “curly method” I used the correct shampoo, leave in conditioner, curl cream and defused with a finger defuser making sure to cold flash it. It looks ‘okay’ as it dries, but quickly turns into this monstrosity. I’m so unhappy with the results especially because the stylist cut off 4 inches off my hair when she said she was just going to “trim” the dead ends.. it’s at the most disgusting length and my hair takes FOREVER to grow..\n\nI have an appointment with her this upcoming Wednesday so she can see the state of my hair. She said she could put in more rollers but I don’t want her to try and fix it because I know it will cause more damage. What should I do when I go there? Could I ask for a refund? Another service? I’m in such uncharted territory… PLEASE HELP!",

      "content": "Teenage Skin, UK based!! Hate having photos of my face online, but i need this kind of help. Looking to start a routine because I fainted the other day and couldn't think about anything but how awful my skin makes me look. I want to fix it to gain some confidence!!\n\nSkin Type: Varies dramatically. Usually dry on every part of my face except my nose. My nose can be extremely oily and breaking out, or extremely dry and peeling. My lips atm are so dry they are frequently peeling off, and my nose is pily and breaking out. Rest of the skin is leaning towards dry, maybe. Not too sensitive, but if I put too much acidic stuff on my face it can cause irritation for a few days.\n\nSkin Texture: The only way I can describe is is doughy and saggy. I have lines and wrinkles, and my skin doesn't really feel tight enough? (If that makes sense. And weirdly enough, the rest of the fat on my body also feels similar? Almost liquid like under my skin). Its harder to see in the photos, but glaringly obvious irl. My skin always feels bumpy and uneven, even though I don't have acne.\n\nRoutine right now: I wash my face. With water :( I don't own skincare products, quite a few, but I don't know how long they take to work or if they'll even benefit me.\n\nFluid Intake and Diet: My daily fluid intake is maybe 500ml on average (awful ik, I promise I'm working on it but I don't feel physically thirsty so its hard). My diet... mostly miso based broth and rice noodles? I also eat a lot of tomatoes and other fresh fruit and veggies. Occasionally I eat bread and have a sweet treat, but I don't allow it often. I fast, also.\n\nSuncream: I don't go outside often. I try my best to apply it, but I often forget when I do. I have already bought a good suncream I will use that blocks all the UV ray types, so i don't need recs on this for now :&gt;\n\nLooking for: a way to make my skin feel tighter. I hate how saggy my face feels to me, and would like to try and make it more firm and bouncy like other people's. Thats my main goal for now, because I know I might not be able to get rid of the lines already on my face (which is fine I suppose, at least I dont have to suddenly cope with it when im like 40). I'd also like to fix the uneven texturing in my skin.\n\nPlease help me reddit :(( xx I will do anything to end up with skin like this. I'm not rich, but I will more than happily invest in pricy skincare products if needs be. Tysm for reading this far if anyone did :&gt; ",

My current products: Rx tretinon, hero cosmetics cleanser, toner, moisturizer; the ordinary salicylic acid 2%; cetaphil body moisturizer, hero glow stick (for around my eyes if they get dry), Burt’s bees lip balm, 10% sulfur acne paste. \n\nI’m open to any suggestions but am trying to shift to leaping bunny and similar certifications in the products. I will also be shifting from hero (I got the products for free in a large size and they are running out, though I do really like the moisturizer but am worried w the new owners on formula changes).\n\nI normally wash my face in the shower, apply tret and spot treatment if needed and moisturize when I feel a bit dry or I know it’s going to be dry. In the morning, I normally just scrub my face with a very clean towel (I’m somewhat afraid of sponges bc microbio and my research scares me lol), and maybe put on moisturizer.\n\nI live in a big city and walk, so that’s my main exercise and I’m normally not into more strenuous activities. I lean towards more cystic acne every now and then, general redness (butterfly rash) and visible pores with smaller non cystic breakouts. Make up is put on maybe once every 4 months?\n\nI know I should really wash wash my face twice a day with soap but it feels so harsh in the mornings. Any suggestions or things to move around/add/subtract? Thank you!!",

      "content": "\nI have type 2C fine curls. My curl routine: I use a sulfate and silicone free shampoo and conditioner. Then I section my hair into 3 parts and apply a curl cream in each section. When I go to my crown, I do a no part styling technique (taking horizontal sections at the crown and brushing backwards) and then I flip my hair over and scrunch in either a mousse or a gel. I use heat protectant, and then I diffuse. I like to keep my hair upside down or flipped side to side while diffusing.\n\nThis routine makes my curls look so much more defined and tighter and gives me more volume. However, I think that the diffusing technique is causing the back of my hair to get messed up and a bit knotted. I always have to fix it up after i’ve finished diffusing, and it’s a bit irritating.\n\nI’ve tried diffusing upright, but it just doesn’t look as good. It doesn’t look as defined and I get no volume that way.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips? ",

      "content": "your acne continues to return most likely because an unbalanced skin barrier.\n\nIf it isn’t your gut health or hormones, and something you’ve been dealing with your whole life, I would greatly consider getting into Korean skin care.\n\nFixing your skin barrier will fix your acne— something I dealt with my whole life since puberty, and I’m now 27 and finally for the first time, acne free.\n\nTo fix your skin barrier, you will need:\n\ni) oil cleanser (I recommend Beauty by Joseon Ginseng oil cleanser)\n\nii) water-based cleanser (Skin 1004 Centella foaming cleanser is a great one, or INISFREE BHA Volcanic foam cleanser for a BHA)\n\niii) milky toner - milky toners are like a toner plus serum all in one which makes for extra moisturization  (go with TirTir MilKy Toner)\n\niv) skin barrier moisturizer with ceramides and/or peptides (I recommend Cosrx Ceramide Skin Barrier Cream)\n\nkeep your routine simple, minimal, and keep strict to this.\n\nNow, two other things are critically important for clearing and keeping away acne that you’ve had your whole life: Tretin0in and Microneedling.\n\nlisten, I got my tretin0in off Facebook marketplace from a girl who goes down to Mexico and get the Mexican version and bring it back and sells it for 15 dollars a tube. I swear on everything if you can find that on marketplace, you’re winning. It’s the purple tube, not red. I use the 0.05 and the language on the tube itself should be in spanish.\n\nTrust nothing made within the US. Skincare from Korea and tretin0in from Mexico. That’s it that’s all. Trust NOTHING American.\n\n99% of the brands you see at any given store w skincare, that shelf space is owned by all the same parent companies and will do nothing for your skin. Avoid American entirely.\n\nWHILE MAINTAINING THE FOUR STEP REGIME ABOVE DAILY, I’m gonna explain how tretinoin and micro needling are essential to your new routine, and how to fit them in.\n\nTretin0in:\n\n(disclaimer- this only works when you maintain a healthy, BALANCED skin barrier. Dry skin means lack of oil; dehydrated skin means lack of water. The barrier cream I recommended above is going to help you rebalance all your levels of oil and water. Take it seriously.)\n\nwhen used 2-3x per week, and GRADUALLY built into your routine, using Tret on specific or targeted acne-persistent areas (not something you put over your entire face like you would skin barrier cream), Tret acts in the same way Accutane does, as an exfoliating vitamin A, just without all the scary side effects. Different from Accutane, Tret as a topical is safe for people who are pregnant, or people who are susceptible to depression. Accutane is NOT.   \nUsing this two times per week at first and then mayyyybe graduating to three if your skin can really handle it, will start to exfoliate old layers of skin, and allow for new layers to fill in. This is especially helpful for hyper pigmentation or deep, acne scars, as well as eradicating your pores of debris. There may be an acclamation period where your skin is purging all the gunk out and surfacing its blemishes. It’s important to keep with the routine as this will go away. if you want to use a high frequency wand to zap blemishes this is a safe and effective way of minimizing inflammation, pain, bacteria in the skin, and will help heal what’s surfacing/purging way quicker than if just left alone.\n\nit is criticallllllll to be mindful of your skin barrier and be using creams that are super moisturizing, so as to avoid dry or flaking skin when using Tret. dry and flaky skin is when you’re gonna break out because your barrier is not balanced. This is a stage you will learn your skin better. You can test and you will know for yourself if you need to lesson the thret, or up the barrier cream. Don’t be frugal with the barrier cream, and don’t be too genrous with Tret. And NEVER use tret without following it with barrier cream.\n\nthe layering you want is:\n\ni) milky toner\n\nii) tretinoin \n\niii) skin barrier cream \n\n  \nFor extra, added Moisturization or to lessen the efficacy of the tret, esp when you’re first working it into routine, maybe you’d want to consider layering this way instead: \n\ni) milky toner\n\nii) skin barrier cream\n\niii) tret \n\niv) skin barrier cream \n\nA good indication that your skin is balanced and hydrated, is that after application of your skin barrier cream, hours and hours and hours after, your skin still feels moist to touch and hydrated. when you wake up in the morning, it should still be super hydrated. You shouldn’t have any dryness.  \n\n\nTret use is going to be that safe, nonabrasive exfoliation that you need in order to get new layers of skin, but it does not have the same effect unless you also also pair with and integrate an excruciatingly important element which brings me to my second—\n\nMicroneedle:\n\nthe process of creating micro-channels and punctures in the top layer of skin to essentially trick the skin into healing a wound that isn’t there.\n\nThis is not something you want to do without great research and watching aestheticians perform on themselves first.\n\nalways use gloves, be extremely cautious of transferring bacteria from surface to your skin, numb with a numbing cream that contains lidocaine, go through your face washing routine by double cleansing after numb, and only use the needle count and depth that’s right for the area. 0.25 depth is good for boney areas, fattier areas of the face can see 1.0 depth.\n\nif you cause yourself bleed, you are going way too deep. however, if you are merely and only getting red on the areas you’re going over, that means it’s working. Redness, good. Blood, not good. No redness at all, you’re not going deep enough.\n\nif your greatest concern is deep scarring, like me, use Dr. Pen collagen ampoule while microneedling, remembering to keep a moist surface wherever you are working and to not needle over dry skin. This ampoule is a great barrier liquid, AND serum to be working into the skin.\n\nSome aestheticians or dermatologist will just use sink water as a liquid, but this is insane and such an uncontrolled substance as it carries crazy amounts of bacteria. I don’t know why they would ever do that. blows my absolute mind, at a molecular level. please use the Dr. Pen collagen ampoule, please do not act mentally scientifically stunted.\n\nThe most excruciatingly important thing to remember is to NEVVERRRRRRRRRRRR needle over a COMEDOME, whether closed or open, because this is absolutely transferring bacteria from those inflamed zits and placing them in non-inflamed or affected areas of the face, which is absolutely counterintuitive and counterproductive.\n\nDo the Trent for a while, clear the current acne, THEN microneedle.\n\ndo you want your skin to be pretty clear before attempting a microneedle.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be perfect, and you can avoid going over the comedomes, but definitely don’t microneedle an inflamed for the most part face.\n\nWhen you are finished with your micro needle treatment, do not put anything else on your face. That is not the ampule for 24 hours. After that, you’re free to wash your face and use toners, serums, moisturizers. Wait 48 hours before sun exposure, and the use of sunscreen. Use only noncomedogenic sunscreens, and apply any time before the sun for the next at least week. Super important, as your skin is sensitive and in a regenerative process this week.\n\nTrust me.\n\nTret is going to keep your skin exfoliating old layers, and new layers surfacing, while microneedling is going to trick your skin into a healing, regeneration process.\n\nyour acne will clear, your barrier will rebalance, your skin will renew, your hyperpigmentation and deep scars will fade into smooth, toned skin.\n\nif you have any questions, comment and I will drop my IG handle. I went to school for this, so I could clear my own acne. Finally I have cracked the code to skin, how it acts, how to respond to any signs it shows, and now have clear skin for the first time ever, at 27 yo. This is the truth, and they all work together in harmony. Each step I mentioned serves a great, critical purpose. Please reach out with any questions, and stay away from mechanical exfoliation (scrubs, sugars, harsher abrasive washes as this messes your skin barrier up and undoes a bunch of progress of strengthening and renewing it we just made)",

At night I do a gentle cleanser, the toner, the same mandelic, hydroremedy, and also a 2.5% acne med benzoyl peroxide and no moisturizer. I’m taking the FR clear skin restore supplement as well. AND ICE my skin day and night like ughhh. I’m frustrated because my skin wasn’t even half this bad when I started and now I’m starting to see a bunch of cystic pimples, and I just feel so clogged. I’m also getting bad scarring that wasn’t there before:( i’m so close to just starting Accutane. I know my acne is hormonal but I think it also might be something else. She has such great results, and I’ve heard so many good things about face reality and people getting results like ASAP. I don’t understand what’s going wrong and what the problem is. If anyone has used the face reality products or has been through something similar and has some advice or maybe hopeful words I would really appreciate it!",
