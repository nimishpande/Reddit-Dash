      "content": "Hey reddit! Looking for some advice on this crazy curl pattern change. Over the last two years, my curl pattern has gone from the beautiful texture you see on the first slide to the flat, sad pattern in the second, and I’m so lost trying to figure out why. I didn’t change my routine until after the change had occurred, stayed with the same amazing curly hair stylist for years, and didn’t change locations (i.e. water stayed the same). \n\nHere’s the routine I was using 2-3x per week:\n- Oribe hair alchemy shampoo (2 washes) + conditioner\n- Oribe leave-in conditioner\n- Oribe curl gloss\n- Oribe curl mousse\n- Scrunched dry with a microfiber towel, then diffused on low heat. Finished with kerastase oil and oribe anti-humidity spray. \n\nAfter I really started to get frustrated with the change, I tried:\n- Two different heat protectants for over a year, thinking maybe heat damage was the culprit\n- AG Care Renew Clarifying shampoo once per week, thinking buildup may be contributing\n- Innersense True Enlightenment scalp scrub once per month \nThese changes did not make a difference :(\n\nI have consistently used a silk pillowcase and silk bonnet to sleep, both before and after the change. \n\nI fear that, after doing some research, the culprit may be hormonal changes associated with a change in my birth control, or maybe this is just aging-associated change that I can’t control. But, before I jump to talking with my doctor about making major medical changes, does anyone have any other ideas I can try? \n\nTIA for your help and for reading, I miss my curls and really appreciate your help getting them back!!",

I have a wide tooth comb I use, and a regular comb I will use to fix my part in the middle.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

There used to be a lot of pus and even bleeding, which made me extremely self-conscious. Because of that, I avoided posting pictures or talking about it online.\n\nNow the active acne is mostly gone, but I’m left with a lot of acne scars, bumps, and uneven skin tone. Honestly, I feel stuck and don’t see a clear solution anymore.\n\nI joined Reddit specifically to ask for skincare advice from people who have experience or knowledge in this area. I genuinely want to improve my skin and understand what options I have.\n\nI’m 21 years old, and it feels like time is slipping by. I’d really appreciate any honest advice, guidance, or personal experiences that could help me move forward.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to help.",

      "content": "One of my 2026 resolutions is to finally be consistent with skincare. I have always had great, clear skin—but things started to change in my late 20s (I’m 31F). Winter flaky-dryness became more persistent, and I was suddenly dealing with a lot of redness no matter the time of year—my skin just looks blotchy all the time (my nose is the worst offender). I’m also noticing more texture all around. \n\nAfter some experimentation, I have landed on Dieux’s Instant Angel moisturizer and Deliverance serum. I have used them for 3 weeks and my skin loves them! Dryness has somewhat improved.\n\nI picked up Naturium’s Retinol Complex Serum and their BHA Exfoliant (2%), with the hope these will tackle the tone and texture issues. I know to only use them 1x a week and not on the same night…but is it a good idea to use them at all with my redness-prone skin and compromised skin barrier? Should I focus on barrier repair with the Dieux products before diving in?\n\nAny tips on how to use and any product recommendations are very welcome! Would also love to hear if anyone has had good or bad experiences with the Naturium products mentioned.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "The first picture is from 2023, the second and third are from a week ago.\n\nFrom ~2022–2024 my skin was at its best. During that time I did very little skincare: mostly rinsed with water, occasionally used Vanicream cleanser, and rarely used moisturizer. My skin was calm, pretty even-toned, and acne was minimal (except some acne marks). Then in the summer of 2024 I started getting acne again, this was right before a vacation so I decided (impulsive decision from watching a youtube video) to buy and use adapalene and benzoyl peroxide without any buildup and start using it almost daily. As you can imagine this triggered a very bad breakout and made my skin barrier very damaged. After the breakout I stopped using any skincare for whatever reason for a good few months. Forward to 2025 I started using tretinoin (my skin barrier still wasnt fully repaired) but my skin couldn't handle this even with slow buildup and enough hydration/moisture, I saw no improvement and my skin kept staying red, irritated and the texture was bad.\nBecause of this my skin gradually became more reactive. Now even lukewarm water or gentle cleansing can cause dryness and stinging, especially after showers.\n\nCurrent symptoms I have are:\nTightness after washing or water exposure\nStinging when applying even gentle products\nDiffuse redness on cheeks and around nose\nMild inflammatory acne (not cystic)\nSlight “orange peel” texture consistent with dehydration\nSkin feels fragile/reactive rather than oily-comedogenic\n\nThis is my current routine I have been using for 2 weeks, I have found some posts on reddit that said if you have oily dehydrated skin you should use a hydrator and moisturizer + gentle cleanser for your skin so this is what I'm using right now:\nCleanser Round lab dokbo 1025 cleanser only in the evenings\nMost mornings: lukewarm water\nHydration / Moisturizers:\niUNIK Beta-Glucan Serum (daily, AM &amp; PM)\nPurito Oat-In Gel Cream (main moisturizer, AM &amp; PM)\nAvène Cicalfate+ (2–3× per week or as needed, targeted to irritated areas)\n\nWhat I’m NOT using right now:\nNo exfoliants (AHA/BHA/PHA)\nNo retinoids\nNo actives\nNo scrubs or masks\n\n\nSo my question is,\nDoes this sound like barrier damage from overdoing skincare?\nIs continuing a very minimal, gentle routine the right approach to calm sensitivity and eventually return to a low-maintenance routine like what worked for me before?\nAny feedback or suggestions (especially cleanser frequency or whether to temporarily stop cleansing entirely) would be appreciated.\nAlso, any products you recommend and should I add or remove anything?",

Ive had them since I was 11/12, and im 23F this year(2026). I live in a tropical area but with clean water and have done most things to ensure I dont have them anymore. Theyre mostly not whiteheads nor blackheads. But theyre very numerous clogged pores whereby if I squeeze them, lots of gunk comes out almost in a spiral BUT theyre not pimples unless I squeeze them out wrong and they get inflammed. The issue is that there r so many that I cant squeeze all of them, and some are on parts of my cheeks that I cant see or squeeze without either scarring myself or causing it to become a pimple. Im on differin gel, and that has purged and helped my skin a bit, but i still have a lot of these closed comedones and Im not sure what I can do about them. Im hoping for advice on what products to use etc. Ive gone for facials before where theyve removed the gunk once a month, but i cant afford $700 facials every 3 months. Currently I have a cleanser, salicylic acid toner pads from cosrx, SkinLab serum, and moisturiser. I won’t be continuing the serum soon because it’s not affordable for me. But I really want to get rid of these bumps. It really really bothers me every day.\n\nTLDR: numerous closed comedones/clogged pores. I dont know how to get rid of them and I need suggestions or help. Ive used differin but it only helps to a certain extent. ",

I try to eat healthy and while I would say I do somewhat okay with my lifestyle (don’t go outside unless I have to and wear suncream when I do, no drink/drugs/vaping/smoking, only drink water or occasionally milk, have pasta or baked potato for dinner most nights, avoid most junk foods aside from biscuits/chocolate and limit sugar to 25g a day at the very most) but I’m not perfect, it’s not ultra healthy but I’m trying to ween myself onto better foods after only eating ultra-processed slop my entire life and that colouring my palate. However up until this year or so when I got a job and gained some choice over what I ate I largely was only able to eat terrible processed food like chicken nuggets and waffles as well as lots of chocolate so I’m very concerned over the damage that has already been done. I’ve never been overweight, always on the small side of average or underweight and always ate small portions for my age but it still greatly concerns me.\n\nI moisturise once a day using Cerave’s moisturiser, take a Vitamin D tablet daily and use a gua sha for about ten minutes but I want to prevent anti-aging early. I have heard that collagen may not have any effect at my age but I still think if it can work it’ll be worth it to try as a preventative matter, I want to look young for as long as possible. Over the Christmas and New Year period I’ve gone over my 25g sugar limit most days just from having family force chocolates or sweets onto me and it’s genuinely making me panic. What brands would you recommend? I don’t care about the price, I just want it to be effective. I am from the UK if that helps. Thank you.\n",

The third photo is dried and unstyled, but not yet brushed.\n\nI (f24) have very curly hair. For the whole of my whole childhood, I assumed it was just frizzy and damaged. For the majority of my adult life, I've either straightened it or tied it back to ignore the frizz, but this coming year, I really want to embrace my curly hair.\n\nThe few times I have tried curly hair routines, I've struggled with the texture of mousse and gel on my hair, as I absolutely detest it! One of the main reasons I enjoyed straightening my hair was the soft feeling it gave my hair, so please keep this in mind when recommending products &lt;3\n\nI currently use Being Bye Bye Frizz Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner, as well as Herbal Essences Bio Renew Smoothening Leave-In Cream. For the in-between steps, I am absolutely clueless!\n\nI know you're not meant to dry brush, but does this mean I should wet my hair daily to be able to brush it and detangle it? Working in a bit of a labour-intensive job, my hair is going between tied up in a crappy bun and tied back at the base of my neck several times a day to keep it out of my face.\n\nAny tips and tricks would be appreciated, if products could be from Woolworths/Coles/other Australian stores that sell beauty/pharmacy products and not break the bank, that would be amazing as well.\n\nThank you all so much! Let me know if I need to clarify anything I've said.",

I have only been using a gentle cleanser and moisturizer for two months now. My derm had initially diagnosed me with cystic acne and Rosacea. I had first been prescribed in March 2025 clind+benzoyl peroxide cream for a couple pimples around my face, but the bp burned my skin. Then many months later, I had tried ivermectin, which made my skin a lot worse after 8 weeks. I stopped and started the gentle routine, but it just kept getting worse. \n\nMy derm says it could also be hormonal. I also suspect I have perioral dermatitis, but the sheer amount of deep cystic pimples I have gotten in the past month is insane. I also have many CC's, and these white heads that are very liquidy, but sometimes pop on their own, and are also very deep. I'm starting topical clindamyacin in two days, hopefully that will help.\n\nI'm at a loss. I'm petrified Accutane won't work and that the redness and PIE won't go away. I feel so awful and don't know what to do anymore. I already cannot use so many products due to the rosacea, and avoid anything that isn't fungal acne safe. My skin seems oily but dehydrated. Is there a way to come back from this? Damaged barrier? \n\n",
