It might seem over the top, but I really wanted to do anything that could help,  hoping something would end up working. \n\nOn Sept 26th, he started topical minoxidil 5% (AM + PM), oral finasteride 1 mg, nutrafol men supplements, nordic natural omega-3 supplements\n\nEvery Sunday I use rosemary scalp pre-wash to give him a scalp massage then double cleanse / hair mask with ketoconazole 2% shampoo. I also use a red light therapy mask on his scalp every Friday and Sunday.\n\t\nOn Oct 3rd I booked a prp session and it was extremely painful for him. I know this sub isn’t too fond of this treatment but he’s willing to try 2 more sessions every 6 weeks to see how it goes.\n\nAround Oct 11th (first pic), he started shedding a ton at the crown and hairline. On Oct 14th(second pic) the shedding got worse so he decided to buzz his hair. The shedding stopped around Oct 29, and since then everything has stabilized…I think. \n\nYesterday , Nov 11th, he took the new pic and I feel like there’s crazy progress already !!! I hope I’m not delusional but I feel like there is more density. \n\nI’m planning to start dermarolling his scalp every Sunday starting January since I heard that helps a lot. \n\nWill keep updating if people want to follow along. I love reading everyone’s success stories and I’m excited for future results ! \n\n",

      "content": "First 2 pics are from 2021, last one is my current hair. I’m just wondering if anyone might have some advice on what’s going on!\n\nBefore I started CGM in 2020, my hair was a frizzy, undefined, dry mess. I didn’t know I had textured hair at all; I thought it was just sad and damaged. I was using Dove Intensive Repair (I think?) up until I started experimenting with curly products and suddenly I had amazing ringlets and waves. \n\nIn 2020 I was using primarily Shea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine shampoo, conditioner, and curl enhancing smoothie. So lots of protein! I would also mix in some other haircare brands with gels, mousses, etc. and I would use a lot of cream. At that point my hair loved it and never got weighed down.\n\nFast forward to today, the slightest bit of protein ruins my hair, and my waves are continuously loosening. I stopped using anything with protein altogether. This last time I washed my hair I figured that I *must* need some protein, because things just aren’t making sense. I put in some AG Recoil after the shower (which has protein about halfway down the ingredient list), and my hair is so sad and sticky and limp. Otherwise, my hair still feels and looks much better when I use my regular moisturizing products (which are no longer strictly CGM). However, I’m still concerned about my texture.\n\nCould this be a hormone thing, or my hair just changing over time? Could it be length? \n\nAnother thing I’m curious about is the fact that I learned how to treat my hair wavy/curly (scrunching, less brushing, using products, diffusing, etc.) at the same time I stopped using sulphates and silicones. I almost wonder if those weren’t necessarily making my hair dry and pouffy, but just the fact that I didn’t know how to style it. Before learning anything to do with CGM, I used to vigorously rub my hair with the towel out of the shower (with zero product). I know, it’s so bad!\n\nSo in general, I’m confused about the changes in my hair and its behaviour. I would say it’s high porosity, and I have fine, medium, and coarse strands all over my head. Most of it is medium though. I’m thinking perhaps I need to let go of how my hair used to behave, and that maybe I need way less products now? It’s hard to change my mindset after years of heavy products doing amazing things on my hair, and now it’s getting flatter and flatter even when I use light products.\n\nRoutine\n\nShampoo: Garnier Honey Water shampoo (this is brand new for me and has sulphates which have been working better so far)\n\nConditioner: Garnier Honey Water conditioner (this is CG friendly, and I love it!)\n\nAfter shower: Garnier Honey Water cream and Innersense I Create Hold gel. Sometimes I’ll use Carina Organics Sweet Pea leave in and John Frieda Dream Curls gel.",

      "content": "Dry skin is a common concern that affects millions of people, especially during colder months or in low-humidity environments. If you struggle with tightness, flakiness, or dullness, you’re not alone. This guide covers everything you need to know about caring for dry skin, from expert routines to ingredient insights and product recommendations.\n\n# Why Dry Skin Happens\n\nDry skin occurs when the skin’s natural barrier is compromised, leading to moisture loss. Common causes include:\n\n* Harsh weather (cold, wind, low humidity)\n* Over-cleansing or using harsh products\n* Aging and hormonal changes\n* Dehydration and poor diet\n* Medical conditions like eczema or psoriasis\n\n# The Best Skincare Routine for Dry Skin\n\nA consistent routine is key to restoring hydration and strengthening your skin’s barrier. Here’s a step-by-step guide:\n\n# Morning Routine\n\n* **Gentle Cleanser:** Use a fragrance-free, hydrating cleanser to remove impurities without stripping moisture.\n* **Toner:** Opt for an alcohol-free toner with soothing ingredients like aloe vera or chamomile.\n* **Serum:** Apply a hyaluronic acid serum to attract and lock in moisture.\n* **Moisturizer:** Choose a rich, emollient moisturizer with ceramides, shea butter, or squalane.\n* **Sunscreen:** Finish with a broad-spectrum SPF 30+ to protect against UV damage.\n\n# Night Routine\n\n* **Double Cleanse:** Start with an oil-based cleanser, followed by a gentle foaming cleanser.\n* **Exfoliate (1-2 times a week):** Use a mild chemical exfoliant (like lactic acid) to remove dead skin cells.\n* **Treatment Serum:** Apply a nourishing serum with peptides or niacinamide.\n* **Night Cream:** Use a heavier cream or sleeping mask for overnight repair.\n\n# Key Ingredients for Dry Skin\n\n* **Hyaluronic Acid:** Attracts and retains moisture for plump, hydrated skin.\n* **Ceramides:** Restore the skin’s natural barrier and prevent moisture loss.\n* **Shea Butter:** Deeply nourishes and soothes dry, irritated skin.\n* **Squalane:** Mimics the skin’s natural oils for long-lasting hydration.\n* **Aloe Vera:** Calms inflammation and redness.\n* **Niacinamide:** Strengthens the skin barrier and improves texture.\n\n# Top Product Recommendations\n\n* Cerave\n* Nurabare Skincare\n* Minimalist\n\n# Expert Tips for Managing Dry Skin\n\n* Avoid hot showers and harsh soaps.\n* Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air.\n* Drink plenty of water and maintain a balanced diet.\n* Patch test new products before full application.\n* Consult a dermatologist for persistent dryness or irritation.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n**Q: What is the best moisturizer for dry skin?**  \nA: Look for products with ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and shea butter. CeraVe Moisturizing Cream and First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream are highly recommended.\n\n**Q: How often should I exfoliate dry skin?**  \nA: Limit exfoliation to 1-2 times a week with a gentle chemical exfoliant like lactic acid to avoid irritation.\n\n**Q: Can diet affect dry skin?**  \nA: Yes, staying hydrated and eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids (like salmon and walnuts) can improve skin hydration.\n\n**Q: Is sunscreen necessary for dry skin?**  \nA: Absolutely. Sunscreen protects your skin from UV damage, which can worsen dryness and lead to premature aging.\n\n**Q: What should I avoid if I have dry skin?**  \nA: Avoid hot water, harsh soaps, alcohol-based products, and over-exfoliating, as these can strip your skin’s natural oils.\n\n# Why Trust This Guide?\n\nThis article is written by skincare experts with years of experience in dermatology and beauty.

I usually tuck it into a fire proof welding jacket with with a tall neck like a turtle neck. I also wear a wrap around face shield and fitted cap over the top of my head. \n\nSome hot metal must’ve somehow found its way In between my head and the helmet. I eventually felt heat and noticed the smoke continued in my peripheral vision with the torch off. I pulled my helmet off and ran my hand through my hair and pulled clumps of what looked like ash out. The SMELL WAS HORRIBLE \n\nthis is where I need help! It seems like this smell is haunting me. I usually use a pretty strong smelling L’Oréal shampoo and conditioner, but it seems like every time I get in the shower or lie down or randomly throughout the day I am getting a whiff, sometimes makes me want to gag. Has anyone dealt with this? Does anyone have product recommendations for getting rid of that burnt smell? \n\nAlso any product recommendations in general for a repair/maintenance for someone who is trying to keep longer hair but is extremely hard on it at work? \n\nThanks ",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "title": "[Routine Help] Cleansing combo oily/dry skin",
      "content": "Hi,\n\n***TLDR***: I have combination skin with extremely oily, always have closed-comedones skin on my forehead and temples/maybe nose, and dry skin on the rest of face. I'm not sure how to properly cleanse both regions at once. Very gentle cleansers make my forehead worse, but cleansers with more cleaning power make my cheeks feel squeaky even just running down my cheeks when rinsing. I can isolate 2 different moisturizers to my forehead and cheeks separately,, but using 2 cleansers seems difficult. Currently, I am using SANA Nameraka Soy Foaming Cleanser, a high pH, squeaky-clean Japanese style cleanser. This cleanser is the best I've tried for reducing my forehead bumps, but it also dries out my cheeks. Also, I live in a low humidity area.\n\nLet me know any recommendations, either products or techniques, for keeping both parts of my face happy. Thanks!\n\n***Additional info:***\n\n**Forehead**: Gets oily fast, except sometimes stays matte the whole day (can't figure out the common denominator here). Permanently have closed comedones or fungal acne (waiting for black light in mail to figure out if FA.). Never have whiteheads except few ones rarely, near period.\n\n**Dry cheeks:** I'm not sure if the dry skin region is truly dry skin as I still get clogged pores and whiteheads there if I consistently layer on hydrating products. Skin has patches that are rough to the touch (kind of sandy/sandpaper, generally dry texture) unless I use a very gentle cleanser. Also has a few closed comedones or FA, but smaller and fewer than on forehead.\n\n**Nose:** Oily like forehead, but gets noticeably more wrinkles if I use the same products I use on my forehead. Tolerates the products I use for my cheeks without getting closed comedones, except rarely.\n\n**Lifestyle:** Eat very clean. Very little dairy; only eat lactose free dairy. No difference between month when I ate zero dairy and when I do eat dairy. I think I drink enough water too, and also haven't noticed differences between weeks when I drank more water vs less. Also see no increase in acne during holiday weeks when I eat desserts from relatives all day basically. Only my menstrual cycle seems to change my skin.\n\n**Other products on face**: I do not wear makeup so my bumps are not from insufficiently washing off makeup. I also don't wear sunscreen because it increases the bumps big time (will figure that out once I establish a basic routine). I rarely see the sun, even through windows, anyway so my dry skin patches are not from sunburn.\n\nMy current products are: several layers Naturie Hatomugie toner all over face, IUNIK centella gel on forehead only, Cerave tub on cheeks and nose only. The Cerave makes it so that the sandpaper-y (to touch only; looks no different from rest of my cheeks) areas feel simultaneously moist to the touch.\n\n***What I have tried (cleansers):***\n\n**Cleansing, applying products 2x a day (current):** Currently trying twice a day again (for morning: cleanser only applied to forehead and try to avoid getting suds on cheeks). Seems like my forehead is getting worse so far. Will try for 1 month. Also tried before in summer where it also seemed to make things worse; I got scared and stopped.\n\n**Cleansing and also applying products only once a day at night (before):** ranged from super clear forehead even during period, to acne everywhere. Couldn't really figure out common denominators for fluctuations.\n\n**Aveeno positively radiant/Neutrogena oil free acne wash:** Used for 3 yrs (Neutrogena first) when I wasn't really into skincare. Getting into the habit of washing my face daily reduced my bigger whitehead acne. The closed comedones or FA bumps on my face remained as always since middle school. Used the Aveeno until I think this spring.\n\n**Cetaphil gentle cleanser:** wasn't sure if it even cleansed my skin. Left some kind of film. Tried 2 times: once for 2 weeks in summer this year, and once for 10 days in autumn, where I used it 2x daily. Seemed to make both forehead and cheeks bumpier both times. I will mention that Cerave cream on my forehead instantly makes me break out, and both the Cetaphil gentle and Cerave cream have Cetearyl Alcohol, so that may be the culprit. No stinging on cheeks even with plenty of scrubbing when in a rush.\n\n**Cerave hydrating cleanser:** tried a sample for 1 week when my skin was already breaking out. Didn't stop the breakout, didn't make it worse. Feels just like the Cetaphil, but just a little bit more cleansing power. No stinging on cheeks.\n\n**HaruHaru black rice soft cleansing gel:** super gentle and also cleanses well. No stinging. Seemed to make forehead worse after 1 week so got scared and stopped using. Will try again later after receiving black light (to see if the fermented ingredient in it is making my maybe-fungal acne worse). The skin on my cheeks never felt better than I was using this, but my forehead seemed to get bumpier.\n\n**LRP Effaclar Foaming Gel:** tried 2 trials, 7-10 days each trial. Stinging on the undereye/cheekbone area of cheeks. Make my cheekbones dry (texture when touched). Strong cleaning power. Didn't make forehead any clearer.\n\n**Benzoyl peroxide**: **Cerave foaming 4%:** Have been using from summer to now, 3x a week. Dermatologist told me to try it on my forehead; I leave it on for about 3 min (forehead only) as directed. Only seemed to reduce my forehead bumps when, and only when, I was also using the SANA, so I'm not quite sure if the benzoyl peroxide is the one doing the heavy lifting. When used when I was trying other cleansers, didn't really change much. (skipped it for about 3 weeks then reintroduced it). Note: benzoyl peroxide reduced my already-rare whitehead acne to virtually zero now, but didn't change my non-whitehead bumps.\n\n**Sana Nameraka Soy Foaming (current):** This gives me the clearest forehead (compared to the others, but still not actually clear), but is the most irritating for my cheeks. I stopped using it for about 2 months while trying different cleansers, and got an increase in forehead bumps. This cleanser instantly reduced my bumps after I reintroduced it again. Currently, I am trying: AM: use on forehead only. PM: whole face, but only 20s on my cheeks. The undereye/cheekbone area of my cheek is getting a gritty texture to the touch. Visually the skin there looks moist/slightly oily, and does also feel moist, but also gritty.\n\nMy speculations: the SANA foaming works better on my forehead than the LRP even though both have the same squeaky-clean cleansing power. I think the difference comes from the soy components or the lactobacillus in the soy ferment.\n\n**Oil cleansers:** Dermatologist told me not to try oil cleansers right now, so not looking to buy one.\n\n**Shampoo/conditioner:** Dermatologist also told me to use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. Currently using Cerave as per the derm's recommendation. Not sure if it makes a difference: Cerave haircare + SANA cleanser = less bumps, but when I used other cleansers, bumps increased. Not sure if SANA is doing the heavy lifting here.",

      "content": "Hey there! I have normally combination skin and have struggled with acne off and on, I decided to go on differin for my skin texture and for the acne clearing benefits. Currently, my skin isn't looking the best right now and it's making me concerned. I've only used the 0.1% Differin Gel about 4 times since October 27th. The last time I applied it was either November 7th or November 10th. It already looks bad and I don't know if I've seen any improvements yet.\n\nMy sebaceous filaments are literally insane rn and I got a bunch of CCs everywhere on my face. Some of the pimples on my face hurt a bit when I touch it, yet they aren't cystic as far as I'm aware. I used to never get painful acne unless they were cysts. I used 0.25% Tretinoin for a few months and it did the exact same thing to my face (bad texture) but I quit tret and went on differin instead (my tret was also expired). \n\nI would really appreciate some advice and just whether or not I should keep going, because if I'm purging why is my skin texture so bad?? I don't think my barrier is compromised so I'm just worried. I even buffer the differin with moisturizer too so I don't know what I'm doing wrong :(\n\nMy current routine is:\nVanicream facial cleanser\nDermalogica moisturizer (either the Active moist kind or the Skin smoothing kind)\nI use Purito Sun Day adventure Sunscreen anytime I leave the house.",

I would prefer a bang for my buck or if it’s expensive, for it to last longer. Has anyone tried these? What were your results, thoughts? I feel crazy on this journey of finding the right products for me. My hair definitely hated the shea moisture shampoo and conditioner they recommended for type 2 hair. My hair felt like shit. My hair also dislikes coconut. What is everyone’s holy grails? I’m not concerned about shampoo and conditioner but more of the styling products. Here’s a very short and quick version of my routine. \n\n1. I’ve been using the L’Oréal elvive hyaluron plump shampoo and conditioner. \n2. After I shower, on wet hair I apply Camille rose curl love in my hair and the curl maker. I get decent results, but they aren’t my favorite.\n3. Depending on the day I’ll air dry or defuse. ",
