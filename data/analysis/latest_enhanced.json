If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

My natural hair colour \n\nBackground / hair history:\n\n* My natural hair colour is a neutral-to-warm light brown.\n* In April 2025, I did a full permanent colour of a darker brown.\n* The ends of my hair are now lighter and coppery, probably from that dye job lifting colour and washing out.\n* Recently, I had very light blonde highlights done at a salon (this was a gift and now I can’t afford to maintain salon colouring - these prices are scary?!).\n\nCurrent situation:\n\n* The highlights are growing out and look very stark against my natural brown.\n* My hair now looks like multiple colours:\n   * Natural brown at the roots\n   * Very light blonde highlights\n   * Coppery/lightened ends\n* The highlighted sections are also drier and more porous.\n* I’ve realised blonde isn’t for me, and I want to blend everything back toward my natural brown and grow it out cleanly.\n\nWhat I wnat to achieve: \n\n* A blended, natural-looking light brown result\n* No harsh line between blonde and brown\n* Something that will fade gently as my natural hair grows\n* A professional, neat look as I’m starting a new job soon at a very proffessional office work setting \n\nConstraints:\n\n* I’m a student on a tight budget (around ±$25 in my currency) - meaning I can probably get 2-3 boxes/colour products\n* I can only colour at home\n* I live where brands like L’Oréal Paris, Garnier, Schwarzkopf, Clairol, John Frieda, L’Oréal Professionnel, Schwarzkopf Professional, Redken, Moroccanoil, Kérastase, and Wella are available but not always alll their product ranges. \n\nWhat I’ve heard (but I’m unsure):\n\n* That bleached hair needs warmth put back in first before going brown again\n* That skipping this step can cause green/grey tones\n* That using permanent dye over everything might cause the same coppery fading on my virgin hair later\n* That semi- or demi-permanent colour might be safer for blending\n\nMy worries:\n\n* I’m scared of going too warm and ending up orange/copper again\n* I don’t know:\n   * Whether I need a filler, gloss, shampoo, or dye\n   * What shades to choose (golden? neutral?)\n   * Whether to use permanent or semi-permanent colour\n\n**My main question**  \n**Given my situation, what is the simplest, lowest-risk at-home approach to:**\n\n1. **Neutralise and blend the blonde highlights**\n2. **Bring everything closer to my natural light brown**\n3. **Avoid over-darkening or strong copper tones**\n\nIf anyone can recommend specific product types or shade families, I would be incredibly grateful.\n\nThank you so much for reading xxx",

I do understand that other hormonal pigmentation is hard to reverse, but I at least want to try improving it.\n\n# Current routine:\n\n**AM:**\n\n* Face wash\n* Rose water toner\n* Saffron oil serum (Ranavat)\n* Moisturizer: Antioxidant (chebula) + hyaluronic acid (True Botanicals)\n* Sunscreen\n\n**PM:**\n\n* Face wash / rice exfoliant (2-3x a week)\n* Rose water toner\n* Saffron oil serum (Ranavat)\n* Moisturizer: Bakuchiol (retinol alternative from Ranavat)\n* Shani Darden Skin Care Intensive Eye Renewal Cream\n\nA dermatologist recently suggested **Eucerin Radiant Tone Serum (Thiamidol)** for hyperpigmentation, and I’m considering adding it at night.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n* What do you think my routine is missing for hyperpigmentation?\n* Should I incorporate **vitamin C**? If yes, how?\n* Do I need any **AHA exfoliation** like a lactic acid cleanser?\n* What else am I missing?\n\nWould really appreciate any insights, especially from people who focus on gentle routines. Thanks! 😊",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

It is also sensitive, I have a lot of redness and really big pores everywhere, not just the T zone.\n\nI have tried La Roche Posay, Cera Ve, The Ordinary, Mixa and none of those helped. I tried niacinamide serums and pore minimizing serums and they didn't work. My routine is mostly just a cleansing gel and moisturizing cream in the morning and evening, when I was trying out serums, I layered them correctly. I wear makeup every day and not even primers work (mattifying or pore minimizing). I do not have acne but I get small white zits or some zits appear under skin (mostly cheeks and around the nose) almost every day. I have some blackheads but I don't have a lot and I can exctract them, they arent a problem. Please also note that I change my face towel regularly, always just dab my face, change my pillowcase regularly and so on. I really try with everything. I do my routine regularly, I am aware that consistency is key, but nothing has helped me so far. I hate it because I hate the feeling of oilyness on my face and it also affects my hair, it gets oily even faster bc of my face. I also cannot walk around with no foundation because I am insecure about the pores and redness, but also if I don't wear foundation, my face gets oilier even faster and even if I dab it or wash it with water, it gets oily again after an hour.\n\nAny suggestions on which products, routine would work for me? A friend suggested retinal, which I havent tried, what do you think?",

Everything seems focused on fast dry time and hair health, with cool shots and heat cycling.\n\nWith curly hair, my hair is already mostly dry from sitting under a hooded dryer. I use a blow dryer specifically to stretch, smooth, and straighten the curl, not to dry wet hair. A lot of the newer dryers get warm but don’t stay hot enough to actually smooth.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for professional blow dryers that get really hot and stay hot? Not worried about being the healthiest option, just looking for heat and power.\n\nAppreciate any suggestions.",

So around 90% of my hair is virgin at this point and fairly dark brunette. \n\nTo the point: I want to get face framing mostly minimal highlights just mostly at the front. I’m not the very best at bleaching my own hair so that will be done at the salon but I want to skip out on the extra crazy up charge for toner when I know I can do that at home (I used to tone my own hair quite a bit a few years ago). \n\nQ: Just wanting some recommendations on what toner could help me achieve a sort of light honey blonde color. I typically use Wella. \n\n((EXTRA: I’m thinking the cut of the third picture would suit me but I’m open to any cut suggestions.

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

This is not very common for East Asians, and my hair also exhibits typical E.A. hair traits - on the thinner side, low porosity. Growing up, I had no idea how to take care of my hair and I was convinced I had unruly, frizzy hair.\n\nAround my late teens I discovered the curly girl/wavy girl method. I tried gels, cremes, mousses... they all made my hair crunchy and I had no idea what I was doing wrong. I did a bit more research and then came across a suggestion: curl foams. \n\nAnd wow, at the ripe age of 23, my hair has never looked better.\n\n(obligatory not sponsored by any of these products)\n\nMy routine:\n\n1. Shampoo and Conditioner (Kristen Ess The One Signature Shampoo, Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Conditioner)  \n2. Towel Dry until damp  \n3. Styling - Umberto Giannini Curl Foam, scrunch and diffuse, finish with ARKIVE Good Habit Hybrid Oil\n\nDo y'all have any holy grail curl foams?

      "content": "Around two years ago, I had a bad acne flare-up from using a cleanser and used tretinoin 0.025% for a month. Since that was slow to work, I used a 25% mandelic acid peel and immediately after, one cheek began wrinkling from being thin and dehydrated from my tretinoin use. I used aquaphor twice daily and my skin healed within a few days.\n\nThere was a significant improvement in my acne and PIH, so I continued using the mandelic acid peel every other week for roughly the next 16 months (until mid-2024). I stopped using it since it caused increased sun sensitivity even with daily sunscreen use and some dryness.\n\nWithin these two years, my face looks more aged and kind of sagging: sunken under eyes, flatter cheeks, noticeable nasolabial folds. I asked my PCP about it last year and she said significant collagen loss isn’t expected at my age. I’ve always looked young for my age and had plump, full cheeks, but now, I feel sad when I look at myself. \n\nWhat can I do to increase my facial volume and firm my skin? I know retinoids increase collagen, but there have been posts about them causing dry eyes and mimicking volume loss for thin skin, so I’m scared to use them again. But Medik8’s crystal retinal at low strengths (1 and 3) seem more suited for sensitive skin and I’ve been curious about it. I’ve also read that peptides can help increase collagen while being gentle. I’m also open to effective, non-invasive skincare treatments.\n\nMy diet is pretty clean and based on whole foods, lean proteins, and fruits/veggies. I’ve roughly stayed the same weight during this time. Below is my current skincare routine:\n\nAM\n\n-rinse with water -propolis toner or dr. jart ceramidin cream (depends on the weather) -haruharu wonder sunscreen\n\nPM\n\n-etude soon jung whipping cleanser -mist face, skinfood propolis toner -alastin restorative eye treatment -dr. jart ceramidin cream -aquaphor (if skin is dry) -dermalogica microfoliant (1x weekly)\n\nThank you so much for the help!",

      "content": "So I haven't worn my hair naturally wavy/curly in years. My go-to has been to air dry fully, then do overnight curls using a robe tie type-thing. It's been so great for ease of styling, but I've been wishing I could style my hair more naturally, so I've decided I'm going to work towards embracing my natural curls this year. However, my first few attempts at styling have gone terribly, lol. I know I need a really good trim - I have one booked for early next week. There's damage there from highlights (I only get them done once, sometimes twice/year) and I had some shedding due to stress/health issues that seems to finally be resolving. I know it's going to take time but... Can anyone help with some ideas for why my hair is so gross and stringy?! It looks so much fuller than this when I do overnight curls (see last photo). My hair is super fine, I know that. This makes finding the right products challenging. I'm also trying to figure out what curl pattern I have. It looks so much curlier when soaking wet with product in, after being scrunched. But it just dries to this crispy, stringy mess. :( I swear it used to be quite wavy/curly when I used to wear it that way consistently. Like I'd have some actual curls in there. Here's my routine/what I've tried: \n\n1) Double was, then condition (Ouai fine hair shampoo &amp; conditioner), every 2-3 days. Once/week I'll use purple shampoo instead of one of the washes, and every couple weeks I'll use L-Oreal clarifying shampoo because I have hard water. \n\n2) Light spray with L'Oreal Total Repair 5 spray for leave-in/detangling\n\n3) Then for product so far I've tried...\n- Just using JVN air dry cream\n- Just using Design Me Bounce Curl Balm \n- Using L'Oreal dream lengths curl mousse in combination with JVN air dry\n- And then more recently, because I've read that styling creams can be too heavy for fine hair, I've tried Not Your Mother's curl talk mousse and gel (based on suggestions I've read on some posts) - mousse first, then gel.\n\nI apply products to soaking wet hair after detangling and spray with more water as-needed. Then brush style using a knockoff bounce curl brush. I've tried just air-drying and also plopping followed by diffusing, which is the result in pics 1-2. \nPic 3 is after air drying, overnight curls then just fixing the front pieces a little with a flat iron. \n\nI've barely given this two weeks but I feel ready to abandon it LOL. I realize it'll take more time. Can anyone give some guidance/encouragement to help me stick this out?",

It’s now just this lump and has a central pore in it, if I squeeze it a very small amount of grey or brown thick keratin type thing comes out of the pore.
