Bali Curls Moisturizing Conditioner\n\n3. Bali Curls Hydrating Curl Cream\n\n4. Bali Curls Curl Defining Gel \n\n5. Bali Curls Bonding Oil for scrunch out the gelcast.\n\nI never had long hair and had to find out just after my early 40s that i have curly hair (i would say 2c-3a). It is very fine but it seems i still have a lot strands. I was going to cut that dry and frizzy mess short again until i learned how to maintain it after watching videos, search the internet and finally got a \"curlsys\" cut from a hair stylist knowing how to handle curly hair and teach me how to maintain and style it. I also learned that some things makes night and day like avoid friction and sleeping only on a silk pillowcase with a loose bun (also silk scrunchie here). It can get really on my nerves to maintain that mane but i just feel so much better now at my age with my longer hair and while in the beginning people said it looks terrible, now it is more the opposite and it is a great conservation starter to women and man.\n\nI am still searching for maybe some better products for my special hair type and try other things. I just bought the \"Lockenbox\" Christmas calendar with 24 tools and products to try for next year ;) My journey just began (even i am already a 47 years old man) and hope to grow the curls much longer and maintain them better. I still have some bad hair days with a frizzball on my head but now i know how to \"repair\" it. One thing for sure, even if some people try to talk me into a shorter hairstyle i am done with shorter hair.....at least until it might get thinner as an aging man. So far i think i still have some years to go. ",

I can’t STAND the back of my hair. It’s stringy and flat and weird, and only curls at the bottom. I have strands that frizz and don’t define no matter what I seem to do. At the same time, my hair can look flat and weighed down, and only curls at the bottom in most places. I’m not sure what I can do. I don’t know if I should be adding more moisture or if I’m adding too much. How can I get my hair to look less weighed down at the top and in the back? Any help would be appreciated.  \nI usually use Herbal Essences honey shampoo and conditioner, but lately I’ve been using garnier fructis conditioner. I wash my hair maybe 2-3 times a week, or more if it gets sweaty. I try to leave in conditioner for as long as I can before washing it out and I always leave in a tiny bit. I only brush my hair wet, and I apply products while it’s pretty damp. Daily, I use OUAI leave in, or Sleep on it overnight curl cream. Neither really do anything, I still have a ton of frizz and weighed down looking hair. I shower before bed, and let my hair air dry 70% before I clip it up. I swear I could put in the whole bottle of product and my hair would still look dry. The second pic is a failed attempt at defusing. In the 3rd picture I included, I had used gel as well to style my hair, and I like the way it looks. It was completely air dried. It was also summer, and my hair always seems to be prettier in the summer. The fourth pic is just air dried hair after my normal routine. Any advice would be really appreciated. I’m not sure what my hair needs. Plz give tips!!",

I do a no part styling technique at the crown, and layer with some gel and diffuse.\n\nThis routine gives me very inconsistent results. Sometimes it looks nice and defined. A lot of the time, it looks crunchy and stiff,even after I try to scrunch out the crunch.\n\nive tried so many curl routines, and most of them just make my hair look thin and stiff.\n\nDoes anyone know of how I can give my hair a bit more body/volume?

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "So I have a lot of comedones all over my face as well as big pores and sebaceous filaments all over my nose. I've tried a lot of stuff before retinoids — La roche Posay Effaclar products (Serum + Duo M + Moisturizer), Clay deep cleansing masks, Salicylic acid face washes, but nothing seems to penetrate my skin deep enough to get rid of the problem. I've heard a lot of good things about Differin, so I thought that I don't really have anything to loose no, might as well try something different. I've never tried using another like that so I decided to be really precise with getting my skin adjusted to it. Here's what l do:\n\n1. Wash my face twice with La Roche Posay Toleraine gel\n2. Apply moisturizer (Bioderma Atoderm), let it soak in for 30 minutes\n3. Apply a pea sized amount of Differin all over my face, except under my eyes and mouth area, wait 30 min again\n4. Finish it all off with another layer of the same moisturizer\n\nI'm planning on doing that twice a week for two weeks, then switching for three times a week for another two, and then switching to every other day for the rest of the months. Also, l've heard that you shouldn't use any acids while using Differin, so I'm planning to stop using any skin care stuff that I have while l'm trying Differin. I really want this to work out, cause l've been told that it's just hormonal teenage stage, but I'm 22 now and I'm sick of doing anything just to end up with a bumpy uneven skin.\nIs that the right routine when trying to get on Differin? Should I do it differently? Any advice will help",

Then cut it mostly off post COVID and super short a year ago to get rid of the last of my dye in preparation for going gray. Now I'm growing it out again. \n\nI know the conventional wisdom is to moisturize a lot but during this growing out phase I actually prefer letting it frizz a bit and just do its thing. I have a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner but here is my current routine:\n\nWash about 2x week. \n\nAussie Moist shampoo (yes I know not really curly shampoo)\n\nA little Bumble &amp; Bumble Semi Sumo and let it air dry. \n\nWhen I use moisturizing curl shampoos and conditioners they seem to weigh my hair down and there's no wave at all, just flat-looking. \n\nI think when it gets to be a certain length I'll need to switch to the curl friendly stuff. Wondering what other people are doing at this phase?  I think I'm probably a 2a or 2b when grown. Attached are pictures from when it was longest and what it is now",

But when my hair is wet, I see that there’s still something of a curl present, but I don’t really know what to do or which products to use that will help the curl get a bit more revived.\n\nRight now this is my routine:\nI wash my hair using Ultra Doux shampoo, conditioner and mask for brittle hair (the white and pink bottle with oats). I detangle in the shower when I’m using the hair mask.\nAfter that I use a leave in conditioner (l’oreal hydra hyaluronic leave in conditioner spray). Sometime I use a mousse for curls (from taft), but usually don’t really notice a difference if I use it or not.\nI also air dry my hair, because I don’t want to spend most of my evenings blow drying my hair with a diffuser (I work in health care and I’m too tired to spend my time this way).\n\nI was bored and was looking online for some products and I remembered Curlsmith.\nI used to use the hair jelly and it wasn’t bad but I just didn’t know how to really work with it. \nThere’s a sale going on on the website I was browsing and these ones caught my eye.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on these products, if they’re any good and how to use them in the best way possible and of course any other tips or recommendations! I’m in the EU btw :)\n\nThanks in advance!",
