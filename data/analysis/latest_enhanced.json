(No conditioner used), use brush for curly hair to detangle the most you can.\n\n2.\t⁠After shower when the hair is still wet, divide the hair in 2 parts, left and right area, and each of those in 3 subparts: front, middle, back. So 6 parts in total.\n\nUse hair clips for this.\n\n3. Start with one of the 6 parts, and grab a smaller amount of hair from it, that is easier to manage and apply Skala curl cream and Etniker curl gel in all that piece of hair, the curl patterns starts to appear automatically\n\n4. Now define every curl from that amount of hair definitively by rolling them on your finger and releasing carefully. One by one. (do not put much tension, not so tight).\n\n5. After finishing with that amount of hair, grab other manageable amount of hair from the 1st part, and repeat.\n\n6. Do the same for the next 5 parts.\n\n7. At the end, dry the hair with diffuser around 15 minutes. Diffuser is so important!\n\n8. When going to sleep or laying in bed for any reason, use a Satin anti frizz Hat (important also)",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi, so I’ve been looking to figure out my own skincare and been very confused with all the products on the market. I do have somewhat of a routine but I feel like I’m not doing something right.\n\nI used to see a dermatologist about 5/6 years ago for acne on my face back arms and chest. I used a specific face wash for oily skin, used differin gel, another gel I forgot the name of but was some form of strong retinol?, and been on accutane. Oh, and I also got some steroids for bacne. It’s all sorted now except for my face concerns.\n\nI am 22 now and moved to a colder country from the Middle East, since then I don’t think my skin has been as oily but maybe combination and dry at times. This is dumb but I’m not even sure how to figure out my skin type 😬 it feels mildly oily maybe mostly around the T zone but also feels dry/rough at the same time so I’m thinking combo or oily?\n\nI have these fine lines on my face that I think are just dehydration lines, I’ve some active acne (not a lot at all), quite a bit of acne scar/pigmentation (red and brown spots), melasma(?) or darkening around my mouth and dark circles. There are small bumps as well but not many. My nose feels rough and bumpy too. I would also like to have clear glass skin if that’s even attainable at this point but mostly I just want my face to be 1 skin tone. My forehead is also darker than most of my face.\n\nAt the moment, this is what I do\n\nMorning\n\nFace wash - la roche posay Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel Cleanser\n\nToner - isntree green tea\n\nSerum - the ordinary niacinamide or vitamin C by sukin (although it’s over now so I just use niacinamide)\n\nMoisturizer - illiyoon ceramide ato concentrate\n\nNight\n\nFace wash - simple barrier support face wash\n\nToner - isntree green tea\n\nSerum - I rotate between tretinoin 0.05% or medicube 0 pore pads\n\nMoisturizer - illiyoon ceramide ato concentrate\n\nI was wondering if maybe anything like alpha arbutin or hyaluronic acid would be a good addition? If so how must I use it in this current routine or does the routine need a change? Any recommendations for products are also greatly appreciated. As a note: I’ve brown skin\n\nI must also mention I’m not rich and loaded (yet) so I would love if any product recommendations could be affordable and on that note I can also not afford a dermatologist as I no longer have ‘bank of dad’. Thank you 🙏",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

But I shaved against the grain in the past, many times, and this is the longest I’ve had this reaction (about five days). It’s not going away. \n\n**I’m on topical tretinoin** (I admit I’m lazy with it tho), used to be on adapalene. \n\nI’ve tried the 7 days salicylic acid + cica exfoliating pads for these zits, I popped them too and smacked tretinoin on it (seemed to work in the past) but I think that might have been prolonging my healing. (I know my methods are unorthodox, I’m sorry 😭)\n\nToday, I did more research and the ai search result thing recommends sulfur. So I **put** that De La Cruz **10% sulfur mask on for 30 minutes** and washed it away. But I’m not sure if it helped.\n\n**What can I use to make this go away fast?** \n\nI gotta admit I’m impatient with it since I have an event to go to this Friday and I’m so insecure about it. \n\nMy sister told me anti bacterial soap is good. Didn’t read that online though. \n\nI’ve been **using Bepanthen** and it’s soothing the irritation but it’s not making the little zits go away. I suspect it’s worsening it since it’s a pretty rich cream. ",

Or just stick to one?\n\nToner: The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner (Monday and Thursday) COSRX ABC Daily Toner for the days he doesn't use the Glycolic Acid toner. Or would this be too much and he should use something like The Ordinary Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner?\n\nSerum: Niacinamide (to help with dark spots)\n\nMoisturizer: COSRX Ceramide Skin Barrier Moisturizer\n\nSunscreen\n\nPlease feel free to suggest anything that might help.

Yesterday, before the lotion and oil combo, I used an epilator that has a light on it and noticed my skin is VERY dry, the epilator was leaving marks. I am not sure if this is winter specific, but I thought my routine was solid. \n\n  \nAny advice? Am I doing too much in the shower?
