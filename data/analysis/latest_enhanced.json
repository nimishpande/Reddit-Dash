It comes with an inner mesh cap that you place over the wet hair to hold curls in place, then apply the black blow-drying cap that connects to your hair dryer. I live in the Midwest where it is currently very cold, and traditional diffusing before work tends to result in bad frizz and a bad hair day overall. My curls do not like this cold winter weather because I prefer to air dry, but there is not enough time in the mornings. I cannot wash the night before because my hair gets mis-shapen  and smooshed down from my CPAP that I wear at night. I do wear a silk cap under the CPAP. I have to wash daily (morning)  due to oily fine hair.\nRoutine: L’Oreal ever pure moisture S/C, It’s-a -10 coily leave-in conditioner spray, Cake Curl Crush light hold gel. I finish with a gel/moose combo once 90% dry, for extra hold. My hair gets easily weighed down by too many or too heavy products.\nCaucasian, fine 3a/3B hair, length is just past shoulders, dishwater blonde with medium highlights.",

      "content": "Some background is I have had acne basically my whole life (I am now a women in early 20s). I went to a dermatologist for years, tried all the meds and even did 2 full rounds of accutane years ago. I remember my skin being dry but literally still having active breakouts. Nothing worked and I was told it was hormonal and there was nothing they could do. Now I am on birth control specifically for acne but have noticed no real difference.\n\n3 months ago I decided maybe I could try the dermatologist again. I went and she was suggesting accutane but thought we could try spirolactone first since accutane wasn't successful and it may be hormonal. She also gave me tretinoin .05%, azelaic acid, and clindamycin. My current routine is AM-wash tace with water, hypochlorous acid spray, clindamycin, Vanicream daily facial moisturizer. PM-double cleanse with prequel gleanser, alternate azelaic acid, rest, tret, rest, then the Vanicream again.\n\nI have noticed pretty much no difference since I started this routine and the medication. When I tried to increase tret usage my skin would get irritated and break out, and I don't think it was purging. I feel absolutely discouraged that I will have acne my entire life. It is so unfair to be a girl in college, and basically no girl has acne the way I do. If I want to feel even remotely pretty and put together I have to wear heavy makeup. I hate it and all I want is for my acne to go away, but even the end all be all of Accutane didn't work at all. What do I even do at this point?",

But idk how my face becomes so dull everytime I step into the sun. And the moment I come back home , fash off my face with facewash , it becomes lighter (???) , how does this work and what is it ?\n\nI apply sunscreen but it seems like it makes me look more dull. I use aqualogica sunscreen , not that bad but idk what's up with this . I have an oily and sweaty face so I swear too in the sun. Honestly no matter what sunscreen i use , i tried Neutrogena, Aqualogica, but anyhow I feel like I swear it off. What do I do ? This is during WINTER. Summers are worse.\n\nPlease help me identify the cause of this ",

      "content": "I have 3a/3b curls that used to easily retain moisture, were quite tight and lasted me 3-4 days. After a haircut in September, where my hair was sadly straightened,my curls started looking a lot looser and were not as nice looking. They started falling flat and limp, were frizzy and just looked way different than they used to. When they were straightened a heat protectant was used, however, I don’t know which one. I started using Rizos Curls Products after that haircut, which basically has no Protein as far as I know. So basically my hair wasn’t getting protein for almost 3 months straight. My hair dries different now and also feels different. I have no idea how to get them back.\n\nMy routine consisted of:\n\n\\- Shampoo and Conditioner by Jean&amp;Len\n\n\\- As I Am leave in classic\n\n\\- Rizos Curls Curl Defining Mousse\n\n\\- Rizos Curls Strong Hold gel\n\nI started with the leave in and raked that throughout my hair with my hands, just a quarter size. Then 3 pumps mousse, sometimes raked in sometimes scrunched. Then the gel, just a little bit also scrunched. After that I diffused and always slept with a bonnet.\n\nWhen I started researching why my hair was like this, I heard a lot about Protein, so I got the Rehab Salve from Curlsmith. I used this like 2 times now but it just looked better right after that but not long term. I’ve been trying for a month now to find the problem but I am clueless. I don’t know what to do and how to fix it and it’s really messing me up because I love my hair :(\n\nThe first 4 pics is my hair now using the same styling method, however, my curls look much looser now in my opinion.\n\nThe 5th and 6th pic is before the haircut, during that my hair was straightened and I wasn’t using any protein products. \n\nThe last two pics is my hair over a year ago where I was only using As I Am Long&amp;Luxe Curl Enhancing Smoothie.\n\nCould it be dead ends now that they grown out more? Is it the lack of protein over 3 months? Is it something else entirely? If you have any ideas please help me on how to fix this.\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "Hair type: Low density, Course, High porosity 2c/3a (I think)\n\n\nHi, so I started growing my hair during Covid and by Oct 21 it was shoulder length (pic 1), and it looked pretty good considering I did nothing with it except wash (Aussie Miracle Moist) and condition (Tresemme rich moisture), then air dry.  I have satin pillowcase and a silk bonnet that I wear to bed.  I also turned 50 in October 25, and my hair has definitely got thinner in the last 5 years.\n\n\nAt some point in early 22 I had my hair done to make it lighter halfway down and the following year (2023 - pic2) I discovered Flora &amp; Curl curl lotion - I would use a blob of that after washing (hair still wet) and comb it through root to tip with a curly hair comb, then let it air dry which worked great for a while (pics 3-5).  Unfortunately at some point mid-late 2024/early 2025 F&amp;C changed the lotion in some way and it changed consistency.  After that it felt greasy and heavy, although it did still help a bit with the curl (pic 6).\n\n\nAfter that I noticed that intermittently my hair would go straight halfway down the strand, and be super frizzy and or lose definition (pics 7 &amp; 8).  After that point if I washed it and didn't use anything except shampoo &amp; conditioner + air dry it turned into a horrible frizzy mess (pic 9).\n\n\nI tried Curl Smith, Curl Show, Camille Rose, Only Curls, Cantu and some others but they all did the same thing as the single F&amp;C lotion after it changed, and some of them were really heavy.\n\n\nIn mid December (25) I had my hair coloured (just a dark red, no bleach) and just after I went and picked up the 3 stage F&amp;C line (lotion, gel and mousse) to see if those together would do anything.  For my work Xmas party I washed it the night before, and then used the F&amp;C lotion, then mousse, and then used my hands to remove excess water and then scrunched my hair for the first time ever, and did that for about 30 mins.  I then used a hairdryer on low blowing up at me to try with my head upside down to try and remove some moisture and add volume.  When it had finished and I took the picture the next day (pic 10) I had the best curls I've seen in years, and a ringlet one I could put a pencil up at the front.\n\n\nWeirdly I've not been able to recreate what I had at Xmas since - Over the holiday period I was told I should be using a defuser, so I brought one (Tresemme Pro Pure Curl Define).  Yesterday I tried using all 3 F&amp;C products + the defuser (watched some vids on how to use it) and it went horribly.  About £50 in product + defuser and to be honest it looks the worst it has in SO long I just want to give up (pic 11).\n\n\nIt looked so good right after I had it coloured and just using the lotion and mousse + hand scrunch, and now I'm wondering if the colouring is doing something to the hair that makes the product work better.  Of course as I'm washing it now no colour runs out so if that was the case that would help explain the texture change.  The last 2 pics don't even look like the same hair!\n\n\nI originally wrote this back in November 25 but with the colour and my lucky Xmas hair I thought I had cracked it, but that turned out to be a one off so here I am, asking for any hints or tips on what to do next.",

      "content": "I have long, 3B, low-porosity, graying hair, and my \"holy grail\" for years has been 100% Kinky Curly.  I use the Come Clean shampoo, Knot Today conditioner (I use this as a co-wash between shampoos and also as a rinse-out/leave-in), and the Curling Custard gel.  I love this routine because it is free of proteins and heavy butters and oils, and because it is very simple - only three, CG-friendly, natural and versatile products, all from the same brand.  I also love that none of the products has a strong fragrance.\n\nI now live in Spain and will soon run out of the Kinky Curly products that I brought from the U.S.  Can anyone recommend a similar product line that is available in Spain?  Bonus points for products available in stores like Primor or Druni, but I will order online if necessary.  I need a strong hold gel because I live on the coast where it can get very humid (my KCCC works great if I use a lot of it and then diffuse after).  Thank you!",
