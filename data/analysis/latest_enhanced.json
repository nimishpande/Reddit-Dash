Also, she has dark brown, straight hair that will also have to be bleached or lightened or lifted. Whichever the term is. Ill attach some screenshots of what shes aiming for and thank you in advance.

      "content": "Hi, \n\nI hate falling for marketing bxllshxt, especially when it comes to personal care products. I always try to do as much research as possible and understand the formulas before buying anything. \n\nEven though it’s impossible to know the exact numbers, it’s extremely likely from a commercial standpoint that curly hair care brands, especially the “premium” ones with genuinely good formulas like Innersense, K18, Olaplex, Curlsmith, etc. produce their finished products (packaging + formula) for less than $3 per unit, while we pay $25–$30 for each.\n\nSure, these products work and many of us are satisfied with them, but it’s hard not to see those margins as a scam. A 10x markup or more on most items, It just doesn’t justify the price. \n\nI actually like spending money on honest products that are worth their price, but in this case, I spend with frustration, knowing that the brand I’m giving my money to is treating me like an idiot with fancy packaging and overhyped marketing. \n\nYou might say: “Then stop buying premium brands and go for cheaper ones.” But no ... because despite their excessive marketing and storytelling, those premium brands are still the most effective in terms of formula-to-performance ratio. \n\nIf I buy something like C\\*ntu, Ska\\*a, or any mass-market brand, yes, I’ll spend less than $10, but it’ll also be money wasted bc the formulas are underdosed in actives, full of silicones, and only provide short-term placebo effects. \n\nIn skincare, we have brands like Geek &amp; Gorgeous or The Ordinary, totally transparent, no marketing fluff, high active concentrations, and fair prices. But in curly hair care, that kind of brand seems to not exist. So my question is: to take proper care of our textured hair, are we forced to overpay? ",

The stress from my health concerns, the demands of college, and the complexities of life in general have taken a noticeable toll. As a result, I've experienced an alarming amount of hair loss, so much so that my remaining hair is now incredibly sparse, to the point where it all comfortably fits in the palm of my hand.\n\nnow, I've been losing my hair gradually for about 3 years, and it seems to have started when my life got super stressful. I'm looking for some advice on how to deal with it. I'm already on meds, so I'm not really keen on taking more prescriptions. I've tried coconut oil and vitamin gummies. already (i started the coconut oil thing last week, just to let you guys know). Any ideas on other things I can try to make my hair grow back, and to help with the stress? (idk if this is the right subbreddit, if its not pls tell me where i can ask)",

I haven't been happy with a wash day in a long time. The pictures I've included are in reverse chronological order.  Lately my curls have been feeling stretched out, misshapen, suuuper frizzy. My gel/mousse situation is leaving my hair feeling like straw after it's dry, and also way, way too dry. I'm just kind of at my wit's end. I've tried a good handful of products, am super for real in need of some new recommendations. I started using gel and mousse earlier this year, love the definition and hold, would really love for my hair to still feel soft afterwards though. I feel like my shine is gone too. I have low porosity, medium dense hair, completely virgin, no heat at all since shaving it.\n\nI tried prose a few years back and was really happy with it, couldn't afford to keep getting it. Since looking at the mega document on here and other people's experiences, it seems like it might not be worth a rebuy? \n\nI'm currently using innersense shampoo, conditioner and mousse, loma maximizing volume gel.  \nWash day's just include normal shampoo cleanse, conditioner sits while I do body stuff, scrunch in mousse/gel combo, let it dry, scrunch out. I've tried and failed with some refreshes in between, it usually just ends up in clips or braids before the next wash\n\nwould love product or routine recommendations, drug store or \"designer\", anything in between.

I may or may not consider transplant in the future, but not right now.\n\nI only recently came across Hair Systems, and it's like god send. I feel like this will greatly improve my mental health and my confidence in general. It almost sounds too good to be true, and now that's my concern.. what's the catch?\n\nI understand it needs regular maintenance and can cost a bit (\\~400$ for new installation and $30 for maintenance where I live). It's definitely worth it since it solves a major insecurity in my life, while the alternative is min/fin forever or go bald. I'm also an active person (heavy cardio 2-3 times a week, and gym 6 days) so that's a concern.\n\nHas anyone had any regrets getting into hair systems?\n\n  \nEdit: As most say, the psychological effect of wearing a \"wig\" is not my concern now as I hate my current hair / going bald and see this as a solution. Folks who using it over at the hair systems sub have all good things to say about it, and it seems to be the exact opposite here. Is it because folks here haven't tried it ever and have an already existing stigma around it?",
