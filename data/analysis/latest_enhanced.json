      "content": "This is my DAY TWO hair. My hair is very fine, thin, low density, rough finish and frizzy. Creams weigh it down and make it look limp and stringy, but I also struggle with frizz. I read a tip on this page to put mousse in dry hair, and after an unsuccessful wash day figured I would give it a shot, and I love the results!\n\nRoutine: I applied a tiny amount of Mais Cacho’s leave-in after my shower when hair was soaking wet. I raked through the Kinky Curl Custard and brush-styled the top section only (I find this helps with volume) and micro-plopped with a microfiber towel, and diffused / air dried. It was my first time trying this routine (normally I use TiGi Curls Rock and no cream)  and I wasn’t happy once my hair was dry and I scrunched out the crunch. My curls were defined, but I had very little volume, and the curls were too clumped together, limp, and stringy. Right before bed I decided to glaze through a small amount of the Curlsmith mousse, scrunched and diffused on medium heat. I used a Renee Furterer mouse on the other side of my head. Right away, my curls came to life and became voluminous and shiny! I slept with a pineapple on my head and when I woke up in the morning, my curls still looked fantastic. Normally, I refresh my hair with spray water and a bit more gel, but I didn’t even have to do that! I just walked right out the door. \n\nNote that the side shown in the picture is where I use the Curlsmith mousse. The side where I used the Renee Furterer mousse looks noticeably worse and much frizzier. \n\nThank you to everyone who made this great recommendation!",

      "content": "I realize this question has been asked a LOT, but hear me out bc I wouldn't be asking if the other posts were totally helpful 🫤\n\nSo, yeah, best pube razor? \n\n1. When you look for \"dermatologist recommended,\" the answers are **immediately,** _\"Get a dedicated electric shaver!\"_ or _\"While this may not be a traditional close shave...\"_ As soon as I see that, I dip out 😄 I mean, yes, skin around the pubic hair is prone to ingrown hairs and/or sensitivity, but I refuse to believe **every single** female dermatologist has resigned themselves to a constant pube 5 o' clock shadow :P \n(I'm sure some of them get laser or waxing done. Dermatologists make _bank._ )\n\n2. I see women say _\"Anything with 5 blades!\"_ but hasn't it been shown that more blades = more irritation?? Honest-to-god, I think FIVE blades is insanity. I'm not saying I don't use them, but I feel like it's just clever marketing that has burned into the core of our souls that more blades = a closer shave. Maybe 3 blades MAX (I just feel like the additional blades mind help grab hairs that were left behind. I DON'T EFFING KNOW... I'm being super vulnerable here admitting I know jack shit about shaving, apparently lol) \n\nSo are they good or not?? I wish I knew 😭\n\n3. *SINGLE-BLADE RAZORS.* In recent years, single-blade razors with their old-fashioned handles have been touted as the \"best shave ever!\" Their reasoning is that fewer blades = less irritation; a good, sharp blade will always beat 5 not-so-great blades; they're more affordable, etc. But they don't really elaborate about the shaving experience beyond \"it's close!\" Obviously the majority are _men,_ but I've been seeing them advertised for women, too... Look, I have a feeling most of us understand that when it comes to a blade near your GENITALS, a single-blade razor housed in a metal handle, no flexibility, no guards, etc. seems TERRIFYING. I swear to God, I have always had the fear of nicking my labia (it hasn't happened.... YET 😅)\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I really have never seen one that has a flexible handle to help you reach hard places without being a contortionist.\n\nSo far the ONLY way I can shave downstairs without a ton of irritation is to wait until my pubes are soft &amp; \"fluffy,\" but I can never shave in between those times without patches of blood or razor burn 🙄 Could I wax? Yes. Do I want to? NO. In this economy?? Plus, it takes SO much hair to need to get waxed.I've invested in an at-home laser-flash thingie, but I'm not consistent (And it requires you to shave the area anyway!)\n\nSo what do YOU ALL think? Of course no one HAS to shave their pubes, but if you do, how in God's name do we get a close shave without irritation?? Be nice, y'all. This is a struggle we ALL have &amp; I don't want to see women being mean over something as silly as bushwhacking :P \n\n**TL;DR Finding razors is hard.** Finding women's stuff in general makes me feel like the whole \"sort yourself out\" bit by Mitchell and Webb 🫤 (do yourself a favor &amp; find it on youtube. It's less than a minute. It'll give you a giggle.)\n\nWe are but an afterthought when it comes to a lot of products...  ",

My college is in Hyderabad, where the weather is usually dry  and my skin is perfectly fine there, more on the normal to slightly dry side.\n\nBut every time I go to Bombay for internships (where my family also stays), my skin completely changes. It becomes extremely oily, sweaty, and sticky the moment I step out. Since I’m constantly running around in formal clothes for court/office, by noon my skin looks super shiny, dull, sticky and just... disheveled. Like not the glowy kind of oily, it's the tired, heavy, “why does my face feel like it’s melting” kind. And it feels uncomfortable ngl\n\nI’ve tried blotting papers, which help for a while but even after that my skin feels heavy and sticky for some reason. I also tried the Innisfree No Sebum Powder, but it made my skincare kind of pill (that weird rolling feeling on the skin), and I hate that texture.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\n\nMorning:\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n2. L’Oréal Revitalift Serum\n3. L’Oréal Revitalift Hyaluronic Acid Cream\n4. Dot and Ket Watermelon Sunscreen\n\n\nNight:\n\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n2. Earth Rhythm Serums (I alternate between the CLEAR SKIN SERUM and 10% NIACINAMIDE SERUM)\n3. Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer\n\n\nI don’t wear makeup daily, maybe just sunscreen and Etude water tint. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, but my skin just hates Bombay weather. Is it the humidity? My routine? Any product or routine adjustments that could help?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice, I’m tired of looking like a greaseball by lunchtime 😭",

What’s really bothering me now are the red marks that just won’t fade no matter what I do 😩\n\nAround two months ago, I added 0.3% retinol from Minimalist twice a week at night, and also tried azelaic acid cream from Conscious Chemist on non-active days. But the azelaic acid irritated my skin, so I stopped using it.\n\nI built this routine based on research and some AI suggestions, but I’d really love to hear from people who’ve dealt with similar skin issues. How do you fade post-acne redness while keeping breakouts under control? Any product or ingredient recs that actually worked for you would be amazing 💛",

      "content": "So, if you've ordered one of these scalp applicators for Minoxidil. I have a few tips and tricks for getting the technique right. I've been using one for a month now\n\n**1. Don't put the entire dose in the applicator at once.** I suggest you put anywhere from 0.2-0.4ml in at a time. You can use your dropper, spray bottle etc to measure how much you put in. This helps you get more even coverage with less solution. I find whenever I do this, it's easier to get my scalp soaking with much less solution and much better coverage. It also helps you better split the dose consistently per area. (e.g. I use 0.4ml for temples and 0.2ml for vertex). Consistent application also makes it easier to know which dosing works for you!\n\n**2. Twist it!** Instead of running the applicator back and forth. Use your fingers to twist it, so the applicator spins, while moving it back and forth at little. This drastically improves coverage since the applicator is half ball-point tips and half just plastic knobs. This really sped up my application process. Just notice since you get better coverage much faster, you have to be more precis about where you apply.\n\n**3. Adjust your pressure.** If you press too hard, especially when you've just filled it, too much of your dose will come out at once. I find at the start of filling it, light pressure, then towards the end you can apply more pressure to get out the last bit. Even pressing the top of the applicator at the end can help you get out a little. But don't do this at the start because it will drip out most of what you put in, in one spot.\n\n**4. Doseage.** Do this at your own discretion. I realized once I started using this thing effectively that even 0.6ml per dose would leave my target areas covered and noticeable wet with solution. So I decided to use 0.6ml instead of the usual 1ml. (1.2ml per day) I cannot testify to the efficacy of this (yet) but you lose much less to your hair and fingers than you would with 1ml using a dropper or spray bottle. So it can be an idea to consider using less, if you get comparable coverage in the area with less solution.\n\n**5. Clean regularly.** To avoid it clogging, never leave solution sitting in it. Rinse with water after using and you're good to go.\n\nThe result of all this is that it takes me not more than 2-3 minutes per dose to apply minoxidil, and I get much less of that frustrating \"did I even cover my scalp\" feeling I got from using a spray bottle. (serious f\\* those! half the dose would be lose to my hair and fingers). I hope this is helpful!",

I’ve never had pimples like this and the exact same ones have been here for weeks. I also have these tiny bumps all over my chin I think they’re closed comedones.\n\nI used to use hydroboost gel cleanser neutrogena as a cleanser and Vaseline aloe Vera cream. I used hylauronic acid TO too. \n\nMy makeup just consists of nyx concealer and maybeline skin tint 24hr. I occasionally use the beauty of joseon and garnier sunscreen.\n\nI stopped using these to help my skin clear up.\n\nThe natural approach didn’t work so I tried to use these to help:\n-azealic acid TO cream\n- sudocream\n- aquaphor\n- Vaseline\n- salicylic acid \n\nI am not getting any results which sucks. I have a feeling this was possibly caused by cutting dairy and sugar for a month but I returned back to eating them right after my Italy trip.\n\nUnfortunately I can’t go to a dermatologist because there’s barely any in my country and you need to get on a waiting list. I went to my GP and she dismissed it. An appointment to the DR is €75 so it would be waste if I went to another doctor and they dismissed it again.\n\nAny suggestions?",

I’m thinking this is due to wearing tight shoes for too long, and there have been instances where I remember taking off said shoes and have a red scab/piece of skin falling off (graphic lol). I think my skin in this area is naturally pretty thin as well, so after healing like this multiple times my heels are now just permanently red- even when I havent worn irritating/tight shoes for months or years and all wounds have healed. Is there something I can do to fix this or do I just have to accept it?",

I explained to the hairstylist that my goal is to have the most seamless grow out possible. That was about 2 months ago. \n\nThe issue is .. it looks awful now. I've also had quite a bit of breakage. How much should I cut off &amp; what could I ask for at a salon for a more seamless growth journey? What would my natural color be called? \n\nSince making the choice to grow it out I keep my hair mainly in loose buns / braids, sleep with a bonnet and use a water filter.

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

It gets tight, flaky, and honestly painful sometimes. I’ve always had dry skin, but winter just wrecks it completely.\n\nI’ve gone through the usual stuff like Cerave, Neutrogena Hydro Boost, and Eucerin. They’re all fine, but nothing amazing and not specific for winter.\n\nThe only one I found that actually looks like it’s made for winter is the Mudmasky leave-on winter mask moisturizer. It’s supposed to be a protecting moisturizer that “shields like a mask.” Haven’t tried it yet, but it’s literally the only one I found that’s made specifically for winter. Has anyone here used it yet, and does it actually do anything?\n\nWould love to hear what winter moisturizers actually work for you guys. My skin is straight up begging for help right now.",
