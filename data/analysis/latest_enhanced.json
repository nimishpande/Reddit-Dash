      "title": "Is anyone else beyond fed up with hairdressers never ever listening?",
      "content": "Or does anybody have a secret tip that gets them to listen without just being a rude and scary customer? I've tried so many hairdressers in my city, price points anywhere between 20 and 120€ per cut, and none of them seem to listen to a single word I say.\n\n\"Would it be possible to cut my hair while it's dry? It really is a lot easier to get an even cut this way.\" \"That's not how it's done, cutting wet hair is always easier!\" Okay then. I stopped trying to convince them because not a single one ever listened, not even the ones who have cut my hair before and know how long it takes to fix the unevenness they create with a wet cut.\n\n\"I want a slightly longer pixie like in this photo, so my hair should cover my ears. My curls pull up a lot when drying, so since you're cutting them wet, they need to go slightly past my chin - right where I am pointing now.\" \"Got it! \\^\\_\\^\" and the very next second I feel how they cut my hair directly at earlobe level. I will clasp my wet hair between two fingers to pull it as straight as they do with the comb, and then use my other hand to point at the exact place where the scissors or the blade would need to go, but they still always manage to miss it by at least 3 cm. Do they forget? Or do they just ignore me because they think they know better? Even though simple geometry says that to connect points A and B, a curved line needs to be longer than a straight line? Telling them that I want a bob when I actually want a pixie doesn't work because while it fixes the length problem, the general shapes of these cuts are too different.\n\n\"Do you see those two spots where my hair is a lot more curly than anywhere else? These need to be left a bit longer. If everything is cut to the same length when wet, I will basically have two large missing chunks in my lengths when dry.\" \"Okay, if you say so!\" And a few minutes afterwards, when I notice that they get close to one of the spots, I repeat \"that's one of the really curly strands I pointed out earlier, so that one should be left longer.\" And they say \"yup I remember \\^\\_\\^\" and still cut it to the exact same wet-length as everything else.\n\nI already gave up on \"could you hold the hair dryer in one place when diffusing? It breaks up the strands and gives me frizz when you kind of comb my hair with the diffuser nozzles like you're doing right now\" (\"okay!\" \\*keeps combing\\*), or \"can we use a spray bottle to get the hair a bit wet again after cutting? It helps with getting the combed hair back into structured strands\" (\"no, they will tangle if they get wet after combing!\"). I just ask them if I could diffuse them myself and I carry my own spray bottle. So that's an easy communication issue to avoid. But the other stuff is a lot harder.\n\nHow do I get them to listen? Does anyone have tips? Do I just need to be, like, really really assertive? Or interrupt them at every single strand to ask \"can you show me where you're planning to cut? No, a bit lower, please\"? I hate being a Stressful Customer :( so if anybody has tips that don't involve me becoming rude and annoying as fuck, please let me know?\n\n(The sub wants my routine to let me post, I just cowash and style with the Balea Oil Repair line from a drugstore chain in my country, really happy with how that turns out, the hairdressers are the only challenge I have left in my hair journey lmao)",

I had major acne problems on forehead and face and the marks stay, also bumps on face especially forehead are quite frequent. Also pigmentation on lips( I don't smoke) . I just want to work on the uneven skin tone and texture and the bumps on skin and tanning. Also I have combination skin type and I try to drink Coconut water a lot for skin issues but doesn't seem to help a lot.\n\nProducts: i went on the internet searching and got to know about a few creames , like \n1. Glycolic acid\n2. Tretinoin\n3. Azelaic acid\n4. Salicylic acid\n5. Kojic acid\n\nQuestions:\n1. Now I wanna know which of these should I use, how and if combining them in what way ?\n\n2. I also plan to use sunscreen, I use lakme rn, not very regular with it though, please suggest any for my skin type?\n\n3. Any other remedies to get rid of tanning and bumps and acne scar please? \n\nThanks in advance !\n",

I was scratching my scalp to get that result, so it is never actually that bad. I never have white stuff on my shoulders, but if I take a really close look in the mirror, there are little speckles of that white stuff.\n\nThe other concerning thing is that I have these red marks or scars as you can see in the second picture. I would say these are all over my head, not in centrally located clusters, but dispersed throughout. I’ve had these for years now. Even if I go months without picking at them they are there. They often form a yellow orange color like crystal that I pick off after a long time.\n\nMy scalp never particularly itches or gets irritated, but I don’t want to be gross. Not sure if anyone can tell me for sure what this is. My hair is fine and thin I think, you can see my scalp pretty easily if you manipulate my hair. Should I be following some kind of protocol for washing my hair? Thanks",

I'm chalking it up mostly to the type of sunscreen I was using (i asked my bf who never ever burns if he could research and purchase a reef-safe sunscreen as we've been snorkeling in mexico, and he showed up with spf 30 😬), but i also used that on the rest of my body and only got a little pink. \n\nto be clear, im not really looking for advice on what I did wrong/to do differently, I am just concerned as we fly back to freezing cold nyc tomorrow and the slightest touch of fabric hurts like hell. whats up with this, is there anything I can do other than icing/ibuprofen/aloe to help, and do I need to see anyone about it?\n\nive attached some photos taken with/without flash comparing my normal skin tone with tiny patches of burn from spots I missed earlier and the abomination that is on my leg. unfortunately, it is redder in person!\n\nthank you so much and apologies for the extended description.",

If I apply lip balm on top it just makes it worse, I have to fully exfoliate off as much as I can with a dry tissue or paper towel and THEN go back in with the lip balm.

I’m 18 years old 200 pounds 22% body fat barely eat sugar, barely eat at all period and when I do I’m eat vegetarian, and workout consistently and I’ve been doing so for about a year and a half (also I’m not sure if this matters but since maybe it’s a genetic thing I am Mexican). I’ve tried creams that do seem to work a little but nevertheless it remains. I was pre diabetic when I was like 15 but since then I started taking care of myself better and no longer pre diabetic (I think) I would really appreciate whatever help and advice I can get. Thank you.",

I am wondering if anyone can explain to me scientifically the discussion and recommendation of not washing the hair until 48-72 hours after a color service due to the cuticle not being “completely closed”.

In my experience, washing 24 hours after color shouldn’t affect the longevity because the color doesn’t continue processing &amp; the conditioner seals with an acidic pH. I’m confusedddd",
