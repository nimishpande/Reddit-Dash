I know I have to let it keep growing but is there anything I can do with the sides by my ears? They’re just there and annoying. They don’t curl like the rest of my hair. (It looks terrible if I push them behind my ears.) The last picture is what it looks like when I wake up - thew that one in for good measure 😊Anyway, what do I do? Do I just leave it and keep growing? I’m worried if I leave it what it will look like in a few months as it grows out. Any advice is appreciated. This process sucks.\n\nMy routine: I wash and condition with Kenra volumizing shampoo. \nProducts: I don’t use any as they weight my hair down. \nStyling: I let it air dry\nI wash my hair everyday and use a satin pillowcase to protect it while sleeping. I don’t do a refresh routine. I just rewash my hair every morning. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

The first few weeks were rough. My hair looked uneven, the texture felt unfamiliar and I honestly thought I had made a mistake. I realized I did not even know what my natural hair actually looked like.\n\nAfter a couple of months, things slowly changed. My hair started feeling softer and stronger with less breakage. The frizz did not disappear but it became more manageable. I also noticed that my natural texture started showing more definition instead of just looking “messy.”\n\nThe biggest change was not just physical  it was mental. Letting go of heat made me more patient with my hair and with myself. I stopped trying to force it into a specific look and started working with what I have. My routine is simpler now, and my hair feels healthier overall, even if it does not look “perfect” every day.\n\nI am curious **what happened when you stopped heat styling your hair or is it something you are thinking about trying?**",

      "content": "Hi skincare angels ✨\n\nI’m in my mid 30s and could really use some help building a solid AM/PM skincare routine. \n\nMy skin is prone to dry, a little red (hyperpigmentation?), and starting to show fine lines. I believe I should aim for deep hydration + fine lines and age prevention. \n\nBelow are the products I use. I’m not sure how to combine them into a solid routine that actually makes sense, or if some of them are actually working against each other. \n\nMost of my products are about to run out, that's why i decided to look for advisesz \n\nI believe i could benefit from using serums, vitamin c, azealic acid, etc: i am open to try new things out titluntil I find what truly works for my skin\n\nWhat I have right now:\n\n• Shiseido Benefiance Extra Creamy Cleansing Foam – i find this cleansing quite harsh because my skin feels extremely dry after rising it\n\n• Shiseido Expert Sun Protector (Face Cream SPF 50+) – i've been using this product for a few years now and i absolutely love it and love the texture \n\n• Eisenberg Paris Start Hydra Masque Hydra-Defense – moisturizing &amp; pollution defense mask that i use once a week. My skin feels very moisture in the next morning and thought out the day, not sure what other benefits it might bring\n\n• Shiseido Future Solution LX Concentrated Balancing Softener – hydrating/softening lotion that i don't use that much somehow !\n\n• CeraVe Blemish Control Gel (AHA + BHA) – exfoliating blemish treatment that i started last week as an attempt to decrease the redness in my cheeks \n\n• The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% in Squalane – retinol treatment that i use a few times a month \n\n• Weleda Skin Food Light – currently i use it as my main daily moisturizer. overall i like it, but some days it feels a bit too heavy and makes me sweat a little, which is new for me and quite  uncomfortable \n\nCOSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence – hydrating/repairing essence, i started this product a month ago and i absolutely love how hydrated my skin feels and would like to keep it in the routine, if it makes sense\n\nI’m wondering what I might be missing? what would you add? \n\nAny tip is very appreciated, thank you !

I have always known my hair was like a frizzy type of wavy but it has never looked remotely like this before.\n\nI sent a photo to my friend and she suggested I start a curly hair routine. Currently, I use Pantene rosewater shampoo and conditioner, and then scrunch it a bit and let it air dry. I wash with shampoo/conditioner every other day. My hair is dense and greases up easily, so I worry that heavy products like creams wouldn't work on it. Any recommendations from those with a similar hair type?\n\nThank you!",

(You may have seen my recently post in the Tretinoin group, about my fears of starting low-dose Tret for anti-aging, just bear with me.)\n\nI have always worshipped the sun. I love to kayak, hike, walk, camp, etc. I am also up at the flight levels (altitudes 18,000--40,000 feet) on the daily, for hours on end. All of that takes a huge toll on a person's skin (although I'm just genetically lucky to be mistaken for 25 quite often.) But to ME, I have aged drastically, and in 2026 I decided I am fully ready for a grown-up skin routine.  \nBut...  \n1.) I had my heart set on starting tretinoin. But EVERY thread, more than half of women say they ultimately have to stop. The flaking, itching, even horrible comedogenic acne that Tret suddenly started for them, never went away, or lasted for 8 months or more. (I know, I know, Retinization is a process.) But with my life (not just my hobbies, but things I can't avoid, like working up at altitude!) I'm beginning to think Tret will be impossible for me.\n\n2.) Next option: Okay, Tret isn't for me? I'm not hard up for money, so how about a lifetime of laser resurfacing? That would be easy and supposedly has powerful anti-aging effects? Well, apparently it leaves many people disfigured, skin permanently damaged, even brain damaged as it can damage nerves. There are entire support groups for it. It's NOT uncommon.\n\n3.) Microneedling has to work, right? Sorry again; there are also entire groups of people whose skin has been permanently damaged by microneedling. It killed the fat in their faces and left their skin sagging permanently, along with 'orange peel' skin and a host of other horrors.\n\nThese are not people who went to sketchy Mexican dermal clinics either. These groups are full of women who went to experienced, reputable providers for lasers and needling.\n\nI'M AT A LOSS. I want a routine that yields REAL, dramatic results over the next 20 years. But I guess I could just use a low-grade retinol from the drugstore and some good Korean sunscreen forever, and pray my face holds up into my 40s. But this is killing me. Choose your goblet and hope it's not poison, is what this feels like. Is there any hope? Regular Microdermabrasion maybe? But I've heard that even weakens your skin over time. Botox and good sunscreen?\n\nSincerely, a sad pilot.",

It doesn’t hurt, not sure it’s a skin tag as i’m able to clip it off at times but it just grows back always. It’s also not a wart. I’ve had this ball of skin attached for years. I used to play competitive sports so maybe it’s from those tighter shoes, but nothing I do seems to help it long-term wise. I’ve tried exfoliating, using those callus remover scrub things, nothing…\n\nThen, on one of my smaller toes there’s the dark red nail. I wore boots I didn’t break in, in October - spent the whole day (AM - PM) walking around in them (not smart, i know). Next morning, woke up to pain in that toe and it looked like my toe nail was about to fall off. Kind of wish it did, instead it stayed there crooked and bent, and now it looks like another/new nail has grown underneath it. I’ve tried to bring down the darkness as well, not sure if it’s blood or bruising, or simply just a dead nail, but I’ve tried deep cleaning it, trimming it a bit and cleaning it, nothing helps. (I can provide a closer up picture if needed)\n\nLastly, on my pinky toe, there’s that big buildup of dead skin?? Also have had this callus/glob of dead skin for over a year now. Nothing helps either, trimming off the dead skin, exfoliating, using that callus stone, etc. Doesn’t hurt, but is very very thick to the touch. Think it’s dry from the cold weather, but it doesn’t seem to absorb lotion/moisturizer that well either.\n\nNot sure if my shoes contribute to any of these problems, but I wear socks consistently, pretty much alternate between many pairs of shoes throughout the week. Maybe a fungus thing, not sure. Just wanna see if anyone out there is able to help me out, give me some advice if they’ve had similar issues, any at home remedies, if anyone thinks I should go to the podiatrist or my dermatologist - just sick and tired of these long term issues. Literally any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

      "content": "Skin type : I have combination skin depending on the weather and the season, leaning towards oily, dry to normal in winters, I have pcos related cystic acne from time to time especially around my periods, and when I eat trash for a substantial period of time and don't manage my sugar and drink milk.\n\nProduct price : Sebamed clear face care gel details for about 450-560 rupees, I have not checked individual websites but I get it wherever I can get it for the cheapest.\n\nReview : the product is 5.5 ph and is targeted for people with sensitive skin and contains no fragrance or oils.\n\nI apply it when my face is still 30-40% wet, and it goes on smooth, it is calming on my skin and doesn't feel greasy when it goes on. I've realised from many years of using skincare that the less I do the better it is for me, and so most of the days I only use a moisturizer and sunscreen after washing my face (during the day) and just moisturizer at night (with spot treatment if I have a pimple). I try to be very gentle with washing my face too and try not to strip my skin dry as that leads to my skin reddening and becoming sensitive over time.\n\nThis is my 5-6th tube of this moisturizer and in the box there's another tube and I will forever use it unless I find an identical replacement that costs me a little bit less (open to suggestions please tell me if you have any), it does it's job and calms my skin as a plus, that's all I apparently need from a moisturizer, most of my skin conditions are cause by hormonal conditions or how my skin reacts to humidity and dryness in the air, so topical stuff can only do so much. Most of the moisturizers I have had apart from this one have never worked for me and I'd rather not use one than use one that just clogs my pores.\n\nSo if you have sensitive skin this is probably a safe choice.\n\nWRP",

      "content": "Hello everyone, hope all is well. Im coming here bc honestly? I'm at my wits end and Icould really use some advice.\n\nBwfore i ask anything, i want to know, do i have hyperpigmentation? I don't think this is what its classified as, but then again , im not a dermatologist.\n\nOkay, so I’ve been struggling with dark spots, blemishes, and overall darkness around my jawline, chin, under my jaw, and where my sideburns would normally grow since I was 13, im 17 now and I’ve tried numerous things to clear my skin, and nothing seems to actually help my skin up and get it all the same texture and color.\n\nI shave pretty often because I really hate the feeling of facial hair. My routine is usually trimming the hair short with trimmers, then going over it with a foil shaver to remove the stubble. I do this almost every day or every other day since my hair grows back really fast. Tbh, I'm starting to think shaving is making things worse, but not shaving isn’t really an option for me.\n\nSo what i basically want to know is; What actually helps get rid of dark spots and blemishes related to excessive shaving? Especially on the jawline and chin area?\n\nSome products ive tried are turmeric soap, African black soap, and numerous different cleansers. Some helped temporarily or made my skin feel clean, but none of them have actually cleared up the dark spots or prevented new blemishes from forming.\n\nAlso, I've been thinking about ordering tretinoin because I’ve heard it can help with hyperpigmentation and blemishes, but I don’t want to jump into it blindly if there are better options or things I should try first.\n\nIf anyone has experienced this or has knowledge on something that could finally help my clear my skin up, I would be so thankful to you. Thank you!",

It started on my forehead and around my nose, and now it’s on my chin and around my mouth.\n\nI’m traveling, so several things changed at once: very dry indoor air (heater + AC), worse sleep, heavier moisturizing (Cetaphil + occasional Vaseline), and one new product (Torriden Dive In serum). I also had a 6-hour Korean digital perm a few days ago—lots of time in dry heat and exposure to strong chemical fumes (nothing touched my face directly).\n\nMy skin is normally stable, not acne-prone, and low-maintenance. This texture is new for me. The bumps aren’t very red, but I can feel them spreading, and moisturizing + humidifier haven’t helped.\n\nThis feels more like irritation or a reaction than dehydration (similar to how my face reacts if it gets exposed to bug spray).\n\nWhat should I do next? Is this contact dermatitis, fungal acne, or something else?\n\nPLEASE HELP 😭",
