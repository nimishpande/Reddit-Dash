      "title": "Before &amp; After Cutting Length and Dyeing My Hair",
      "content": "Hi! I’m sharing my current curly hair routine and would love any feedback.\n\nHair &amp; Background:\n\nI have medium-density curly hair. I recently cut my hair from mid-back length to a medium length (just above the trapezius/collarbone area) and also had it professionally dyed. I don’t chemically straighten my hair.\n\nWash Schedule:\n\nI wash my hair every 2–3 days. Between washes, I thoroughly rinse my hair with water only.\n\nCleanse:\n\nOn wash days, I start by rinsing my hair thoroughly with water. I then use VIONA 2% ketoconazole shampoo, applying it mainly to my scalp, letting it sit briefly, and rinsing thoroughly. About once a month, I use AG Care Balance &amp; Boost Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo instead.\n\nCondition &amp; Treatments:\n\nAfter shampooing, I condition with SheaMoisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Shine Conditioner, applying it to mid-lengths and ends and rinsing it out fully. Every 1–2 weeks, I use AG Care Nourish Snow Mushroom Moisture Mask in place of regular conditioner, leaving it on for a few minutes before rinsing. About once a month, I also use AG Care Balance &amp; Boost Apple Cider Vinegar Conditioner.\n\nLeave-In &amp; Styling:\n\nImmediately after turning off the shower, while my hair is still very damp, I apply my leave-in and styling products. First, I use AG Care Fast Food Leave-On Conditioner (about a half baby-carrot sized amount), scrunching it into my hair and up toward the roots. Then I apply AG Care Re:coil Curl Activator, using about 1–2 pea-sized amounts, and scrunch again.\n\nDrying:\n\nI diffuse my hair, spending time diffusing all the way down to the scalp to maximize curl definition and spring.\n\nSleep Routine:\n\nI sleep on a silk pillowcase. I used to sleep with a silk bonnet, but found it compressed my curls too much overnight. Since my hair is shorter now, the pillowcase alone has been working better for preserving curl shape.\n\nNotes:\n\nSince cutting my hair shorter, my curls feel noticeably bouncier, springier, and more alive. My hair is much easier to manage and control at this length, and my curl pattern really shows up better overall. I’m really happy with how light and healthy it feels now.\n\nOpen to any routine feedback or styling suggestions. Thanks!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I’ve had Nexplanon in the past and it did the same thing to me. Just a lot of hormonal forehead and chin acne that’s constantly there. Without BC, I don’t normally have acne issues, only a few pimples on my period.\n\nMy current routine that’s always kept my skin clear but isn’t the best because idk what to use-\n\nWipe all over my face with a wet cotton round and then moisturize all over, once in the morning and once at night.\n\nI feel like I should be using a cleanser, maybe a toner, a different moisturizer, etc. but I’m not sure what to use because there’s so many products out there. But now I really need a better routine with this new acne.\n\nMy skin type is combination but mostly it’s oily, especially in my t zone, and dry cheeks and dry areas around my lips. It’s also pretty sensitive, gets clogged easily, and gets irritated from new products(hence my current simple routine).\n\nAny advice or recommendations welcome, thanks!\n\nEdit: after looking through this sub, I’m going to buy Beauty of Joseon dynasty cream, green plum toner, and green plum cleansing gel, and possibly try adapalene gel on my forehead where my most acne is.

I've been getting some new growth in (not that I need it) because I'm starting to go grey, so my hair is changing over (mid 30s). I think this is contributing. \n\nSo, I'm looking for hair gloss recommendations! I saw Redken has the bond inside and crystal clear gloss, but for those with more experience than me - what are your tried and trues?\n\nRoutine\n\n\\- Shampoo: Biolage Ultra hydrating (not every shower - but when my hair needs a reset - my hair is very dry).\n\n\\- Conditioner: Paul Mitchell Deep Moisture conditioner (my hair really inhales this one in)\n\n\\- Leave Ins (light to heavy): Paul Mitchell One Conditioner, As I am Curl Cream, Pattern Gel.\n\n\\- Deep Condition: Shea Butter/Aloe/Vitamin E\n\n\\- I sleep with it up in a pineapple with a satin/silk scrunch. sometimes I wrap it in a scarf too.\n\nAny and all advice appreciated!

      "title": "[Routine Help] PH Deep Dive and if my Routine is good or bad for 40 yo acne prone skin",
      "content": "Happy weekend everyone!\n\nI went down the rabbit hole a little bit on pH and  products and order to use products, etc. I'm 40 and I have oily skin that is still pretty susceptible to breakouts, especially around my chin. I used to have a lot of closed comedones, but I added a retinol product a few months ago that has helped.\n\nAnyways, one of the posts I read from this group linked a blog post about pH. It was super informative. One thing that stood out to me was that if you're acne prone, your pH is generally going to be higher, which allows more bacterium to remain on your skin and cause more breakouts. Here is my current routine:\n\nAM:\n\nCleanser- Cerave Acne Control Cleanser (can't find the pH of this one)\n\nAHA/BHA- Nassif MD Detox Pads (between 3-4 ph)\n\nCosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (6.5 to 7.5 pH, but saw some posts of people saying they used test strips and got it at 5.5)\n\nHero Dark Spot Correct Vitamin C Serum (4.5-5.5 ph)\n\nAir Repair Complexion Boosting Moisturizer\n\nHero ForceField Sunscreen SPF30\n\nPM:\n\nCeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser (5.5 pH)\n\nThe Ordinary Retinol 1% in Squalene\n\nAir Repair Complexion Boosting Moisturizer\n\nWhen I added the retinol in, I started with the 0.5% in Squalene one and used that for about two months before switching to the 1%. I was a little dry in the beginning, but now it's going well.\n\nI added the Hero Dark Spot Correct a little over a month ago and that's the only recent new thing, I think it's been helping. I've only been putting it on the areas I have dark, acne scars, but those areas tend to be repeat offenders for breakouts. But since using it, (fingers crossed) breakouts have been less. Prior to starting this, I was using The Ordinary Azelaic Acid in the AM, but so far I'm seeing better results with the Hero product.\n\nAlso found in what I read today that I should be waiting 30 min after applying some products, which is not ideal for my ADHD. I generally wait for each product to dry on my skin before adding the next.\n\nSo my question is, would it potentially be beneficial to try something like Cosrx Low PH Good Morning Gel cleanser, or another low PH cleanser? Or is there something else in my routine I should remove or add? I'm so tired of being 40 and still breaking out!",
