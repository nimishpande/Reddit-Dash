It either makes my face an oil slick within hours\n\n2. Or it disappears from my face like it was never there within ten minutes\n\nI mean, what's going on? I just want my skin to feel calm, bouncy, healthy, not sticky and definitely not matte like I'm hiding under makeup. Especially here in Indian humidity, the struggle is real. \n\nBut here's the weird thing: \n\nThis layering approach feels like it's working. the lightweight gel in the morning? No midday meltdown so far. The night cream? My skin woke up calmer than usual. Could be a fluke, could be magic. I'm leaning toward the latter. \n\nSo, fellow skin-warriors battling humidity, sweat and pollution, what's your holy grail for staying hydrated without looking glazed? \n\nDrop your faves, texture tips, application hacks, let's nerd out together.   \n",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

Ended up waiting a few days and attempted to bleach again (both times were 20 vol for about 30-40 minutes) which did come out a little bit more even (last pic) and then covered with 5A semi permanent dye. I left it on my roots longer to attempt a root smudge but my natural hair is almost like black so I probably needed to do that with a darker dye. \nThe goal here is to have some blonde highlights, obviously not gonna get super light with all the dye that has now gone on them. Wanting to attempt another shot at highlighting with a 10 volume and maybe just toner afterwards but unsure if I should color strip my whole head now or should I just hope some comes out as I wash my hair?? In some lightings it looks kinda good, in others it looks really uneven so I’m just up for any suggestions. \n\nAlso how can you tell if your hair is okay to bleach again? I didn’t have any breakage but it was pretty dry afterwards. I do plan on waiting a few weeks before trying again and using olaplex, hair oils and hair masks in the meantime.\n\nDisclaimer: I’m aware I am not a professional, the salon is not financially accessible to me right now and in the end it’s just hair. If I fuck it up it’ll grow back. ",

Only have a breakout when I have coffee after like several months (idk if it's the coffee or the hot milk) \n\n\nMy skin looks okay-ish and less red throughout the day. It's only after I do my night skincare, I face this redness. Looks fairly good and 'clear' in the morning. My skin is also dull.

My hair doesnt really get oily but having a dirty scalp makes me feel so icky.. BUT If I wash it too early my hair might get damaged??😭😭 Idk anymore. \n\n\nWhen do you wash your hair and why do you wash it that often?\n\n\nI have 2c-3b, very high porosity, medium thick hair.\n\nMy routine:\n1. Wash day\n\n-Cantu shampoo\n\n-Cantu hair mask + cantu avocado \nconditioner + shea moisture jamaican conditioner \n(yeah its a lot lol, but its the moisture my hair needs)\n\n-cantu leave-in\n\n-cantu avocado curl activator\n\n-cantu curl mousse\n\n-aussie instant freeze gel\n\n2.

      "content": "I’m looking for a good *night cream* for my dry, rosacea-prone skin. I have redness mainly on my cheeks — it’s not super severe or acne-related, just a constant flush that never really goes away. My skin is also on the dry side, and I’ll admit... I’m *terrible* at remembering to moisturize in the morning (I’m always running late 😅), so I want a good, calming moisturizer for nighttime.\n\nFor context:\n\n* I used to use **Eucerin Redness Relief**, and I really liked it! It didn’t make the redness disappear completely, but it was super soothing and reduced redness slightly. However, this product has been discontinued.\n* Lately, I’ve been using the **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer** — it’s great for hydration (I even keep it in the fridge for extra soothing), but it doesn’t seem to help much with redness.\n\nProducts I’ve *already tried* that didn’t work for me:\n\n* **Cetaphil Redness Relief** → burned my skin 🥲\n* **Peach Slices Redness Relief Calming Cream** → no noticeable improvement of redness\n* **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream** → didn’t help the redness; felt like I had to use a ton of product to moisturize my face\n* **Aveeno Calm + Restore Redness Relief** → also didn’t do much for redness / dryness\n* **Cocokind Polypeptide Cream** → hated the texture (felt weird/sticky) and it did nothing for redness\n\nI’ve heard good things about **Marin Soothing Hydration Cream**, but I’m not sure if it’s too heavy since it looks like it’s meant for *really* dry, cracked skin. I’ve also heard **Avene** has some great options, but the price point is a little high (like $38 for 1.3 oz 😬). I know there’s **Avene XeraCalm**, which is a better deal for the size (6+ oz for the same price), but that’s more of a body lotion (though I have heard it could work for the face too).\n\nI’m open to other suggestions as well — ideally something *soothing and hydrating* that helps reduce redness. My budget is around **$40 or less** (as I am in grad school), but I don’t mind spending that much if it comes with more product or actually works.\n\nThanks in advance for any recs! ❤️\n\n  \n",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am 20M, I’ve been struggling with combination skin plus seborrheic dermatitis for a while now. My skin often looks dull and tired, and it feels like it’s lost its glow, plumpness, and elasticity. I’m just starting out with skincare and honestly don’t want to overwhelm myself with too many products or spend a fortune.\n\nRight now, I’m thinking of getting a gentle cleanser (something that won’t irritate my dermatitis), a serum (not sure whether I should go with niacinamide for calming inflammation and oil control or vitamin C for brightening and elasticity), a lightweight moisturizer, and a good sunscreen that won’t make my skin greasy or irritated.\n\nMy budget is about ₹1200 max for the essentials. I’ve been looking at some Minimalist products (seen my good minimalist reviews here)  but still confused about what to prioritize, especially the serums.\n\nIf anyone has similar skin issues or has suggestions for effective, beginner-friendly products that won’t break the bank, I’d really appreciate your input. Also, any tips on how to introduce these products without messing up my skin would be awesome.\n\nThanks so much!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
