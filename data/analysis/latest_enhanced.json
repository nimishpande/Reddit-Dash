      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "title": "[acne] Painful breakouts still at 3 months on Adapalene… help :(",
      "content": "I’m honestly at my breaking point with acne. It may not seem that bad but I’ve always had clear skin my entire life so this has been a really depressing 6 months now.\n\nputting this at the top — i cannot afford a dermatologist appointment so pls don’t recommend that. I would love to but it’s just not an option.\n\nAround 6 months ago, I had perfectly clear skin. I don’t know why I wanted to do anything to it but I kept seeing the Anua cleansing oil on TikTok and wanted to try. I used it for 1 week and immediately got closed comedones all over my chin area, some on my forehead, and some everywhere else. I’d never had texture like this ever in my life. I thought I did the double cleansing process completely by the book but I must’ve been wrong. (pic 1 for reference of the CCs)\n\nAt first I didn’t know what to do because I was never really a skincare girly. I used makeup wipes my whole life and only properly washed my face in the shower. Only had an occasional pimple here and there. So I switched my cleanser to the Vanicream one and tried incorporating a salicylic acid toner a few days of the week. Nothing budged at all. The bumps on my face now just felt like sandpaper.\n\nI have OCD so this really sent me into a spiral of not being able to control my face. I started using the Neutrogena Adapalene 0.1% 3 months into dealing with the CCs. I was slow and patient and worked my way up to finally trying to use it every other day. The purge around 2 months was absolutely horrendous. I actually couldn’t find many people on here or anywhere on the internet that purged like I did. All the clogged pores turned into painful inflamed cystic bumps that took soooo long to go away. I have never been more insecure and depressed in my entire life. I didn’t go anywhere for the first two months without makeup, and really I still don’t.\n\nSo recently a couple weeks ago I thought my acne was finally clearing up. I started incorporating 5% benzoyl peroxide wash on the days I didn’t use adapalene just to try to get rid of the inflammed acne. My texture was almost completely gone, all the CCs purged out. I have a lot of scarring from the purging and that too was starting to go away. I was so so happy. Then last week I got 3 cystic pimples all around the same spot on my right cheek area. Mind you, every time I get a pimple now they’re deep, inflamed, take forever to go away. I thought maybe the BP dried my skin out along with the adapalene so I stopped using it and that seemed to help. I got them to heal over this past week and starting to flatten. Even though the PIE is very red and prominent at least the painful under the skin pimples were no longer painful and starting to go away. I was sad because my face looked really good a week ago.\n\nHow fast forward to a couple nights ago — used adapalene again (using the sandwich method) and wake up with 2 more cystic pimples in the same spot. I have almost a perfect line of acne down my cheek to my chin. I feel so defeated… I felt like I was almost in the clear.\n\nTo be quite honest I feel like I’m at my breaking point. I’m so sad over it all the time. I feel like I’m now obsessed with how my face looks. I don’t want to go anywhere or do anything. I am desperate for advice. I’m really wanting to stop the Adapalene because I’ve noticed the longer I go without using it, the faster my face seems to be clearing up. But it helped so so much with my texture that I’m afraid of reverting back all the good it’s done. I just don’t know if I should stop or continue. It’ll be 3 months on the 19th. :(\n\nhere’s the products I use and have used regularly this 3 months:\n\nMorning:\n\n•\t⁠double cleanse with the Garnier micellar water if my face is especially greasy\n•\t⁠wash with Vanicream face wash for 1 minute every time\n•\t⁠I was using Good Molecules Hyaluronic acid every time after dampening my face but I ran out a week ago\n•\t⁠Bubble Cloud Surf moisturizer\n\nNight:\n\nbasically same routine as the morning except every other day I apply the adapalene to a dry face, wait 15 minutes, and then apply the moisturizer.\n\nI also use the micellar water as my makeup remover if I wear any.\n\nI also have a suspicion that maybe one of my makeup products is causing the acne but I never have ever had a problem using anything and having it break me out? but idk I guess I have different skin now. :/\n\nI also change my pillowcases very frequently. I use paper towels to dry my face. Like I said I am hyper obsessed with getting rid of my acne so I try to do everything right. I’m so beyond tired. 😔",

      "title": "My 5th Hair Transplant at 35 — When I Thought I Had No Donor Left. Hope for Anyone Thinking It’s ‘Impossible’",
      "content": "\nHey everyone,\nI never thought I’d be writing this, but here I am—sharing my journey after completing my 5th hair transplant. Yes, you read that right. Five surgeries. And honestly, this one has been the most challenging, the most technical, and the most emotionally overwhelming of them all.\n\nMy name’s Mr. Niko, and my hair transplant journey started way back when I was 25 years old. Like many guys, early hair loss hit me hard. I had my first surgery at 25. Then life moved on… and so did my hair loss.\n\nI ended up getting 3 surgeries at Gurugram, Delhi over the years.\nMy 2nd and 3rd surgeries ( 2018 and 2019) were actually led by Dr. Abhinav Kumar (back when he was there), and both included scalp + beard graft extraction. Those surgeries genuinely improved my situation and gave me hope.\n\nBut by the time I hit 35, I knew I needed one final correction. My scalp and beard donors were exhausted, and the pattern of loss over the years had expanded again—especially around the crown rim and mid-scalp.\n\nI honestly thought I didn’t have enough donor left for anything meaningful.\n\nStill, I trusted the process, tracked down Dr. Abhinav at Patna online (because of the good experience I previously had), and travelled to Patna from London for what would become my last and final repair surgery.\n\n\n---\n\nWhy This Surgery Was So Difficult\n\nThis wasn’t a typical transplant. The goals were complex:\n\nMake the scalp donor look uniform so I can undergo Scalp Micropigmentation later.\n\nUse scalp and beard grafts strategically to cover the expanded rim around the crown.\n\nSlight enhancement of my hairline to make it more artistic and natural.\n\nRefinement of the temporal triangles (which were previously not perfect because of angle changes and not good experience at Eugenix in 2021 when Dr Abhinav was not there).\n\nRestore mid-scalp density, which had reduced over the last decade.\n\n\nSince my scalp and beard donors were nearly tapped out, the clinic also used 1,200 chest grafts to fill the mid-scalp and boost density.\n\n\n---\n\nTotal Grafts Implanted\n\nApproximately 3000 grafts:\n\nScalp: 1510\n\nBeard: 400\n\nChest: 1100\n\n\nI never thought chest hair would be part of my restoration journey… but here we are. And honestly? Totally worth it.\n\n\n---\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nI can’t explain how relieved and genuinely happy I am with the results. The hairline looks artistic now, the crown blends far better, and my donor zones finally look uniform enough for SMP in the future.\n\nI’m sharing my results here for two reasons:\n\n1. To give hope to anyone who thinks a 5th hair transplant is “impossible.” It’s not.\n\n\n2. To acknowledge that all my previous surgeries except the first one were good. Each of them helped me. But over time, hair loss progresses, density changes, and sometimes you need that final corrective push.\n\n\n\nI’m grateful I found the same doctor who operated on me in my 2nd and 3rd surgeries. This final correction in Patna genuinely feels like closure after 10 years.\n\nIf anyone out there thinks they’re “out of donor,” or “out of options,” trust me—you might not be.\n\nHappy to answer questions.\nAnd to anyone still fighting: don’t lose hope.",

      "content": "In the Midwestern US right now there have been lots of humidity fluctuations- like one day it’s 30% humidity outside and then the next it’s raining and 90% humidity. It’s been messing up my hair because of that. For reference, I have medium textured, medium density, 2C-3A, low porosity curls. \n\nIn the summer it’s almost always humid and I’ve found that I can use lighter conditioners, non-conditioning or even drying hold products, and my hair holds and feels soft enough for multiple days. If it’s high enough humidity I can even spray on hairspray and it will help with hold but my hair won’t feel dry or mat up with it. \n\nAs there’s been more days with low humidity, I’ve noticed my hair feeling dryer so Ive been wanting to use heavier conditioners and more moisturizing products that typically would soften my hair up too much and decrease its hold in the humid weather. But then a day or two after washing, it’ll be raining with 85% humidity and my hair will be grow so frizzy and poofy. If I style with lighter weight products in anticipation of a humid day, I notice my hair feels dry and brittle until that humid day and I get worried about hair breakage. Not to even mention using hairspray on a dry day- my hair just mats up and feels horrible. \n\nI typically wash every other day to every four days just depending on how my scalp feels (it gets pretty oily or dry depending on what I’m doing) and I would love to be able to style my hair to last for multiple days regardless of changes in the weather. Do yall have any suggestions or advice on what I could use to help my hair last this season?\n\n————————————————————————\nRoutine (summer routine as I haven’t quite found a fall/winter one that works well enough yet.)\n- Shampoo with Dove Clarifying Scalp Shampoo 2 times\n- Condition with Garnier Hair Filler Strength \n- Skip any leave ins or cream as my hair is typically conditioned enough\n- On wet hair, rake through either NYM Curl Sculpting Gel or Herbal Essences Totally Twisted mousse (both work really well for me)\n- hover diffuse dry\n- scrunch out the scrunch with the Verb Ghost Oil\n- when I want extra hold, I use some L’Oréal Elnett Hairspray",

Any tips?\n\nWhy I suspect acne mechanica:\n\n\\- the timing of the acne lines up with when I started riding my bike/using my helmet more frequently\n\n\\- I don't think it's bacterial, because disinfecting my helmet has made no difference\n\n\\- I don't think it's based on anything in my routine, because paring down to bare bones has made no difference\n\n\\- I have struggled with hormonal acne in the past, but this feels different because (1) my past hormonal acne has been basically all on my chin, I've never had jaw issues and (2) my hormonal acne typically involves fewer, larger pimples that eventually come to a head - this is a greater quantity of smaller pimples that feel very much under the skin and never come to a head.\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated !\n\n  \n",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my honest experience with Mercure Istanbul Clinics, I know how difficult it is to choose the right place. I was completely bald maybe for 95% and I didnt expect it would ever get like this again. I used finasteride and minoxidil for more then a year but it didnt work.\n\nI am really happy that I have done it and also happy that I went to this clinic, if I see some hair transplant results here from hair mills and everything… I can absolutely recommend them, they did a good job and they were/are always very helpful. And before the transplant I really didnt tought it will be like this again. I am so happy.\n\nMy first hair transplant was with Dr. Carman more then a year ago, and my second with Dr. Bandirmali who did the fue channel all themself, taking grafts out were done by technicians, doctors are all day with you, and just with you, they do just a few patients per day and that was also the main reason I went them. Their price is also reasonable/avarage without being a hair mill.\n\nThe doctors were very serious and focused on their work, and the team around them are also really caring and very helpful. They really want the best for you, I can highly recommend them and I am very thankful. Beside English they have also Dutch support and translators which was more comfortable for me from the Netherlands.\n\nAfter the treatment they check daily the first days for the aftercare and also the months after they keep contacting you, they follow the growth month by month. That felt really helpful especially with the first transplant in the first days.\n\nI had two sessions in total. The first was 4575 grafts for the hairline and top. The second session was 3500 grafts for the crown. I am very happy with the end result of the first hair transplant after now more then a year, the second transplant I’m at month 10 now, and also the crown is starting to thicken up.",
