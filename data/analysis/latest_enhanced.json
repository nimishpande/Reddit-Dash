      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

My roommate always threads her face and eyebrows.  Dyes her eyebrows and waxes and shaves regularly. I grew up in a house where my elder had no hair growth on her body or face and my mom is toooo pretty for these things. Same with her as well no hair growth. But me. I'm complete opposite. I have v uneven eye brows. Alot of face hair and body hair.  The problem is because my mom and my sister never did any sort of such things.  I never learned. But now that I'm living among other girls I finally see that wow I have been living like a man.  \nBut Idk where to start. I have alot of acne scars.  I'm scared that if I wax my face and eye brows it will idk come back worst.  I got the Braun trimmer something for my facial hair but idk I feel extremely weird using it.  Idk if I should dye my eyebrows or wax my hands too. I feel idk.  Out of place.  Idk how to adapt to these things. And when I ask my mom about it she makes it a big deal honestly.\nSo I turned to the random mom's of the internet. What do you think I should do. Or start with. I want honest replies please.

      "content": "\nI (23F) have had reoccurring acne on my chin for more than two months now. I usually have some acne here and there, but this has just not gone away for quite some time, which is abnormal for me. The pimples that have been popping up have mostly been very large or a lot in one area at once. I also am prone to getting keratin plugs and sebaceous filaments around my chin and lips, which I am unsure of how to get rid of (any suggestions?). In the second picture you can see the blemishes left over from recent acne going away. \n\nI usually struggle a LOT with picking at my skin, especially those plugs/ filaments, which I had assumed is why my acne had gotten intense, but I've been very good about leaving it alone and just sticking to my skincare routine, and even so, it has been very very hard to get my skin to calm down. This has me wondering if my skincare routine is too harsh, and what I need to change about my routine to decrease my acne and clogged pores. \n\nAM:\n-splash of water\n-occasional Proactiv Emergency Blemish Relief on acne \n -occasional thin layer of lotion if skin is dry\n\nPM:\n-Cetaphil exfoliating SA cleanser\n-Proactiv toner (glycolic acid, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, witch hazel, etc.)\n-Proactiv Emergency Blemish Relief on acne\n-If acne is ready, hydrocolloid patch overnight\n-Occasional thin layer of lotion if skin is dry\n\nI feel like I am overdoing it with the exfoliating ingredients, but I don't know how else to handle these breakouts. I don't typically break out this much for this long, but clearly something isn't working. I don't really know much about skincare products or what my skin needs the most (dry skin, but occasionally oily on forehead and chin), and I don't have a fortune to spend on skincare, but any advice on what to change will be much appreciated.  \n",

I'm 25, and for basically my whole life I was sure I had straight hair, just frizzy and puffy because I didn't use the right products. I noticed that, when short, they were straight and manageable, but started to get puffy and frizzy as soon as they grew longer. So I just kept it short. Now I want to make them grow, and I did some research on haircare to learn how to manage them, and I think they're not straight at all. What's your opinion? What type do you think they are? And do you have any advice on how to manage them? The pics show both the short and long version, the latter being the most recent one. I don't really have a routine, I use a shampoo and conditioner specifically formulated for me from Shampora, and random masks once in a while. In the pics they're not diffused or anything, just straight hair drying.\nThank you",

      "content": "Hello! I have recently started getting more serious about my skin because I’m 23 and tired of having acne like a teen. I have mostly hormonal acne and blackheads/general skin unevenness. Here is what my dermatologist recommended for me (and the products I own):\n\n1.\t⁠PanOxyl 10% BPO foaming cleanser\n2.\t⁠A glycolic acid foaming cleanser\n3.\t⁠The Ordinary 10% azelaic acid cream\n4.\t⁠0.025% generic tretinoin\n5.\t⁠VaniCream sensitive skin moisturizer\n6.\t⁠LaRoche-Posay Lipikar triple repair moisturizing cream\n7.\t⁠CeraVe tinted mineral sunscreen 30SPF\n8.\t⁠CosRX sunscreen 50SPF\n9.\t⁠A 100mg spironolactone Rx that I use on my periods\n\nI alternate between the sunscreens and moisturizers because I already had a lot of one brand and didn’t want to just throw it away before switching to the other one. Once I’m out of old stock, I will use the CeraVe tinted sunscreen only. The vanicream moisturizer I use mostly in the mornings for lighter coverage, and the lipikar one is used with the tretinoin because it’s a bit heavier.\n\nSo, I’m a little bit confused on when and how often I should use all these products together. I was told to use the glycolic cleanser in the mornings followed by a vitamin C serum (which i haven’t bought yet because they’re expensive) and the azelaic acid, then moisturize + SPF. And I was told to use the BPO cleanser at night followed by tretinoin + moisturizer. Dr. Google told me, though, that BPO can counteract tretinoin and make both products less effective. So should I alternate nights between using these products instead of using them daily together (and use a generic facial cleanser on the nights I use tretinoin)? Or should I use them on the same nights but wait 10 minutes or so before applying the tretinoin after using the BPO wash? Any insight would help, thank you!",

Currently growing my hair out post-cancer.\n\nMy routine:\n- Shampoo &amp; conditioner is Ouidad Climate Control (I also use the V05 Kiwi maybe once per week for clarifying)\n- After shower, I use a wide tooth comb to comb out\n- I alternate between the Ouidad moisture lock gel and the Eco Style olive oil gel (trying to find the protein-moisture balance)\n- I use a bit of the AG mousse gel, as well\n- Diffuse and scrunch out with Ouidad CC foam\n\nWhen I put gel in, I usually flip my head over and rake the gel through, then scrunch it up. I used to plop with an old tshirt, but I realize that knocked out the gel, so I typically just use the tshirt to scrunch my hair up a bit after using gel.\n\nI rarely get a cast, and usually need to use some hairspray to keep my hair in place. Should I be applying gel differently, or something else?\n",

I’m a former cosmetologist who specialized in curl and wave styling, it’s genuinely some of my favorite things to do. recently, my partner had me cut their hair up to her shoulders for the first time in years, and the waves we’ve suspected were there are starting to show through. her hair is INSANELY thick, like she could keep her phone under it while showering and it would be fine. we figured their previous length weighed down the waves too much to have much of a shape, but her new short hair has let them peak through a bit more especially when wet. they’ve been experimenting with scrunching and styling in the shower, but any waves they create are gone by about noon because of the density and weight of her hair.\n\nI know she is generally very low maintenance when it come to hair, and doenst really know where to start, so next weekend I’m planning on styling their hair wavy for the first time so she can see what’s possible (and I can figure out what works if they want it again). Does any one have product recommendations for 2b/2c hair that will hold without weighing down her already heavy hair?\n\nTL;DR, my partners hair is too heavy to hold waves, product recommendations? (specifically gel/serums/curl creams and maybe some leave in conditioners)\n\nObviously I don’t have a routine laid out quite yet, but it’s required to post so here’s what I have so far: I’m not sure what shampoo/conditioner they normally use but I’ll be bringing one thats curl friendly (sulfate and silicone free!) as well as an argan oil hair mask that has always left my hair extremely moisturized. I might also attempt to add some Not your mothers sea salt spray if anyone thinks that might help, and I already own Eco gel for my own hair if you guys dont think that will weigh things down. I will be diffusing instead of air drying at they HATE the feeling of wet hair, especially on their neck.",

I don’t have active acne, but my skin definitely doesn’t look healthy and I want to give as much detail as possible about my face.\n\n* Noticeable redness around my cheeks and a few small marks that look like healed pimples.\n* Old acne scars  some small pits or uneven spots on both cheeks.\n* Overall uneven tone and skin texture, and visible pores, especially around the cheek and nose area.\n* A few brownish dark spots or slight discolorations from old breakouts.\n\nI’m not sure what kind of skincare routine. I currently don’t have any, so I’m open to starting from scratch. I’d say my skin is not very sensitive, but I’m not sure how strong it is either. I think I have an oily center face (nose, chin and inner cheeks) while the outer face is kind of dry (sides of cheeks and neck).\n\nI did a bit of basic research and made the list below, but as I said I don’t know much and I’m open to all suggestions. I would really appreciate specific product recommendations since I’m not familiar with the market.\n\nWhen Wake Up:\n\n* Cleanser\n* Niacinamide Serum or Hyaluronic Acid ?\n* Moisturiser\n* Sunscreen \n\nBefore Bed:\n\n* Cleanser\n* Azelaic Acid or BHA or Retinoid-based stuff ?\n\nAbout tret/retinoid products: I did basic research and found it might be better to start with non-prescription options first so I don’t harm my skin. I’m thinking of trying Avène Cleanance Comedomed Peeling Intensiv Anti-Pickel Akutpflege.\n\nI live in Germany and I can buy via online. Also I’m open to prescription medication, but I don’t want professional dermatologist procedures like laser treatments or needles. What would you recommend to me?\n\nThanks a lot in advance for your help!",
