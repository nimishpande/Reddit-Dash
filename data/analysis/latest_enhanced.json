It might seem over the top, but I really wanted to do anything that could help,  hoping something would end up working. \n\nOn Sept 26th, he started topical minoxidil 5% (AM + PM), oral finasteride 1 mg, nutrafol men supplements, nordic natural omega-3 supplements\n\nEvery Sunday I use rosemary scalp pre-wash to give him a scalp massage then double cleanse / hair mask with ketoconazole 2% shampoo. I also use a red light therapy mask on his scalp every Friday and Sunday.\n\t\nOn Oct 3rd I booked a prp session and it was extremely painful for him. I know this sub isn’t too fond of this treatment but he’s willing to try 2 more sessions every 6 weeks to see how it goes.\n\nAround Oct 11th (first pic), he started shedding a ton at the crown and hairline. On Oct 14th(second pic) the shedding got worse so he decided to buzz his hair. The shedding stopped around Oct 29, and since then everything has stabilized…I think. \n\nYesterday , Nov 11th, he took the new pic and I feel like there’s crazy progress already !!! I hope I’m not delusional but I feel like there is more density. \n\nI’m planning to start dermarolling his scalp every Sunday starting January since I heard that helps a lot. \n\nWill keep updating if people want to follow along. I love reading everyone’s success stories and I’m excited for future results ! \n\n",

      "content": "First 2 pics are from 2021, last one is my current hair. I’m just wondering if anyone might have some advice on what’s going on!\n\nBefore I started CGM in 2020, my hair was a frizzy, undefined, dry mess. I didn’t know I had textured hair at all; I thought it was just sad and damaged. I was using Dove Intensive Repair (I think?) up until I started experimenting with curly products and suddenly I had amazing ringlets and waves. \n\nIn 2020 I was using primarily Shea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine shampoo, conditioner, and curl enhancing smoothie. So lots of protein! I would also mix in some other haircare brands with gels, mousses, etc. and I would use a lot of cream. At that point my hair loved it and never got weighed down.\n\nFast forward to today, the slightest bit of protein ruins my hair, and my waves are continuously loosening. I stopped using anything with protein altogether. This last time I washed my hair I figured that I *must* need some protein, because things just aren’t making sense. I put in some AG Recoil after the shower (which has protein about halfway down the ingredient list), and my hair is so sad and sticky and limp. Otherwise, my hair still feels and looks much better when I use my regular moisturizing products (which are no longer strictly CGM). However, I’m still concerned about my texture.\n\nCould this be a hormone thing, or my hair just changing over time? Could it be length? \n\nAnother thing I’m curious about is the fact that I learned how to treat my hair wavy/curly (scrunching, less brushing, using products, diffusing, etc.) at the same time I stopped using sulphates and silicones. I almost wonder if those weren’t necessarily making my hair dry and pouffy, but just the fact that I didn’t know how to style it. Before learning anything to do with CGM, I used to vigorously rub my hair with the towel out of the shower (with zero product). I know, it’s so bad!\n\nSo in general, I’m confused about the changes in my hair and its behaviour. I would say it’s high porosity, and I have fine, medium, and coarse strands all over my head. Most of it is medium though. I’m thinking perhaps I need to let go of how my hair used to behave, and that maybe I need way less products now? It’s hard to change my mindset after years of heavy products doing amazing things on my hair, and now it’s getting flatter and flatter even when I use light products.\n\nRoutine\n\nShampoo: Garnier Honey Water shampoo (this is brand new for me and has sulphates which have been working better so far)\n\nConditioner: Garnier Honey Water conditioner (this is CG friendly, and I love it!)\n\nAfter shower: Garnier Honey Water cream and Innersense I Create Hold gel. Sometimes I’ll use Carina Organics Sweet Pea leave in and John Frieda Dream Curls gel.",

So I tried something different instead of buying yet another serum:\n\n\n\nI started doing “mini 3-day experiments”:\n\n\\- Take a bare-skin selfie every 3 days in the same lighting\n\n\\- Log how I slept, how much water I drank, how stressed I was, how much screen time, sun exposure etc.\n\n\\- Make ONE small change per 3-day cycle (earlier sleep, less sugar, more water, no late-night scrolling, etc.)\n\n\n\nAfter 3–4 cycles I noticed a pattern:\n\n\\- Nights with terrible sleep = redness + puffiness every time\n\n\\- Low water + lots of salty food = instant dullness\n\n\\- On weeks where I actually followed a simple routine, my skin calmed down a LOT\n\n\n\nHonestly, just seeing my face + habits side by side did more for me than any single “miracle product”.\n\n\n\nI’m curious:\n\n\\- Has anyone else tried tracking their lifestyle + skin like this?\n\n\\- If you did, what patterns did you discover?\n\n\\- What would you track if you were starting from scratch?\n\n\n\nI’d love to steal some ideas from people who are more disciplined than me 😅\n\n",

      "content": "Dry skin is a common concern that affects millions of people, especially during colder months or in low-humidity environments. If you struggle with tightness, flakiness, or dullness, you’re not alone. This guide covers everything you need to know about caring for dry skin, from expert routines to ingredient insights and product recommendations.\n\n# Why Dry Skin Happens\n\nDry skin occurs when the skin’s natural barrier is compromised, leading to moisture loss. Common causes include:\n\n* Harsh weather (cold, wind, low humidity)\n* Over-cleansing or using harsh products\n* Aging and hormonal changes\n* Dehydration and poor diet\n* Medical conditions like eczema or psoriasis\n\n# The Best Skincare Routine for Dry Skin\n\nA consistent routine is key to restoring hydration and strengthening your skin’s barrier. Here’s a step-by-step guide:\n\n# Morning Routine\n\n* **Gentle Cleanser:** Use a fragrance-free, hydrating cleanser to remove impurities without stripping moisture.\n* **Toner:** Opt for an alcohol-free toner with soothing ingredients like aloe vera or chamomile.\n* **Serum:** Apply a hyaluronic acid serum to attract and lock in moisture.\n* **Moisturizer:** Choose a rich, emollient moisturizer with ceramides, shea butter, or squalane.\n* **Sunscreen:** Finish with a broad-spectrum SPF 30+ to protect against UV damage.\n\n# Night Routine\n\n* **Double Cleanse:** Start with an oil-based cleanser, followed by a gentle foaming cleanser.\n* **Exfoliate (1-2 times a week):** Use a mild chemical exfoliant (like lactic acid) to remove dead skin cells.\n* **Treatment Serum:** Apply a nourishing serum with peptides or niacinamide.\n* **Night Cream:** Use a heavier cream or sleeping mask for overnight repair.\n\n# Key Ingredients for Dry Skin\n\n* **Hyaluronic Acid:** Attracts and retains moisture for plump, hydrated skin.\n* **Ceramides:** Restore the skin’s natural barrier and prevent moisture loss.\n* **Shea Butter:** Deeply nourishes and soothes dry, irritated skin.\n* **Squalane:** Mimics the skin’s natural oils for long-lasting hydration.\n* **Aloe Vera:** Calms inflammation and redness.\n* **Niacinamide:** Strengthens the skin barrier and improves texture.\n\n# Top Product Recommendations\n\n* Cerave\n* Nurabare Skincare\n* Minimalist\n\n# Expert Tips for Managing Dry Skin\n\n* Avoid hot showers and harsh soaps.\n* Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air.\n* Drink plenty of water and maintain a balanced diet.\n* Patch test new products before full application.\n* Consult a dermatologist for persistent dryness or irritation.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n**Q: What is the best moisturizer for dry skin?**  \nA: Look for products with ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and shea butter. CeraVe Moisturizing Cream and First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream are highly recommended.\n\n**Q: How often should I exfoliate dry skin?**  \nA: Limit exfoliation to 1-2 times a week with a gentle chemical exfoliant like lactic acid to avoid irritation.\n\n**Q: Can diet affect dry skin?**  \nA: Yes, staying hydrated and eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids (like salmon and walnuts) can improve skin hydration.\n\n**Q: Is sunscreen necessary for dry skin?**  \nA: Absolutely. Sunscreen protects your skin from UV damage, which can worsen dryness and lead to premature aging.\n\n**Q: What should I avoid if I have dry skin?**  \nA: Avoid hot water, harsh soaps, alcohol-based products, and over-exfoliating, as these can strip your skin’s natural oils.\n\n# Why Trust This Guide?\n\nThis article is written by skincare experts with years of experience in dermatology and beauty.

I haven't really ever done skincare before, I'd just use a cheap face wash and that was it.

I have combination oily dry skin and am very prone to blemishes. They recommended Clinique Take The Day Off oil cleanser, Dr Jart Pore Remedy foam cleanser and Dr Jart Cicapair Sleepair Intensive Soothing Repair Mask. \n\nI've been using all of these for about 2 weeks now, and my skin has been absolutely awful. I keep getting multiple whitehead spots pop up on my face every day. My friend says that this is my skin 'getting rid of impurities' and that it will settle down soon, but is that true?

I detangle every morning, it’s a pain.\n\nAm I using too much product? The wrong ones? My routine is usually detangler or a spray water bottle in the mornings and coating sections with leave in conditioner then applying gel like aunt Jackie’s or eco gel. I wash my hair like twice a week and only use shampoo like once every two weeks. Every couple months I also have my hairstylist do a clarifying shampoo to just remove product build up. I don’t have a nighttime routine it’s usually just in a bun. I am familiar with a diffuser and have one for special occasions but does something like that really have to be done daily? I can’t figure out how to use oils, they just sit on my hair. I don’t understand the concept of which products you need in full, I’m a minimalist for the most part lifestyle wise and just need some general direction. ",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
