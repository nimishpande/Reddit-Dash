Not totally sure though. I've heard i may need a clarifying shampoo, but im very uneducated about properly taking care of my curls, though I have tried with experimenting. Ive thought about olaplex, but ive seen a ton of reviews its absolutely ruined people's hair texture \n\nmy routine:\n\n\\- hair wash every other day \n\n\\- shampoo: Pantene Pro V daily moisture renewal \n\n\\- conditioner: Pantene Pro V daily moisture renewal \n\n\\- second conditioner: Hask organic oil repairing conditioner\n\n\\- brush out and let air dry, scrunch method\n\n\\- very recently ive been using argan magic intensive hair oil about once a week but havent noticed a substantial difference \n\n\\- my hair becomes incredibly frizzy and loses curl texture after brushing when its dry, but curls up immediately after a shower\n\nI feel kind of at a loss on what my hair needs. I see all this stuff about proteins and other elements, and I need to do more research, but im not sure where to look or even what my hair type actually is. \n\ncurious if anyone else would reccomend a clarifying shampoo, as im sure I have decent build up potentially. any advice would be great! tysm!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m looking for advice because I honestly have no idea where to start with my hair.\n\nI recently did a big chop (first image). My hair used to be mid-back length, but it was very damaged, so I cut it shorter to try and start fresh. I have not created a routine at all yet so I am unable to provide one I’ve been mix matching between creams, mousses, gels, oils and leave-ins trying to find something that works. The first picture is no product but it is diffused to the best of my ability. I hover dry for 15 minutes and pixie diffuse for another 5 minutes until completely dry. Other than that I use head and shoulders shampoo and conditioner as this is the only thing that has seemed to work for me.\n\nI’ve had curly and frizzy hair since I was a kid, but it was never really taken care of properly. Both my parents have straight hair, so no one really knew how to manage curls. It was almost always brushed out and pulled into a low ponytail or slicked-back ponytail, which definitely didn’t help.\n\nOn top of that, I started using heat on my hair every day from around age 13, and I’ve only just recently stopped at 21, so I’m sure that contributed a lot to the damage and loss of curl pattern.\n\nWhen I was younger, I did actually have spiral curls, and even recently my hair can still form curls, but they feel inconsistent and hard to maintain.\n\nI also went to a hairdresser for my 21st birthday hoping to get my curls styled and shaped properly, but it was honestly a terrible experience. Their website advertised curl-focused styling, but they barely put effort into defining or styling my curls, and the result didn’t reflect what I was hoping for at all (second image).\n\nRight now my biggest struggles are frizz, flat roots with no volume at the scalp, curls forming more on the ends but looking limp or weighed down at the top, and not knowing whether I should focus on moisture, protein, lighter products, or something else.\n\nEverything I’ve tried so far seems to either weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy and undefined.\n\nIf anyone has advice on how to help curls become healthier, how to get volume at the roots, what kind of routine or products might suit fine to medium curly hair, or even just where to start when you’ve never really learned curl care, I’d seriously appreciate it. Also I’m from Australia, so preferably Aussie products!\n\nAny advice is welcome because I feel pretty lost and overwhelmed. Thanks so much!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

      "title": "My experience identifying and treating fungal acne",
      "content": "Here's my journey identifying and treating fungal acne.\n\nI didn't have acne until 2 years ago when I had to take antibiotics after years. After that dose, I got facial acne, a yeast infection down there and my gut became very sensitive. Today I realise that they were all indeed connected. The root cause was antibiotics being broad spectrum and wiping out all good bacteria from my body. The permanent fix to this is to build immunity by eating fresh fruits, yogurt and supplementing the diet with prebiotics and probiotics. I did go for doctor appointments (not for my skin though) but they failed to fix my infection and looked at all my symptoms separately, not as a whole. For my yeast infection, I was using a clotrimazole powder, available abundantly in any supermarket or pharmacy. But I'd also use it to cleanse my shoes once in a while, I'd use it to prevent chafing and so on.\n\nBefore:\n\nAs for my acne, it would start out red, grow in size, then the top would start turning white resembling a whitehead. After sometime, it'd open and a white grain sized particle would come out along with water. Then the scars would stay. I tried double cleansing, tried Boroline, tried pimple patches, stopped niacinamide, stopped retinol, stopped using toner, changed cleansers, changed sunscreens. Nothing working, maybe double cleansing helped slightly.\n\nDuring:\n\nI began to suspect my acne being fungal. Since I already had an active yeast infection, maybe my acne could be fungal too. One day it hit me - if clotrimazole is anti-fungal and if I have fungal acne then this powder must have an effect on my face. I did a patch test on my hand first, and next day a spot on my face. The next day I could see immediate improvement. I then continued to use it on my face and saw great improvement. Soon I used it frequently - I made a paste using Boroline and clotrimazole powder and applied it to my active acne. My active acne started reducing and this was overwhelming evidence that my acne was fungal. I then took advice from this subreddit, and started using Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo on my face. I also stopped every other product. I only used shampoo and Neutrogena moisturiser. I also changed my pillowcase once in two weeks at least.\n\nAfter:\n\nI started in December 2024 and after a year of diligently using it everyday, my skin is pretty much clear. I apologise in advance for the cropped pictures, it's weird but that's all I'm comfortable with. In a few days itself a H&amp;S shampoo wash + clotrimazole powder on active areas stopped active acne. In 3 months I was just left with some marks, no reddness. I was no longer hesitant to take selfies :) These marks took a while to clear. But I'm so glad I've finally figured out the root cause and that I've almost cleared it entirely.\n\nSo in conclusion, for my fungal acne caused by antibiotic usage, I give the credit to:\n\n* Clotrimazole powder\n* Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo (any other anti-fungal shampoo might work too)\n* Maintaining a routine of using the shampoo as a wash twice a day as well as using clotrimazole powder\n* Washing pillow case once in 1 or 2 weeks\n* Stopping all other products except for the above mentioned and moisturiser\n\nI've not used or mentioned any Rx products here.\n\nBig thanks to this subreddit! I hope to give back by sharing my journey and progress timeline/photos. I think one takeaway from my journey is the hack of using clotrimazole powder to test for fungal acne as well as treat it. Hope this helps someone, somewhere :)\n\nTLDR: Used antibiotics, wiped all good bacteria in my body, got acne, used clotrimazole powder to identify it as fungal acne and clear it.",
