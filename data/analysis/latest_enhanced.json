I just kept using it without any real reason.Recently, I read about using glycerin on the skin and decided to give it a try and my skin loved it!\n\nBought the atomiser from Blinkit and got glycerin and distilled water from a local pharmacy. Glycerin needs to be diluted, otherwise it can make your skin feel even drier. I diluted it in about 1:8 ratio (glycerin : distilled water)\n\nThe glycerin bottle cost me around 50, and the distilled water packets were rs.3 each. I spray it on my face when it’s slightly damp after cleansing, then follow up with a moisturizer. I’ve been loving it lately, it’s super hydrating and very budget friendly!",

      "content": "I got sick of reapplying lip balm. It felt like my lips were addicted to the application of balm again and again. I was using minimalist spf30(which I can't find easily anymore, anyway). I decided to go cold turkey four days ago to reset.\nNow, my lips are severely chapped, peeling, and painful. They feel dependent and I need to stop this constant re-application habit for good.\nI need quick, practical advice.\nWhat are the best, low-ingredient, non-addictive healers I can use very sparingly? Think single-ingredient moisturizers or occlusives. I want to heal, not get re-addicted.\nI'm considering the Kama Ayurveda lip balm as a potential, more \"natural\" step-down option (ingredients look like pure oils/butters/beeswax). Has anyone used this and found it less habit-forming than conventional balms?\nAny wisdom from those who successfully quit the balm habit would be hugely appreciated!!\n",

I’m not sure if they’ve actually gotten larger or if I’ve just started paying more attention to them this year. Honestly, I think they’ve been there for a long time but maybe they were not so visible. I noticed that my teen sister also has this problem (she is 15 and I am 27).\nMy skincare routine is pretty simple: a gentle face wash, serum, moisturizer, and SPF during the day. Is there anything I can do to minimize the appearance of these pores?\n\nFor context, I’ve also been using Epiduo Forte for about two weeks to treat some breakouts on my cheeks and chin.\n\nThanks so much for any advice!",

      "content": "Reddit\n\nSooooo, I just need honest feedback. I have had long hair my ENTIRE LIFE. Been going to my hair stylist for like 5 years. Have never had anything to complain about before. I normally do a refill on my highlights. I did tell her I wanted to go a tiny bit more blonde than before. Today I just had a bad feeling when she started putting the bleach on. \n\nI felt she was rushing. (She does doubles all day) She also seemed to be putting bleach on parts of my hair that were already blonde and I know that is a no-no. I tried to shrug it off and trust her. Bleaching is done. Says she is going to put me under the dryer for 15 minutes. I asked if she wanted me to set my timer. She said “No I’ll be back.” \n\nAt almost 15 minutes I decided to take myself out of the dryer (again, bad feeling) and let her and her assistant know I was going to the bathroom, then sat back down by the dryer but didn’t go back under it. When her assistant finally came and got me around 25 minutes total time she had a panicked look on her face like “uh oh, we left you under for too long.” Thank god I’m always paranoid of breakage and didn’t go back under the dryer. \n\nAssistant then checked my foils and the stylist comes over and assistant says “pure white”. Stylist says “perfect! And I’ll bring a hair mask over to the wash bowl” goes back to her booth then assistant takes me to the wash bowl. (Stylist never comes back with the hair mask btw) Everything was fine with the wash but I did feel the toner couldn’t been left on a little too long and the assistant was talking to another staff a little too much for my liking while the toner was sitting on my head. \n\nWe go back to booth. Someone is in stylist chair (nbd) assistant takes towel off my head and I tell her, we are going to need a lot of detangler, she then asks “do YOU want to comb your hair out so I don’t hurt you” and that’s fine because I generally do prefer to comb out my own hair because it’s so long I can just get through it faster. \n\nWhen I first start combing it out I instantly notice something is wrong. My hair is falling out in clumps. In brushfuls. It is worse than any other hair breakage from bleaching I have ever had. And listen, I’ve had my hair bleached for many years and am used to a small small handful of bleached hair coming out but this was ALOT of hair. (The photo doesn’t do it justice.)\n\nI called stylist over and showed her and she downplays my concerns! “It looks like more than it is, and as long as it’s not breaking from the top it’s fine.” Then her assistant chimes in “and you’re cutting a few inches off anyway right? So that will make it so it’s not so bad.” I am internally saying “WTF?” And holding back tears while I continue to pull small clumps of hair from my head and add it to the pile of my hair that has already come out. \n\nI was going to get a trim and blow dry but I was trying not to cry and was so upset that I asked assistant to just let me know the total so I can go. Mind you, this whole time stylist is busy speaking to and working on another client. Assistant tells stylist I want to leave and don’t want my trim anymore. Stylist mentions something about sending me home with a hair mask. I pay and leave (with no hair mask btw and start crying as soon as I get in my car. \n\nAm I overreacting?? I felt like they both tried to minimize my concerns and no apology was given, no real conversation was had, no care seemed to be had by either of them. I don’t know if stylist just didn’t want to address it because she had 2 other clients right there but to tell me “it’s not that much hair” and then I pick up the whole pile and say “this is a lot of hair.” She then says “It is, a little bit.”\n\nDo I have a right to be offended? I also was expecting a phone call or text or something from stylist but got nothing. I don’t even know what to do. Don’t know if I should go back to her because of how I was brushed aside. I just need advice please. Thanks in advance and sorry about this novel.",

I also noticed I don't really think about my hair anymore, I was going crazy for like 2 years before that and was very self-conscious but that kinda disappeared, not sure if it's because of actual progress or just because \"I'm doing what I can\".\n\nI've been using fin 1mg for a year now pretty consistently (M/W/F) and minox 5% on and off because I'm lazy",

      "content": "For a little context, I had pin straight hair from out of the womb til around 30. For different occasions (prom, weddings, etc) professionnals tried to curl my hair to no avail. No matter the work, technique or product, 30 min later it was back to straight, not even a wave in sight. Then a few years ago my endo quickly got a whole lot worst and my hormones have been all over the place ever since. Which is what I suspect caused a change in my hair. \n\nI’ve seen then noticed loose waves forming when my hair is wet and even some random curls curls in the back of the my head. But I continued to treat them as fully straight and brushed when wet (and dry), mostly air dry and wore it in tight messy buns. My hair gets super frizzy and they never look good when not tied up. \n\nSo today I tried this routine (in order):\n\n- Washing the roots (Marc Anthony strictly curls shampoo)\n- Conditioning the ends (MA strictly curls conditionner)\n- Brushing (head down with curl defining brush)\n- Curl creme on dripping wet, scrunch (MA curl defining lotion)\n- Gel on dripping wet, scrunch (MA flex gel)\n- Scrunch some more with my hands\n\n\nAt this point they were very wavy / some curls\n\n- Plopping for about 20 min with a non textured microfiber towel\n\nAt this point they were looser waves with one side wavier than the other lol. (Photo 1)\n\n- Air dry\n- Scrunch to break cast\n\nOther photos. \n\nAnd now about 7h later they’re even looser. There’s still some wave pattern on the bottom but eh. \n\nErrors I might have made : \n\n- Too much cream\n- Not enough gel / Not well distributed\n- Touching my hair too soon because I had the impression it had fully dried but I don’t think it was\n\nHaving had straight hair all my life I kinda feel like an imposter that’s just trying to force it and feel like an idiot. So all this to say, is this normal day 1? Are these waves in need to be defined over time? Or am I just seeing things and my wavy wet hair means absolutely nothing? Thanks yall. &lt;3\n\n",

Let me know what you think or if products contradict with each other. I’ll put links below! \n\nLittle bit of background : I do believe I have a weakened barrier from trying to fix a menstrual / hormonal breakout a few months ago and am currently on 50MG spironolactone and plan to go up to 100 next week. it’s been a month and my skin is slightly improving or atleast preventing more breakouts while the old ones heal, but I’m having trouble lightening the spots. I only recently started having that problem where even tiny pimples with a head and untouched will still leave a dark spot. I believe I have some PIE from what I can see. The first selfie is my initial breakout around end of July, the second one is my skin currently. When I had clear skin I was using (and still am) cetaphils daily cleanser, dermologicas rice microfoliant 3x a week, and Sephoras brands mineral SPF 30 but recently switched to Beyond Angel Aqua moisturizer incase the shea butter in the Sephora brand sunscreen was contributing to my acne. \n\nLinks to new skincare products : \n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/ginger-melt-oil-cleanser-pimprod2030963?sku=2592879\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/power-calm-hydrating-gel-cleanser-pimprod2004468?sku=2541744\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/rice-70-glow-milky-toner-pimprod2048932?sku=2634193\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/redness-relief-azelaic-acid-serum-pimprod2033306?sku=2597522\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/zero-cast-moisturizing-finish-sunscreen-pimprod2052428?sku=2641345\n\n",
