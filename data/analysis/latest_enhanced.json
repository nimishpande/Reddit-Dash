Any recommendations?\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone with similar skin type 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "title": "[Acne] Breakouts Around Mouth !HELP!",
      "content": "Within the last month or two I’ve been dealing with constant breakouts around either side of my mouth. I never used to have any texture or bumps there and never any breakouts. Now my skin always has little bumps in those areas and as soon as I think I’ve cleared one pimple up, I wake up with a new one the next morning. Also dealing with redness in those areas as well. As someone who has been very lucky with their skin and rarely dealt with breakouts, minus a few spots every so often, I’m really struggling figuring out what’s causing this and how to stop it! \n\nFor a bit of background, I’m 27 and never dealt with acne before. The breakouts are ONLY around my mouth, no other areas. My skin is also very dry in that area and I do use moisturizer. I recently have been exercising more lately (though I don’t sweat in that area of my face). So I bought hypochlorous acid spay to use after exercise. That hasn’t helped. I’ve tried tea tree face wash, hasn’t helped. I’ve tried pimple patches, haven’t helped. I’m not kissing or having anyone touch my face. I’ve tried different cleansers and nothing has helped. Tried face scrubs and different moisturizers and nothing. I do use body butter on my body before bed, so could that be getting onto my pillow somehow and causing this? \n\nExcuse my hairy face haha! And sorry for the crap pictures. It’s hard to get a good picture that shows the texture of my skin. \n\nI’m fully aware this could be much worse. But this is so out of the ordinary for me and it’s really frustrating and taken a hit on my confidence for sure. If anyone has any insight into how/why this is happening and how to heal my skin please let me know! I welcome any and all advice! Thank you for reading 🫶\n\n",

      "content": "I’m starting to believe that spicy foods are correlated with the potentiality for maintaining hair. Hear me out: I’ve observed that men from countries with higher contents of spice in their cuisine generally have thicker, more fuller hair deeper into their 30’s+. For example, I’m from Pakistan, and you’ll likely see a full head of hair across the country, from the rich to the poor, from the young to the middle aged. Of course, there’s always the “balding gene”, but compared to other countries, not even close. Same with South American counties, and more, I’m sure. \n\nI believe a reason for this is because of the high spicy content in the cuisines. We know that blood flow is important for keeping pores active and open, and spicy food directly results in blood flowing through the head. Every time I eat really spicy, for example, I feel a strong rush of blood through my temples and on top of my head. Yet, I stopped eating spicy food in my teens, mostly because of stomach issues. My father still has a full head of hair into his 60’s, and his hairline is immaculate. He loves spicy food and eats it often. I’ve resorted to using min/fin for my temples. Of course, my mother’s side is also prone to balding, but her side also did not eat many spices growing up.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you think a high spicy content can sustain blood flow to the scalp? In the least, it should help with maintaining longer, no? \n\nNot saying a lack of spicy foods results in hair loss, but that a high intake of spice may encourage blood flow to the scalp, and thus maintain hair density longer.

I think my hair is wavy but I think it does get curly (?) depending on the routine I follow. \n\nI have low porosity, more coarse than fine hair that is thick. I’ve dyed and bleached my hair multiple times in the past 3 years but had 2 big chops before starting CGM. All the hair on my head is healthy hair. \n\nI need help with damn roots. It’s always straight no matter what I do and it ends up looking so awkward. Please help!\n\nHere’s my routine for Day 1:\n\n1. Shampoo and conditioner every 2-4 days with Love Beauty and Planet’s shampoo and conditioner, and twice a month I use ACURE’s clarifying shampoo and use the Tsubaki hair mask after, and I leave my hair sopping wet\n\n2. Section my hair into 2 parts and comb through using a wide tooth comb, I keep my hair parted into 2 and style with my head bent down from here onwards\n\n3. Scrunch out excess water and add in Aussie’s Instant Freeze Gel using the praying hands method and scrunch afterwards\n\n4. Hover diffuse for 3 mins for the gel cast to form. I diffuse on low heat and speed for around 5 mins and add in Aussie’s Curl Refresher and continue diffusing until 80-100% dry\n\nFrom Day 2 onwards, I dampen my hair with water (maybe around 50% wet) and add Aussie’s Curl Refresher. I diffuse to dry. Results are the photos attached. I used to add in gel for day 2+ routines but it ends up weighing my hair down so my current routine is what I think my hair looks best in. \n\nI’ve noticed my hair loves gel and mousse as I’m looking for definition rather than volume since my hair is thick anyway. I have Cantu’s Wave Whip Curling Mousse on the way and want to incorporate it into my Day 1 routine. \n\nAlso, please excuse my English!! It’s not my native language 🥹",

(so on a clean face again also used a bit of nivea but that too is itching and burning) these 2 products are really good using it since three years- so the product is not a problem. The problem is sunburn and maybe my skin isn’t able to take in any moisturiser(trust me I tried 2 moisturisers and also some body milk directly on my face- but they all just sit on the face.) There is also a patch of roughness maybe small red bumps on my skin which is not allowing moisturiser to go in) and it really burns too and itches. What should I do? Please someone help if faced similar problem or knows more about curing sunburn. Google suggested aloevera pulp direct application on the redness; but I don’t think it’s a good idea to use something directly without knowing much. Attached photos of my products. ",

Looking for a moisturiser to use here, please suggest the best one.\n\nResults-\n\nCleanser: i’ve been using for about 6-7 months now and i dont know if it works but i have noticed that oil production has reduced in my T-zone. It has never broken my skin out or anything harsh like that so I’ll probably repurchase it and continue using it.\n\nSunscreen: Been using this since the start of summer this year so around March, and I quite like it. Again I honestly don’t know if it’s doing anything because I have fair skin with redness on my cheeks 😭. But I haven’t tanned so i guess it’s working? It’s light-weight, blends into my skin quick, no white-cast, and the texture is thin, not thick at all, hasn’t caused any breakouts so I have recently repurchased it and will continue using it.\n\nToner: Just bought it a week ago, no clue if it’s working or not, hasn’t caused a breakout, let’s see if it reduces pores as it claims. Will update in the comments if I notice improvements.\n\nSerum: Definitely noticed a difference from the first week itself, I used 5% for like 6 months and it hardly did anything so I started using 10%, I can see the redness reducing and other people have noticed it too so i’ll keep using this one.\n\nTLDR: Sharing my review of these 4 products &amp; Requesting y’all to drop some advice/comments about my routine, what other serums I can try to reduce redness and acne scars, and please suggest a good moisturiser for my skin type.",

During grad school I narrowed down the routine for my hair. It's very minimalistic lol. \n\n1. Dry brush curls with the Wet Curl brush. \n2. Wash at least every other week, I prefer the Aussie curl brand shampoo. If not washing this shower, then just wet it thoroughly every 3rd or 4th day. (Please note, I am lazy and will sometimes use Bed Bath and Beyond body wash instead, I know, it's shameful, I'm gonna keep doing it anyway.)\n3. If I am actually washing it, do it again until hair is foamy and sudsy.\n4. If I used actual shampoo, I feel obligated to condition with the Aussie curl conditioner here. \n5. Rinse thoroughly.\n6. Wrap in towel for 10 ish minutes. \n7. Wet brush it, then scrunch in Aussie detangler. \n8. Scrunch in a mousse or thick leave in conditioner. Sometimes an oil. I switch brands here a lot. \n9. Plop it into the silk cap and go to bed. \n\nHere's the thing. I'm having my first baby in a few months and I'm concerned I won't have even that much time. Idk how much time newborns take, but I prefer to err on the side of more. Should I cut it off? Haven't had a buzz cut in awhile. Is this routine minimal enough to survive parenthood? I do have lots of support ready and happy to help with baby, but idk how much time I'll have to for things like haircare. I already have a very secure silk wrap for the hospital bed so I don't get those back of neck dreads during birth. \n\nAll advice is welcome! Thank you ladies and gents!",

      "content": "Hello,\n\nI was wondering if there’s anything to improve about my hair and also wasn’t that sure about my routine. In terms of products I own literally every product in the last picture except the smoothie and heat protectant, and also have a mousse and curl styling cream from that brand (kruidvat).\n\nI would classify my hair as medium porosity, leaning thin, not very dense.\n\nPictures 1-2 are after using a regular (non curly) shampoo because I thought I might have buildup, then hair mask (was suspecting some heat damage too), and then detangling with the “hydrating conditioner” and rinsing out with cold water.\nI separated them the day after and applied just a little bit of the leave in and styling cream on the dry hair. I was happy with the results.\n\nPic 3 is after co-washing with the “perfect curls conditioner”, then once it dried I separated with the oil on my hands and then tried applying the leave in and styling cream again like yesterday but it came out worse, sprayed a bit of water to try to tame it and it didn’t help lol. So it came out more frizzy than pics 1-2.\n\nWhat I’m trying to figure out is : \n- I don’t know if I should ditch the blue “perfect curls” line because my hair pattern is too tight for those (referring to the graph that Kruidvat provides for their products, last picture)?\n- Should I stop co-washing? I’m wondering if my hair is too straight for it, and because the water where I live is pretty hard, if I should just shampoo every time. The “perfect curls shampoo” seems to be a softer shampoo.\n- Can I use the “clarifying shampoo” as a chelating shampoo because of the hard water? \n\nI’ve tried analyzing the ingredients but honestly can’t figure out much from the results. These products are all marketed as CG proof anyway but it’s more about figuring out if they’re right for my routine.\n\nI can provide any list of ingredients if needed.\nThanks to anyone that read this far!",

I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin?

Here's my routine every 3-4 days:\n\n* Wash my hair with Step 1: All Curl Types Shampoo\n* Leave Step 2: All Curl Types Conditioner in my hair for over 5 minutes\n* I squeeze excess water out of hair and apply Step 3: All-in-One Repair Hydrate Style\n\nSince I started using these products, I need to wash my hair less frequently and my curls have never looked better. However, \n\n* the shampoo and conditioner make my scalp dry and itchy\n* the bottles are very difficult to squeeze the product out of\n* the fragance-free options only come in 250 mL\n\nAnyone out there have any product fragance-free product suggestions?",
