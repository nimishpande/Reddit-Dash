      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I'm asking for help because I want \"hot girl hair\" so I can looksmax, and I know it's holding me back big time.\n\nMy problems I see:\n\n1.  It's UNBELIEVABLY knotty and it takes 20min or more to comb all the knots out, and even then, it's hard for a brush to go freely through my hair.\n\n2. It looks dry and kind of frizzy? I want it to be silky and shiny. The texture is grossing me out. \n\nI attached a picture of my hair piece which is the hair I want. I know Asian and Indian girls have this hair without doing anything and it makes me feel ashamed. I already spent 10s of thousands on my face, so Im hoping I can get to this without spending 100s on a professional every month.\n\nWhat Im doing:\nFor 1.5 years I've added a conditioner. It helps maybe 20% for the shininess and softness. I work in surgery so I wear a bouffant cap for 10hrs a day idk if that's bad.\n\nIm hopelessly clueless. Please, give me all the help I can get 😅",

I have changed hair products A LOT and have dyed my hair many times, but since taken a break. I am currently using the Native brand and Soapbox brand for shampoo and conditioner. I had their sprays too, but after some research I found a lot of people were dealing with thinning and frizz. I too.. am dealing with thinning and frizz. For extra moisture I use the soapbox brand too. I’ll put shea oil in my hair on extra frizzy days. \n\nDuring 2021 I used Cantu, but they’ve changed their recipe sooo much over the years and I can’t rely on that anymore. I cannot recall what I was using for shampoo and conditioner, but I honestly think it was Dove shampoo and Suave. I feel like my hair was so much fuller and bouncier in 2021! \n\nExtra info: I air dry my hair and do not blow dry at all. I sleep with a bonnet sometimes and use a silk pillow case ALWAYS. I do not go to bed with wet hair. \n\nWhat should I do? Go back to the basic routine even though they’re full of sulfates or try something new again? I think a hair cut is due for starters. ",

Like, I straight up cannot pull my Denman through my hair after applying them. I have fairly healthy hair with little damage, and can glide a fine-toothed comb through my wet hair right out of the shower, but it feels like a lot of gels just blast my hair's cuticle wide open.\n- Good hold - lots of gels that promise to be \"less drying\" also just have hold that sucks!\n\nI'm not super picky about it being \"no-crunch\", I love a good cast, but I think there's probably something to the crunch-free-ness that makes it more slippy.\n\nPlease help, this gel was perfect but I know there have got to be cheaper alternatives out there. 😭\n\nThe basics of my routine currently:\n- in the shower: Curl Keeper Treatment Shampoo, rinse, then Skala Mais Cachos (the blue one), rinsed about 80% out\n- gently comb to detangle\n- Curl Keeper Tweek\n- John Frieda Frizz Ease Dream Curls Mousse\n- gel (this is the step where the Ultra Defining Gel comes in)\n- section hair and brush style with the Denman (just pulling down with light tension, no brush curling or anything)\n- scrunch, air dry until about 50% dry and then diffuse the rest of the way",

For a little more context, I use ordinary shampoo (just on my scalp) twice a week and ordinary conditioner (on everything but my scalp) nightly.\n\n  \nI don't really have a concrete routine anymore since I've been trying different things every day, but here's what I did for the results pictured:\n\n  \n\\- Completely soaked\n\n\\- Very lightly dried with regular towel (just dabbed enough so it's not dripping everywhere)\n\n\\- Brushed it straight with a wet brush while spraying it with a spray bottle to keep it wet\n\n\\- Applied and brushed through some It's a 10 Miracle Leave-In Potion\n\n\\- Flipped head upside down, ran a palmful of LA Looks Extreme Sport through hair and scrunched all over\n\n\\- Left completely alone to air dry over my back\n\n  \nThe results of my hair feel inconsistent day-to-day. I think I have a straight bottom layer of hair, so I'll see little strands of straight/wavy hair frustratingly protruding from my curls. Frizz feels sporadic and seems to show up wherever it wants.\n\nI know I don't go above and beyond for my hair, so am I expecting too much? Is there really a normal amount of frizz in the photos?

Now im starting to grow it longer again since I want to feel feminine again. \nIf you think \"Why didn't your parents teach ya this?\" It's because they both have very different hair than me, both thin hair as in hairstran, volume and just the texture. They're blond and brunette. \nA few things about my hair and scalp.\n\nMy hair: \nNatural ginger\n2a-2b depends on season. In autumn and winter it curls more for some reason and in summer it sags.\nMy hair has always been fizzy\nMy hair is thick, as in I need to thin it out around the 3-4 otherwise it will matt, no matter how many times I brush it because I move a lot in my sleep. \nHairstran thickness is medium, \nTakes very long to dry after it gets wet. Sometimes I sleep with wethair and wake up with it next morning. \n\nScalp:\nHas been itchy and uncomfortable lately \nIt has also been painfully a bit. \nHas some lose bits of skin. \n\nWhat I want: \nVolume, when it gets long the volume of my hair at the scalp is gone but lower it comes back. \nA comfortable scalp, that would be nice since I now keep itching it. \nNot having to thin it out every 3-4 weeks\n\nI just don't know where to start. I get overwhelmed by the haircare section and I just don't know what my hair needs. \nCan someone help me please how to find the right things? Bc I did multiple quizzes, game the same answers but somehow got different hair care treatment suggestions. I just feel overwhelmed. ",

      "title": "My little skincare and haircare routine 🩰✨🫧",
      "content": "🦋\nAbout me 🎀: My skintype is combination(oily on large areas and dry on another). I have large open pores and pigmentation. I easily get whiteheads and redheads if i don’t wash my face to reduce the oilyness. I have PCOS ⚡️and i go to gym like 2 days average in a week. I eat a lot of sugars, reduced carbs and take whey protein. I have facial hairs due to PCOS so i use  facial hair trimmer twice a week.\n\nAbout the products🦩:\n\nFacial Skincare🫧: \n1. Paknet (derma suggested)🪼: skin feels cleared and very smooth. I did a little research and got to know benzoyl peroxide reduces pimple causing bacteria. So i guess it helps reduce pimple. I gently move my hands in circular motion clockwise and upwards to let me skin absorb it and then wash. (AM PM)\n\n2. Acne oc- moisturiser (derma suggested)🪻: reduces pores and moisturise my face. Regulates oil production on face. I have seen some change in my pores and oiliness. I again apply it and move my hands upwards to let it soak in.(AM PM)\n\n3. Adapalene (derma suggested)🦥: it has benzoyl peroxide so it helps reduce pimple causing bacteria and in turn help prevent pimples. I take a very little of it and again in circular motion upwards apply it all over the skin but not on sides of nose, under/close to the eye and in sides of my mouth. Once in two days. Can irritate skin if over used.(AM -use sunscreen after)\n\n3. Moisurex-hydra (prev derma suggested) 🐚: i apply it same way , circular clockwise upwards till absorbs. Its water based so good if you have dry skin.  (AM PM)\n\n4. a. Aziderm (prev derma suggested)🐝: it reduces pigmentation, pimple and pimple marks. Also helps in detaning. My new derma hasn’t suggested it, but it works well so i’m using it. Same application - upwards and in circular motion. I use it as night as you need to save your skin from sun after these products. Use it a little like adapalene as it can irritate skin as well (PM)\n\n4. b. Clindamycin (derma suggested)🐥: no idea what it does but i have to apply it everyday in the morning. Doesnt irritate. Same application - circular, upwads) (AM PM)\n\n5. Deconstruct vitamin c serum ( self suggested) 🪽- my skin has got tanned so started using it recently. Still waiting to see if it works. Read application on the bottle(AM PM with sunscreen)\n\n5 b. Pixi toner -(nykaa gift) 👾- its good, no idea what it does but doesn’t do any harm so yeah, good so far. I apply it with cotton in circular upwards motion. (AM PM)\n\n6. Sunscreens 🌞-( all doc suggested current and prev) - uv doux is best but is tinted. It feels heavy so i will get the non silicone based on from uv doux. Others are fine. (Every two hours under sun, 2x pinky finger size)\n\n7. Vaseline (self suggested) 👄- i have pigmented lips, used it daily whenever i felt my lips have gotten dry, started observing them getting pink and less dark.\n\n8. Meds ( derma suggested) 💊- green one is omega - good for hair and skin. Black one is antioxidant, and peach one is for pimple reduction. I take them everyday\n\n9.shatavari juice (self suggested)🍶- i have pcos, so i take it every day after meal at night, helps with pcos and inflammation i guess. Im using everything so dont know how exactly is this working. I have to drink it for another month or so.\n\n10. Medicube collagen night mask, vlcc detan mask, detan scrub (self suggested)🎭- once a week for tanning.\n\n11. Turmeric and red sandal (self suggested)🎭- got them recently, good for face, clears , depigments brightens. I use it twice a week, it leaves yellowish color, so use it at night.\n\nHaircare:\n1. Ordinary 👩‍🦰: (self suggested): reduces hairfall and dandruff. Works like magic. I have seen hair fall reduction and new baby hairs (PM )\n\n2. Serum (self suggested) 🪮- makes hairs manageable inturn less breakage. After wash or whenever im using heat.\n\n3.  Soul flower serum (self suggested) 🫤- unsure, but i would bot recomment too many stuff ordinary is best.\n\n4. Soulflower oils 🛢️- (self suggested) - best ones for hair growth and thickness. (An hour before hairwash)\n\n\nAll these products are what i use, not suggesting that they work like magic or will work for everyone, but my face is now pimple free and when i touch my skin now, smooth and soft🥰. With PCOS your skin, mood and everything becomes twice complicated😅, i’ll aways suggest doctors when you think skincare and health🔎. If you are in bangalore and looking for the doctor, i have some names. I’m can help you🙃.\n\n\nThanks and have a great skin and hair ♥️🌸\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I’ve been growing out odd layers and 99% of the time I pull it back, because I feel that is most flattering to my face. I moved to a new city five years ago and I’ve seen four or five hair stylist for cuts since then, typically they just air dry it like a poodle, nobody has ever given me any good advice for styling, and I feel like they just think I’m hopeless. I don’t do well with using tools, my hair always seems to look worse and I have limited patients to learn to use tools. Same with hair product, it either weighs it down or makes it stringy. Plus, I don’t like to use any chemicals or fragrances. Right now I use a leave in conditioner. When my hair is curly, the curls go in all different directions, and are different shapes and curl patterns. The longer my hair grows, the less curly it is. I would love to do a pixie, but it would all be frizzy curls. I was recently thinking that maybe a flat iron or a curling iron would help at least smooth the ends, but I really have no idea. I’m 64 and don’t wanna look like an old lady with terrible hair. These are some photos of me with the straight hair. If I use a bristle brush, it is smoother. Any suggestions on a very simple, minimalist, routine that might help would be very much appreciated.",

I’ve been on TRT alone in the past and had to quit due to hair loss. This time on TRT I started oral Minox prior to TRT (I’m also on Spironolactone for acne, been on that for years) and the Minox was working wonders for my hair but then I added T back in and after 2 months started losing hair despite being on Minox so I added in finasteride and it worked, my DHT is now below 5 however I’m still losing hair. I’m seeing comments/posts about DHT can still be on the scalp and cause hair loss, I’m also using Nizoral shampoo a couple times a week. Is there anything else you recommend to eliminate the scalp DHT? I’m trying my hardest not to come off the T because I felt like shit the last time I had to hence why I went back on it. Granted… it could be other things causing my hair loss (other hormones out of whack) but I’ve lost hair to T in the past so that’s why I’m trying to cover all my bases. Thanks. ",

      "content": "So, I've had acne since 13-14, definitely my breakouts aren't as bad as before I only get some pimples before my period but I do struggle with PIE marks and overall redness for which I use Azelaic Acid and a Salicylic Acid spot treatment when I get active pimples. \n\nLong story short I went to a new dermatologist for my seborrheic dermatitis and she prescribed Uriage DS emulsion on problematic areas but she focused mainly on my acne. She said my face was too blemished and I need to start Isotreitoin 20 mg a day based on my weight for 11 months, that it would change my life in 2 months and I would be unrecognizable, she didn't warn me about any side effects only that I couldn't get pregnant. I didn't know she meant accutane at the time, but I've heard and read so many side effects and thought it was meant for severe acne. She said it would be beneficial overall because it would decrease the oiliness of my face and help with my seborrheic dermatitis and occasional body acne. The routine she provided was AA on the morning with SPF and Adapalane at night 0.1% but I feel that and Isotreitoin is a lot. I'm scared of the side effects, I already have dry eyes and mental issues too. I wouldn't be able to wax and I do walk under the sun on college campus.\n\nI'm wondering if looking at my pictures the risk would be worth it or should I try only Adapalane and AA first. She prescribe another AA, I was using the ordinary but it hasn't help me improve. \n\nI'm really at a loss, because I only get pimples around my period but she says I need it because I'm scarring. I really thought my acce wasn't that bad and I would only cover it with makeup but seeing tiktoks of people post-accutane makes me see that clear glass skin is what people can get. And I really do want that but I'm scared of the side effects. Also I work at a Hospital once a night and receive artificial light. I'm also on Metmorfin and don't know about the toll on my liver. But nothing else has worked for the past 9 years. Could this be the solution? ",

I've found that most products that are marketed to us typically just use the same \"natural\" ingredients (Shea butter, thick oils etc) while all other hair care brands use science backed ingredients with years of clinical studies to assert their claims. \n\nHair products marketed towards curly and coily hair never endeavour to use cutting edge hair science in their products and tend to just use the same rudimentary ingredients in their formulations. Why do you guys think the divide exists? Do you think theres a stigma towards innovation within black hair care vs what we've always used? Do you think this mindset does more harm than good for black hair?\n\n(routine)",
