      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "\n\nHi everyone, I really need some quick recommendations because I have to place my orders in the next two days and I’m completely overwhelmed.\n\nA bit of background so you understand my situation: I’m an Indian tan–brown skin girly, and due to personal struggles I stopped using makeup and even basic skincare for over a year. I’m finally getting back into it and basically restarting from zero. I want to rebuild a simple but effective makeup, skincare, and haircare routine, and a friend coming from the US has offered to bring things for me.\n\nI’ll mainly be shopping from NYX, LA Girl, Wet n Wild, and other drugstore brands, but I’m also placing a few orders on Ulta and other US websites if the products are worth it. My budget is around 20 USD per product, but I can stretch a little for something genuinely good.\n\nI would be incredibly grateful for recommendations for:\n• Blushes (cream or powder) that work well on tan/brown skin  \n• Lipsticks or lip products that flatter deeper tones  \n• Face products: concealers, foundations, tinted moisturizers, primers  \n• Drugstore must-haves from NYX, LA Girl, Wet n Wild, etc.  \n• Ulta exclusives or US-only products worth picking up  \n• Skincare or haircare items that are worth bringing from the US  \n\nHaircare part:  \nI recently got the Dyson Airwrap ID because my hair has suffered heat damage. I have shoulder-length hair and I’m learning how to use the attachments properly. The same friend coming from the US has agreed to bring extra attachments for me.\n\nI’m looking for:\n• Third-party Dyson Airwrap attachments (like AirStrap, round brush dupes, curl barrels) that you have personally tried, that fit well, and don’t damage the Dyson  \n• Trusted brands that ship online or are available in the US  \n• Any sales on official Dyson attachments on Dyson, Ulta, Sephora, or Best Buy  \n• Hairstyling products (heat protectants, volume sprays, hold sprays) that work well with the Airwrap, especially for short shoulder-length hair  \n\nSince I’m rebuilding everything from scratch and the order is urgent, I’d truly appreciate any advice, reviews, or product suggestions. Thank you so much to anyone who takes the time to help me.\n",

Maybe it's not meant to be.\n\nHere is my routine:\n\n1.) I don't have a set shampoo or conditioner I use. Right now I'm using the L'oreal Ever Clean thickening set. I often switch.\n\n2.) All I have in my hair in this picture is Trader Joe's leave in conditioner. It was air dried. I have tried gels and mousse but it usually leaves my hair looking dirty, weighed down, or stringy. Maybe by technique sucks.\n\n3.) Air dry all the time. I have tried a diffuser but it just amps up the frizz.\n\nLooking for tips on helping define my curls. Also, what curl type would you categorize me as?",

My hair is short to shoulder-length, and I’m still figuring out what attachments work best for me.\n\nA friend of mine is coming back from the US soon and offered to bring me a few attachments. I’m interested in good quality third-party options (like AirStrap, round brush dupes, etc.) that you have personally tried and tested — especially ones that don’t damage the Dyson motor, don’t overheat, and fit securely.\n\nIf you know any trusted third-party brands that ship internationally or are available online in the US, please drop your recommendations.\n\nAlso, if the original Dyson attachments are on sale anywhere right now (Dyson direct, Ulta, Sephora, Best Buy, etc.), I’d really appreciate a heads-up because I’m open to buying the official ones too if the price is good.\n\nAnd finally, if you have suggestions for any hairstyling products (heat protectants, volumizers, hold sprays) that work well with the Airwrap on short hair, I’d love to know those as well.\n\nThank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to share their experience.\n",

They cut my hair dry first, then styled my hair and then cut these face framing pieces. \n\nI just washed my hair for the first time since… and the face framing pieces have DISAPPEARED. Because they cut it while the hair was in these clumps, the face framing pieces were kind of specific to the way my hair was styled at the time… but now that I’ve washed it, the shorter pieces have clumped with longer pieces and it’s all generally the same length. \n\nI don’t know what to do, especially since I have my senior graduation pictures coming up soon, and I kind of care that they turn out nice. Do I figure out how to separate the short hairs and re-clump them? Do I try to learn how to cut my own hair? But then, I have no clue where to start. Would anyone be able to recommend where to start?\n\nFor my routine, I use matrix’s a curl can dream: their shampoo and conditioner, then i put in detangler, gel, and I diffuse.",

You know how that goes they give you medication and etc. I know this is a bit off topic I’m sorry.. anyways.. I got on accutane bc my dermatologist told me it was the only way to help with my hormonal acne and I did. Wasn’t even on a high dosage and I ended up getting kp on my chest and face… it’s ruining my life and i personally don’t know what to do. I know people will say “don’t let it affect your life”, but it’s hard. The texture everywhere makes my skin crawl. I don’t know what to do.. I avoid places and going out because I feel so ugly. I’m just wondering if anyone that sees this and has had kp.. well someone with kp as severe as mine were you able to get rid of it?.. like through laser or something. I need some reassurance that it can get better bc I cannot personally handle this anymore.. it kills me and sorry if I seem dramatic, but it just hurts me.

      "content": "Edit: for our friends who struggle with reading comprehension, let me be clear -- I use finasteride, have done for 14 years, and will continue for life, cuz I wanna keep my hair lol. But i do not use minoxidil. Minoxidil is a lifesaver for many men and women alike, but for some with mpb it may be worth considering JUST taking finasteride plus whatever hair restoration shampoo/conditioner set they think has a nice formulation. I made it a point NOT to recommend any particular one.\n\nI'm about 9 months in using things like Regenepure, Revita, Hair Labs, and the results I've had have astounded me. I got on Fin 14 years ago at 19, and while there was some improvement, it wasnt much, but the psychological shield was most of the battle. So I'd like to caution people: fin does \"stop it\" and minoxidil does \"regrow it\". Minoxidil can also cause hair growth on other parts of the body, and oral minoxidil will do that system wide, albeit not as profoundly I'd imagine as if you daily smeared minoxidil on your shoulder or something. So the issue that I see is this: for those who start fin soon after recession begins, they probably haven't experienced much follicular \"death\". But with minoxidil one will never know what regrowth is attributable to turning back the miniaturization clock vs artificially creating terminal hairs out of biological lost causes, though if your MPB is sufficiently aggressive then I'd say  it's more than worth to do what you gotta do. So this is a caution but also a question: has anyone else had such great experiences with just fin and the right shampoo that they're left wondering why we live in fin/minoxidil reductionistic world?",

Why?  The wayit glides on, feels on, smells?  Is it the packaging? Does it remind you of something? Spark your imagination? Relax you? Make you feel special?\n\nMine aren’t particularly fancy. One is Avene’s Revitalizing Nourishing Creme; it comes in regular and riche, and I alternate according to the season.  It’s cheap enough for me to always buy it consistently, the scent is very light, and I love the way it glides on and delivers a surge of moisture.\n\nThe others ones that are memorable unfortunately are not as easily available.  One was Dr. Jart’s Body Oil, discontinued years ago.  It had this soft emollient quality that I have not been able to find in any other body oil since then.  My skin just soaked it up and felt smooth and soft, not just slippery the way dry body oils feel.\n\nThe other was this shea butter, mango butter, and jojoba oil balm that I bought from a vendor at an art fair.  It’s called Pharoanic Healing Butter Balm from Egyptian Botanicals and though the scent is sharp and medicinal, it smells the way I imagined Ancient Egypt smelling when I was a little kid.  I use it on my cuticles nightly and dream of ancient lands every time.\n\nWhat are your most pleasurable skincare products (or routines?)",

I used all of them for at minimum 4 weeks and see no results good or bad really. It’s like my skin doesn’t react to it at all.\n\nI currently just use a daily gentle cleanser and moisturizer from cerave but I am wondering if I will need more high quality products or if it’s recommended because I see a lot people using La roche posay. \nMoney isn’t the issue but I’m trying to be as safe as possible\n\nAlso if there is any recommendations on how to possibly reduce or help the purging stage if my skin purges.\n\nBTW - My skin type is mixed but more oily than anything.

      "title": "[Routine Help] Damaged skin barrier around the eyes, developed Micellar water allergy, what do I do?",
      "content": "Some backstory: when I was growing up I used to have bad eczema during winter time where it would develop on my neck, inner elbows, inner knees, and corner of my lips. One day when I was 9 I finally went to the doctor for it and they prescribed (what I assumed was steroid cream but I don’t remember) it helped and after that I never needed to use the cream again because my eczema never came back. Later on growing up I realized I had eczema (the doctor never told me what it was just my mom and what they would prescribe me). \n\nRedeveloped? back story: When I was ending sophomore year starting junior year of high school I started investing in makeup and to remove it I would use the blue micellar water bottle and that was it nothing else and I was told I wouldn’t need to rinse my face with water or anything. I’ve always had clear skin, no acne, so I was starting off with only wearing lashes and lipstick. Later on I started wearing eyeliner and when I was researching what eyeliner to use I found this one eyeliner a girl used and it was a brow liner but she used it as eyeliner. When I would try to remove it with micellar water it would be kind of a struggle so I would pass it and rub the cotton pad with micellar water multiple times trying to get it off and I would eventually get it off, with a very minimum amount of times giving up with a very faint eyeliner line there. This will continue to happen everyday till one day it started to hurt and feel unbearable and itch. Until it soon become very dry and sometimes have fluid come out and I didn’t know what the problem was. I was prescribed steroid cream after going to the dermatologist. And it worked but stopped using it because I was scared of becoming dependent on it and it becoming worst. Later on they prescribed me Elidel (pimecrolimus) and I searched it up apparently it’s not a steroid cream (let me know if I’m wrong).\n\nQuestion: I am now starting my second year of college seen a few TikToks of it saying I have a damaged skin barrier. I also learned from experience (and assumption) I have grown an allergy to micellar water (I’m not sure about the other colors I just know for blue and now I use cleansing oil to remove my makeup). But I need help I want my skin around my eyes to go back to how it used to some days my skin will be fine and other days either I wear makeup for only 2 days straight or it can happen randomly, the skin will get itchy, flaky, and dry. It has since never became as bad as it first started with the fluid coming out, but I need help how do I fix my skin barrier and go back to my normal skin? Any suggestions on what to use? \nI assume to have dry skin type (because I also don’t drink the amount of water as I should but I am getting around to drinking more water)",
