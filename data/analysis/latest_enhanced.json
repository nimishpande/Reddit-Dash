Last 2 pics are after washing yesterday, and this morning)\n\nMy hair is usually so thick and juicy, light frizz comes naturally I don’t mind that. My problem is that these last couple of months, my hair has been so… stringy?? They’re not getting juicy anymore. And the curls are very lackluster, like waves. Then when I wake up the day after washing them a lot of the underneath is just straight. It’s almost as if my hair has changed texture, it’s looser and softer. \n\nAny advice to get my juicy thick curls back please comment! I have high porosity hair, I usually do use a bonnet.\n\nMy routine:\n\nI do my hair every 3-4 days. I shampoo with off brand head and shoulders every other time (I think this might be part of the issue, I know I need new shampoo. Recommendations would be helpful.) Then I use OGX coconut miracle oil conditioner every time. Usually use a little herbal essences mousse, then diffuse, then when It’s dry I oil it with jojoba. \n\nIn the past I never used mousse, &amp; was using shea moisture power green shampoo (seldomly) &amp; love beauty and planet conditioner but it has become too expensive for me.

But i have a really bad neck and so it is the only way. \n\nI also have always the problem that even when all is dry and the gel-cast is scrunched out and then try to put my hair to the back it looks good from the front but my back looks like a huge cowlick in the middle....i hate that. My hair flows so much better when i just wash it, maybe working some products and then already pull all back and brush it like a slick back and let it air dry.

      "content": "Hello! I’m pretty new to all of this, so bear with me. Over the past two weeks, I’ve been trying to figure out my hair as part of a general  effort to improve myself. I’m about 70% sure I have curly hair. If that’s wrong, feel free to tell me straight up.\n\nRight now, I’ve been using Not Your Mother’s shampoo and conditioner. I also picked up VO5 shampoo for the co-wash, though I’m still not entirely sure how to use that properly. I’ve only used it once. I bought Eco hair gel and tried it yesterday by using two finger dabs and working it through my hair. I’ve been reading the beginner guides and trying basics like scrunching, but after showering I usually just let my hair air dry.Also, I was told to get curly mousse, can anyone explain how exactly this is different from a hair gel,(I'm an idiot cut me some slack). The order I apply is that typically I do conditioner  wash shampoo wash conditioner again wash then I dry my hair with a towel by patting my head then on non wash days I only apply conditioner.\n\nI’ve heard a lot about leave-in conditioner, and I’m wondering if I’m messing up by rinsing all the conditioner out instead of leaving some in. If I was to leave some in how much should I leave in or is leave in conditioner another different type of conditioner you are meant to apply only after the shower.\n\nMy main concern is that I’m planning to get a haircut in the next two weeks, and I’d really appreciate advice from people who know more about hair than I do. I don’t know much about it. Throughout high school I mostly got buzz cuts because my hair grew fast and my dad wanted to keep it simple.\n\nI’m in college now and want to try something that actually suits me. I don’t want it super long because I do not want frequently get a haircut, but I also really dislike extremely short hair. Buzz cuts especially. I always felt like I looked like an egg. In the past, I usually preferred my hair a bit longer than shorter for that reason because I didn't really feel insecure about it.\n\nOne friend suggested a fade, but he also said he is not really an authority on what to do here since he has wavy hair himself.If it helps after talking to same friend I've determined that my hair is 3A/3B in quality(correct me if I am wrong as always) and I have a rounded face type.\n\nAny suggestions for haircuts, routine changes, or things I’m doing wrong would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nTLDR Newbie to hair care, looked at curly girl, not sure about difference between stuff like curl mousse and hair gel. Plan on getting a haircut that is not a buzz cut for once and wanted some advice on what to do,how to cut it, what kid of looks/cuts to pursue, and look for.",

I've tried the Curly Girl routine and this is the result. I've used Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus products for both the shampoo, conditioner, and the gel. I'm kind of clueless about what to try at this point. My goal is really to just wear my hair down to show off the curls like in 99% of the posts on this sub, but my hair doesn't seem to want to do that at all, it'll always rise in a weird way after brushing it down and it'll look very awkward and unnatural. I also think my hair has a lot of trouble retaining moisture; only an hour or so after the last two photos, my hair was looking dry and similar to the first 3 photos again.\n\n\n\nI would really appreciate help to figure out a better routine I could use for healthier hair, as well as even recommendations for what a more flattering hairstyle would be for this kind of hair. I'm too scared to do some irreversible change and mess it all up, so I just play it safe and get a tiny bit off the sides every couple of weeks (although I've missed that since November..).\n\n \n\nI've really struggled to find people with my kind of hair (thin, somewhere between coily/curly, and very prone to damage) so hopefully this post could also help someone down the line. Any advice on my exact hair type would also be very helpful.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry?

      "content": "Hi, I was wondering if anyone has any tips for shine. My face is always shiny, even right after cleansing or, as in these photos, right after applying blotting paper. (The blotting paper does remove some oil — my face, later in the afternoon, does get pretty oily — but a lot of shininess still remains; the same happens when I cleanse.) I don’t think it’s just my face being especially reflective or something like that, bc it’s not like a dry-shiny but rather, as you can see, it’s more of a liquidy-shiny? I’m probably overreacting, but I’ve become really insecure about it. \n\nIs this just the way my skin is (e.g., it’s like a genetics thing) or is there something products-wise I could/should be doing? If it’s the former and there’s nothing I can do about it, I’m cool with going into love-myself mode and deciding to ignore it, but it’s hard to enter that mode when I don’t know whether actually it’s something tactical that I’m doing wrong or could be doing.\n\nAny help/advice would be much appreciated, thanks!\n\n(My skincare routine:  \n*Morning* \\-  \n\\- CeraVe’s Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser (but if I’m not leaving my apt, sometimes I’ll skip the cleanser and just wash with water)  \n\\- moisturizer: La Roche-Posay's Effaclar Mat  \n\\- sunscreen: Murad’s Oil and Pore Control Mattifier SPF 45  \n*Evening* \\-  \n\\- same cleanser  \n\\- moisturizer: Skinfix’s Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream.  \n  \nI’ve used different products before, which I could list out if that’s helpful, but my base shininess is always pretty much the same and has been for a long time. I also used to use Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant about 1-2x/week, but stopped once I started using Cabtreo on my chin (my dermatologist said not to use other actives during Cabtreo).  \n  \nThe shininess doesn’t always appear in photos (I think the camera lens flattens it out or something) and won’t always appear in mirrors, depending on the surrounding lighting; but then I’ll be out walking and catch my reflection in a glass building when the sun is out, or find myself before a certain mirror, and suddenly see all this shine in its full glory, lol.) ",

I’m not a professional at hair care, but I’ve tried basic things before like coconut oil and similar treatments. Unfortunately, the dryness never really improves and every strand seems to have a mind of its own.  \n\n\nI currently use a curl-defining cream, and it does help a bit, my hair looks better compared to nothing ,but it’s still far from what I want. On top of that, most curl creams make my scalp itchy, which is super annoying.\n\nSo I’m looking for alternative solution\n\nI’m open to:  \nHair care routine  \nProduct recommendations  \nTreatments  \nSemi-permanent solutions\n\nIf there’s anything that can last 1–3 weeks, that would honestly be amazing. Even if not, I’m still very open to solid care advice and product suggestions.\n\nThe closer I can get my hair to the style/texture shown below(in the replies), the happier I’ll be.\n\nThanks in advance, I’d really appreciate hearing your experiences and suggestions \n\n",
