Even though I’ll get 5 compliments a day about it at work, they refuse to believe it and tell me that people probably make fun of me. Obviously I don’t agree with them, but I feel like both myself and them would be happier if I found a different way to take care of my curls or a different length layout to make it look a little more styled, as well as stopping some of their comments. Longer bangs are non negotiable, and I also don’t want any fades or tapers because I’m so bored with getting those over and over again. I just want something that can keep some length on the sides and back, while also feeling a bit more tidy or clean. I’ve tried looking all over Google, but nothing really seemed like it would suit me or my head shape. Any ideas?\n\nCurrently, my routine is using a nizoral shampoo and frizz ease conditioner, as well as a Bb curl cream for after I shower. I gently dry with a towel but mainly rely on air drying.",

Even after I brush it, and in general shows massive signs of being curly and just isn’t getting a good routine/is damaged.\n\nAs a chronically ill teen, I kind of rely on my mother for getting hair products and the like, which isn’t great since she’s convinced I grew out of my curls. So, I’ve been thinking about going to a salon specialising in curly hair for their opinion on it.\n\nHowever, my mother can be VERY stubborn about things like this, and we’ve been getting family discounts from my cousin for years, so she’s used to paying \\~£20 for my hair. The place I’m looking at is £105 for the initial appointment (though I have enough money saved to pay for it/the difference).\n\nCurrently my only big pro for her is that my cousin isn’t the best at cutting hair the way we like it (eg you tell him to trim your armpit length hair and you need to watch him to make sure it doesn’t turn into a longer bob). And the other option we occasionally use, her friend, is unreliable with showing up. Neither are particularly good with curly hair from what I’ve seen.\n\nLooking for any other talking points she might listen to.\n\n  \nthanks all &lt;33",

      "content": "[PART 2] of comparing Indian version of skincare products with its foreign counterparts. \n\nToday I tried to compare Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra Indian variant with its USA counterpart. \n\nFrom the first screenshot we can conclude that the USA variant is silicone free and has \"more,\" exactly 5, ingredients which creates \"hydration\" for the skin and has 2 \"less\" ingredients which may cause \"oily skin\".\n\nNow from the second screenshot, the major differences are:\n\nThe Texture:\n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses Silicones (Cyclopentasiloxane and Cyclohexasiloxane). These give the cream a silky, smooth feel that disappears quickly into the skin. It feels more like a velvety finish. \n \nThe Right Side (USA): They swaps these silicones for Natural Plant Oils (Brassica Campestris Seed Oil and Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil). This makes it feel much richer and greasier. It doesn't evaporate quickly, it stays on the surface longer to physically nourish the skin. Which may make it bad for our Indian skin, due to humid climate. \n\nThe Seal: \n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses Stearic Acid and Palmitic Acid. These are fatty acids that create a thick, physical seal on top of your skin. It’s designed to waterproof your skin so moisture can't escape.\n\nThe Right Side (USA): Uses Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and Sodium Citrate. Instead of just sealing the surface, it focuses on soothing irritation and providing antioxidant protection.\n\nThe Emulsifiers:\n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses more traditional, synthetic emulsifiers (PEG-100 Stearate, Steareth-21). These are very stable and give the product a long shelf life and consistent texture.\n\nThe Right Side (USA): Uses Cetearyl Glucoside, It is generally considered more skin-friendly for people with extremely sensitive or eczema-prone skin because it mimics the skin's natural structure.\n\nThis concludes this comparison between two variants of Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra between two different regions. \n\nTo my research a few people claiming that we, here in India, get inferior products as compared to the foreign counterparts, I think it's not inferior at all, it's just made/formulate in such a way that it supports our skins that too in a very humid climate, just like we have here in India as compared to cold weather in any western country!!!\n\nLet me know what you guys think. \n\nP.S. I'm not a dermat, so I cannot fully differentiate between the ingredients list all by myself, so I used Google and Gemini to help me sort things out. If there's any mistake I'd love know in the comments section! ",

      "content": "Hiii senpais, I'm in my early 20s and have been into skincare for a year now. I wanna know if there's anything that I can improve with my skincare routine, as my current products are almost over and I wanna buy better ones.\n\nFor starters, I have oily skin and when i say oily, it means that you could probably deep fry any dish lol &gt;&lt; ( I'm kidding, but it's really oily).\n\nSo this is what my skincare routine looked like till now.\n\nAM:\n\n1. Neutrogena Deep Clean Foaming Cleanser\n\n2. Nivea soft face moisturizer (the white one)\n\n3. Minimalist Spf 50, used this for 3-4 months then switched to Minimalist Spf 50 Light fluid\n\nThe reason i switched is because I noticed that Spf 50 was kinda late to dry and due to me living in a humid region at that time, the sweat washed it away.\n\nBut I did not have this problem with Spf 50 light fluid since it dried relatively fast and also it was not as heavy on my skin as the Spf 50 was.\n\nPM:\n\n1. Neutrogena Deep Clean Foaming Cleanser (the reason i use it twice a day is because I play quite a bit and the dust settles all over my face)\n\n2. IPCA Scar-Kt Advanced gel Serum (this was what my derma suggested since I have small acne scars)\n\n3. Nivea soft face moisturizer (the white one)\n\nAlso a thing I noticed a bit late was that, the sunscreen and the moisturizer made my face look greasy, but the protection they gave was quite good.\n\nSo, this was my routine and I now want to upgrade it a bit.\n\nPlease recommend some products and if i should start using toners/serums.\n\nThank youu \\^\\^!!!",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening?
