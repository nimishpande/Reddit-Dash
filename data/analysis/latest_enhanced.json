      "content": "Hello Curly People! I’ve lurked in this group for about a year now, and finally decided to make my own post. \n\nToday, I tried out the Ulta Hair Analysis (curiosity), and I was shocked that it said my hair was mostly wavy and only 2% curlies. I think it’s very wrong. My hair is mostly 3B curls, I think, with some 3A and a couple 3C curls for funzies. Am I crazy?! Is the app crazy? Anyone else get weird, inconsistent results either this app? Definitely hoping for the latter, hah!\n\nI’ve had very short, curly hair with teeny tiny baby bangs most of my whole life. A few years ago, I decided to see what my hair would look like if I grew it out. Now that I’m getting older and have some grey hairs, it’s so fun to watch as it swirls with the curls. I’m also learning how to diffuse and am looking for my favorite products/ gels. \n\nAnyways, if you have similar hair to mine, what’s your favorite cream and gel? \n\nRoutine: Usually, I shampoo/condition w/ either Redken frizz dismiss, Biolage Hydration, or Ouai for medium hair. \n\nThen, I use Unite/Boing Curl 7-Seconds detangler spray (right after the shower, brush upside-down while wet), scrunch with Pattern Leave-in Conditioner (still upside-down), and Curl Keeper liquid gel (upside-down). I just ran out of the Curl Keeper gel, and have been trying out Eco Gel. \n\nAfter upside-down scrunching, I flip my hair back, and diffuse by cupping the curls up to my scalp until mostly dry or I let my hair air dry. It takes a long time to dry. Still learning how to care for my hair as it gets longer and more grays appear.\n\nHappy New Years, my curly headed folks!",

      "content": "Okay, so like a year ago I made a post realizing that my haircut was basically doing all the heavy lifting for my appearance.\n\nOld post for context: [Did I just realize I’m only cute because of my bob?](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXIndia/comments/1h06jlg/did_i_just_realize_im_only_cute_because_of_my_bob/)\n\nWell, fast forward to now (I’m 22). I decided to grow it out. Partly because I wanted a change, and partly because my boyfriend was getting a little too weirdly obsessed with it (that’s a whole other drama lol).\n\nBut now that my hair is shoulder length and \"normal\"... I feel invisible??\n\nI swear, when I had that bob, I could roll out of bed in an oversized t-shirt and look \"chic\" or \"artsy.\" Now when I roll out of bed, I just look like a mess. I look in the mirror and I don't see \"that girl\" anymore, I just see... me. And it’s boring.\n\nI remember asking in my old post, \"Is the bob doing all the work?\" and I think I found the answer. YES. It was. The bob was the main character and I was just the host body.\n\nI have this insane urge to chop it all off again. I miss feeling effortless. I miss the \"vibe\" I had. But I also worked so hard to grow it out, and everyone says long hair is prettier/more versatile/whatever.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this? Did you go back to the short hair, or is this just a phase where I need to learn to style my long hair better? I feel like I lost my superpowers.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I use miccelar water instead.\n\nMy hydration routine is simple: Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream morning and evening after washing face, I also tried using a second moisturizer before this one for extra hydration - Skin1004 Centella Hyalu-cica Moisture Cream. It is not helping much, I think maybe I need some kind of serum instead? I’ve used The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Serum in the past, I think it helped with hydration, but my skin felt bumpy while using it.\n\nIt is winter right now where I live, during summer my face is more balanced, sometimes a bit oily around nose.\n\nAny recommendations to manage tightness and flakiness, and clear up the tiny bumps on chin and forehead?",

      "content": "I'll be 22 years old in a month. I've used a low dose of retinol by the brand Good Molecules about a year ago but wasn't consistent with it for more than 2 weeks. I'm American but have been living in Korea for a month now and will continue to be here for one more month before heading back home. Of course with my stay here, I have completely dove into all the K beauty having a full skin care routine for the first time in a year. I've used chemicals and had a very consistent skincare routine for a while before taking this year long hiatus from everything other than a basic skin cleanser so my skin isn't sensitive to chemicals on the face. With that being said, i've now been using this 5X retinol complex + PCL serum by CNP Lab for a month now in my nighttime skincare routine with no problems of sensitivity, burning, or peeling. In fact I've noticed the fine lines I do have reduce a lot. Of course I'm using other products such a hyaluronic acid, sunscreen, vitamin C, and others that also probably add to my improvement in overall skin texture. I started using retinol based products as preventative skin aging, and have seen that it's okay and sometimes recommended to start in your 20's, but I'm also seeing things about how it can have the opposite effect and reduce natural collagen production in the skin the older I get. I've been feeling and looking fine now but it has only been a month of these products, also i'm not using a straight retinol now but more so a retinol complex. Am I okay to continue use? Or should I stop before I create damage?\n\nI have an oily T-zone, the rest of my face is just normal. Not too dry, not too oily. I don't really have issues with acne other than the occasional pimple around my menstruation cycle. I am however more prone to blackheads, clogged pores, and textured skin, but my routine so far has seemed to help with all of those. I don't know if this matters but I'm mixed with black and white so i'm rather tan, but I know everyone should use products to prevent sun damage no matter what complexion you are, so I am religious about sunscreen use. ESPECIALLY with using chemicals like retinoids.",

Third day it’s red with some pimples with pus/just red remaining.\n\nNot sure if it’s fungal or hormonal, I’ve never broken out like all of my life, there’s some itching and burning occasionally. Previously was using tactupump as a topical acne cream, continued to use it and got prescribed antibiotics. Been also using the anti-dandruff nizoral shampoo.\n\nDon’t know what to do, if anyone has suggestions or had a similar experience please help",

I believe I have medium porosity, medium density and medium/coarse finish. My routine for this result was in order: Aveeno Apple Cider Vinegar Clarifying Shampoo, OGX Volumising Biotin &amp; Collagen Shampoo, Moogoo Milk Protein Coditioner (scrunched out with water), Microplopped with a cotton shirt until damp, Cake Curl Crush Jelly Scrunched in on damp hair (admittedly I didn't use a lot because I was scared it would be way too crunchy) and diffused upright leaning over slightly. Is there anything better I coild be using instead? Particularly shampoo. I really want to try a protein mask aswell and i have bought the curlsmith bond repair salve to try, do I use it before or after shampoo? I plan on getting a haircut soon too so if there's any advice on what to ask for in terms of a cut that will enhance my waves but keep a decent amount of length let me know! 🙏🫶",

I wanted to buy a moisturiser- which is not so expensive but also doesn’t have actives; god forbid it’s my mistake! Bcoz nothing is available easily. Even a plain moisturiser has vitamin C. Why?? Plain products are available only at a very higher price; mid and lower ranges are filled with unwanted acids. Even if it is available without acids- 2 months later the company rebrands and remakes the same cream as “enriched with hyalaron”.. ! Is it compulsively “essential” to use acids nowadays? Why is this trend emerging I don’t get it. Or is it just companies catering to the growing demands? \n\nAnd also please name some moisturisers (not those which will break my pocket) which are lightweight on skin, and actives free. ",

(which I also hate the feeling of but thats another story..) not really any refresh routine. thank you! ",
