I left it short (and cut it myself) for most of my life, but have been growing it long the last 10 years... I'm not fully sure why since I'm so dissatisfied with it, but I think also because I've gained a lot of weight after some psychiatric issues and I always promised myself if I lost the weight, I'd lose the hair too - that would be my prize. \n\n**I would love ideas how to firm up the curls or make it not look like it looks now in the absolute easiest way possible**. It gets very frizzy (I don't mind some frizz tho), but it's the partial stringy curls that drive me crazy. I DO box dye my hair because I have very little money to spend on myself and not dyeing it monthly is *not* an option. \n\nI know myself and I will not spend a lot of time on my hair. A very solid 90% of the time, my hair is up in a bun because it looks like this. Do I even have options? 😭\n\nRoutine: Wash &amp; condition with L'Oreal Ever Strong Sulfate-Free Thickening duo, scrunch w/ Miss Jessie's Coily Custard, air dry preferably/diffuse usually... also not usually parted in the middle",

Back in my teen years I tried every product and technique (thanks to OG YouTube) to get any kind of curl — and oh man, the results were awful. To be fair, I had absolutely no clue what I was doing and zero knowledge about hair care ahaha\n\nEventually I gave up and started heat-curling my hair almost every day for years. \n\nFast forward to now — I’m 28 and haven’t used any heat tools for 2–3 years, but I always do some kind of heatless curls method (my hair takes “shape” super easily and keeps it for days, if that makes sense).\n\nPIC 1: Hair air-dried with my normal routine (some kind of moisturizing serum, leave-in conditioner, and hair oil — I gently brush between each step to spread the product). It’s basically a bird’s nest. Straight but also so poofy and frizzy. Honestly could be cast as Hagrid.\n\nPIC 2: Next-day hair after my “heatless curls” method (aka a loose bun with a big scrunchie).\n\nPIC 3-4-5: Wash day (today). After seeing a post here — and still secretly hoping I might have a hidden wavy pattern — I decided not to brush after washing. I just sprayed some moisturizing stuff and scrunched in my leave-in conditioner. Air-dried (about 90% dry in the pics)...\nWHAT IN THE WORLD?? DO I ACTUALLY HAVE WAVY HAIR?!\n\nI’m so excited!!!! But I have no idea what to do next. I’m looking for any advice on how to build a routine and make the most of these waves. I know nothing. This is literally day one for me and I’m ready to learn \n\nWould also love product recs — affordable stuff I can find easily in Canada would be amazing!\n\nOther info:\n\n- My hair is very thick and there’s a ton of it\n\n- It’s always been dry and frizzy so I usually stick to hydrating products\n\n- I got highlights done (once) a few years ago, nothing else color-wise\n\n- I’ve got a couple split ends so I know it’s trim time, but honestly it’s pretty healthy despite it looking like a horse’s dinner\n\n**** I'm an autistic burned-out girlie that gets easily overwhelmed with online interaction so I promise I'll read every/any comment but may not be commenting a whole lot myself",

That's all I've been using. Literally the same exact product every single day and as you can see the curls aren't defined anymore. They're not shiny anymore. They're not glowing. My hair now just looks not good at all. I don't like the way it looks and I just want to know what's going on. \n\nMy day to day steps I’m not like strict or nothing like that I would just use shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie, or actually I would use the as I am product it’s like a clayish tan looking product and that helped but now i feel like it doesn’t do much and I’ve never used any conditioner nor would I be specific about my shampoo I would just use like a dove brand shampoo for as long as I can remember like years and I would dry it with a towel like till it was damp and apply the product and just let it air dry after and I’ve done the same routine for VERY long ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Over the past 6-7 months, the curl pattern on top of my head has basically become nonexistent and it frustrates me so much. I've tried so many things to bring it back and am not 100% sure why this happened, and frustrated because the bottom half of my hair curls just fine?? Even though it has friction damage and split ends?? I have a haircut scheduled on Wednesday with a curl specialist I haven't seen for a while due to distance/pricing, and I'm hoping she'll be able to help.\n\nThe first three pictures are from October 2024, and then pictures 4-8 are all from the past 2-3 months, with the last one being the most recent.\n\nMy main guess is that my haircut I get changed. Previously it seemed like the gal who cut my hair was doing more of a curly cut, whereas the person I've been seeing for the past few months has been doing more of a mullet/shag cut with razor, which I really love for fine texturing but is it possible that it could make the hair have a hard time curling?\n\nThe only chemical changes that I have done to my hair are continue to bleach my bangs and the side pieces on my hair, which in October 2024 was being done professionally, and as of the past 1-2 months, add in color, but the top layers were flat even before I added color.\n\nEven when I get out of the shower with freshly clean hair or scrunch the top layer with products, it just won't curl. The most I get is a wave or it stays limp. \n\nI use a variety of products since I've been trying to figure out how to bring it back. Here's my routine:\n\n1. Shampoo: Typically use Innersense Pure Harmony Hairbath, but yesterday I bought Olaplex No.4 (bond maintenance shampoo) if clarifying, which I do once a month, I use the Kristin Ess Deep Clean Clarifying Shampoo\n\n2. Conditioner: Innersense Hydrating Cream Conditioner. I also have the Olaplex No.5 Bond Maintenance conditioner but haven't used it yet.\n\n3. Other products (leave-ins): Typically use some form of leave-in conditioner after showering which is the Innersense Leave-In. I also use Not Your Mother's Bonding Leave-In Protector. Today, I used the K18 Leave-In Molecule Repair Hair Mask. \n\n4: Other products (styling): AG Care Foam Weightless Volumizer w/Heat Protectant, Innersense I Create Curl Memory (although I've been too lazy to use it recently), topped off with either Verb Ghost Oil OR Trader Joe's Pure Jojoba oil.\n\n5. Drying method: InfinitiPro Diffuser by Conair, low air, cool heat. Hover for the first 5-10 minutes, then pick up curls into the diffuser cup and hold for about 1-2 mins, repeat around head until 80-90% dry. Scrunch with oil when 100% dry.\n\n6. Anything else to know?: I have high porosity hair, so I try to keep a balance of moisture and protein which has always been difficult for me. I've been trying to grow my hair out for forever but always have to get the ends cut because of split ends and damage from friction due to sleeping with no protection. As of the past 2 weeks, I've started to wrap my hair in a silk scarf and put a bonnet over it when I sleep. When I'm not sleeping, I'm usually wearing my hair down. I use the BounceCurl brush to 'clump' and style my curls once the product is in, and it makes my bottoms layers curl nicely, but it just makes the top even more straight, no matter what angle I use or how I curl the brush.

      "content": "I got my trichoscopy report recently and it left me with some questions. My dermatologist believes my hair loss isn’t due to AGA but rather mechanical shedding caused by seborrheic dermatitis.\n\nHere’s the context:\n\t•\tI’ve had seb derm for years, but this summer I went through my worst flare-up ever.\n\t•\tMy scalp (especially the frontal mid and left temple) was completely covered with thick crusts for over a year.\n\t•\tWhen I finally started corticosteroid treatment, those crusts came off together with a lot of hair — I’d estimate maybe 1500–2000 hairs in a short period(15-20 days) with the each seb derm flakes that came out. \n\t•\tInterestingly, the areas where crusts were the worst are exactly where seem to have less density and fewer hairs per follicular unit.\n\nNow the trichoscopy data (Frontal region):\n\t•\tHair density: 143 hairs/cm²\n\t•\tAverage hair shaft diameter: 63 µm\n\t•\tVellus hairs (&lt; 30 µm): 5%\n\t•\tMid hairs (30–50 µm): 20%\n\t•\tThick hairs (&gt; 50 µm): 75%\n\t•\tFollicular units with one hair: 33%\n\t•\tFollicular units with two hairs: 49%\n\t•\tFollicular units with three or more hairs: 17%\n\nSummary:\nThere’s minimal to no miniaturization — the frontal and occipital regions have nearly identical hair thickness distribution (63 µm vs 61 µm average diameter, 5–6% vellus hairs).\n\n\nMy dermatologist said this pattern — low miniaturization but reduced hair count and fewer hairs per FU— fits a mechanical loss / seb derm-related telogen effluvium, not AGA.\nShe prescribed 5% minoxidil foam for the empty areas, saying it might help speed up regrowth.\nShe also told me that, since there’s no real DHT pattern and pressure for the follicules, I won’t lose those hairs again if I stop minoxidil later.\n\nI’m still a bit skeptical though.\nCan diffuse or patchy thinning like this really happen without miniaturization and still not be AGA?\nMy hair is everywhere normal but less dense in some parts of my scalp. Would you start minoxidil in my place or just wait to see if it fills in naturally?\n",

But after I placed the order, the order summary showed the serum as 10ml.\n\nWhen I contacted Nykaa customer care, they said I didn’t order a combo — that I ordered the items individually. But in my order list, it clearly says “combo”, and even the price matches the combo listing.\n\nWhen I sent screenshots to prove it, the support agent just disconnected and closed the chat. One agent even said that there’s “no such combo,” so I shared the product link (which is still live on the website!) — and again, they ended the chat.\n\nHonestly, this was one of the worst experiences I’ve had with Nykaa. Their customer service is terrible and seems to avoid taking responsibility for misleading listings.\n\nJust posting this here so others are aware — please double-check before ordering combos from Nykaa.",
