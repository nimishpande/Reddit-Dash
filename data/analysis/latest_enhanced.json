      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Minimalist Sunscreen SPF 50\n\nThe “everyday reliable coworker” of sunscreens  never misses a deadline but lacks personality.\n\nLightweight and budget-friendly, but that alcohol smell lingers longer than your ex’s texts.\n\nVerdict: Solid performer, no spark.\n\n\n\n3. Fixderma Shadow SPF 50\n\nMore like Thickderma. Great protection, but the texture could double as cake batter.\n\nIf you’re oily-skinned, this will have you looking like you moisturized with candle wax.\n\nVerdict: Best for dry skin winters only.\n\n\n\n4. Re’equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch\n\nMatte? Yes. Dry touch? Sure. Comfortable? That’s a no.\n\nIt’s like applying successively smaller layers of chalk.\n\nBut hey, it’s one of the few that actually controls sweat.\n\nVerdict: Good for Athletes. Functional, not romantic.\n\n\n\n5. Dot &amp; Key Watermelon Cooling Sunscreen\n\nSmells great, feels cute, and then proceeds to melt faster than your patience in Delhi summer.\n\nGood for “I’m-just-running-to-the-café” days, not for actual sun exposure.\n\nVerdict: Influencer energy, not athlete energy.",

However, this has caused my skin to become dry and flaky, which is expected. She also recommended using a sunscreen with iron oxides, so I’m on the hunt for a tinted sunscreen.\n\nI’ve tried the Live Tinted and absolutely loved how hydrating it was without being sticky.

It's completely different now (next 3 pictures). It used to clump together nicely, now it’s just stringy and wirier even when I use leave in regularly. it feels thinner especially on the sides too and it just feels really frizzy most of the time.\n\n routine:  I currently use Camille rose leave in everyday on wet hair after wetting it in the shower,  then leave to air dry throughout the day, I don't touch my hair with a towel. I shampoo and conditioner 1-2x a week using as I am long and luxe the pomegranate and passionfruit one. please advice as to  what is wrong with my hair? is it damaged? Has my curl pattern changed? do I need to better my routine? any advice helps please. \n\nFirst 3 photos are my hair at the start of the year, nice and full and clumped together. Next 3 photos are my hair over last couple of weeks really stringy and damaged looking.  I also think I do have low porosity hair as it takes a lot of water for it get to get fully soaked and it takes a while to fully dry, but at this point im so lost im not even sure. \n\nNote : I have moved to a colder climate at the start of this year so could it be to with that? Or maybe something to do with stress or hormones? (19M)\n\nPlease any advice would be great , feeling a bit stuck right now and just want my hair to return to how it was at the start of the year. ",

Also, i live in the southeast so the moment i spend a day outside, i come home and its practically over. I turn to the mirror and see: BUSH. Well, at least its a pink bush now. \n\nCurrent routine: wash every 3-5 days. Sometimes 1 week because i procrastinate. Two types of shampoo and i only do my scalp + conditioner on the ends which i let rest for at least 5 min. Rinse out. been trying to use lukewarm water at the least. Then if i feel like it, i use the curl talk gel + mousse and maybe a lil oil on my ends. Nothing crazy. I sleep in a ponytail. Thats probably not a great idea but i cant get used to bonnets and there seem to be so many sleep methods/products/bla bla out there that i get overhwelmed asfuck. Pls help. ",
