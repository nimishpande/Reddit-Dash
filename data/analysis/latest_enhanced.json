I’ve aged, bleached/colored it (though I stopped doing anything to it about a year ago), and had a baby. \n\nI did the strand-in-water test and it floated on the surface so it’s apparently low porosity although it dries very quickly. I have had hairdressers say I have a lot of hair but the strands themselves are very fine. \n\nThe photos show my hair air dried after using my regular routine of OGX Bond Protein Repair shampoo and L’Oréal Elvive renewing conditioner. I wash it every other day because if I go two days or more my scalp gets very greasy. \n\nI live in a very dry climate and when I go to humid places it definitely forms more of a curl which tells me it needs a lot more moisture but I haven’t found a conditioner that won’t weigh it down a lot. \n\nI’d love to see what it would look like with the waves/curls more well defined. I would sure appreciate any product, routine, or cut and style advice!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

The clogged pores/blackhead situation is significantly better than it used to be.\n\n\n\nThe downside to this is that so much exfoliating and extracting has started to permanently scar/wrinkle my nose. These definitely aren't normal age wrinkles, I'm young. When I first started noticing the scars/wrinkles, I switched to a less gritty/harsh exfoliator (recommended by the esthetician) and started using snail mucin in addition to my normal moisturizer (also esthetician recommended). \n\n  \nIs there anything else I could/should be doing? I wanna try to get ahead of this if possible. Is there anything else I can do to fix, conceal, or prevent this scarring? Something that will make the texture of my nose look more smooth and young like it used to. But it’s gotta be something that won’t make my pores clog up again.

There were a couple of feeble attempts where I half way did or skipped some steps and would give up when it didn’t work, not to try again for months or years. Tonight I had a wave of determination and tried again. \n\nMy routine was first I shampooed twice with head and shoulders shampoo and then used suave conditioner and detangled(I know, broke college student here, not the best stuff). With wet, detangled hair, I put in some not your mothers curl talk mousse(after heat protectant). Then I used not your mothers beach babe sea salt spray, scrunched, then diffused after starting the dry without touching or disrupting my hair(hovering over it, idk?). These are just the leftover products I had laying around and know I will likely need to try different products. My hair also probably could have been wetter, the idea to try to get wavy hair happened after my hair had partially air dried and I sprayed it down with water again, but it definitely wasn’t soaked, probably one of my mistakes for sure. After diffusing, this is what I ended up with. It is still slightly damp is some places, but overall dry. I can see a definite texture and even some nice “curls” at the base of my neck. How can I improve this and get it looking even better?! Looking for any tips, tricks, products, or things to avoid! \n\nFor reference, I have pretty fine hair, but quite a bit of it. It struggles to hold a style and is typically pretty flat, but will get a bit frizzy and start to sort of curl on the edges when it’s really humid(I live in a pretty humid place and this is one thing that led me to suspect I had a pattern). I also have people in my immediate family with curly hair. I currently don’t do anything to “take care” of my hair, mainly because I’m busy but also because this is the first time I’ve confirmed it could actually do something like this!",

I could really use some advice about my hair.\n\nI’m a 26-year-old South Asian male with naturally wavy hair, and I’ve recently been trying to put more effort into my hair care routine. My biggest struggle right now is frizz, and I’m having a hard time figuring out how to manage it.\n\nI currently wash my hair twice a week since it tends to get dry. These are the products I’m using:\n\n* **Shampoo:** &amp;honey Deep Moisturizing Shampoo\n* **Hair mask:** Fino Hair Mask\n* **Oil:** 100% Camellia oil\n\nWhile these help with moisture, frizz is still my main issue. I’m looking for something I could use daily that would help style my hair while also controlling frizz.\n\nI’ve tried curl creams specifically Umberto Giannini Curl Crème. It does define my waves, but it also makes my hair feel matte and still somewhat frizzy.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions or tips on how to better manage frizz (especially for wavy hair), I’d really appreciate it.\n\nThanks in advance!",
