      "content": "I’ve been using the Dot &amp; Key Vitamin C + SPF 50 sunscreen for a month straight. I bought it after seeing all the ads and I regretted it for a sec much since everyone bashed it but honestly, here is my hot take based just on my experience: \n\nPros: Leaves no white cast on my face. I layer it with a Serum, Moisturizer and then sunscreen but it hardly feels oily (maybe cuz I have dull skin). The texture feels good on the skin and mixes well. Feels very light. I hate the feeling of being plastered when I apply sunscreen so this felt good for a change.\n\nCons: Everyone keeps saying the SPF protection is not as good. I personally didn’t feel that way, since my face didn’t get any darker. It did give it a subtle suppleness, and i am getting no unwanted tan yet either. \n\nI think i’m gonna stick with it irrespective of what i might hear, if something works for you- it works! It is what it is. \n",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Still, I’d love suggestions I can actually find here too.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n- Help understanding my porosity\n- A simple routine suggestion\n- Recommendations for a good leave-in and curl cream (priority!)\n- Any other product ideas that could help with dryness/frizz\n\nWhat I currently use:\n\nMielle Rosemary Mint (as a clarifying once every one to 2 weeks) + Aussie Miracle Moist shampoos, Aussie deep hydration conditioner, Lush Super Milk (Leave in spray), Garnier Banana Hair Food (kinda as a leave in/curl cream), ECO Gel, some oils (Amla, Castor), and Aussie heat protectant before diffusing.\n\nWhat I want to try next:\n\nThinking of buying the SheaMoisture Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Mask for deep hydration. If you’ve used it on hair like mine, please tell me if it’s worth it!\n\nMy main issues: very dry, frizzy, moisture-sucking curls that don’t hold definition well.\n\nThank you so much for any help 💛\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I’m not sure of my curl type and porosity and I need help building a routine. All good recommendations are welcome, especially for a leave-in and a curl cream. ",

Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to find a curly hair stylist near me, so I’m hoping to DIY my looks.\n\nI’m aiming for three different styles across events:\n1) A loose, romantic bun (if it’s possible with my length)\n2) A half-up half-down style\n3) A natural curls-down look that can survive hours of dancing \n\nWhat I'm struggling with is that most tutorials I’m finding are either for much longer curls or assume I already know what I’m doing, which I do not. \n\nSo I’m looking for:\n- Beginner friendly curly hair updo tutorials (if it says twist the front sections back, I would love to know how to actually do that without looking like a mess)\n- Tips or hacks for short-to-medium curly hair\n- Products for strong hold (happy to use non-CG hairspray if needed)\n\nMy other big concern is if I use strong hold hairspray/gel for the bun or half-up style earlier, will that ruin definition for the final curls-down day? Or is there a way to reset without fully washing again?\n\nAny advice, product recs, easy step-by-step guides, or “don’t make the mistake I did” stories are very appreciated!\n\nThank you from a stressed out but determined bride-to-be ✨ \n\nRoutine: \nI wash with a generic shampoo and the Cantu shea butter conditioner a couple of times a week (endurance sports + swimming). I then use the Asbha leave in conditioner and gel when wet, scrunch with a tshirt, lightly diffuse and then allow to air dry completely. Apart from this, I use satin pillowcases protect my hair while sleeping.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Any help/ advice/ recommendations would be appreciated! \n\nTheir hair care routine is as follows\n\n1.Right now they just use regular shampoo and conditioner from the grocery store, most of the time it is Pantene i believe. \n\n2.they do not use any products pre or post shower\n\n3.they usually let it air dry. \n\n4. they have never gotten it colored or dyed\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/om7ojg7f2g5g1.jpg?width=1165&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d50f0c1437ce3368364169f19d6b2ad74de4113\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3mbzhg7f2g5g1.jpg?width=1323&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8500cadcb22501e2604772834641019ffca25233\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/92lbog7f2g5g1.jpg?width=1018&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cd28aace27c85ff8c3dd0b2cc2fb53470e3c9b2\n\n",

It tends to disappear after a minute, but if it’s a day where I’ve been smiling a lot it can take up until the next morning for it to disappear. Maybe it’s only on one side of my face from sleeping more on that side? Or from having a bit of a crooked smile? Not sure\n\nI’m pretty new to skin care so not really sure what I’m doing. My routine right now is perhaps minimal - I use a moisturizer at night, one in the morning with a korean SPF, and I’ve started a retinal.\n\nI’m really scared of it quickly becoming a deep permanent line. Am I aging too fast? I definitely have fair skin that burned a lot in my youth, wearing daily SPF wasn’t a thing I knew to do until the past year 😭 RIP\n\nAny advice appreciated! \n",

It could be ingrown hairs, razor bumps, shaving irritation, pigmentation, or marks left from old acne. The area feels like it has a lot of tiny clogged pores or trapped hair roots. I want to understand what this condition actually is so I can fix it properly. If anyone has had something similar or knows what this might be, please tell me.

I’ve been trying to focus on my curls for the last 5 months it seems and it’s definitely gotten better, but this is a stage I’m stuck in now where it’s curly but also oddly thin? I’m very new at this so I’m not even sure what type of hair I have in terms of curl pattern. Is there a different haircut that I could maybe try? I feel a little meh about the whole thinning/thin thing because my hair i hold very near and dear to my heart. I included photos of my hair in 2023 because I feel like it was much thicker then. I did not use any products at the time nor was I focused on hair care like that sadly. \n\nI was overexercising for a hot second there (about 3-4 months) without proper nutrition which is when I noticed a ton of shedding/loss. I’ve been eating normally and back on track for about 7 months now. I put my routine below in order of how I do it! The photos I have here I blow dried with an adapter because of the cold weather,  which I don’t typically do. I usually let it air dry after I put the products in. I appreciate any and all advice 🫶🏻 \n\nshampoo/conditioner: dove intensive repair \nleave in: next of us low porosity leave-in conditioner \nmousse: not your mothers activating curl talk \ngel: curls blueberry bliss curl control jelly \n(Sometimes I alternate the gel and mousse) \n",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
