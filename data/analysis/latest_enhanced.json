I’m trying to achieve even 10% of what she has.\n\nI am currently on day 3 after washing. My current routine for this week was: I shampoo with moisturizing curl talk shampoo, then I do Mielle rosemary mint strengthening hair mask. Then I do 3-in-1 Curl Talk conditioner and don’t fully wash it out and squish in a bit to my ends before exiting the shower.\n\nThen I praying hands Pattern styling custard and drag it through a bit on top.  I then use them bounce curl clips while diffusing on warm setting for heat and low intensity with minimal movement to set the curls. I fluff out the roots after dry with the bounce curl volume comb. I scrunch in Ouai hair oil once dry.\n\nToday I sectioned my hair out while using tresemme keratin smooth weightless anti-frizz finishing spray at the roots and using the bounce curl volume comb diffusing where I sprayed after using the comb on low cold setting to set the spray.\n\nI’m pretty happy with the results, but looking for more tips if anyone has any? \n\nI may just need a hair cut. I just can’t seem the back to achieve the same volume at the back that I get around my face. At the side part it seems flat as well.  Amy other hair spray, how to cut the hair (I just cut my own hair how I feel like, so I’m not scared to try), or technique tips?\n\nI also want to understand how they do her lazy messy updo (see photo)??? I’m totally lost on how that is achieved.\n\n\n",

My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily.\n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Hope you are doing good I'm here after hesitating a lot and I want other people's input. So I have had really bad experiences with dermatologists where I live, where they go for your money 99% of the time. Or they gave me things that were completely useless. I had a really good dermatologist back where I used to live and took accutane for about a year which did miracles on me (when I was 16). But now I'm almost 21 and still have acne every here and there (don't know why? But I'm working on my diet currently) and have redness sometimes, and also as you can see A LOT of blackheads. I wash my face twice a day (double cleanse at night) using a product containing salicylic acid and an oil cleanser (at night) and I also use spf everyday and moisturizer. Bare minimum pretty much. I do drink a lot of water also if that's important and don't eat much junk. I have been trying to work on myself and looks lately and decided to invest in myself (financially as well) as it helps me a lot with my mental health, and found affordable places where I can get hydrafacial done (thought it would be good to cleanse my face and my pores for the blackheads), also microneedling which could help with acne. My skin is sensitive btw! I'm open to your suggestions and advices, please remain nice and respectful :))\n\n",

I don’t know what to do to fix this.\n\nMy routine: \n\n•shampoo (garnier fructis) my roots, rinse\n\n• put conditioner in (also garnier) and brush/detangle, rinse \n\n• immediately put a palmful of mousse (cantu) by doing the praying hands (very carefully) and squishing\n\n• la croa curl jelly, about 1/3 of my finger, again by light praying hands and squishing\n\n• plop for a few minutes while i put my clothes on\n\n• diffuse by hovering — first the roots, then the rest of my hair, then pixie diffuse\n\nI’d appreciate any advice!! :’D",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I do not apply the moisturizer directly on my eyelids or very close to my eyes.\n\nThe burning starts shortly after application and feels uncomfortable.

      "content": "Hello yall! This year for Christmas I received the following products!! I usually use La Rouche Poussay, but my family bought me these incredible Korean products to upgrade my routine. I’m fairly well versed in skincare, but I’m having trouble making out a new system / skincare routine when it comes to adding Differin.\n\nI have never used Differin before, how would you guys recommend I go about incorporating it to my routine?\n\nSo far, I am thinking I will use the bean mask 1x/2x a week, wash, use the pore toner pads, then apply the PDRN pink collagen exosome serum, and from there it’s a bit up in the air. My skin is fairly oily, but sensitive, so while it’s strong enough to test out the other products, incorporating the Differin is what’s giving me some spooky feelings. Don’t want to damage my skin barrier! I was gifted the Red Bean Water Gel in case I needed some extra hydration to “sandwich” the Differin, so there’s that option too! (Not sure what it means to sandwich the Differin)\n\nThank you guys for any help, I am sorry for any mistakes, this is my first post onto this forum and I am not familiar with reddit too well. (Lurker not a poster 😩😅)",

      "content": "Hello! \n\nIt’s my first time trying to use the curly hair products on my hair. I’m even confused what kind of hair type I have, my guess is 2a but idk 🤷‍♀️ After everything the hair doesn’t look good, it just looks like a bird’s nest and like I haven’t brushed it for a long time, the waves don’t look good. Also, the bottom of my hair is wavier than the top. Could anyone please advise me what went wrong in the routine, what products don’t fit my hair type, maybe are too heavy. I pretended my whole life that my hair is kind of straight, so I have no clue how to go about this. Thank you in advance 🙏 Step by step routine in the shower:\n\n1. Shampooed my hair twice. Didn’t touch the ends, only roots and mids. (Didn’t use a shampoo specifically for curly hair because I don’t have one)\n\n2. Used conditioner on my hair starting from mids to ends. Brushed through my hair and detangled with a wet brush (regular one, not for curly hair) starting from bottom and going up.\n\n3. Washed out the conditioner. Put curl cream (the pink tub from Fenti hair) on my hand and raked it through my hair (used the amount advised by the pinky to thumb method while hugging your hair, idk how to explain it 🤷‍♀️). Brushed through my hair again to distribute the product. Scrunched my hair up with some water\n\n4. Added some Curl Jelly gel by Umberto Giannini on my palms (I have a feeling I didn’t use enough) and raked it through my hair starting from mids to ends, scrunched it up and pulsed 3 times.\n\n5. Went in with the curl styling brush (I watched tutorials on youtube how to use it but I’m not confident that I did it the right way anyway)\n\n6. Started drying my hair by hovering the diffuser over my roots and then moved on to the ends. When I felt the cast harden, started pushing my strands up with the diffuser (confused if I did this part right too). When I pushed the strand up, I held it for like 10 secs in place and let go. Finished drying my hair like this\n\nThe results are as you can see in the picture and I don’t think it looks that good 😭😭 Even considering going back to keeping my hair as is without any product. Please help 🙏 ",

I'm on the third one now and it's almost finished. It has helped me a lot, and currently I'm also doing PRP and taking 1.25 mg minoxidil and 1 mg oral finasteride daily. I’ll also start derma rolling soon.\n\nEven though my doctor originally prescribed only three bottles, I want to keep using the shampoo until at least my fifth bottle or so, because it really helps my scalp health and I still see some issues.
