      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi guys!! Posting here because I’m really at a loss for what’s going on with my hair lately. To start, I want to add context to the pictures I added. First picture was taken a few weeks ago, second picture back in August, and third picture 3 years ago today. \nI’ve noticed recently that the following things hace been changing with my hair: \n- the area of my hair that used to have the tightest curls, my crown and my bangs, are noticeably looser and don’t hold as long, if at all. I have to finger coil my crown area to get anything. \n- my wash-and-go’s, which used to last over a month if i allowed it, hardly last two weeks without needing to be refreshed. \n- more breakage when i detangle \n- i have to fight my hair to hold volume when before i used to have to fight my hair to NOT be huge. \n- the products i used to love and adore are mediocre now. \n\nI also want to include that I RARELY straighten my hair (last time was over a year ago), and usually use low heat to diffuse, so heat damage can’t be the issue. I dont do tight hairstyles, hardly do ponytails ever. I sleep on a satin pillowcase, the same kind I’ve been using for years (even when the 3 year old pic was taken). I’ve been on hormonal birth control for over two years (and have not noticed any real change in anything that hormones might affect. My skin is still the same as always, and my cycle has always been regular anyways). I don’t frequently cut my hair, I actually used to cut it more back when the 3 year old pic was taken, so I’m ruling out curl shock as a factor too. \nI wash my hair every 1-2 weeks usually with a cleansing conditioner. I shampoo only 1/2 times a month and use a clarifying shampoo shampoo for one of those days. I use hair masks frequently, either for protein or hydration, for maybe 20 minutes after I shampoo (maybe protein overload? Over hydration?). The only thing I can think of that is messing with my hair is the brand I use…Shea moisture. Mind you, I’ve been using this brand for 7 years and it worked super well even after the CEO and formula changes. But not now. \n\nMy routine has always remained the same: shampoo twice (if I do shampoo), detangle with conditioner using a tangle teezer, use a mask of some sort, wash out with ice cold water. Use a leave in conditioner and section my hair to get maximum definition. Diffuse or air dry after scrunchie with a microfiber towel. \n\nI guess I’m asking if you guys have had similar experience with this brand, and if it makes sense for me to point these changes to me using products that are actually hurting my hair rather than helping it. I would also appreciate if you guys can recommend black owned hair products/brands that I can look into as well. \nThank you for reading my novel!! I appreciate everyone who took the time to read :) \n",

      "content": "For background, I’m 38, female, have had acne most of my life, but the past few months feel like it’s gotten bad. So last week I started using Differin Gel on my most problematic areas (including behind my ears, because I’m suddenly breaking out there, too.), mostly my chin, above my lips, and my cheeks.\n\nThree days after starting, my skin started itching behind my ears. The next day my whole face started itching and I realized it was probably the Differin. I have stopped using it since then (Saturday, it’s not Tuesday). Today, my skin is red and very dry. Upon research, I realized I should’ve started much slower with it than I did. So here’s my question: should I give some time for the redness and dryness to fade and then slowly add it back into my routine, or is this more like an allergy?\n\nMy routine (PM):\n1.\t⁠Oil cleanse with Bubble oil cleanser (usually leave it on for a few minutes and then emulsify and rinse)\n2.\t⁠Wash with CeraVe hydrating foam cleanser\n3.\t⁠Differin (now not using it)… went back to the Cosrx Snail 96 Mucin this week.\n4.\t⁠Moisturize with Bubble Slam Dunk, have been adding a couple of drops of a facial oil (Ole Henriksen HydraBarrier Nourishing Facial Oil)\n\nMy morning routine is either washing my face again in the shower, followed by basic moisturizing, or just rinsing my face. \n\nSometimes I like to use the Medicube hypochlorous acid spray, but I was leery of starting to use that at the same time as the Differin.\n\nBefore I started using Differin, I had been using the Byoma retinol oil for sensitive skin. I stopped when I started with Differin, but maybe I should go back to it?\n\nThere are too many variables… I need help!",

      "title": "[Routine Help] tweaking my routine: the order to do stuff in and wait time",
      "content": "So a couple things: \n\n1: Started shaving regularly several months ago and have noticed I probably need more moisturization on the mornings that I shave but I don't really want to mess with my morning routine too much, I already use a hyaluronic acid and a moisturizer, and I feel like using an aftershave balm would probably mess with the absorption of the rest of my AM routine, unless I can figure out a way to like shift things around, or maybe if using an aftershave balm would do like anything at all if applied after my actives. I definitely should pick up a richer moisturizer for those mornings and also evenings in general as I've noticed it hasn't really been enough as my skin ages so if anyone has any recs for a good rich or semi-rich moisturizer for somewhat sensitive skin that tends to clog kinda easily I'd appreciate it. Currently use the air-repair complexion boosting moisturizer which idk if it's a real thing or not but I've been using it for years and it had been fine, doesn't break me out but it's just too light for me rn. \n\n2: currently adding azelaic acid to my routine, was going to add it in the morning because I already use a glycolic acid toner and retinol at night so I wanted to avoid adding anything else that might be too aggressive, but my morning products are kinda stacking up at this point. I read that it's fine to use after vit c, which I use in the morning, as long as you let the vit c soak in first. But I also read that some people say vit c is good before retinol if you wait, it can help with the absorption? I don't know at this point lol\nEDIT 1: tried adding the azelaic acid suspension just now, as well as waiting after the vit c. I don't normally wait and adding the rest of my products to dry skin felt unpleasant to say the least and there is a tingling I don't particularly like, but I assume that's just from using the azelaic acid for the first time. Should I alternate days for the first week or something? Or switch the vit c to the evening after my glycolic acid toner, since I wait an hour before applying the retinol anyway?\n\nEDIT 2: forgot the third thing\n3: how to work my routine around going to the gym. \nI've wanted to get back to going to the gym, I would be going in the morning and it seems like a waste to do my whole routine, go to the gym and sweat it off, and then go home and shower and reapply. Should I just cleanse and use moisturizer and sunscreen in the morning, and then use like my Garnier micellar water or possibly cleanse again and follow with the rest of the routine? \n\n\nCurrent routine: \n\nAM\n\nWash with African black soap\n\n(Shave here when shaving, with prosaro shaving cream, rinse and then use alum block, let sit and then rinse off again)\n\nThayers rose toner \n\nTO asorbycol glycoside (vit c)\n\n=wait like 10 minutes=\n\n(Would add TO azelaic acid 10% suspension here)\n\nTO hyaluronic acid\n\nAir repair moisturizer\n\nBeauty of Joseon sunscreen with niacinamide \n\n\nPM\n\nWipe with Garnier micellar cleansing water\n\n(Usually would do a first cleanse here with shisedo perfect oil cleanser but I ran out a while ago and it's expensive so I never got around to replacing it but it will come back eventually lol)\n\nCleanse with Avene cleanance acne salycilic acid 2% cleanser\n\nTO glycolic acid toner \n\n=wait 1 hr=\n\nPrescription .1% adaptaline rétinol\n\nKhiels avocado eye treatment \n\nAir repair moisturizer\n\nLaneige lip mask \n\nAny advice appreciated! Even if it's not something I specifically asked about.  \nEspecially hoping to hear from folks who shave as there doesn't seem to be a lot of folks with elaborate skincare routines in the wetshaving subreddit lol",

It would be clear for months then bam - problems again! I always felt so defeated. Through countless derm visits &amp; trying different meds &amp; products, I’m now able to maintain my current skin. \n\nThe 1st doc I saw prescribed 0.1% tret, which messed up my skin so bad (1st pic). This was for someone who never used tret before! Luckily, I stopped &amp; saw an actual derm years later. From 19-25, I took spiro. It helped manage my hormonal acne &amp; I think made my oily skin drier. I picked up tret again along the way, &amp; that combo really helped with texture &amp; acne as well. I’ve since stopped both &amp; is only using tazarotene in my late 20s.\n\nThis past year, I invested in microneedling. It was SO worth it! My texture became smoother with less acne scar &amp; it improved my skin tone.\n\nDespite massive progress over the years, I still fear acne whenever it comes up. I still struggle with large pores (my biggest battle rn), acne here &amp; there, &amp; uneven skin tone. After constant years of having acne &amp; still does sometimes, it leaves a little scar on you. 🥲 My skin isn’t perfect. It will never be. Nevertheless, I am very happy with my skin right now. \n\nI don’t want to make this post longer than what it is so can put my routine in the comments! \n\n",

I followed up with the customer service and they confirmed this. \n\n  \nSo how are people getting their derma pens / microneedling pens ?

      "content": "Ive been kind of neglecting my hair for a few years not entirely sure on what i should be doing differently. This is 1 day after my wash. Hoping for advice on what products to use and certain routine tips. Currently my routine literally just consist of 1 weekly wash in which i throw a random masque in my hair after dampening, let it sit for like 20 min, then hand detangle. Afterwards i put a random ass leave in conditioner in then repeat a week later. If anyone knows good vegan masque and leave ins id appreciate it. Also maybe a good rehydrator? I live in louisiana and its always humid so if i dont use a leave in with good hold my hair is only good for a day or 2, but i also dislike very strong holds and how they effect the look and volume lol. Any advice helps thank!",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I have some questions as someone who is just getting into skin care, kind of. So, like two years ago, I finally actually started doing skin care, only night routine, I live in Guatemala and I was vegetarian at the time so Yves Rocher being the first vegan brand I found for skin care was what I bought. A cleanser, an exfoliator and hydrating cream. And I loved it.\n\nThen I stopped using it because it is a little expensive and just couldn´t afford it. A couple weeks ago, I decided to start again. The cleanser (pure algue gel detergente ultra-freshezza con microalga) and exfoliator (pure menthe gommage purificante con menta piperita) feel really good still, I got the same ones, but the cream... The lady told me it was the same cream, they had just changed the package. But I mean, it looks different this one is like beige (elixir botanique recovery sleeping care) and the other one was white (don´t remember the name). And I did also end up getting a serum (elixir botanique serum recuperador noche efecto melatonina).\n\nFirst time I used the cream, it kind of burned in the area above my lips, but I didn´t know if that was the cream or the serum. And then a friend told me to just put it on with the skin still wet and it didn´t burn anymore but when I asked the lady at the store (she gave me her phone number) she told me I should be putting it on dry skin.\n\nI did break out a little, but I wasn´t sure if it was because of my cycle or the products. I have continued using them, but only use the serum once a week. And it´s fine, I guess, but I haven´t really seen any changes in my skin.\n\nI have dry skin with big pores, basically, that´s what I want to work on. So I am thinking about just waiting till I use up the serum and cream and then keep getting the cleanser and exfoliator (although, while looking at the name for this post I realized the exfoliator is supposed to be for oily skin, so idk) and change to a different hydrating cream, and I guess a toner?\n\nI am so lost. I was thinking about the CeraVe cream, but then I saw someone on tiktok say that is a light weight one and for dry skin I should get something more hydrating.\n\nAnyway, any advice you could give, not just on like products but also should I get a toner besides the cream? Or a serum? Both? This is for the night skin care, in the morning I just put on sunscreen bc its just a lie that I am gonna do anything more, I don´t have the time",

The extent to which I will style is using products like sprays, mouse, or leave in products, or using a sock to do sock curls. I like having layered hair and like having some pieces that frame my face. I didn't mind the bangs but I don't think I would like a bang like I did before, as it did get a bit annoying after a week to deal with as I kept having to trim them myself to keep up the maintenance on them, until I eventually grew them out.\n\nMy coworkers say I should try out a wolf cut or some kind of shag cut but I don't know as they seem like you'd need to do your hair to maintain that look.

Got back on the pill at 26 because I entered a relationship. Still with the guy but the worry of pregnancy is gone. So I got off the pill in July. Now it's Nov and my usual one spot of acne before my period has been there all month, more have shown up.\n\nMy face is oily I can feel it. I have been looking into proper face wash to help but I don't know the first thing about it. I know I am doing it wrong with just water but I want to change that. \n\nI did some research and read that oil based face wash is good for oily skin? Seems like a scam but I don't know anything.

      "content": "A lot of people hate Nizoral because it dries their hair out like the Sahara, so I thought I’d share what I’ve been doing. I use Nizoral 2% twice a week (Monday + Thursday), and this routine has basically stopped all that dryness while still letting me get the anti-DHT benefits.\n\nHere’s my routine:\n\t\n•\tNizoral 2% – massage it in, leave it for a few mins, rinse.\n\t\n•\tEgo QV Nourishing Shampoo straight after – super gentle, helps bring the moisture back.\n\t\n•\tEgo QV Nourishing Conditioner – this stuff is underrated. I let it sit for a bit then rinse.\n\nAfter I get out of the shower:\n\t\n•\tTowel-dry lightly so it’s still damp, not dripping.\n\t\n•\tUse 2–3 pumps of Schwarzkopf Extra Care Hair Treatment Oil (the one with argan oil). I run it through the mid-lengths to ends, not the roots.\n\t•\tDry/style as usual.\n\nThe result:\nMy hair doesn’t go dry or brittle at all. It actually looks like “day-after-wash” hair — soft, not fluffy, a bit of healthy texture, and it smells good. Basically, Nizoral without the punishment.\n\nHopefully this helps someone who’s struggling with the dryness. Niz 2% doesn’t have to feel like you’re scrubbing with dish soap.",
