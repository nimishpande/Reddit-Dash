      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m hoping to get some advice about my hair routine because I’m not sure if I’m using the right products or if my routine needs to change. I started with separate products like the Mark Anthony Strictly Curls leave-in, curl cream, and mousse. Recently, I decided to try something new, so I bought the yellow Skala product to see if it would work better.\n\nMy hair type is 2C/3A and very long, but every routine I try ends up with frizz and barely lasts two days. All I want is definition and absolutely no volume. Here’s my current routine: I start by wetting my hair completely and brushing it through. I then separate my hair into sections. I start with the crown because I want it to stay gelled down. The two front pieces are separated into about three smaller sections each since that’s how I usually wear my hair. The back is separated into just two horizontal sections because it’s very heavy and hard to manage.\n\nFor each section, I apply the yellow Skala product and brush it out, then I add Eco Styler gel and use a bounce curl brush. I’ve been thinking about maybe trying gel first, then mousse, then brushing, but I’m not sure if that would help. After finishing the front sections, I move to the back sections, which are harder to style and don’t hold curls well. Finally, I put my hair into a bonnet till I go out.\n\nDespite all of this, my hair always ends up frizzy, and the curls barely hold. I’m not sure what to do differently. Does anyone have suggestions for products, routines, or techniques for long 2C/3A hair that would give definition without adding volume? Any help would be really appreciated!",

She said NOOOO you just need a little trim, you've got nice length.\nShe was using such a burning hot hairdryer it felt like she was ironing my scalp.\n\nAnd now I'm back home, it's been a few washes, and I think she made it worse. The hair just puffs up so much. I have an odd hair pattern, it's kinda wavy, but doing a curly routine makes horribly shaped curls that only last a day and are never actually curly, straight hair looks absolutely awful on me and also puffs up very quickly...\ni have tried a billion routines, fancy and cheap products - I always end up the same, nice hair for one day only, if even. But after this cut it feels like nothing works.\n\nI never wear my hair down because I look insane and like I don't brush my hair. The pictures are of my hair just brushed... You get the vibe.\n\nI am fed up with it, and considering shaving it all off, because I just have no idea what else I can do about it. I don't want to do an hour long hair routine every two-three days. My hair gets oily at the top very quickly, but the ends are dry no matter how many masks I slap on.\n\nAlso it's not solely her fault, my hair has always been problematic, but I feel like after her work I simply can't do anything with my hair to make it look normal.\n\nPlease, if you could suggest on how should I proceed? Scorched earth shave it all off, do another cut short, a flawless wavy hair routine I've not heard of? \n\nI appreciate any advice. Every single hair stylist I went to never gave me anything substantial :(. Thank you.\n",

I’m starting to wonder if this can only be fixed with professional treatments like laser or microneedling…\n\nI’m open to any skincare advice (especially K-beauty or Asian skincare recs), product suggestions, or just personal experiences from anyone who went through the same thing and managed to improve their skin.\n\nI’m desperate but still hopeful that I can make progress.\n\nThank you so much to anyone who takes the time to reply!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nghhk32amvxf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b73ca2a5ae833788dc15a6dc510d5d9602c02db1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/88h3kw2amvxf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e25413297a9db33f87cb9f62652ab64f88ecf003\n\n",

I went to a dermatologist to ask if it was something else and they just told me to start paying them (or buy their hair supplements /roll eyes ). I'm only 27 so not yet ready to start paying a subscription service for my hair, lol. Any tips are welcome!!\n\nRoutine: function of beauty wavy hair shampoo and conditioner, either their curl cream or mousse depending if I'm at home or not, and ouai hair oil just on the lengths of my hair (to try to combat the frizz). I use Maui Moisture Scalp Care Clarifying Shampoo irregularly, but occasionally. I wash it 2-3 times/wk (couple months ago increased this from every \\~4 days). I use a silky pillowcase to sleep, considering starting to wear a bonnet.",
