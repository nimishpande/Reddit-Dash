      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m hoping for some help and guidance as I start trying to embrace my natural curls after many years of straightening. I’ve been straightening my hair for about 20 years (usually around 3 times a week), and I think it’s finally time to step away from the heat and see what my curls can do.\n\nMy main goals right now are to improve the overall health of my hair and figure out how to manage and style my curls so I can feel more confident wearing them out. One thing I struggle with is that my hair has really thinned out since having my daughter 7 years ago. My hairline has receded a bit, and I find that it’s more noticeable when my hair is straight. I’d love to learn how to make my curls work in a way that helps disguise this a little more naturally.\n\nRight now, my curls are pretty inconsistent. I get ringlets underneath, but the top layer is mostly waves, and there’s very little curl from the roots. It also tends to look stringy and frizzy, and it always feels super knotted no matter what I do (especially on refresh days.) \n\nI’m still getting used to using products because my hair usually feels kind of dirty or weighed down after I put anything in it. I’m not sure if this is just what curly hair feels like or if I’m doing something wrong.\n\nI have a bunch of products already and would really love some help figuring out how to experiment with what I have before buying anything new. Here’s what I currently have:\n\t•\tShampoo \n\t•\tClarifying shampoo\n\t•\tConditioner\n\t•\tLeave-in conditioner\n\t•\tCurl cream\n\t•\tCurl defining lotion\n\t•\tMousse\n\t•\tGel (I don’t find gel works as well for me as mousse - volume wise)\n\t•\tAveda humectant oil\n\nMy usual routine is: wash and condition, apply either the cream or lotion plus mousse on soaking wet hair, plop for a bit, and then diffuse to about 90% dry. I sometimes use the aveda oil to break the cast. Sometimes I use a curl defining brush, but I’m still learning how to use it well. I often end up pinning my hair back because the top just doesn’t look as curly or nice as the bottom.\n\nIf anyone would be willing to help me come up with a plan to test and rotate through the products I already own, I’d be really grateful. I know everyone’s hair is different, but I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed and unsure of where to start.\n\nThanks so much for reading and for any advice you’re willing to share.\n",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

When I first style it before bed, my curls are beautiful, hydrated and defined. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong - is it the products I’m using? When I refresh my curls, I usually use a small bit of my leave in conditioner mixed with some water in a spray bottle, but that often makes it frizzy, particularly on the east coast since it’s so humid. \n\nI’ve attached a couple photos of my hair today, next morning after washing, and a photo of my hair after leaving the salon from a haircut, so immediately after washing. \n\nHere’s what I’m currently doing:\n- Wash routine: L’oréal’s Ever Pure Sulfate Free Frizz Defy shampoo and conditioner, every other day and every couple days if I can squeeze another day in without a wash before it starts looking gross.\n- Products: after washing, I use praying hands to apply Curls Leave In Conditioner, Curls Crème Brûlée curl cream, and Curls Blueberry Bliss Gel, then scrunch it all in while my hair is still sopping wet.\n- Pre-styling: I finger coil my hair to make sure the product is as evenly distributed in my hair as possible after scrunching and that my curls are adequately separated. \n- Drying: I diffuse my hair with a hair dryer and separate my curls as needed.

Then about twice a week with The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution for 5 mins at a time, which I've been doing for about 2 weeks now. If I do the peel in the morning, I'll go in with a thin layer of up&amp;up Oil-Free Facial Moisturizer with Sunscreen (SPF 15) but if I do it in the evening, I go in again with the Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser before bed.\n\nMy skin has always been clear, never had serious problems with acne just tiny breakdowns (I'm talking one or two pimples) maybe 4-5 times a year. Oil was only a bit of a problem in my T zone but the Cerave product helped with that a lot. My main concern is evening out my facial discoloration (pink in the middle of my cheeks, brown in select areas near my mouth/chin and temples), but even more importantly, trying to get little bumps of skin off my face; they haven't budged since starting. These bumps manifest right under my eye bags going towards my nose but not reaching the bridge. I want my face to be as smooth and soft as possible, I can be fine with the discoloration as I'm also getting into makeup but the little bumps have always irritated me. Any advice, recommended routine changes, or product recommendations would be amazing! And please be kind, I'm in my early 20s, FTM, and only now starting to make a routine of washing my face/anything to do with skincare so I'm still a beginner.",

Thank you in advance for all your help!!\n\nMy skincare journey started with moderate but stubborn acne which reacted to dust, dairy, nightshade plants— you name it!!!\nI tried switching up products, but what really helped was isotretin prescribed by my dermatologist.\n\nComing to my moisturizer issues, I have tried multiple moisturizers, but just about everything breaks me out.\n\nThe ones I have tried:\n1) Mary and May Idebenone Moisturizer \n2) Soon Jung Etude House 10 Free Emulsion\n3) Sebamed Clear Gel (possibly the citric acid in it)\n4) Isntree Tea Tree \n5) Beplain Cicaful Calming Gel\n6) Sidmool 100 Honey Moisture\n7) Neutrogena 72 Hours Moisturizer \n8) Clinique moisture surge\n9) Purito oat in calming gel cream\n\nOther things which broke me out-\n1) TO alpha arbutin but Cos de Baha arbutin didn’t— just to cross out ingredients\n2) Numbuzin number 5+\n\n\nThings that don’t break me out- \n1) Iunik beta glucan serum \n2) Cosrx full fit propolis ampoule\n3) plain old glycerine \n4) Purito Daily soft touch sunscreen\n5) Cosrx snail mucin (not sure about this one)\n6) skin1004 Centella ampoule\n\nI was hoping to find a decent moisturizer to help my skin restore its barrier given I have to use tretinoin and azelaic acid every day. \nI have been using tretinoin for about 3 years now. I started off with 0.5 but recently realized that my skin doesn’t handle it especially when I am using azelaic acid along with it, so I moved to 0.025%. While this has helped keep those skin flakes at bay, my skin still feels dry and I have mild acne/texture all over my face. \nI’m open to recommendations for moisturizers, ampoules, or in-office treatment.\n\n\nThank you!!\n",

I popped on here because I'd like to get the best opinions/recommendations for a thermal brush before purchasing as they are quite expensive. My budget is open for a good brush because I hate my unmanageable hair. I'd prefer not to spend $500 dollars on a hot brush, but if it's the best in the game I will. I've always had a very hard time taking care of my hair and styling it, oddly enough I have an easier time styling my hair when it is straightened and after it has had heat applied to it. I'd love to feel comfortable with my own hair for once in my life, and I'm hoping this can help. I used to straighten my hair quite often, but as an adult now I don't have the time to sit down for 4-5 hours every weekend to do so. I'm hoping this thermal brush can speed up the process for me with the same results, or similar results. Please help, thanks!!!

      "content": "Hey everyone, hope you're all doing well! I popped on here because I'd like to get the best opinions/recommendations for a thermal brush before purchasing as they are quite expensive. My budget is open for a good brush because I hate my unmanageable hair. I'd prefer not to spend $500 dollars on a hot brush, but if it's the best in the game I will. I've always had a very hard time taking care of my hair and styling it, oddly enough I have an easier time styling my hair when it is straightened and after it has had heat applied to it. I'd love to feel comfortable with my own hair for once in my life, and I'm hoping this can help. I used to straighten my hair quite often, but as an adult now I don't have the time to sit down for 4-5 hours every weekend to do so. I'm hoping this thermal brush can speed up the process for me with the same results, or similar results. Please help, thanks!!! (sidenote: my hair is about shoulder length, a bit past my shoulders and my hair handles heat veryyyy well!)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vxr5mxtqgxuf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f593de30af43df2234f51d92ecbd2b843787bd0c\n\n",
