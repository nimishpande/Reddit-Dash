      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Where do I go from here? What am I doing wrong? Are these ridiculous long locks worth salvaging despite the time, effort, and expense, or was this a fun experiment I should move on from for my own well-being? I've been growing my hair out with only two very minor trims for two plus years now. I don't know if I had/have a particular goal or vision, it was some kind of combination between \"I'm loving my little ringlets, maybe I love them even more the longer they grow?\" and a bit of a trauma response to the overwhelm of becoming a parent a bit over two years ago. \n\nWhen my hair was much shorter, I had gotten pretty great at figuring out cheap and easy-ish routines that yielded results I really liked (that would get me stopped in the street about) using Aussie Miracle Curl conditioner or Ethique's curl conditioner bar and just leaving in some of the product before plopping with a t-shirt for 30 minutes, and bam - another good hair day. I got by that way for the first year and change of growing it. I experimented with homemade flaxseed gel and had really good success with that too as my hair got longer. I started tying my hair back to get it out of my eyes and face and liked that look too... my curls make me feel powerful on good days. \n\nBut at some point a few months ago, something changed, and everything went downhill. My old standby, Aussie Miracle Curl Conditioner (paired once or twice a week with their shampoo) started making my curls stringy as soon as I put it on, rather than help the curls nicely adhere together like I swear it used to. I tried Shea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine Conditioner and had no better results. My hair started taking 7 to 10 business days to dry, even if I dragged out the plopping to an hour or more or tried a second dry t-shirt after soaking the first (and I don’t think my scalp has  been loving all the trapped moisture, incidentally). I started using handfuls of Eco Style Olive Oil gel in the shower in hopes it would help the curl shape and minimize frizz, to mixed and short-lived results. Pic 1 is the current best-case scenario, plopped and then patiently air-dried for hours. Still lots of frizz, the overall shape is weird, and the only way to keep hair out of my eyes seems to be to tie at least some of it back. Which leads me to pic 2, six hours later, tied back with the rest of the curls frizzing the heck out despite all the gel I thought I’d prayer-handed in that morning. Pic 3 is a typical end-of-night look, when the hair tie comes out and it all feels and looks like an old pile of hay from someone’s abandoned barn. Kind of makes me want to buzz it like I did after that boy broke my heart sophomore year of college. But then again… I don’t know that I will ever have the patience again to grow this much hair and endure all the awkward lengths, so would I come to regret getting rid of it all? \n\nI just did the float test on a strand of hair and when placed on the water it floated above it, but when I submerged it manually it sank to the bottom. Is it possible my hair used to be lower-porosity and now is more porous for some reason? Or am I misinterpreting things?\n\nThe five last pics after that are from 9-10 months of growth or less (Aussie Miracle Curl conditioner or Ethique conditioner bar, maybe some flax gel, a brief plop and then air dry), when good hair days felt attainable and I enjoyed the ego boost of a compliment from a stranger every now and then.\n\nI love absorbing wisdom and hairspiration from this amazing sub, but lately I’ve felt weighed down by the ADHD of it all. The thousand options for steps I \\*could\\* take have led me to total paralysis and a shame-spiral of disliking my hair and therefore not taking care of it and therefore liking it less, lather rinse repeat.\n\nI know there’s no SHOULD, but… “should” I (or would you):\n\n* Get all the ends trimmed? Get it totally reshaped? Get bangs of some sort? Go back down to a skin fade on the sides and a few cheeky ringlets on top and save myself a bunch of time and effort? Should I pony up three figures for the X-curly-technique-certified stylist or just seek out someone well-reviewed in my hood with a curly cut I like in their IG feed?\n* Do some sort of triage/deep conditioning repair treatment for my unhappy curls?\n* Try blow-drying/diffusing? I’ve never done this but am very intrigued by the potential time-savings and benefits. Can’t decide if I should get some cheapo secondhand dryer/diffuser just to try it out or splurge for a top-of-the-line situation because it’ll be \\*that\\* life-changing (Dyson Supersonic Nural or similar?)\n* Sleep in a bonnet and/or use a silk pillowcase? Would this potentially really lead to hair I could wear down on a second day without a shower?\n* Try some other holy grail products that worked for you in a similar situation? I like the idea of a simple, low-cost, low-plastic routine but if really great curls are going to require a shift in values... I'm willing to try something new, though I don't know how much capacity I have at this point for exhaustive experiments to dial in the perfect regimen.\n\nAny words of wisdom, real talk, encouragement, and/or product/routine recommendations are much appreciated &lt;3",

I learnt a lot here and want to give back to this community, so here is my Finasteride progress:\n\nFin only, 1mg/day every morning before breakfast. Started on Dec 2022 and just had my hair transplant 3 weeks ago (will post separately after unpacking and prepping the info). As you can see, I am not a hyper responder or anything, but I thought it's important to see a somewhat normal effect of hair being stabilised, which is the exact purpose of fin if I understand it right.\n\nNo side effects. I also talked with my GP before starting it and we measured PSA/testosterone levels for a base line, and everything seems to be normal after 2 years of taking the med.\n\nNo minoxidil. Since I had no sides with fin and have to take it for the rest of my life, I decided not to try minoxidil as I didn't want to add another variable, especially considering the long term use. Also, was planning a hair transplant anyway and was more focused on stabilising/prepping for HT, rather than trying to fix the situation with meds only. This is just my opinion for my specific situation, I'm not advocating against minoxidil in any way though :)\n\nI will upload and link my HT post/pics a bit later. Please keep any HT questions until then.",

      "content": "I've been struggling for a while now to tame the frizz at the ends of my hair. I've swapped between a lot of different routines and products to see if I could find a combination that works well for me, but I haven't really arrived at a routine I'm super happy with. \n\nEven when wet, I notice my hair doesn't have a tendency to stick into defined \"clumps\" anymore; the ends always seem to want to go off in their own directions (see pic 3), but I'm not sure if this is normal or if this is the \"it's frizzy when it's wet\" problem. Once it begins to dry the frizz of course gets a lot worse.\n\nI use a Bounce Curl styling brush and section off the top part of my hair, scrunch in styling product, and run the brush through each part. Then repeat for the top part. I make sure my hair is soaking wet for this whole process. After that, I scrunch each area once with a microfiber towel to help the drying along and then let it air dry. My hair takes a pretty long time to fully air dry, maybe 3-4 hours depending on humidity? I will usually scrunch out the gel afterwards using my hands or diffuse it with a hair dryer on it's lowest settings.\n\nThe products I used in the photos:\n\n* L'Oreal Elvive Hyaluron Plump Shampoo\n* L'Oreal Elvive Hyaluron Plump Conditioner\n* Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Leave-in Conditioner\n* DevaCurl Light Defining Gel\n* OGX Argan Oil\n\nI've also tried combinations of the following products, all achieving mostly similar results:\n\n* DevaCurl Styling Cream Curl Definer\n* DevaCurl No-Poo Original Shampoo\n* DevaCurl One Condition Original Conditioner\n* Lush Curl Power Cream\n* Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Curl Envy Cream\n\nI will use Olaplex No. 4C Clarifying Shampoo from time to time (maybe once a month to every two months?) and I've also tried Olaplex No. 3, although I don't think my hair really needs it.\n\nI'm at a bit of a loss for where to go next with my hair, I'm wondering if I just need to chop off like 2-3 inches from the ends because they're maybe damaged or something? I noticed after my last cut my hair felt a lot healthier and easy to style with the above products overall so maybe it's just that time again.\n\nI'd really appreciate any help or advice y'all can give!",

Both are AWESOME for body but not for face, they made me look dull and dark. But if you have very dry skin condition? The white tub will work for you\n\n3) Bioderma atoderm - very moisturizing and a bit sticky, great for body but again it gave me pimples on face. So I used it for my body \n\n4) Cetaphil - Have used this before nivea for few months, very moisturizing but made me look dull and greasy \n\n5) Venusia max - I have used both max and the simpler version of this moisturizer, It's amazingg! Non comedogenic, no fragrance and gives a matte finish!!!! But I may not order it again bcz I'm not a fan of matte finish, I like those slightly dewy finish kinds hehee \n\n6) Emolene - nice but will give you acne, so use on body\n\n7) Re'queel Ceramide moisturizer - Just ordered it 3 days ago, I like it, even the fragrance is very good but moisturizers shouldn't have strong fragrances right?? So idk if I'll get this again or not, let's see\n\nLastly I want to try my hands on Cerave😂 I'm wishing to have one holy grail Moisturizer, That I will carry to my grave!\nIt should be simple and good, and yes like drugstore products &amp; I'm not a fan of products with too much social media hype like dot &amp; key etc\n\nThanks for listening!

Since last month, I’ve completely simplified my routine and stuck only to the basics:\n\nAM &amp; PM routine:\n\nSimple cleanser\n\nPond’s Vitamin E + Hyaluronic Acid lightweight gel moisturizer\n\nFixderma sunscreen (AM only)\n\n\nThat’s it. I don’t use any active regularly. Whenever I get active acne, I spot treat with Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid.\n\nDespite this, my acne keeps getting worse instead of improving. On top of that, I’m really struggling with PIE (post-acne red marks).

Instead of getting layers cut I just started blow drying it straight and then doing heatless curls and blow outs. I’m now 18, but when I wear my hair natural there’s still some curl especially underneath and frizz. Also through the last two years there have been times (mainly on holiday at beach) where the curls are kind of revived. I live in a rainy place and I want my curly hair back. Currently use a T-gel shampoo (only thing that works on my hair), garnier hair food conditioner and and heat protectant. Can anyone recommend products (no new shampoo I can only use tgel) and a routine can I use to revive it? I now have layers which will help. My hair is fairly thin but a lot of it, wavy and frizzy.",

I'd appreciate some advice on where to start with the hair care and prevent it my from looking like a total havoc, and perhaps some product recommendations. \n\nApologies in advance for my English.\n\nSo, all my life, hairdressers have told me that I have straight hair(fairly common problem, by my observation) and tried to bring it in line with the straight hair standard. But my hair was always slightly wavy and never stayed straight, and now I've finally decided to embrace my curly/wavy hair. I think my hair is low to medium porosity, and is quite thick. \n\nI have severe mental health condition, so it would be difficult to maintain a very complicated hair care routine; I frequently get allergic reactions(don't know the exact ingridients causing problems) and am sensitive to smells, so something fragrance free and for sensitive skin with minimal scent would be ideal option. \n\nI've already tried the fragrance free Curlsmith line (shampoo, strong hold gel and conditioner) and their invincible Mousse but I'm not sure I liked the result(first picture, not the best to understand, but I don't have any more).\n\nI do use curly method when washing my hair. Rarely use a hairdryer, no diffuser, I just leave it to air dry.  \nAnd I did follow the instructions. Everything that needed to be applied to soaking wet hair was applied to soaking wet hair.\n\nNow I'm just using the same wash I use for the rest of my body (bioderma sensebio DS cleansing gel), which is not helping my hair most likely, but better than nothing I guess and it doesn't smell. \n\nCurrently living in the UK, since I moved here my hair has become significantly drier because of the hard water in the area. Installing a proper filtration system is currently not an option. \n\nNo budget limit. \n\n\nThank you for any advice! \n",

I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin?
