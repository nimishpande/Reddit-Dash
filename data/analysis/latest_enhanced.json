      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I’m 25 and I used to have extremely oily, acne prone skin. I was also starting to get hormonal acne because of my gut issues. I used every viral skincare product and my face only became worse. I first went to the doctor for my gut issues, I still have them but it’s better now. I then went to the dermatologist and got pharmacy skincare and was prescribed isotretinoin(please don’t take it without doctor’s advice) for a month, along with Moisturex Hydra. Was also given a face wash, but didn’t like it much. \n\nBut, one product I can recommend is the Moisturex Hydra face moisturiser. It’s the best for oily skin. I have used everything in the market, and everything sucks. This one doesn’t feel heavy at all. My skin is far less oily now, and feels and looks hydrated. So if you’re an oily skin person and are looking for a good budget friendly moisturiser, go for Moisturex Hydra. It’s available in pharmacies and on Amazon also. And my skin cleared! This is after 6 months of using this moisturiser. \n\nAlso attached my updated skincare routine. FYI I only use the AHA BHA PHA peel once in a week at night. Please use it after a patch test. And the Asaya serum at night. It has helped lighten my dark spots after 3 months of usage. You can use the toner spray both morning and night. Dot and key sunscreen is good. But if you use anything else, that is fine too. And simple is the only face wash that has worked for me. Literally so good. \n\nThis is just my personal experience, please don’t be mad if some of these don’t work for you. Use whatever suits your skin. Thanks!",

There has been a lot of progress because at 18-20 my face was full of acne. My mother straight up took me to do a laser treatment from a cosmetologist without consulting a dermat when I was 18 which obviously reversed.\nThen I went to a top dermat at 22 in mumbai who helped me with medicines and chemical peels which solved a good chunk of my problem. I moved away to a different country and  my acne was back. I have since moved back to India and was diagnosed with PCOS and my acne is well gone and stable with the medications given by my gynac. I can finally touch my face and even discovered I have a dimple.\n\nNow I am looking to solve this acne scaring problem. Makeup does not help because it accentuates the pores. Anyone have any tips or knows affordable dermats in mumbai who can help me get my skin close to regular females my age? I sadly can no longer afford my original luxury dermat 🥲  and I feel super embarrased traveling in Mumbai with this issue. ",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "title": "[Acne] Help! Cystic Acne and Chin Acne from shaving",
      "content": "\n\nHey everyone, I'm posting for my brother 22M who is currently dealing with a rough combination of severe cystic acne and a flare-up of seborrheic dermatitis around his nose, eyes. He's unable to see a dermatologist for a few months due to starting a new job, and we're hoping to get his skin under better control in the meantime.\n\nHe's always struggled with acne, but last month it was so bad that his whole face was swollen from simultaneous cystic breakouts. In a pinch, I set him up with my own routine, and thankfully, his cheeks have improved substantially! The routine was CeraVe SA Cleanser, Cos De BAHA Niacinamide 10%, Azelaic Acid 5% Serum (which I plan to replace soon because I dislike it) and Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Moisture Cream.\n\nHe was recently gifted a new cleanser and a mattifying face cream that both contain Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate (PAD). Since he's already using an Azelaic Acid 5% serum, I worry this is too much active ingredient. What you guys think?\n\nHe also stopped using the Isntree cream in favor of the mattifying one because he felt it was \"too greasy,\" and now the seborrheic dermatitis is sadly making a comeback.\n\nI also feel the need to mention that I've caught him a couple of times doing his routine up to 4 times a day because he panicked about the breakouts! And I'm working on convincing him to use SPF, but for now, he hasn't been using it.\n\nThe biggest problem seems to be the area he shaves, which is the most inflamed. He shaves and uses Proraso shaving foam and aftershave and seems aggravated by it. I'm really lost on how to help him with this.\n\nAny and all advice on adjusting this routine would be a lifesaver! Thank you so much for your help!\n\n(P.S. Acne patches won't stick on his skin! They simply slide off. Any tips on getting them to adhere?)",

      "content": "Hi everyone, posting here hopefully to hear if someone had a similar experience or for advice. \n\nI’ve been growing my hair for a year… and was feeling good about it.. but then I went for a cut requesting only a small amount (1/4 inch) be taken off only the top layer and I completely froze. The stylist was moving/talking very quickly and used a razor on my hair to “debulk (my hair is not thick)…. I’ve had bad hair cut experiences in the past and I was traumatized and frozen… I couldn’t speak up to ask her to stop. She wound up taking off so much hair. I knew I didn’t want to use a razor on my hair but I was frozen.\n\nMy hair is 2b/2c and 3a in some places. It is feels very frizzy, coarse, and thin from the razor now. The internal layering has left shorter pieces all over the place and my hair doesn’t clump like it used to. It falls almost entirely straight in places now. \n\nI have to finger coil it over my entire head for it to even look kind of ok. I use Innersense shampoo and conditioner, Innersense Sweet Spirit leave in conditioner at ends and mid lengths and K18 mask every other week (routine). Air dry only, diffuser makes it fall straight (styling). Protein makes it fall flat so the coarseness is the only thing contributing to volume. The look of it isn’t bothering me as much as the feeling of it (though still don’t like the look at all). It feels so coarse and rough that I am very uncomfortable. She said she wasn’t going to take any significant length off the top layers but they ended up almost 3-4 inches shorter in some places. I’m still trying to grow it long so I don’t know what to do in the interim about the change in texture and thinness. \n\nIf anyone has advice on steps to take while growing it out, I’d love to hear. If this has happened to someone else, I wonder how long it took to grow out? I am wanting to grow it out so that it is very low maintenance. I used to be able to just comb it and walk out the door. Now it takes hours to do anything with it.\n\nPictures are: \n\n1. Current after 3 months growth (after finger coiling, trying really hard to style)\n2. Post haircut \n3. Pre haircut ",

Both are AWESOME for body but not for face, they made me look dull and dark. But if you have very dry skin condition? The white tub will work for you\n\n3) Bioderma atoderm - very moisturizing and a bit sticky, great for body but again it gave me pimples on face. So I used it for my body \n\n4) Cetaphil - Have used this before nivea for few months, very moisturizing but made me look dull and greasy \n\n5) Venusia max - I have used both max and the simpler version of this moisturizer, It's amazingg! Non comedogenic, no fragrance and gives a matte finish!!!! But I may not order it again bcz I'm not a fan of matte finish, I like those slightly dewy finish kinds hehee \n\n6) Emolene - nice but will give you acne, so use on body\n\n7) Re'queel Ceramide moisturizer - Just ordered it 3 days ago, I like it, even the fragrance is very good but moisturizers shouldn't have strong fragrances right?? So idk if I'll get this again or not, let's see\n\nLastly I want to try my hands on Cerave😂 I'm wishing to have one holy grail Moisturizer, That I will carry to my grave!\nIt should be simple and good, and yes like drugstore products &amp; I'm not a fan of products with too much social media hype like dot &amp; key etc\n\nThanks for listening!

I spend a lot of time outdoors, and over the last couple years I developed a few darker patches on my face.\n\nI went to a beauty shop (Ulta ? Ultra ? Umma ?) and got Good Molecules Discoloration Correcting Serum. I made applying it to my dark spots part of my daily routine for about 4-5 months and it did seem to lighten up the dark spot a bit, but that's hard to judge as it also became winter time.\n\nI went back recently looking for a travel sized, and the clerk - whose skin was much nicer than mine - suggested trying Murad Environmental Shield Rapid Dark Spot Correcting Serum. I've only used it a handful of times.\n\nI'm not sure I really understand the differences between these products or their efficacy. I'm also not sure if I should be applying to my entire face or just to my dark spots. I don't really want to reduce the melanin across my face entirely, and I'm honestly not very interested in having a completely clear face, which would not match the rest of my skin, I really just want to get rid of these particular melanin spots if that's possible. Is the Murad one indeed more effective for my goals than the Good Molecules one is ? I have a huge amount of the Good Molecules left and would rather not waste it given the price of these products - the Murad is perfectly sized for travel though, and if they do are generally the same thing then I could reserve it for travel and use the Good Molecules at home.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

I use a smoothing brush and put it in a low pony, as that is honestly the only hairstyle I can stand (I can’t stand my hair touching the sides of my neck).\n\nThe problem:\n\nAfter maybe 6 hours or less, my hair frizzes up on the sides (the top too, but mostly the sides) and comes out of the ponytail. Using gel extends this time, but not by very much. It really bothers me because a) it looks silly, and b) I can’t stand the feeling of little frizzy hairs touching my ears. \n\nMy current solution is to spray my hair with water mixed with the leave in conditioner, and rebrush it with the smoothing brush, but this only lasts for like 2 hours. I could add gel, but if I did that every 2 hours my hair would get so gunky. I’m just so tired of having to refresh my hair every couple hours, and it’s eating up a lot of conditioner. \n\nThanks for any suggestions! (I also don’t have a lot of money which I why I use shampoo and conditioner from the dollar store…)",

      "content": "Ive moved out of retail into avionics recently. At my old job, I was able to do my makeup and hair and have my nails done but here is a different story. \n\nSome of the chemicals we use here are so strong they totally ruin your nails and its so windy out even my braids look insane by the end of it. Im not concerned about my fashion being on point as everything is going to get dirty haha, but id like to still have something that makes me feel good. \n\nI know the gel x doesnt dissolve like regular nail polish does with what we use but the acrylic gets tacky again with some chemicals and they'll pop off quickly. Im thinking maybe if I get my own gloves and tape them I can keep getting nails. \n\nAs for my hair. Im at a loss. It has to be up and out of the way. It doesnt have to be in a bun so we do have options, but I do braided buns when it is required for poloshing since my hair is long enough to get sucked into the buffer. Its so windy though the braids tend to look frazzled. Maybe have them tighter and use a lot of hairspray ? \n\nAnd then my face ! Im breaking out more than usual due to the carbon and stuff getting on my face. Are there any washes and wipes yall blue collar girlies recommend ? Something I can have in my pocket to scrub stuff off when I have a second so its not sitting in my pores all day. \n\nIm not trying to look how I once did at work since it not as feasible, but id still like to look put together. Its important to me. ",

      "content": "I have struggled with acne and red skin/inflammation for about 4 years now, it was veryy bad and cystic until last year, it’s cleared up a lot. However I really struggle with redness and occasional acne/texture etc. \n\nI don’t have skin barrier issues, I’ve actually not used any harsh acne actives in over a year. I wash my face only once a day at night (cerave), and use an Avene moisturiser or Cerave. I keep it pretty simple!\n\nA few months ago I started using an azelaic acid/ivermectin treatment to use at night for rosacea/texture, which seems to have helped a tiny bit but not much. \n\nLiterally last week I have started using retinal twice a week (medik8 crystal retinal 3). I used tretinoin about 5 years ago and it was great but obviously I was much younger (22) back then, my skin only had a few tiny spots anyway! \n\nI try to stick to an anti inflammatory diet with low sugar etc, however I find that most days (especially around days 8-14 in my cycle), I have more inflamed skin. I’m at a loss of what to do! \n\nI just want a normal even skin tone without any redness to it 😭😭\n\nThank you for any help!! ",
