      "content": "I’m starting to believe that anal sex, especially in gay communities, is correlated with the potentiality for maintaining hair. Hear me out: I’ve observed that gay men, who often engage in more anal activities as part of their sex lives, generally have thicker, more fuller hair deeper into their 30’s+. For example, look at the queer scenes in places like San Francisco or West Hollywood—you’ll see a ton of guys with lush locks, from twinks to bears, from the club kids to the professionals. Of course, there’s always the “balding gene,” but compared to straight dudes grinding away in vanilla missionary, not even close. Same with other vibrant gay hubs around the world, like Berlin or Sydney, and more, I’m sure.\nI believe a reason for this is because of the intense physical and hormonal rush from anal sex. We know that blood flow is crucial for keeping follicles active and nourished, and bottoming (or topping, for that matter) directly amps up circulation through the body, including the scalp. Every time I hook up and go for anal, for example, I feel a strong surge of endorphins and blood pumping everywhere, even making my head tingle. Yet, I dialed back on it in my early 20s, mostly because of relationship drama. My ex still has a full head of hair into his 50s, and his mane is epic. He’s super active in the gay scene and bottoms like a champ. I’ve resorted to using rogaine for my crown. Of course, my straight uncle’s side is also prone to balding, but they were all about that repressed, no-anal life growing up.\nWhat do you guys think? Do you think regular anal sex can sustain blood flow to the scalp? In the least, it should help with maintaining longer, no?\nNot saying a lack of anal sex results in hair loss, but that a high intake of it—especially in gay contexts—may encourage blood flow to the scalp, and thus maintain hair density longer.",

      "content": "Hi everyone 👋\n\nI need some help choosing a lightweight moisturizer for oily, acne-prone skin, especially for winter.\n\nSkin type:\n\n• Oily, acne-prone\n\n• Breaks out if moisturizers are too heavy or occlusive\n\nCurrent routine (worked well until recently):\n\nAM &amp; PM:\n\n• Bioderma Sebium Actif Salicylic Acid Cleanser (twice a day)\n\n• The Derma Co 5% Nia-Ceramide Mattifying Moisturizer\n\n• La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo (+/Unifiant) as Spot Treatment \n\n• Re’equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen (AM)\n\nThis routine was working great, but with winter weather, I suddenly started getting breakouts, so I suspect my moisturizer or cleanser might not be suiting me anymore.\n\nI’ve attached images of all the moisturizers I’m considering:\n\n• Sebamed Clear Face Care Gel\n\n• Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel\n\n• Deconstruct Oil-Free Moisturizer (3% NMF + Panthenol)\n\n• Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Gel-Crème\n\n• The Derma Co 5% Nia-Ceramide (currently using)\n\nI really liked the texture and feel of La Roche-Posay Toleriane Sensitive Fluide (super lightweight, calming, non-greasy), but unfortunately it’s not available in India.\n\nWhich of these moisturizers would be the closest alternative to LRP Toleriane Sensitive Fluide in terms of texture + ingredients?\n\nWhich one would you recommend for oily, acne-prone skin in winter, without clogging pores?\n\nI’m also looking for a tinted spot treatment similar to La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo (+/Unifiant) — something with salicylic acid + niacinamide + tint (India-available). Any recommendations?\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone with similar skin type 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "content": "Hello, I've started my journey this year, a bit before the summer.\n\nBefore I was doing my routine i got a lot of redness in face, mostly after showering, flaking around the nose that got worse with stress and weather, black heads and some sun damage in the nose that harder to see now.\n\nThe initial reason I started doing cosmetics is to delay aging signs. My skin became a bit thinner under the eyes with aging. There wasn't a lot of improvement there BUT it's somewhat better now.\n\nI can't have too many steps in my routine, i am always in a hurry. Also I sweat a lot from my forehead and sometimes it can get a little messy.\n\n**In the summer my routine was fine but now i feel my face is a bit too dry. Maybe I need to add a moisturizer?**\n\nThis is my routine that i came up with after some trial an error (note: I'm in Europe, some products are a bit different from the USA offerings):\n\n# Morning\n\n**CeraVe Cleansing Micellar Water or Foaming Cleanser**\n\nI choose this specific micellar water because it has ceramides and niacinamide. I don't use makeup so the purpose is only to remove dirt and previous cosmetics.\n\nWhen I shower in the morning or after the gym I use Cerave Foaming Cleanser and don't use Micellar water. Cerave Foaming Cleanser feels great in my face. It was the first thing i started using and still using to this day.\n\n**Medik8 Super C Ferulic**\n\nI was using Vichy Vitamin C but recently \"upgraded\" to Medik8. It seems to work fine, no real comments on this. I wanted to try Ferulic acid in my routine and Skinceuticals was too expensive for me :) I share this with my girlfriend so that we go through a vial/bottle faster and it keeps fresh.\n\n**LRP Anthelios UVMUNE 440 oil control fluid spf 50+**\n\nThis seems to be the sunscreen everyone recommends. I use the oil control because my face can sometimes get a bit too shiny.\n\nI cannot find the waterproof version locally but I think it would be better for me because I sweat a lot from my forehead, as mentioned before.\n\n# Evening\n\n**CeraVe Cleansing Micellar Water**\n\nSame as in the morning.\n\n**Medik8 Crystal Retinal 6**\n\nI was using a Vichy retinol before AND retinal really made a difference. My nose is now almost without any black heads. I don't even use BHA anymore. Some other improvements, a brownish \"dot\" disappeared, i think that was sun damage that got reverse, it still there but now it is purple/rose (i think its sebaceous hyperplasia but not 100% sure) and much less noticeable.\n\n**Medik8 Advanced Night Restore**\n\nI hadn't a clue on what to use to moisturize in the evening and since it is recommended on by Medik8 after retinal I sheepishly followed their recommendation.\n\nSome of the options i saw recommend on reddit like Cerave Night Cream aren't available locally.\n\nHowever I am happy with Advanced Night Restore. My girlfriend likes the smell too so it's a win-win :)\n\n# Things is don't use anymore / use occasionally\n\n**Medik8 Eyelift Peptides** \\- this pills a little and seems to be an extra step i'm not very happy with so i don't use it every time, I'm just trying to use it all before it gets spoiled.\n\n**COSRX BHA blackhead power liquid** \\- Since I've started retinal this seems a little redundant as the black heads have almost disappeared. I still might use it from time to time, 4-6 weeks. Seems wasteful to dispose of a bottle that is almost full.\n\n**Cerave SA Smoothing Cleanser** \\- My face does not like this! I got some inflammation after using this just once. I still use just a tiny bit on the back of my ears from time to time and in the feet and between the toes. \n\n",

      "content": "I’m starting to believe that spicy foods are correlated with the potentiality for maintaining hair. Hear me out: I’ve observed that men from countries with higher contents of spice in their cuisine generally have thicker, more fuller hair deeper into their 30’s+. For example, I’m from Pakistan, and you’ll likely see a full head of hair across the country, from the rich to the poor, from the young to the middle aged. Of course, there’s always the “balding gene”, but compared to other countries, not even close. Same with South American counties, and more, I’m sure. \n\nI believe a reason for this is because of the high spicy content in the cuisines. We know that blood flow is important for keeping pores active and open, and spicy food directly results in blood flowing through the head. Every time I eat really spicy, for example, I feel a strong rush of blood through my temples and on top of my head. Yet, I stopped eating spicy food in my teens, mostly because of stomach issues. My father still has a full head of hair into his 60’s, and his hairline is immaculate. He loves spicy food and eats it often. I’ve resorted to using min/fin for my temples. Of course, my mother’s side is also prone to balding, but her side also did not eat many spices growing up.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you think a high spicy content can sustain blood flow to the scalp? In the least, it should help with maintaining longer, no? \n\nNot saying a lack of spicy foods results in hair loss, but that a high intake of spice may encourage blood flow to the scalp, and thus maintain hair density longer.

Looking for a moisturiser to use here, please suggest the best one.\n\nResults-\n\nCleanser: i’ve been using for about 6-7 months now and i dont know if it works but i have noticed that oil production has reduced in my T-zone. It has never broken my skin out or anything harsh like that so I’ll probably repurchase it and continue using it.\n\nSunscreen: Been using this since the start of summer this year so around March, and I quite like it. Again I honestly don’t know if it’s doing anything because I have fair skin with redness on my cheeks 😭. But I haven’t tanned so i guess it’s working? It’s light-weight, blends into my skin quick, no white-cast, and the texture is thin, not thick at all, hasn’t caused any breakouts so I have recently repurchased it and will continue using it.\n\nToner: Just bought it a week ago, no clue if it’s working or not, hasn’t caused a breakout, let’s see if it reduces pores as it claims. Will update in the comments if I notice improvements.\n\nSerum: Definitely noticed a difference from the first week itself, I used 5% for like 6 months and it hardly did anything so I started using 10%, I can see the redness reducing and other people have noticed it too so i’ll keep using this one.\n\nTLDR: Sharing my review of these 4 products &amp; Requesting y’all to drop some advice/comments about my routine, what other serums I can try to reduce redness and acne scars, and please suggest a good moisturiser for my skin type.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

My routine is:\n\nI only wash my hair maybe every 2 or 3 days, Im using at the moment for shampoo the Tresemmé Replenish &amp; Cleanse, for conditioner i’m using a Garnier reconstructing conditioner for damaged hair and after shower I use the cantu leave in conditioner repair cream. I only air dry my hair never used diffuser or hair dryer. And then during the days where I don’t wash my hair I just use and style it with the same cantu conditioner. I think that’s my refresh routine on the days I don’t wash my hair.\n\nI’m open for shampoo suggestions and conditioners too!\n\nthe first 2 pics are after shower after wash and applying the cantu leave in conditioner, the last 2 pics is after waking up. (i use a bonnet but most of the times to protect my hair but it just comes off during the night) 😅\n\nAny advise would be greatly appreciated!!! ",

I’ve been trying to achieve a wet hair look for ages, but I still haven’t got it.\n\nPics 1-2 show how my hair looks right after a shower or the beach (no products)—it’s legit perfect. The issue is, once it dries, it turns into pics 4-6, which isn’t bad, but not what I want.\n\nIdeally, I’d love it to look like pic 3 (Neymar style). I’m a total noob at styling curly hair, so I don’t know how to get there.\n\nOn products: Most I’ve tried (leave-in conditioner, gel, curl cream) make my hair too curly and don’t keep that straight, wet vibe from pics 1-2. They tangle my curls more and turn it coily, like a lil fro.\n\nMy routine: Wash 4 times a week (after sports), then air dry. Shampoo once, conditioner every other time. No real products except a bit of oil sometimes or sea salt spray. I sleep with a bonnet and silk pillowcase.\n\nSorry for the essay, but if anyone has recommendations, I’d really appreciate it ✌🏽 (Also if anyone knows what hair type I have that'd be much appreciated!!)",
