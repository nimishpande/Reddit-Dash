I know looks aren’t everything, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m aging in fast forward while everyone else gets to look young a little longer. The vanity part stings, but honestly the confidence hit is worse\n\nDating apps made it very clear how much people care about hair. My matches dropped like 90% as soon as it started thinning. It’s depressing to realize how quickly you become “less attractive” over something you can’t control.\n\nI play battlefield with friends most nights and even in the chat, jokes get tossed around about my hairline like it’s just harmless fun. Maybe for them it is. For me it’s a constant reminder.\n\nSo I’m asking guys who’ve been through this:  \nDo I just shave it and move on?  \nDoes confidence really make that much of a difference?  \nHow do you accept a change you never wanted?\n\nI don’t want to feel embarrassed about something that’s just genetics but right now I do.",

I have oily, acne-prone skin with PIE (post inflammatory erythema) and to stay safe, I believe my skin is on the sensitive side so I try my best to use gentle products that are non-comedogenic.\n\nThis is my current skincare routine: Makeup remover: Manyo Pure Cleansing Oil to remove mascara only, any micellar water from Nivea Daily Cleanser: Hada Labo Hydra and Whitening Face Wash \nChemical exfoliant (Started with 1-2 a week, then progressed to every other day): Paula’s Choice BHA Liquid Exfoliant (Korean version which is 0.5% only compared to US version 2%) \nSerum: Apotheke Science Philippines 5% Niacinamide for Sensitive Skin \nMoisturizer: Purito Seoul Oat-in Calming Gel Cream \nPimple patch: NEEDLY Spot Clear Patch\n\nI have searched online but I don’t want to blindly commit to a product without knowing other users’ experiences, and it’s hard not to be a skeptic these days with paid influencers. Here are some products that i’ve been thinking about:\n\n-Anua Azelaic Serum (Green)\n-BRING GREEN Zinc Teca 1.2% Serum\n-De La Cruz Acne Treatment Ointment (5% or 10% not so sure)\n-Numbuzin No.1 Pure-full Calming Herb Toner \n-SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Probio-Cica Intensive Ampoule 95ml\n(Note: not buying all products of course, just the ones I have in mind)\n\nThe common theme here is to get rid of my PIE because it’s a main concern I want to address, as well as my acne. While researching, common ingredients recommended were centella, azelaic acid, TECA, TXA, and probably more haha..\n\nI would appreciate any advice on the matter. Also, feel free to recommend products aside from the ones listed, as well as deinfluencing..",

In the shower when I start scrunching it looks quite nice but after the drying process (and especially the next day it looks terrible!) \n\nI usually start with brushing my hair before washing it. First I use shampoo I use the nutritive shampoo, hair mask and conditioner. I will detangle my hair while in the shower with the conditioner in. Then I will wash it out and start scrunching all the water out. After that I will use some hair gel (it’s a strong paste from a local hair dresser that I delude with some water to create a more creamy texture) and scrunch it into my hair after that I will use a towel and scrunch to get the excess water off. Then I try and diffuse my hair which is still a bit of process. After that I plop it into a t shirt and wait till the last bits dry and it sets and that’s how I end up here. Am i using the wrong products or should I use a different method? I saw some people use a comb and twirl the hair around that, is that more suited for curlier than wavy hair or the other way around? \nAnyways I’m super thankful for any suggestions or tips on how to deal with this mess.

I don’t get a lot of pimples but I mostly get cysts/nodules that are very deep and take a long time to go away. In this picture, I only have 2 active pimples and all the other marks you see are completely flat and soft. I’m trying to repair my skin barrier right now so I’m only using a matte moisturising cream along with aloe vera gel, and also the Laroche possay Effeclar green cleanser. My skin feels much smoother and healthier now but still super red.\n\nI’ve tried Benzoyl Peroxide (honestly I think my skin is this red because I was overusing BP), tretinoin, azelaic acid, you name it.\n\nAlso i’d like to mention that I can’t take accutane as i’m a pilot, and there are certain restrictions regarding my medical that I don’t really want to mess with for accutane.\n\nIs there anyone that can give some advice how to combat this persistent redness that never goes away?",

The price jump feels surprisingly small — usually 100g packs cost almost double or at least 1.8x, right?\n\nSo I’m wondering:\n\nIs this a typo or intentional?\n\nHas anyone bought both sizes — are they actually the same product and formula?\n\nDo they maybe use different packaging or batch formulas for the larger one?\n\n\nAlso, if you’ve tried both Barrier Relief and Barrier Plus, how do they compare in texture and finish? (I have combo-sensitive skin leaning oily, if that helps.)\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been dealing with pigmentation for quite a long time now, especially on my forehead and cheeks. Over the past year, I’ve tried to stay consistent — using various skincare products I found after a lot of research on Instagram and other online sources. I’ve even used a few medicated products that were commonly recommended for pigmentation.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing has really worked for me. My skin still looks dull, uneven, and patchy. Every aesthetician I’ve consulted says it’s mainly sun damage, and that I might need to go for something like a Cosmelan peel or a professional treatment. But honestly, those are way beyond my budget right now.\n\nIt’s quite discouraging because I used to have clear, healthy-looking skin, and now it just feels like I’ve lost that glow. I’m looking for affordable and effective treatment options, or even simple product routines that might help improve my skin tone and texture gradually.\n\nIf anyone here has gone through something similar — sun damage, pigmentation, or post-inflammatory marks — and found something that actually worked (especially in the Indian climate), I’d really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThank you so much in advance 🙏",

Ever other wash, use Garnier Fructius Shampoo to clarify. Every day, I wet my hair, scrunch some of the moisture out using and scrunch in AG Liquid Care Effects Medium-Hold Gel (and at the time of this post, I have just started to do the same with Not Your Mother's Defining Cream before the gel). Hover then pixie diffuse to finish.\n\nI have tried to learned literally as much as I possibly can, like protein-moisture balance, etc. Still, no matter how much experimentation I try, my hair always ends up completely undefined and without shape. Basically just volume without definition, just constant bed head. I purposefully use less moisture and more protein because my hair is finer and has a looser curl pattern (and previously I felt as if my hair was experiencing moisture overload), but my hair is still just always limp and dull. When I scrunch out there crunch, my hair instantly frizzes up despite using a high-hold, humidity-resistant gel.\n\nI can't keep my hair overnight with a bonnet because that just doesn't work, and brush styling didn't work me either (not for a lack of effort or for doing it wrong - I sectioned my hair and everything, but brush styling is just not for my hair type.) I also don't want to come off as someone with waves that is trying to achieve curls, because I definitely have loose curls, they just have no definition whatsoever. Finally, the reason why I'm bothered by this is because my hair just completely covers my face, doing the exact opposite of framing it (you can't really tell because my face is covered I. photos but trust). On rare days when my hair is actually defined, it actually frames my face really well.",

I would really appreciate any advise on building my skincare routine. I'm looking for good cleanser - not CeraVe pls, i can survive Sephora prices, maybe asian stuff if it is really good. I am mostly just washing my face and using moisturizer (atm its honey halo pharmacy cream). I don't have trust in unscented products that smell like glue stick, would like to avoid them too i would say my skin is dry/combinated, the other issues are my acne that i rub all the time bc of anxiety, large pores and those sebum filaments on nose and chin. i was using oil cleanser but i don't think it is doing much. thank you all!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
