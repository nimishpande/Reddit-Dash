      "title": "Update (Part 2): I emailed Indian sunscreen brands asking for ISO reports; outcomes after 30+ days",
      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is Part 2 / update to my [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/1pn678r/i_emailed_indian_sunscreen_brands_asking_for_iso/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) where I mentioned reaching out to sunscreen brands to verify their SPF, UVA, and water-resistance claims.\n\nI waited over a month before posting this update so brands had sufficient time to respond. Below is a factual summary of what I asked and what I received.\n\n**What I requested (same from all brands):**  \nISO 24444: SPF in-vivo test report (with lab name &amp; accreditation)  \nISO 24442 or ISO 24443: UVA protection test report (with numerical UVA-PF / critical wavelength data)  \nWater resistance testing (WR40 / WR80), if applicable\n\n# Responses after ~1 month\n\n# 🟢 High transparency\n\n**Re’equil**\n\n→ Shared full ISO 24444 SPF report, UVA data, and water-resistance testing (WR40/WR80).\n\n→ Detailed documentation provided.\n\n# 🟡 Partial transparency\n\n**The Derma Co (Honasa)**\n\n→ Directed to a publicly available “Certificate of Sunscreen Efficacy Testing” on their product page.\n\n→ Certificate confirms: In-vivo SPF testing as per ISO 24444:2019 (SPF ≈ 50) In-vitro UVA assessment (critical wavelength ≈ 379 nm)\n\n→ Full test reports and water-resistance data were not shared.\n\n**Minimalist**\n\n→ Shared ISO 24444 in-vivo SPF report.\n\n→ When asked specifically for water-resistance testing (WR40/WR80 or ISO 16217/18861) to support their “80-minute water resistance” claim, the request was escalated but no documentation was shared even after 1+ month.\n\n**La Shield (Glenmark)**\n\n→ Shared numerical SPF/UVA values via email.\n\n→ No test date, full methodology, or lab accreditation details were shared\n\n# 🔴 No data shared (after 30+ days)\n\nThe following brands acknowledged the request, raised tickets, or said they would revert, but did not share any SPF/UVA/WR documentation even after 30+ days:\n\n* Aqualogica\n* Conscious Chemist\n* Brinton (UV Doux)\n* IPCA (Acne UV Gel)\n* Blynds\n* Photostable\n* Episoft\n\nFor this update, lack of response after 30+ days (despite tickets or acknowledgements) has been treated as an outcome, not a pending state.\n\n**Scope note:** Brands listed were selected based on products frequently mentioned on this sub and those I personally used or see recommended. This is not an exhaustive list of all Indian sunscreens.\n\n***Edit:*** *A few people suggested emailing additional brands. I won’t be expanding the scope further at this point, this update reflects only the brands I had already contacted and responses received within a fixed time window. I may revisit this in the future, but not right now.*",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I discovered that the reason why I had dry skin isn’t because my moisturizer isn’t good enough but the flakes were because of a damaged barrier, and that’s when the first domino fell, I got a cica cream and then thought about fixing hyperpigmentation on my elbows with glycolic acid and now I want to add retinol for uneven skin tone and some small crater scars from chicken pox when I was 6, I am aware that the scars may be permanent now but I am also thinking about adding at home microneedling stamp to help fade it to its extent. Now that’s my main concern but as a side concern I also have some back acne scars that I’ve never paid attention to since the acne was never visible and I wanted to know if retinol would be enough for those and also I have some stretch marks on my hips and lower back which I wanted to use microneedling and retinol.\n\nEXCUSE THE YAPPING, now is there something I should know before proceeding, and would the use of Vitamin C and/or glycolic acid help my issue? and what products/brands do you suggest and which ones to stay away from? For now I use the la Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 and their Anthelios UVmune400 SPF50 sunscreen for my face and The ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% for my elbows and thinking about adding a Cica body lotion",

      "content": "Before I get in to the actual details I think a lot of it is just genetics. I got blessed with good hair color, and my hair is naturally thick and doesn't break easily. A lot of my routine is based around minimizing frizz because my hair will naturally form curls very easily. The first two pictures I attached to the post were Day 3 morning hair so you can see some frizz showing up. The last one is after being out working in humidity for that full day.\n\n\n\n# Basic Care\n\nThe one thing I think I have done for my hair that's been super beneficial is that I have never used heat products. If you straighten/curl your hair on certain occasions you're probably fine honestly, I choose not to just to play it safe.\n\nBesides that you probably already know most of the things. A silk bonnet or a silk pillow case is always a good idea, not dunking your hair in buckets of dirt and grease (or just using too much product) will also definitely help. Keep it tied back during physical activity in order to prevent knots and frizz.\n\n\n\n# Wash Routine\n\nA lot of my routine is based off of the Curly Girl Method (CGM). While CGM does take it a bit far in my opinion a lot of my routine is taken from it. If you are interested you can find a lot of guides on reddit, but be careful as it can cause product build up.\n\nWhat I have found works best for me is-\n\n1. Get hair DRENCHED as much as possible\n2. Detangling with a curl defining hair brush (skip this if you have fine hair or hair that easily tangles)\n3. Shampoo (2x a week, or if hair is greasy/dirty)\n4. Rinse thoroughly\n5. A LOT of conditioner, brush through with curl defining brush.\n6. Let conditioner sit for \\~3 minutes\n7. Rinse thoroughly \n8. While hair is still dripping wet use product, comb through or just scrunch in depending on product (skip if you feel like you are starting to get product buildup or if its just not needed)\n9. Scrunch extra water out with hands\n\nAfter that my hair is still \"wet\" by most standards but I normally go to sleep since I shower right before bed. There is probably a hundred reasons not to do that but when I wake up its always tangle free and I just need to scrunch/shake it out which is really nice in the mornings. I use a silk pillow case so I just \"whip\" my hair on to it before I sleep.\n\nThis is what I have found works for me, if you know something doesn't work for you personally just swap it out or skip it.\n\n# Products\n\nI say this with complete sincerity there is one product I would literally go to war for. [Lush Super Milk](https://www.lush.com/us/en_us/p/super-milk-conditioning-spray/100ml) is my absolute saving grace. I never skip using this, it prevents frizz and smells amazing. The only other product I use is [Function of Beauty Curl Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Function-Beauty-Curl-Cream-Curly/dp/B0CT2FY1S5), it helps to revive my hair but I don't use it every time.\n\nFor shampoo and conditioner I honestly use anything that says curly on it. However what I normally use when I can get my hands on it is the [Aussie Miracle Curls](https://www.amazon.com/Aussie-Miracle-Curls-Collection-Conditioner/dp/B0886XTJDN) line (the link has the full set but I recommend just getting the shampoo/conditioner).\n\n# Closing\n\nLike I said this is definitely not perfect for everyone but I find it works nicely for me. If anyone has any advice for me I would love to hear it. Improving a routine never hurts :)",

Any advice on how to get my roots and back of head to curl? Or is it just going to take way longer for the roots to start curling? Is it just my hair type or am I doing something wrong?\n\n\n\n🎀 HAIR ROUTINE 🎀\n\n   Ask for face framing long\n\n\\- \\[x\\] 1st Week: Hydration Week → Hydration Shampoo, Hydration Hair Masque, Hydration Conditioner (add Hydration Masque only once if washing more than once that week) Jan 27\n\n\\- \\[ \\] 2nd Week: Protein Week → Hydration Shampoo + bonding protein treatment. “Bond repair masque” green bottle \n\n\\- \\[ \\] 3rd Week: Hydration Week → Hydration Shampoo + Conditioner (Hydration Masque if dry) \n\n\\- \\[ \\] Clarify Week → Clarifying Shampoo (2 lathers) + Protein Masque\n\n⸻\n\n🧴 Wash Products\n\n1. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo\n\n\t•\tUse: Weekly (non-clarify weeks)\n\n\t•\tHow: Focus on scalp &amp; roots only. Massage with fingertips (not nails). Let suds run through lengths as you rinse.\n\n\t•\tRinse: Thoroughly with lukewarm water.\n\n2. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner\n\n\t•\tUse: Weekly (after Hydration Shampoo, except Clarify Week)\n\n\t•\tHow: Apply to mid-lengths &amp; ends (avoid roots to prevent heaviness). Use wide-tooth comb or fingers to detangle.\n\n\t•\tRinse: After 3–5 minutes, rinse lightly (leave a little slip if your hair likes it).\n\n3. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Masque\n\n\t•\tUse: Every 1–2 weeks (instead of conditioner).\n\n\t•\tHow: Apply generously mid-lengths → ends. Detangle with wide-tooth comb. Smooth with “praying hands.”\n\n\t•\tWait: 10–15 minutes (cover with cap for extra effect).\n\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n4. SheaMoisture Protein Masque\n\n\t•\tUse: Once a month (after Clarifying Shampoo).\n\n\t•\tHow: Section hair, apply mid-lengths → ends first, then lightly on roots if needed. Brush through for even coverage. Light scrunch to help curls.\n\n\t•\tWait: 10–15 minutes.\n\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n\t•\tConditioner: Skip (this masque replaces it).\n\n5. SheaMoisture Strengthen &amp; Restore Clarifying Shampoo\n\n\t•\tUse: Once a month (Clarify Week).\n\n\t•\tHow: Do 2 lathers — first lifts buildup, second deep cleans. Focus on scalp, let suds rinse through lengths.\n\n\t•\tFollow with: Protein Masque (not conditioner).\n\n6. SheaMoisture Bond Repair Masque (optional/alternate)\n\n\t•\tUse: Every 2–3 weeks or when hair feels weak/breaking.\n\n\t•\tHow: Same as Hydration Masque — mid-lengths → ends, detangle, smooth in.\n\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n⸻\n\n🌿 Leave-In &amp; Styling Products\n\n7. Curlsmith Frizz Rescue Curl Retainer\n\n\t•\tUse: After cream (daily).\n\n\t•\tHow: Scrunch into damp hair, focusing on mid-lengths &amp; ends. This helps lock curl shape and reduce frizz.\n\n\t•\tTip: Use hands or microfiber towel to “cup &amp; scrunch” upward.\n\n8. Curlsmith Frizz Rescue Finishing Serum\n\n\t•\tUse: After styling, when hair is 100% dry.\n\n\t•\tHow: Warm 2–3 drops in hands, then scrunch out any crunch or frizz. Glide lightly over surface for shine.\n\n\t•\tWhen: End of styling, or as touch-up on dry hair between washes.\n\n⸻\n\nIn shower process:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT TO DO\tWHY\n\n1\tDetangle only with conditioner in\tPrevents root stretch\n\n2\tRinse conditioner thoroughly\tSlip flattens roots\n\n3\tLight scrunch before turning water off\tEncourages curl memory\n\n4\tExit shower with hair clumped\tPreserves pattern\n\nWash day styling:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT TO DO\tWHY\n\n1\tKeep hair soaking wet\tCurl forms only when wet\n\n2\tDetangle once (wide tooth, straight down)\tNo shaping yet\n\n3\tApply Curl Retainer FIRST (diluted)\tRoots need early hold\n\n4\tRoot Pinch: small sections, pinch curl upward at scalp (2–3 sec)\tShortens curl path\n\n5\tOne gentle scrunch (mid → root)\tActivates curl upward\n\n6\tDirectional set: push hair forward → back → side to side\tPrevents straight drying\n\n7\tOptional: ½ pea cream on ends only\tSoftness without slip\n\n8\tOptional micro-plop 2–3 min max\tEncourages curl, protects roots\n\nDiffusing for root curl:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT TO DO\tWHY\n\n1\tSet diffuser to low heat + low airflow\tPrevents stretch\n\n2\tStart diffusing at the roots first\tSets curl near scalp\n\n3\tHold diffuser bowl close to scalp but not touching\tEncourages lift\n\n4\tDiffuse in short holds (15–30 sec), then move\tPrevents frizz\n\n5\tTilt head side to side, forward slightly\tCreates root bend\n\n6\tDiffuse lengths last\tPrevents pulling curls down\n\n7\tStop at 90–95% dry\tAvoids over-dry stretch\n\nAfter shower:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT TO DO\tWHY\n\n1\tLet hair cool fully\tSets curl\n\n2\tScrunch out cast gently\tSoftens curls\n\n3\tSeparate only thick clumps\tLess Victorian look\n\n4\tOptional serum on ends\tSeal, don’t weigh down\n\nFront hair line:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT YOU DO\tHOW / NOTES\n\n1\tHair fully wet + styled\tCurl retainer already applied\n\n2\tApply extra-light retainer at hairline\tUse residue on hands only\n\n3\tRoot pinch at hairline\tSmall sections, pinch upward 2–3 sec\n\n4\tTilt head slightly back\tNOT upside down\n\n5\tPlace diffuser bowl close to scalp\tDo not press into skin\n\n6\tHold diffuser 15–20 seconds\tThen lower gently\n\n7\tMove bowl along hairline\tTemple → center → temple\n\n8\tStop when hairline is 80–90% dry\tOver-drying flattens\n\nPinch → tilt back → bowl close → short holds\n\nDay 2 refresh:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT YOU DO\tHOW / NOTES\n\n1\tLightly mist roots first\tSpray or wet fingertips\n\n2\tOptional: diluted curl retainer\tPea-size TOTAL, watered down\n\n3\tRoot pinch at flat areas\tEspecially hairline + crown\n\n4\tOne light scrunch mid → root\tStop early\n\n5\tDiffuse on low heat + low airflow\tSame settings as wash day\n\n6\tStart diffusing at roots\tRoots before ends\n\n7\tTilt head side-to-side\tEncourages bend\n\n8\tStop at 90% dry\tPrevents frizz &amp; stretch\n\nMist roots → pinch → light scrunch → diffuse roots → stop early",

Back then, I had no closed comedones at all, but the redness and dullness bothered me and I’m sure it was the moisturiser 😭\n\nI honestly have no idea what to do, everything is a risk for my skin.

The underneath and lower back sections of my hair are around 2C/3A, but the top layer is more like 2B. After a few days, the top section falls flat and almost straight, while the bottom stays wavy/curly. It makes my hair look uneven — like it’s big and frizzy on top but curlier underneath — instead of defined and put together.  I'm not sure if its because it flattens when I sleep or if I need a bonnet, but i dont think my hair is curly enough to need that?\n\nAnother big issue is dryness. My hair always *feels* dry and kind of rough, even though I deep condition and use oils. It only feels properly moisturised when it’s soaking wet, and once it dries, or even gets damp, that dry/frizzy texture comes back.\n\nI’d love advice on things like:\n\n* how to style a mixed curl pattern, especially getting the top layer to hold waves/curls longer\n* how to stop the crown from going flat\n* why my hair still feels dry even after conditioning and oil\n* any product recommendations for moisture and frizz control (leave-ins, creams, gels, etc.)\n* Any styling tips for wavy hair, I can only really find stuff for curly hair and I'm not sure if it would still work for me?\n\nTysm! I feel like I’m constantly fighting my hair every wash day 😭😭😭\n\nRoutine:\n\n* Oil ends with coconut oil for an hour before shower\n* double cleanse with aussie curly shampoo\n* aussie curly deep conditioner\n* aussie curl hair oil\n* (I dont really style it too much, i just scrunch and air dry as i dont really know how)\n\nP.s. I'll be honest and say I'm still pretty new to this whole curly hair stuff and i can't really afford high end products, so any help at all would be appreciated, whether its styling sleep protection, products or just tips and tricks!",

      "content": "So my parents have always treated my hair as if it's straight, always shampoos and treatments and conditioners for straight hair type only. A few years ago my hair started to puff out and I thought it was frizz and damage from swimming lessons. Now that I've grown more, I've been thinking that maybe my hair is straight up wavy and not straight at all. When I was my hair, it looks sort of straight, and when I dry it with an electric brush it also looks straight, until the days start to go by, it starts to get greasy and it starts becoming wavy. As of right now, when I took this picture, I had my hair up in a simple bun, a few strands fell out, and they look like this. Also, the weather today is very humid, it's been raining all day. I just kinda want to get comfirmation of if my hair really is wavy or if I'm just delusional. And if it is wavy, then which type, just so that I can know how to actually makes my waves show (if I really have them). \nMy routine:\nI use a Tec Italy shampoo/conditioner pair for dry and dull hair. I don't use mousse or gels, only some generic oil drops on the ends. I always blow dry my hair because if I let it airdry it becomes unbearably puffy and messy. I don't use any kind of protection for bed, so no hair caps. (sorry for my English, it's my second language). ",

I think it adds balance to my face overall. I’m looking for some advice from others with guidance towards my most flattering, “signature” haircut. I don’t like to dye my hair and leave it natural.. but I am OK with \\*some\\* styling if it were face framing pieces. If I did get bangs, I would certainly be willing to blow dry/style them as needed. Thanks in advance for any advice/input :) ",
