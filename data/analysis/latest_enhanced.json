      "content": "I see a lot of people talk about hair porosity like it’s the same from root to tip but I don’t think many really understand how it actually works. (*Depending on hair type*) the hair near the scalp is usually lower porosity because it’s newer and healthier, while the mid lengths and ends naturally get more porous over time from everyday wear, washing(esp frequent washes), brushing, the sun, heat damage, dying/bleaching hair, friction or just the ends being older. It is possible for hair from root to tip to be fully low porosity but for that to happen the hair would have to go through little to no damage in its lifetime of growing, for many people it’s inevitable that the porosity will change. \n\nWhen I only used lightweight, silicone-free products for my “low porosity” hair, my hair was a MESS, very damaged, and lots of breakage. My ends stayed dry and frizzy constantly, but once I started using heavier conditioners, masks, and leave ins especially with silicones, my hair completely changed for the better. Tbh once I stopped stressing about porosity and just focused on what my hair actually needed (oily scalp dry ends) is when my hair as a whole improved! \n\n*If anyone has also struggled with this too i can give some product recommendations in the comments on what’s worked for me!! lmk!*\n",

      "title": "What is the science behind 'less damaging' hair dryers such as the Dyson?",
      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Getting the natural pattern back has been a struggle!  It seemed like no matter what I tried it ended up looking like a frizzy mess. I was in utter shock the entire time I styled with the bounce curl brush at how well it worked.\n\nI don’t have much CG products yet - ordered a few things but they are in transit. Here is the routine I used prior to this photo:\n\n1. Wash and condition with AG Haircare ACV Balance shampoo &amp;  conditioner - squish to condish \n\n2. Rinse, scrunch while wet and wrap with microfiber towel\n\n3. Section hair and brush with bounce curl brush to create curl clumps. I scrunched immediately after each section with Giovanni LA hold styling gel.\n\n4. Blow dry mostly upside down with Dyson Supersonic &amp; diffuser attachment\n\n5. Let it completely air dry then scrunch out the crunch with a tiny bit of jojoba oil\n\n6. Stare at hair in mirror completely shocked",

Either way, it's very flat. Sometimes I dry my hair out of the shower, other times I air dry, it doesn't change a thing. I don't do much to add volume but when I DO style it, the style tends to fall after an hour or so. I shower daily, full wash every 1-2 days, and shampoo my bangs daily or else they get too oily. I only condition my ends, only shampoo my scalp.  Idk how people keep their hair looking like this all day, but I was hoping for some advice on that. \n\nI'm thinking a soft wolfcut, a little shorter than this. I'm wondering: is this hairstyle possible without endless product and sprays and curls to keep it in? I don't want to ruin my hair but I also want to put volume in my hair. thanks!",

I have all the issues on my face, you name it, I have it.\n\nI used to have terrible acne, but from the past 2-2.5 years, I started using skin care and made so much of progress.\n\nBut I'm still seeing occasional acne, black heads, white heads, large open pores, PIH, dark spots and uneven skin tone.\n\nBut my question is how do I get rid of my black heads on my forehead?

For reference, I have oily t-zone, sensitive, and somewhat acne prone (I think I've controlled it more, explained below) skin. I also have closed comedones (or fungal acne?) all around and acne scarring/hyperpigmentation on my cheek.\n\nMy current skincare morning/night routine:\n- Soon Jung whip cleanser\n- SK-II pitera clear lotion\n- SK-II pitera essence\n- Anua Niacinamide 10% + TXA 4% Serum (targeted on my cheeks)\n- Shiseido white lucent eye cream\n- Vaseline intensive care (yellow bottle)\n\nI've tried other cleansers, like Anua Quercetinol Pore Deep and Innisfree Green Tea, which were ok but didn't seem to really help. I recently got the Soon Jung one and I really like it so far, my skin actually feels clean after washing but also not stripping. The SK-II seemed to have help control my oiliness a little as well as acne, which I've been using since January 2025. I think the Anua Niacinamide helped a little but then plateaued, so my scarring is still there just not as obvious as better. Ngl Shiseido eye cream didn't seem like it did anything but I thought there's no harm in using it since I don't have any other eye cream. Vaseline lotion I've used for multiple years at this point, I had tried Illiyoon ceramide cream but I think it made me break out (couple years ago, I don't remember clearly).\n\nI want to get rid of my bumpy texture from closed comedones, acne scarring on my cheeks, and control my oiliness! Any and all advice would be appreciated!",

      "content": "TBR: I'm a primary caregiver to a disabled child. Even with an abundance of support from my partner, basic personal care is extremely difficult.  I've got fine, wavy/curly hair, and I'm considering going very short, like above my chin or shorter pixie cut to reduce maintenence.  Is it actually easier with this type of hair? \n\nLonger explanation: \nEven with as much support in place as we can manage, I can barely wash my hair 1-2x a week. Styling *only* happens after bathing. My hair lives in a bun or ponytail 6-7 days a week. I hate it. I hate it touching my face. I hate the headache it gives me from being up all day. I hate how it looks. \n\nMy child is very emotionally disabled and I've gotten my hair cut once in six years. I've been doing the ponytail method at home, resulting in several not great cuts. My wavy/curly hair hides alot of it. But I haven't had a cut I like in at least four years. \n\nI've never had shorter than tips of my shoulder length when dry. And I'm considering going very short simply to not have to fucking deal with it anymore. I also happen to think short hair on women looks fantastic. \n\nBut I've heard mixed opinions on whether it's actually easier (I know it varies hugely by type), and unless I felt comfortable buzzing it myself, I'd have to get it cut regularly. My hair doesnt grow fast though. I'd consider almost any length to make this easier. But also since my hair doesn't grow fast, it would take me years to get back to my current length. So it feels super risky if I didn't like it or it was much harder to take care of. \n\nAnd if you can't tell, I'm in a situation where the smallest thing can set the dumpster of my life on fire. 🫠😂\n\nI'd appreciate feedback!",

      "content": "So there is this theory of androgenetic alopecia suggesting that hair loss is caused by chronic tension in the scalp, which restricts the bludflow, also leads to chronic scalp inflammation, which then triggers a cascade of dht which then miniaturizes the follicles. Then the area which goes bald the galea aponeurotica has the most tension and therefore balds in most men with cases of classic MPB. There fore the best cure for male pattern baldness is the regular routine massaging of the scalp to relieve the tension.\n\nIs this theory legit or bulshit?

Does this indicate global scalp tension everywhere?",

      "content": "I’m a 23-year-old guy, and I’ve had acne since I was about 17. It’s gone through phases, sometimes barely noticeable, sometimes really bad. Earlier this year, it flared up worse than ever, and I got desperate to find a solution.\n\nAfter a lot of trial and error, I think I’ve finally figured out what was driving most of my breakouts: **too much Omega-6**. For years I ate huge amounts of peanut butter every day, along with almond milk and almond yogurt. I used to believe dairy and sugar were the main culprits behind my acne, but even after cutting them, I was still getting painful cystic breakouts. I still do not eat any dairy and very little sugar. I have been off dairy for 3 years.\n\nThen I learned about how **peanuts are extremely high in Omega-6**, with an Omega-6:3 ratio around **4000:1,** compared to a healthy balance closer to **4:1**. Excess Omega-6 can be highly inflammatory, and inflammation is closely tied to acne.\n\nOnce I cut out peanuts and other high-Omega-6 foods, my cystic acne disappeared. I still get the occasional small whitehead, but nothing like before. At the same time, I started eating a lot of **overnight oats made with coconut milk, chia seeds, and flax seeds,** both great sources of Omega-3s. I truly think that balance has made all the difference.\n\nI know not everyone believes diet affects acne, but I really believe it has at least some effect for everyone.\n\n**TL;DR:** Try lowering your Omega-6 intake (especially from peanuts, other nuts, etc) and increasing your Omega-3s (from chia, flax, or fish). It might really help your skin. Just wanted to leave this here, even if it only helps 1 person somewhere.",
