      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

In the beginning of this journey I styled my curls with a brush but found out it made my curls lose all their shape so I just detangle with my hands in the shower while I still have conditioner on before rinsing.\nMy routine is nothing crazy but it works for me and I am happy to share it with you guys☺️",

I can’t STAND the back of my hair. It’s stringy and flat and weird, and only curls at the bottom. I have strands that frizz and don’t define no matter what I seem to do. At the same time, my hair can look flat and weighed down, and only curls at the bottom in most places. I’m not sure what I can do. I don’t know if I should be adding more moisture or if I’m adding too much. How can I get my hair to look less weighed down at the top and in the back? Any help would be appreciated.  \nI usually use Herbal Essences honey shampoo and conditioner, but lately I’ve been using garnier fructis conditioner. I wash my hair maybe 2-3 times a week, or more if it gets sweaty. I try to leave in conditioner for as long as I can before washing it out and I always leave in a tiny bit. I only brush my hair wet, and I apply products while it’s pretty damp. Daily, I use OUAI leave in, or Sleep on it overnight curl cream. Neither really do anything, I still have a ton of frizz and weighed down looking hair. I shower before bed, and let my hair air dry 70% before I clip it up. I swear I could put in the whole bottle of product and my hair would still look dry. The second pic is a failed attempt at defusing. In the 3rd picture I included, I had used gel as well to style my hair, and I like the way it looks. It was completely air dried. It was also summer, and my hair always seems to be prettier in the summer. The fourth pic is just air dried hair after my normal routine. Any advice would be really appreciated. I’m not sure what my hair needs. Plz give tips!!",

      "content": "I am so sorry if this is a stupid question, but is it possible to just not be able to tolerate Retinol? Can you *develop* a sensitivity to Retinol? A few years ago I was struggling with really bad cystic acne because of an IUD, and my doctor prescribed me Tretinoin. At the time I was able to tolerate it really well, eventually being able to use it almost everyday. I moved countries so I don’t have the same doctor anymore, and my cystic acne cleared up after I had the IUD removed, so I never got more Tretinoin and haven’t been using Retinol for the last couple years. I have recently introduce The Ordinay Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion into my routine. I have developed a really bad reaction under my eyes a couple of times where my under-eyes get very red, super dry, burning, and prominent wrinkles (photos attached). I’m not sure if it is a Retinol burn? I got the Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Bakuchiol under eye cream, because Bakuchiol is supposedly gentler than retinol, but I’ve ended up with the same thing from that, just not *quite* as bad. Everything I’ve been able to find says that Retinol often gives you irritation and purging as you are getting used to it, so I’m wondering if that is what is happening or if my skin can just not tolerate Retinol. If anyone could help me out, I’d appreciate it!",

It doesn't get super greasy and I usually wash it 2 times a week, but it's just frizzy. It's always in my face, and I want to have it down more, but it just doesn't sit nicely. I've kept it in double dutch braids for years and have been scared to try anything new with it. It's also sooo heavy. I can't do high buns or pony's because it falls eventually and hurts, and no claw clips hold it. Any, and I mean any advice is appreciated. My hair is beautiful and I love it, I'm so grateful to have such amazing hair, but I just don't know what to do with it. I was kind of thinking of half cornrows, but as a blue eyed white chick, I feel like I'd be judged. I shampoo twice with like herbal essence shampoo, and conditioner with the Enjoy luxury conditioner, but that's literally it. I don't straighten, curl or do put any product in my hair. I try not to brush my hair cuz then it frizzes but it gets so knotty, even with braids, and it becomes almost impossible to do hairstyles. I know the photos aren't the best, but they were the best I could find right now. ",

Started balding at 28 at the crown. At the age of 29 it was progressing so I jumped on Minoxidil topical and after a while I started oral Fin. After two years I had made an almost full recovery but after a lot of ups and downs with sides and dosages, I desided to quit (unfortunately from minox also,big mistake) somewhere during the pandemic and kept a buzz cut. Also with the supervision of a good endo btw.\n\n\nStarted again now and I am 4 months into Minox topical 5% 2Xday and 1 month on  topical fin 0,01% 1Xday (pharmacy compound with minox). Got me a Dr. Pen also and will start next week at 0,7 every 10 days after I buzz again. Got a rosemary castor  oil for the scalp also with biotin etc just for the fvck of it..Also using Ketoconazole 2% 3Xweek. Vitamin B12, D3, C and  Biotin, Ω3 and will add zinc and copper at a 10:1 ratio.\nLong way to go but let's see. That will be the final push to recovery.\n\n\nThank you all for inspiring me to start again with your contributions.",

It's stunning to discover tastes you didn't know before after more than 3 decades on this shitty planet.

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
