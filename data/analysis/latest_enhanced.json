      "content": "1 - Stick to a routine. Doing CTM daily will give you better results than buying a 3,000 rs serum you use once a week.\n\n2 - If a product suits you, don’t switch just because some influencer said so. I’ve stuck to Clinique moisturiser for 5+ years and it still works.\n\n3 - What you eat shows up on your face. Avoid sugars and oils as much as you can.\n\n4 - CTM (Cleanse, tone, moisturise) is the best advice for most people. You don’t need 10 steps unless you're a professional whose career or work depends on having perfect skin. \n\n5 - Don’t fall for hype. everyone went crazy about that Dot &amp; Key Vitamin C serum and then forgot about it in 2 months? So stick to what has been working for others for years and not stuff that is trending.\n\n6 - Use sunscreen daily. SPF 30+ at least. The minimalist or Re’equil sunscreens are best.\n\n7 - Scrubs are not essential. and you should definitely not use them twice a week. Once every 8–10 days is enough unless you have blackhead-prone skin.\n\n8 - Buy for your skin type, depending on whether it is oily, dry, or a combo. Just because someone on Reddit said snail mucin is great doesn’t mean it’ll suit you.\n\n9 - Go for small sizes. Most people don’t even finish their products before they expire or oxidise which will do more harm than good (those damn vitamin C serums).\n\n10 - IMPORTANT: Don’t store skincare in the same bathroom as your regular shower. heat + steam is really bad for the shelf life of those products, if you must, keep them in a locked cabinet.\n\n11 - Mild cleanser &gt; harsh actives, unless you’re using something prescribed like AHA/BHA. Cetaphil and Simple are safe bets.\n\n12 - Drinking water is good, but it won’t clear your acne. That happens only with skincare + diet + hormones.\n\n13 - Don’t layer 6 products, the actives can clash. Stick to 3–4 max. Example: cleanser, serum, moisturiser, sunscreen.\n\n14 - New products take 3–6 weeks to show results.\n\n15 - Never sleep with makeup, not even tinted sunscreen. Just double clense and go to bed.\n\n16 - KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF YOUR FACE. Girl, you have no idea how dirt your phone is.\n\n17 - Sleep matters. Netflix binges will def show up on your skin.\n\n18 - DIY masks with lemon, toothpaste, or haldi ARE A BIG NO. Ayurvedic stuff is good but only in moderation, most natural chemicals are really bad for your skin because of how little you've been exposed to them.\n\n19 - Don’t blindly follow someone else’s routine. Make your own after experimentation and consultation from dermats.\n\n20 - Good skin isn’t flawless. it’s healthy, hydrated, and consistent. Stop chasing “glass skin” filters. That's marketing and especially for Indians, VERY HARD to achieve. Koreans can get that effect because of genetics and diet much more easily. Keep your peace girls, no need to obsess over something that's not right for you in the first place. \n\nHope this helped!!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

They had Not Your Mother's Kids curl conditioner for about $5, when the other conditioner options where all at least $10 (including the regular not your mothers). I grabbed it since it was cheap. I've used NYM in the past and while it's not my favorite it is usually a good option for me when I can't find my usual options (Pattern, Sun Bum, or Cantu). I've used it once and it seems to work fine for me, so I'm wondering if there's any reason not to regularly use a kid's conditioner as an adult, or if it's just some marketing gimmick. It's half the price so I figure if it works just as well, why not use that instead?\n\nI'm not sure how relevant my routine is for this post, but for reference here's what I usually do:\n\n* shampoo once a week or so with a homemade shampoo bar\n* conditioner every time I shower (products mentioned above)\n* wring out and tshirt plop to dry slightly\n* scrunch in curl cream or mousse (Pattern is my go-to. Lately I've been using mixed chicks but I don't like it)\n* About once a week I'll use sea salt spray (Sun Bum)\n* use a hair drier with a diffuser until just damp, air dry the rest of the way.\n* My hair is shoulder length, 3C",

      "title": "Hair is too soft??",
      "content": "TLDR: got a big hair cut and my hair is now completely undamaged, making it so soft and fluffy that none of my products or techniques are working. How do I get it to curl nicely again and not be fluffy and light even after using heaps of heavyweight gel? \n\nHello, recently I had a bad hair cut experience that took me from armpit length hair to chin length. I’ve come to terms with this and I do like my hair short, just wasn’t expecting it at this time. Since so much length was taken off my hair is now realllyyyy fresh and new and clean and undamaged. Normally I’d consider that a good thing but it’s making my hair very difficult to style. It’s been a few weeks since the cut so it’s not just my hair rebounding after that at this point. \n\nMy hair is medium all around, density, porosity, and texture. My hair ranges from 2c to 3b, with the bottom most layer more a 2b. I have a pretty blunt cut that is one length all around just under my chin, and a few face framing pieces. \n\nRoutine: I clarify with the Aveno ACV clarifying shampoo, then Aussie miracle curls shampoo and conditioner. I’ve tried just doing the two shampoos and no conditioner but it didn’t make much difference. \n\nI’ve put gel on soaking wet in the shower then scrunched, sometimes adding more and sometimes not. I’ve scrunched my hair drier and put on mousse or gel in a damp state. Tried just about every combo I can think of with the products listed below. \n\nI’ve tried eco curly gel, aunt Jackie’s don’t shrink flaxseed gel, not your mothers curl talk, and herbal essence curl mousse and they all look okay on day one, usually, and especially if I have time to let it air dry fully or diffuse. If I sleep on it damp at all it’s a mess. Even sleeping on it dry and complete ruins the look. \n\nIt’s all just too soft. It will hold a bit of a cast while drying, and when I scrunch it out a bit at that point the products seem to completely vanish and the hair gets so so soft and looses its definition and frizzes out. But if I don’t scrunch it my hair looks wet and crunchy from the product. Re-wetting it later doesn’t reengage the cast at all, and if I apply more product at that point it gets sticky. \n\nI don’t use a defining brush, I comb it in the shower with conditioner in. I’ve done some manual finger curling clumps but they usually get lost and the strands end up small, isolated, floofy, and frizzy. I do use a satin pillow case but not a bonnet. \n\nMy instinct is to go for heavier product, something with a more extreme hold that will create a cast that builds curls that last more than a few hours after scrunching the cast away when dry. Weighing it down to be less foofy and lightweight, and holding my hair in a more consistent curl pattern rather than letting it fall to barely wavy in most spots. \n\nShould I try a denman brush? A less moisturizing shampoo and conditioner? It’s like I feel like if I dyed my hair a shade lighter and damaged it all a little then it would hold shape and product better. But I’m not interested in dyeing my hair. Does that mean I’ve moved into low porosity? \n\nMy hair previously had been at its best when short, less weight of hair made better curls. But this time it is just not doing that and I can’t understand why. These other times I’ve had my hair short I had been dyeing it lighter? I live in Colorado where it is pretty dry, but I’ve had this short curly cut here before and it was fine. \n\nAny product or technique suggestions? Is it crazy to think about purposefully damaging my hair so that it styles better? Is there a way to do that without actually changing the color? I’ve got a nice blend of grays mixed in at this point that I really like and don’t want to cover up. \n\nDo I go lighter on conditioner and heavier on gel products? Any advice or insight appreciated. \n",

I think it just didn't target the right concern.\n\naquaphor lip repair stick &amp; sunscreen: didn't help, had that weird sunscreen texture, but at least my lips were protected from the sun? will probably use in the future for sun care.\n\nvaseline original: second best thing I've tried, idk what it is about it but it doesn't go *all* the way I feel. like right when I feel like the scab is \"sinking\" back into my skin, it stops working. also got it in a big tub, maybe I was using too much at once?\n\nvaseline cocao butter 💗: this has helped the most. lips actually used to be a lot worse, but this has definitely helped. got the mini version so I keep it in my pocket and reapply it throughout the day. \n\nthe creme shop overnight glaze lip masque: bought it because it had kuromi on it lol. product was kind of hard and struggled to get it out to put on my lips -- not totally surprised since I got it from TJ Max, it smelled good at least?\n\nmy skincare routine doesn't really include lip care, other than applying the cocoa butter vaseline. also any changed in skincare haven't affected my lips since they've been the same since before I even started skincare.",

      "title": "Hair Transplant Truths – Choosing the Right Clinic: How to Avoid Hair Mills (Part 2)",
      "content": "# Let’s keep talking about the real side of this industry. Not the ads or influencer faces, but what actually happens behind the scenes.\n\nIf a clinic offers hair transplants while also promoting dental work, plastic surgery or other treatments, stay away. That usually means they see this as a business, not a medical field. Their goal isn’t to give you the best result, it’s to make as much money as possible. \n\nMany clinics later start offering extra procedures because they realize they can earn more from their existing patients. But that mindset is dangerous. If you really want good results, choose a clinic that only focuses on hair transplants. There are exceptions, but if you see a clinic offering teeth whitening or nose jobs next to hair transplants, it’s not a good sign. It doesn’t show how successful they are, it shows how desperate they are for more profit.\n\nDon’t take constant discounts or “book before this date” messages seriously. Why would a medical treatment have a seasonal sale? A small discount when you ask for it is fine, but if they offer it without you saying a word, that’s a red flag.\n\nAnd don’t get fooled by fancy words like IceGraft, Sapphire FUE or DHI. These are mostly marketing terms. In skilled hands, the difference between them is minimal.\n\nIf a clinic offers you both FUE and DHI and claims one is better, ask yourself why they are still offering the other. If one method is truly better, the logic just doesn’t add up.\n\nThese kinds of inconsistencies tell you everything you need to know. We’ll keep talking about the truths people rarely share. I don’t recommend any specific clinic, but if you have general questions about the process, I’m happy to help. Next part might surprise some of you...",

I wait about 30 minutes for my hair to dry a little and then start blow-drying with a diffuser.",
