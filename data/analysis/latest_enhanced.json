      "title": "Curly Cut - Why no product?",
      "content": "Hi, I am wondering why hair stylists who do dry curly cuts require you to come in with no product? My hair is completely different with and without product. Without product, it is a giant ball of frizz. There are no individual curls. With product, I have clearly defined curls. I have never gone outside of my house with no product on my hair and I'm scared to. I've had curly cuts before but I didn't know you weren't supposed to put in product. Now my stylist is telling me I have to come in without product and I would love to hear why, so that I feel reassured that it will come out well. I looked it up online and it said it's so they can see how each individual curls falls, but without product, I have no curls. Just frizz. I'm worried they will not cut my hair in the way I normally wear it.  Photo of how I usually style my hair. Thanks!\n\nRoutine:\n\nWash with Dove Intensive Shampoo\nCondition with John Frieda Ultra Volume\nIn shower, apply Not Your Mother's Curl Gel\nOutside shower, apply AG re:coil and scrunch\nChi Heat protecting spray \nDiffuse \nSleep with a silk bonnet, never towel dry, rather brush with a Denman\n\nAnd if anyone has further advice to get rid of the frizz, I'm all ears 😁 Thank you!",

      "content": "Hi! So, I (28 F) have always had curls, since I was a child. But I was raised by a straight-haired mother. So you can see where my problem stems from... I was never taught how to take proper care of my curly hair. I was taught to just wash it with a shampoo (not even a curly one) and then either dry it with a dryer or go to bed with it being wet, without untangling it, and dry brush it in the morning. (P.s. My mom had short hair.)\n\nI always thought I simply had weird hair but I'm starting to think it was just me taking very bad care of it. I didn't know it was frizzy because of incorrect routine, I just thought that it was naturally... bad. Or a victim of hair dyeing. (I haven't dyed my hair since I was a teen though.)\n\nOnly recently have I realized I need to brush my hair while it's wet.\n\nI went to a hairdresser yesterday and she cut my split ends and just dried it with diffuser and my curls looked much nicer. Sorry, I don't have any photos of that. But it made me realize that I can look much better... with proper care. However, I don't know anything about it.\n\nI researched a bit. I saw people mentioning irish curls and I thought that might be my hair type but I'm not sure. Can anyone point me in the right direction regarding my hair type? Also, what could be a good hair routine at night? Because when I take a shower in the evening and go to bed, I wake up with unruly hair and feel like I have to brush it out... obviously that doesn't really work with curls...\n\nP.S. The photos above are from not long ago, maybe a few months, but nothing has really changed in the meantime.\n\nP.P.S. My current routine is: I go to bed with wet hair (don't have a hair dryer though I just ordered one with a diffuser) and brush it in the morning. It's been helping a bit but obviously it's not enough.\n\nI currently just use shampoo - \"curl me up\" (Jean&amp;Len). No conditioner or anything extra. I live in Slovenia so I don't really have access to USamerican brands.\n\nThank you!",

For almost my whole childhood, my parents treated my hair as straight hair (brushing it through etc etc) and i always thought i just had frizzy hair but only like this year have i realized that OH! my hair is wavy/curly.  \nMy brothers hair is like really curly too but it's short so he's useless for advice.\n\nOn a good day (days i shower) the curls are pretty prominent, however my hair is still really frizzy after it dries. But then when i sleep it becomes a tanged mess ofcourse and is untamable. I use the TRESemmé bouncy curls shampoo and Coditioner (i dont really have the option of looking for something better because we dont really have the money to finance it).\n\nmy hair also really dry i believe so i need tips on how to hydrate it?  \nI have a really busy routine so it's really hard to even shower for a long time.\n\nI dont really know what to do to maintain these curls. On days that i havent showered they are a wild jungle of a mess and i get frustrated and brush them through which looks like really ugly.\n\ni think it's a combination of dry hair and my lack of knowledge because despite so many things online i cant really understand.\n\ni believe my hair is 2C to 3A ish. Honestly, theyve got a mind of their own.\n\nHow can I hydrate them so theyre not frizzy? (other than oiling) and what type of routine do i need for improvement? is there something i can make at home? what is a curl cream and do i really need those fancy products?  \nAlso how do i keep my hair from not descending into a tangled mess overnight?\n\nAlso im looking for haircut options for me. my hair comes to like just above my mid back. Would layers be good to lessen the volume?",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m about to start using minoxidil to help regrow some hair around my hairline. While researching it, I’ve repeatedly come across the point that—like many medications—minoxidil must be used continuously to maintain any results. If you stop, the regrown hair is usually lost.\n\nWhat I’ve been wondering, and what I’d really appreciate insight on from someone more experienced, is this: with newer and potentially more advanced hair-loss treatments on the horizon (such as PP405 and other emerging therapies showing promising results), is it likely that people would still need to use minoxidil to maintain the hair they’ve gained? Even if these newer “miracle” treatments become publicly available, would minoxidil still be necessary for retention of the hair that was grown using it?\n\nGiven how many new treatments seem to be on the horizon, I’m also questioning whether it’s worth starting minoxidil at all right now, if hairloss is not super aggressive and fast.\n\nAny insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, and happy holidays!\n",

It subsided for a few months. Meanwhile as per doctors suggestion, i did some hormonal tests and Ultrasound for Pcod. Had some hike in prolactin reading but she dismissed it as a reason.\n\nAgain in this July, i came back from a trip and then something triggered these acne. It was in forehead initially. Went to dermatologist, underwent carbon peel laser and switched to bdiff and perlite recover serum. But it has weirdly started appearing all over my system cheek and even in chin. Sometimes the ones near my sideburn(cheek near ear) itches too.\n\nSwitched to a different dermatologist, she recommended doing hormonal test once again.  Consulted gynac with the old results she said it was fine but recommended to do test if kunsure, on second day of my periods. Awaiting that. These are the pics of how my skin turned horrible from just bad.\n\nDesperately need suggestions , please.\n",

However, over the past 3 months, I started getting horrible acne on the chin, jaw line and cheeks area; after a visit to the doctor, they prescribed me Epiduo (1mg/g + 25mg/g). I have been using it for around a week now.\n\nMy issue is, I think my face cleanser and moisturisers are not the best for when pairing with Epiduo. I tend to have oily skin most of the year, expect winter months that my skin is more to the 'normal' because of the cold temperatures. (It is around 0-5 °C where I live)\n\nMy current face wash is: Bioderma Sébium Gel Moussant\n\nMy current face moisturiser is: Neutrogena Hydro Boost Aqua Gel\n\nAny recommendations for alternative moisturiser and cleanser?",

The other days I feel it looks too chaotic and this makes me insecure about it. I know it’s not ugly, but a lot of days it doesn’t feel pretty enough to wear down either if that makes sense.\nThe last picture is all the products I use.

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

On alternate days (4-5 times total), swap for Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Serum instead (still apply niacinamide at night). Sunscreen when I go out.\n* PM: Minimalist 10% Niacinamide Serum all over face.\n\n**Recent Changes:** Attended a 2-day wedding, ate way more sugar than usual (sweets, desserts). Could that be the trigger? Or the serums/purging? Pics are current breakout only.\n\n**Goals:** Fix this, fade scars/spots, prevent more. Budget-friendly India recs welcome.
