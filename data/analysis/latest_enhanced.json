If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

A ponytail would maybe have the circumference of a US quarter? In the summer, I clipped all of it down to 1/4 in and have just let it do its own thing since. Not sure if I need a trip to a salon to tidy up my cut for the best outcome. I tend to just use some cheap VO5 shampoo and conditioner about 2/3 times a week. Showers happen daily, but I don't clean my hair every time. For drying, I use a normal towel and let it air out, then brush and comb afterwards. Thank you in advance for any tips!",

I do use colour care shampoo and conditioner by pureology - is this a good brand to use??\n\nI do love the salon I go to but since going brunette I’ve had to get the colour redone every 2months otherwise it goes a very light cool toned brown which doesn’t look terrible but just isn’t what I wanted. And every time I go it costs 120£ or more.\n\nIs there anything I can do at home to make my colour last longer? Maybe switching shampoos or some kind of treatment or gloss? I’ve even considered dying my own hair at home but I know how bad box dye is meant to be for your hair? Or should I just switch to a salon that does permanent dye so I just have to get my roots retouched?\n\nFor context about my hair history - I’ve been getting blonde balayage for years, when I went brunette in september my hairdresser did a precolour and then a solid dark brunette colour and since then i’ve had my hair redone that same solid dark brunette colour two or three times and as I said earlier it seems to get lighter every time I wash it which is no more than twice a week, sometimes only once a week now because I’m trying to maintain the dark colour.\n\nI’m open to any advice.

If I stop using my Epiduo for more than two days I get lots of whiteheads and my skin gets so much worse, as with the contraceptive pill although that may just be hormonal. but the point is, I know that my skin is definitely better off with them. And I have been taking them very consistently, there have only been a few rare occasions where I have forgotten but overall I have been incredibly consistent. \n\nHowever I still have spots, just not whiteheads. I have lots of red spots over my cheeks and I find that without Epiduo and the pill, they turn into whiteheads, and Epiduo works very well to remove the whiteheads once I start using it again, but it seems to have no impact on getting rid of my red spots. These aren’t scars as they appear spontaneously on the regular, more of them also pop up if I stop using Epiduo, I don’t pick my skin and I had the same ones on my forehead and chin but those went away quickly. Is there any reason for this or anything I can do to get rid of those? I wouldn’t want to add another active ingredient to my skin as Epiduo is harsh itself at times and so I don’t think that would be a good idea, but I also don’t want to stop the Epiduo in case the whiteheads come back.\n\nmy skincare routine: in the evening I wash my face with Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and then apply Epiduo, and in the morning I just rinse my face with water and apply Cetaphil moisturizing lotion.",
