      "content": "Actually, I often see people struggling with skincare and asking for help, so I thought why not share what worked for me based on my own experience and experiments? It might help someone.\n\nI attached a picture for reference as the final result, which is as accurate as possible. \n\nA few months ago, I started taking my health seriously. I began going to the gym and improved my diet. Skincare wasn’t even on my list, but as I focused on nutrition and fitness, my skin started improving automatically. Later, I wondered how much more I could improve it if I paid attention.\nPhysical activity helped a lot. I go to the gym, but you can do anything  running, sports, or any exercise that makes you sweat and pushes you a little. It contributes more to your skin than people think.\nI don’t go outside much, but for those who do, use sunscreen. Sun damage is real  I’ve seen it on my own skin. Prevention is always easier than fixing it later.\nI had blackheads near my nose and occasional pimples. During my research, I learned that excess oil can cause many skin problems. At that time, I was drinking over 500 ml of milk daily, so I reduced my fat intake. My thinking was simple  if I consume less excess fat, my body may produce less oil. It actually worked. Now I take about 300 ml of milk (mostly in tea) and roughly 35–40 grams of fat in total. Don’t reduce fat completely ,it’s essential just avoid excess.\nI also noticed that whenever I ate outside food frequently, I got pimples. So now I mostly eat clean home food and keep outside meals limited. Balance is important  you don’t have to eliminate it completely.\nI sleep around 7–8 hours, follow a high-protein diet with normal meals, and since I don’t eat many leafy vegetables or salads, I take a multivitamin to cover any gaps.\nMy theory was that the body can heal itself if you provide the right things and in my case, that turned out to be true.\nSo instead of spending too much money on skincare products to fix problems, try fixing the root cause first. Reduce excess fat, stay physically active, eat mostly clean food, sleep properly, and use sunscreen\n\n\n",

      "content": "Actually, I often see people struggling with skincare and asking for help, so I thought why not share what worked for me based on my own experience and experiments? It might help someone.\n\nI attached a picture for reference as the final result, which is as accurate as possible. \n\nA few months ago, I started taking my health seriously. I began going to the gym and improved my diet. Skincare wasn’t even on my list, but as I focused on nutrition and fitness, my skin started improving automatically. Later, I wondered how much more I could improve it if I paid attention.\nPhysical activity helped a lot. I go to the gym, but you can do anything  running, sports, or any exercise that makes you sweat and pushes you a little. It contributes more to your skin than people think.\nI don’t go outside much, but for those who do, use sunscreen. Sun damage is real  I’ve seen it on my own skin. Prevention is always easier than fixing it later.\nI had blackheads near my nose and occasional pimples. During my research, I learned that excess oil can cause many skin problems. At that time, I was drinking over 500 ml of milk daily, so I reduced my fat intake. My thinking was simple  if I consume less excess fat, my body may produce less oil. It actually worked. Now I take about 300 ml of milk (mostly in tea) and roughly 35–40 grams of fat in total. Don’t reduce fat completely ,it’s essential just avoid excess.\nI also noticed that whenever I ate outside food frequently, I got pimples. So now I mostly eat clean home food and keep outside meals limited. Balance is important  you don’t have to eliminate it completely.\nI sleep around 7–8 hours, follow a high-protein diet with normal meals, and since I don’t eat many leafy vegetables or salads, I take a multivitamin to cover any gaps.\nMy theory was that the body can heal itself if you provide the right things and in my case, that turned out to be true.\nSo instead of spending too much money on skincare products to fix problems, try fixing the root cause first. Reduce excess fat, stay physically active, eat mostly clean food, sleep properly, and use sunscreen\n\nI hope from this info someone would get benefitted ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Was it really this simple?!” But now unfortunately it feels like a mild sunburn on my skin.\n\nI mentioned this in my last post that I had only been using adapalene twice a week and benzoyl peroxide for spot treatment, and then using other actives the other nights, and I was told “adapalene and benzoyl peroxide are well researched at being effective for skin turnover and ridding bacteria if you use it daily” and that it wouldn’t be effective the way I was using it. But my concern was that my skin is very sensitive, so I kind of feared this very thing.\n\nWill my skin just adapt to using adapalene every day if I just keep using it?

I cannot tolerate niacinamide at all, and since I'm fairly dehydrated my skin doesn't love hyaluronic acid. I am using azelaic acid and I use tretinoin a couple of times of week. \nI used to use mad hippie vitamin c but since I'm getting older, my skin is dryer and I found it drying me out. I don't have much pigment issues (thanks to the azelaic acid) so I'm looking for anti-aging/collagen support. So I haven't used vitamin c in about a year. Can you recommend anything you love? \n\nI was looking at the following:\nPaula's choice c15\nVanicream vitamin c \nCerave skin renewing vitamin c serum \nTimeless 10\n\n\n",

      "content": "So \\~8 weeks ago I started tretinoin .002%, Niacinamide 4% and Azelaic Acid 5% in a compound formula.  Some parts of my skin. probably 2/3 of it... is beautiful, but the lower 1/3, around my mouth... not so much. Breaking out/purging there, and congestion. Small closed comedones and healing post acne marks. \n\nI know purging can last up to 12 weeks, which it has slowed but its still there a bit... Im not too worried about that since I also know this chin/jawline acne clears last and might just be hormonal. \n\nAnyway, not the point, I want some suggestions on products I should use in my routine. I really want to get rid of this chin congestion, and keep acne at bay. I also like being glowy... I have combination dry skin. Its also sensitive. Here is what I do now, and the products I have...  \n\n\n**AM:**\n\nRinse or Cleanse with Vanicream Cleanser\n\nClindamycin 1% (Prescribed by Derm) \n\nPurito Wonder Releaf Centella Unscented Serum but going to replace with... Allies of skin beta glucan &amp; resveratrol advanced hydrating serum (Just dont have this yet, its coming this week)\n\nPurito Wonder Releaf Centella Cream Unscented\n\nBeauty of Joseon Sunscreen\n\n\n\n**PM:**\n\nMicellar Water to take off Makeup\n\nCleanse with Vanicream Cleanser\n\nRed Light LED Mask\n\nhers tretinoin .002%, Niacinamide 4% and Azelaic Acid 5% (every other night)\n\nAestura Atobarrier365 Cream (Love it!!)\n\nOn recovery nights I just dont use the hers.   \n\n\nBut I also own and have swapped in and out sometimes:\n\n**Toners:**\n\nIsntree Yamroot Vegan Milk Toner\n\nRhode Glazing Milk\n\nNumbuzin No. 9 Toner\n\nVT Cosmetics PDRN Essence\n\nDr. Althea's Marine Jelly Mist\n\n**Serums:**\n\nPurito Wonder Releaf Centella Unscented Serum\n\nI feel I am happy with my cleanser and my PM moisturizer... but I am worried I am missing hydration? But sometimes if I add too much hydration I think the congestion is worse? But the rest of my face gets nice and glowy. I also feel like if I am not careful my routine is going to start spiraling out of control.  Previously, when my skin was at its best... I didn't do crap with it. I slapped a curology formula of 5% Azelaic Acid, 4% Niacinamide and .25% zinc pyrithone on it at night after using some micellar water to cleanse... I came off that last summer thinking I could just do skincare on my own, and it was fine for awhile.... but then end of October/November hit and now its been horrible every since. T\\_\\_T. \n\nWould love some suggestions!",

I'm also trying to work a sunscreen into my routine, but my face seems weirdly sensitive to sunscreen and gets red and itchy when I apply it, so until I find a suitable one I've just been wearing a hat 😅\n\nI'm still very new to anything skincare and honestly don't know what I'm doing (information overload sometimes!!) but am looking forward to learning more.

I also find that I have both very dry and oily hair at the same time (?). I get dandruff flakes often and it starts to look greasy on day two. \n\nI’m looking for any advice from anyone with similar hair types on what they have done to make it look more defined and to last longer. I’ve tried so many different products but I find they make my hair look stiff and greasy. I normally just towel dry by crunching and diffuse my hair and leave it at that. I’ve also tried different haircuts/hair styles but I haven’t really liked any of them and found that none of them suit my hair type, so if anyone has suggestions on good hairstyles too please let me know.

I’m not sure if it’s ring work but I panicked and used raw African soap on my face, scalp, and body. After that, I applied 1% clotrimazole cream to my face and neck from the pharmacy.\n\nI’m unsure whether I should continue using my usual topical tretinoin or my Aestura moisturizer, especially since my skin is very dry right now.\n\nI’m feeling really scared and would appreciate guidance on what I can safely do in the meantime while I wait to see a doctor. I’ve already contacted my dermatologist and am hoping to get an appointment soon. I’m mainly looking for advice on how to manage this gently for now.\n\nThe only recent change in my routine is a new job that requires taking two different trains. One of them goes through central Philly and often gets crowded, with people standing very close. Sometimes I go to the gym before work. I always wear a mask, so I’m confused about what may have triggered this.\n\nI’m considering wearing more face coverage when I’m out and would appreciate any advice on how to handle this calmly until I’m seen!",

I have straight hair and so does everyone in my family, so this is completely new territory for me. I’m white and my husband is Puerto Rican, so the curls definitely come from his side. I’m only mentioning that because I’ve read that curl type can matter for figuring out the right routine and I’m still learning how to identify hers. All the women in his family straighten their hair so they can’t really help me with a routine or figuring out her curl pattern.\n\nRight now I’m using the Shea Moisture Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, plus the Pipette Detangling Spray when necessary. After her bath, I towel‑dry her hair and go in with a wide‑tooth comb. On bath days her curls look gorgeous and defined. But sometimes by the next day the curls lose definition or everything turns into a tangly mess. Sometimes it’s just from sleeping, and other times it looks tangly and dry because she is teething right now and keeps yanking on her hair as a soothing mechanism.\n\nDo I need to be using some kind of moisturizer between washes? And if so how do I actually apply it?\n\nAlso is there a YouTube channel or blog that breaks this down step by step for someone who genuinely has no clue about curly hair care?\n\nAny tips, guidance, or things I should know would be super appreciated. \n\nThank you for reading this!
