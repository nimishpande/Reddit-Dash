      "content": "no sugarcoating this but I’ve always struggled with underarm odour.  Winter, summer, monsoon, AC room it doesn’t matter. My underarms just refused to behave and it honestly made me feel humiliated especially when wearing sleeveless.  \n  \nI’ve tried several underarm products before, mostly budget friendly ones, but nothing really worked long term. So in that trial phase, I decided to give the be bodywise underarm roll on a chance too. It’s been few weeks now, and honestly, it’s been pretty good to me. It keeps things fresh for a long time, doesn’t sting (only purpose for me particularly) additionally doesn’t feel sticky either. I wouldn’t call it magic but compared to what I was dealing with earlier it’s been a noticeable improvement.  \n  \nAs it’s been only few weeks-  i wanted to know if anybody honestly has been using it for long term and seen good results ?",

La Roche-Posay Cicablast Baume B5+**\n\n**10/10 HG**\n\nI’ve been getting this product (incidentally, through a friend of my husband’s) for over a year now because I have very dry eczema prone skin. And I love this shit. my biggest gripe is that i run out of it so soon. It’s a thick THICK occlusive cream which I apply as the last step in my PM routine and wake up with “healthy” feeling skin.\n\n**2. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume**\n\n**8/10 Will always RP**\n\nThis one feels a lot more hydrating than LRP if that makes sense? So typically I use this in the mornings when I am not layering too many products and I need the same moisturiser to hydrate and seal\n\n**3. Skin1004 Centella Light Cleansing Oil**\n\n**8/10 Will always RP**\n\nSo I use this because my absolute holy grail Softymo Speedy is very hard to source in India. This one is lightweight though and smells really really good \n\n**4. numbuzin no. 2 protein creamy serum**\n\n**9/10 WRP**\n\nI am fairly new to this. But the texture of this has to be the best I have ever used and I have used a ton of milky toners. It’s actually thicker than milky toners/ usual serums, almost a body lotion texture if you will.  Thats why I love it so much for my DRY dry skin\n\nI am just not very sure if I absolutely need this in my routine given that I already use so many other barrier repair products all the time. But most likely will repurchase just to have it handy for extra dry days. \n\n**5. Skin1004 Centella Sunstick**\n\n**9/10 Will always RP**\n\nHeadsup: I don’t use it over makeup. I just reapply through the day when i am not wearing makeup using this because it feels like nothing on your skin. not sticky not heavy. Love it for that reason \n\nCiao✨",

Most recently are the Nivea day cream (not moisturising, at all.), cetaphil rich night cream (I would believe you if you told me I had rubbed chilli oil on my face), no.7 radiance vitamin 2 moisturiser - best in terms of hydration but still made my skin burn a little and isn’t all that moisturising and the simple hydrating light moisturiser (works pretty well but not really enough moisture for me). Originally, I thought it might be a damaged skin barrier but after reducing my routine to three products (the other two are holy grails) I’m lost on what to do with my moisturiser. I have really dry skin in my t-zone to the point of my skin peeling and cracking so I absolutely need a moisturiser but I’m scared to waste anymore money on moisturisers that are simply going to burn and irritate me.\n\nI’m fairly certain I have combination skin and my other two products are the Thayers milky toner and the cetaphil daily facial cleanser. I used to use the simple soothing toner however I’ve cut it out since I’ve had all these moisturiser based issues.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Dermatica then moved me on to Tret, initially at 0.015, but I am now on a compounded formula of Tret 0.025% / Azelaic Acid 15% / Tranexamic Acid 5%. I have minimal peeling sometimes on my chin but otherwise my skin is pretty happy and I can see some improvements already in terms of less breakouts and smoothness. The one problem I am still having is that I am still suffering from some redness and occasional flushing and I wondered if anyone might have any suggestions? I did mention it to Dermatica and they suggested buffering but having done this in the past, I find it actually makes things worse. I am using it nightly and my routine is as follows:\n\nPM - wash face The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser ( I have double cleansed in the past but found it irritated my rosacea). Wait for skin to dry completely before applying Tret formula (pea size). Wait 5 mins for it to absorb before applying light layer of Geek &amp; Gorgeous Hydration Station.\n\nAM - splash face with water (I was washing my face with Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser in the morning but have found it's generally happier with I just use water). Then I apply Aestura 365 Lotion to damp skin (I usually spritz Avene Thermal Water). Wait for that to absorb before applying Bondi Sands Hydra Face Fluid SPF50. I then spritz again with Avene Thermal Water before applying make up (Bellapierre mineral powder).\n\nI have been wondering if the SPF I am using is a little harsh but I keep going back to it as I know it doesn't break me out as I am prone to spots!

      "title": "Since a lot of people asked in my last posts, I made a rough guide/tutorial (In Post Body)",
      "content": "Before I get in to the actual details I think a lot of it is just genetics. I got blessed with good hair color, and my hair is naturally thick and doesn't break easily. A lot of my routine is based around minimizing frizz because my hair will naturally form curls very easily. The first two pictures I attached to the post were Day 3 morning hair so you can see some frizz showing up. The last one is after being out working in humidity for that full day.\n\n\n\n# Basic Care\n\nThe one thing I think I have done for my hair that's been super beneficial is that I have never used heat products. If you straighten/curl your hair on certain occasions you're probably fine honestly, I choose not to just to play it safe.\n\nBesides that you probably already know most of the things. A silk bonnet or a silk pillow case is always a good idea, not dunking your hair in buckets of dirt and grease (or just using too much product) will also definitely help. Keep it tied back during physical activity in order to prevent knots and frizz.\n\n\n\n# Wash Routine\n\nA lot of my routine is based off of the Curly Girl Method (CGM). While CGM does take it a bit far in my opinion a lot of my routine is taken from it. If you are interested you can find a lot of guides on reddit, but be careful as it can cause product build up.\n\nWhat I have found works best for me is-\n\n1. Get hair DRENCHED as much as possible\n2. Detangling with a curl defining hair brush (skip this if you have fine hair or hair that easily tangles)\n3. Shampoo (2x a week, or if hair is greasy/dirty)\n4. Rinse thoroughly\n5. A LOT of conditioner, brush through with curl defining brush.\n6. Let conditioner sit for \\~3 minutes\n7. Rinse thoroughly \n8. While hair is still dripping wet use product, comb through or just scrunch in depending on product (skip if you feel like you are starting to get product buildup or if its just not needed)\n9. Scrunch extra water out with hands\n\nAfter that my hair is still \"wet\" by most standards but I normally go to sleep since I shower right before bed. There is probably a hundred reasons not to do that but when I wake up its always tangle free and I just need to scrunch/shake it out which is really nice in the mornings. I use a silk pillow case so I just \"whip\" my hair on to it before I sleep.\n\nThis is what I have found works for me, if you know something doesn't work for you personally just swap it out or skip it.\n\n# Products\n\nI say this with complete sincerity there is one product I would literally go to war for. [Lush Super Milk](https://www.lush.com/us/en_us/p/super-milk-conditioning-spray/100ml) is my absolute saving grace. I never skip using this, it prevents frizz and smells amazing. The only other product I use is [Function of Beauty Curl Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Function-Beauty-Curl-Cream-Curly/dp/B0CT2FY1S5), it helps to revive my hair but I don't use it every time.\n\nFor shampoo and conditioner I honestly use anything that says curly on it. However what I normally use when I can get my hands on it is the [Aussie Miracle Curls](https://www.amazon.com/Aussie-Miracle-Curls-Collection-Conditioner/dp/B0886XTJDN) line (the link has the full set but I recommend just getting the shampoo/conditioner).\n\n# Closing\n\nLike I said this is definitely not perfect for everyone but I find it works nicely for me. If anyone has any advice for me I would love to hear it. Improving a routine never hurts :)",

      "content": "So last summer, I was really liking how my curls were coming out most wash days. Felt like they were lasting long and curling up nicely. But I felt like I just didn't quite have the frizz control I wanted, so I went on a quest for a new routine. I'm pretty sure it gave me moisture overload because everything started looking stretched out and flimsy.\n\nSo I swapped back to my old routine from the summer, hoping to get back to where I was and go from there.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n1st cleanse: Panteen Sheer Volume (clarifying days only, maybe every 4-5 washes); Shea Moisture Apple Cider Vinegar (every wash that isn't clarifying)\n\n2nd cleanse: Maui Moistuire Light Curls + flaxseed (only step that's different from summer routine, before it was Maui Moisture Light Hydration in the pink bottle)\n\nConditioner: V &amp; Co. Wave Babe (formerly Wavy, Wavy, Wavy)\n\nLeave-in: Curlsmith Hydrate &amp; Plump\n\nGel: Tre Lux Hi Definition gel\n\nStyling: Rake leave-in through with fingers, lightly brush style upside down (typically the Bounce curl brush), glaze gel over sections, scrunch, plop for 20 minutes, diffuse\n\nI know curl type doesn't matter but to give people an idea of what I'm seeing, I am usually seeing 3A curls with a few very intense 2Cs thrown in. Now it's almost all 2C with some 2B. I'm genuinely confused. I've clarified a couple times since going back to the old routine, so I would think any old products would be long gone and no longer influencing the weight of my curls. \n\nI know a lot of people are talking about the \"finish\" of your hair being important but... I genuinely thought mine was coarse, but every coarse product killed my curls so I'm guessing I'm a soft finish. I think the Tre Luxe gel is considered good for \"coarse\" but it was working great in the summer apart from frizz control. \n\nMy best guesses right now are either the Maui formulation (contains aloe) is just a bad match or I don't have enough protein?? But both rinse out conditioner and gel have protein and were working well together before. Any suggestions are appreciated!",
