It’s nice to be able to do different styles with long hair, but I also was tired of wearing it up all the time. Like I’m realizing I have hardly ANY photos of my longer hair dow because it was always pissing me off lol. The short hair is more effortless for me and it’s kinda nice not having the option to worry about different styles. I also love being able to see my earrings. Just of it is, I need unbiased opinions. I can’t decide if I actually want long hair or if I’m just bored and always want to change things up, or if I’m just feeling insecure because who doesn’t these days. And I’m aware that it will be a pain in the ass to grow out and all that jazz.

      "content": "I have been working with a dermatologist a little over a year now for my acne using both topical and oral medication. I have had quite a few pimple pops that were quite impressionable, but nothing like this.\n\nI’ve had a pimple for around 2 weeks, but as time went on it turned more into a hard lump on my cheek, the skin slowly started healing so it wasn’t “red” like a normal pimple. If I pressed on it there was no pain, maybe some tenderness. Today I popped it, using two knuckles I squeezed the skin around it and a very large mass came out.\n\nIt was not painful, but I could feel it coming out. It is very large and very white. I tried to smear it and it was solid like, but soft. I continued to pop afterwards and the more traditional “puss” and of course blood came out. Any idea what kind of pimple this was, and what came out? (Yes I had a whole photoshoot for it. I needed to document it lol)",

It went from very easily defined and highly dense curls to the suggestion of a curl ish wave and shedding more than it ever had in my life. I had lost a substantial amount of weight but in a very healthy way and had overall objectively increased healthy behaviors as well, and the only times my hair had straightened out or shed was when I was very sick with a restrictive eating disorder so I was very confused. Well, found out recently that my birth control was actually totally screwing with my estrogen levels and had caused two large lesions on my liver, essentially taking up half the thing. And when the bloodwork marker that led us to this began to creep up higher and higher? That’s when my hair started changing. I’ve always known my hair was very sensitive to my health, but for some reason this didn’t occur to me this time. So this is your friendly reminder that if your hair suddenly and drastically changes in any way, talk to a doctor! Get some blood and hormone panels done!!\n\nRoutine (currently, R)\nAveeno thickening shampoo \nSkala maracuja 2 in 1 \nSkala as styler or Innersense products ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

But in truth, it only seems to get bigger, not longer. \nSo what cut would you advice for me to get so, as it grows out, it can slowly turn into a mixture between both the examples in the second image? I want it to have shape, but very discreetly. So, in an elongated almong type of shape with long layers.\n\nWhat would you guys reccomend?\n\nMy routine:\n\n1. Shampoo scalp and ocassionally bring the lather down the rest of my hair and/or shampoo twice.\n2. Carol's daughter conditioner and detangle with one of those separate bristle brushes.\n3. Rosemary mint oil leave-in conditioner I found at burlington that is my best friend on my ends. Sometimes use rosemary oil on my scalp to stimulate growth.\n4. I use skala on the rest of my hair as a curl cream (I was unaware the leave-in was a leave-in, so it was unintentional but it works so hey)\n5. Use bounce curl brush dupe and divide my hair lazily and brush style.\n6. Either Aunt Jackie's or Camille rose gels and squish it in (Yes, squish, not scrunch. I gently pull the hair down for less shrinkage.)\n7. Air dry.\n",

At night I use la roche-posay cicaplast Baume.

I've been avoiding dying it as I've had bad experiences in the past and also I like my natural colour! But I am a bit sick of all the greys and want to look into ways to cover it up a little. I don't mind a few greys here and there at all. My concern is - any time I've had my hair dyed before the hairdressers have just done an all-over copper type colour which seems to be the closest they think they can get to my hair colour (which isn't like my hair colour at all!) and it doesn't look great. I have quite a lot of different tones in my hair and I like it to look multidimensional. \n\nCan anyone recommend what might be useful to think about or ask for (or even look up for inspiration) at the hairdressers? Ideally I'd like to remain a redhead but I don't want flat one-colour hair. I don't mind it being a little blonder or darker if necessary but ideally I want to stay within my colour especially as I really enjoy wearing all the autumnal coloured clothes that tend to suit my colouring!! \n\n  \nIs what I am looking for possible or should I resign myself to going grey?!!

I use the trader joes honey moisturizer whenever my skin gets dry, and the ordinary caffeine for my under eyes on days when I don't get enough sleep. My skin is really good in terms of being clear, but I have really hollow undereyes, and the lines that go from ur nose down to ur cheek and I want to add something that can help with anti aging, and also reducing the hollowness of my undereyes that won't disturb my skin and cause breakouts. I basically want something that will allow me to keep my low effort skin routine going would this be possible? Any suggestions are welcome.",

My right cheek has some unevenness and craters in my skin and I don’t know how to get rid of that. I don’t have active pimples there at the moment but it still doesn’t look clear at all. I know it’s not a crazy issue but I have a good skincare routine so I don’t think that’s the issue. Maybe I’m missing something? I typically do an oil cleanser, a regular cleanser, hydrating toner, and then facial moisturizer (don’t want to do too much). Also my skin looks redder in the pictures because I had just waxed my face. Anyway, I’d appreciate any help you could provide :) Thanks!\n",

I’d squish to condish with a cup of water in my hands\n4. Rinse the conditioner of my hair in cold water\n5. Still dripping wet I’d apply Curlsmith Hold Me Softly Style Balm (add a bit of water into the balm before applying with praying hands)\n6.

Then I add flaxseed gel (it doesn’t have a brand it does have vegetable glycerin and emulsifiers), again I’d mix some water with the flaxseed gel before applying on my hair\n8. Using a clean cotton tee I’d scrunch up my hair to remove excess water\n9. Let it sit for 30 minutes air drying.

I've an oily face and my hair gets ugly quickly which means my hairstyle is always a sleek pony tail or braid.\n\nI also exercise everyday and can't have hair all over my face, best I can do is have those strands of hair in my face like Lara croft and that looks good temporarily before it gets oiled up. \n\n(For my face I use CeraVe blemish cleanser which removes the excess oil for a few hours before it comes back)(That was prescribed by my dermatologist)\n\n\nWhen it comes to getting a haircut it gets more nightmarish...\nI need textured styling with waves and soft framing layers but my hair is STRAIGHT and I've tried everything to make it wavy and nothing works for too long. (I don't even want to talk about hairspray...)\nOnly braiding my hair works to create waves for one two hours or before I bathe or brush my hair.\n\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\n✓ I've a square face = I need hair in my face to create a face framing effect and avoid geometric sharp symmetry \n X I've a greasy face and that means: \nNo bangs no fringe no face framing no nothing \n\n✓ I need textured styling, layers, wavy hair \n X I've a REALLY stubborn straight hair \n\n! Avoid using ponytails and sleek hairstyles \n X That's the only thing I can use when I exercise and helps with the oily face issue plus I've too much hair and it's hot here\n\nCONCLUSION \n\nSquare face + Straight hair + oily face + oily hair        \nIs downright an EVIL combination even more with a hot weather.\n\nI've been dealing with this my whole life and the solutions have been short lasting ones...I would really really appreciate if someone could help me with advices a about a haircut and hairstyle that could work please ♥️\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "\nHi everyone. TIA for the advice sorry for the long post. \n\nMy 4 year old daughter has beautiful curls but I can’t seem to tackle a few issues. Her hair in the AM is always a mess -  frizzy, knotty, and looks dry. \n\n1- in the morning her hair is always frizzy, if I wet it to try to comb it out with detangler spray… it’s brutal. \n\n2- I was washing her hair once a week, then upped it to every two days, no real improvement. Her bed time routine is at night and she usually goes to bed with wet (ish) hair. \n\n3- When I wash her hair - I shampoo it (wash it out), condition it spray with detangler and tie it up. Before I wash it out I brush the conditioner through (it’s like an Olympic event) then I wash it out. \n\n4- After I lightly towel dry it (and by this point she’s Defcon-5) then spray with frizzease and put her to bed. Tonight I did the same but used cantu curl cream for the first time.  \n\n5- I usually brush it one more time before putting her to bed. \n\nAs a dad I have no idea how to care of long curly hair lol.  I have tried quite a few shampoo and conditioners and the one that seems to soften it the best is (Bellisso Curly Hair Shampoo and conditioner). I’ve tried the Frizzease spray, a few different detangler sprays, and multiple curl creams. There are other times, when I use the blow dryer head-puff-thing (it fills up with air attached to the blow dryer with a hose. It looks like a giant pillow and her hair goes in it) her hair comes out amazing… for a few hours, she’ll still wake up the next day with wild hair. ",
