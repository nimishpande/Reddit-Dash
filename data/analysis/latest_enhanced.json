Using a Bounce Curl brush, I detangle each section and then apply my products in this order: leave-in, mousse, and gel. After that, I brush through again to distribute the products evenly and lock in definition.\n\nFor drying, I diffuse upside down on high heat, focusing first on my roots until they’re dry. Then I switch to low heat, flipping my head side to side to dry the ends and boost volume. Once it's totally dry I scrunch and usually separate some of the clumps.\n\nAs you can see, I’m a bit of an Original Moxie stan. It's expensive, but has been my holy grail!",

      "content": "Hi! I have what I think is 2c hair and it is pretty much completely healthy (i think). I do not put heat on it unless I go to the salon, and I do not dye my hair either. I had keratin, (around 5 treatments), but the last one was over 4 years ago. I did end up letting my hair grow out for about 2 years and cut off all the dead ends (it was a LOT of hair). Now, i think my hair is super healthy. I recently cut it about a week ago so it can fully grow long and soft. \nI guess my question is can anyone recommend a good shampoo and conditioner? \n\nmy main concerns are frizz and growth, and the only products I use after I wash my hair are the Mizani Leave In Conditioner and the Design Essentials Almond &amp; Avocado Curl Enhancing Mousse. I always brush my hair, use the leave in first and then I just hand scrunch my hair after applying the mousse and let it air dry. I feel like at times my hair after styling and air drying doesnt really have much bounce to it. It is kind of dull and my curls are severely lacking definition. Btw I also lose a decent amount of hair in the shower, and it’s long strands. is this normal? \n\nI used Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner for like 3 years. I used the pink bottle, the white bottle and the blue bottle. Since cutting my hair I went to the store to buy a new shampoo and tried the Redken AllSoft for Mega Curls, but it was way too much for my hair. Then I exchanged it for the Redken Extreme Shampoo (dark blue bottle) and I don’t know how to feel about it. I used each of those one time so far. Are they more for damaged hair? I also know they have protein in them and I’m not sure if healthy hair needs that? I have also noticed that my scalp smells bad the day after washing. Does that mean I need a clarifying shampoo? and if so, are there any ones that are non drying? \n \nHonestly if someone wants to recommend me a complete hair routine I would be so appreciative. Above I have attached photos of my hair \n(explanation for each photo below)\n\n1- first wash after my most recent hair cut (november 2025) (mousse and leave in used) \n2- after first wash of hair cut before the most recent one (early september 2025)(first time using mousse and leave in mentioned) \n3&amp;4- before first hair cut in 2 1/2 years (march 2025) \n5- result of first wash after that first hair cut (march 2025) (no product)\n\nMy main questions are: \n1. is it normal to be losing long strands of hair in the shower \n2. please recommend me shampoo conditioner as well as any styling products, brushes etc. \n3. how do I prevent frizz \n4. how can I get my hair to look its absolute best \n5. how can i get it to grow strong and healthy?

It’s always been frizzy and messy looking :( \n\nHere’s my current routine: \n\n1: DesignMe shampoo + conditioner (always double shampoo) and use a hydrating mask at least every other week. \n\n2: after shower I put leave-in conditioner + heat protectant spray. Then use cake curl mousse. Then put in Ouia curl cream followed by eco style coconut gel. Then I use keratase oil. \n\n3: I wash my hair 2-3 times a week and oil my ends every night. I use a silk pillowcase. I also use k18 bonding treatment every 2 weeks since I  get high lifts done on my roots every 6 weeks (no bleach). I live in an EXTREMELY dry and cold climate (northern Canada). I haven’t had a hair cut in a few months because I’m not sure the best cut to get for my curls and what kind of cut is easy to style. I live in an isolated area there are no curl specialists I can go to for help. ",

Similar to Ilana Glazer’s hair. But no matter what I’ve tried it hasn’t worked. Not hair clips while drying, not curly cuts, and not any any products. What should I do?\n\nAnd the picture isn’t the best representation of my hair. This was just one of the only pictures I had with my hair styled in any way. Usually, my hair is much more curly than this. It’s more like tight-ish spirals with some sharpie-width ringlets floating around. \n\nMy routine:  \n\nMiss Jessie’s leave-in condish followed by Curlsmith Miracle Shield heat protectant and Dippity Doo gel. Then I separate my hair into small sections and use a Denman brush before scrunching and diffusing. Then I sleep in a silk bonnet on top of a silk pillowcase. \nJ\nWash days are twice a week. Prescription shampoo and a regular conditioner the first day, deep conditioner the second. I wear a heat cap over my hair on deep condition days. \n\nTo refresh, a clothing steamer for the majority of the hair, a mist sprayer for the flyaways. ",

I work at a tire shop where theres constantly dirt, dust, occasional clouds of rust, that kinda shit. when I get home,I use wet wipes /baby wipes to wipe my face clean and it takes like 6 or 7 to clean my face (or i guess not “clean” but I just go until the wipes stop leaving dark brown/ black marks on em) + a bunch more for my neck / behind ears.\n\nI ALSO noticed that when I pick my nose after work the boogers are literally pitch black. Since im clearly getting a bunch of shit in my nose too I started using the same kind of wet wipes as I used on my face to wrap my finger and put it up my nose to get the dirt out. It’s worked pretty well and a lot of dirt has come off with these\n\nIs this fine to keep doing or is it gonna mess up my nose somehow?

Last two pics are from first two weeks of October when my skin was generally clear (the marks you see are scarring). I want to know what people think about my routine/lifestyle/generally what I should do. I’m going to put my routine down here, along w some factors\n\nAM: Sometimes I use a Panoxyl 10% benzoyl peroxide wash Cerave oily skin moisturizing cream gel (has Niacinamide) SPF la roche posey, cream for oily skin\n\nPM: 100 mg spironolactone (I’ve been on this since August but only been taking 100mg for a week, before that it was 50mg for like a month, and 25mg for the whole month of August) Cerave cleanser (this one’s for dry skin) Adapdalene gel w clindamicina (differin?) Isispharma unitone4 white (from my derm to help w my old scars) Cerave moisturizing cream gel again\n\nSkin was basically clear for September and very clear the first two weeks in October I thought the spiro was working. Then around the 10th of October I had a series of very stressful events, moved back from Vancouver (I was there for a month) to Bogota where there’s hard water, took a one month break from adapdalene gel and starting again (am I purging?), and used a sauna with sunscreen on a few times. I eat very well but also have dessert maybe once every two weeks… i do eat dairy but mostly Greek yogurt. I am starting to feel paranoid lol like what if my apartment is breaking me out? Any thoughts or advice? Should I wait a bit longer w the Spiro?",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

I have no clue??) but can’t for the life of me get it to stay looking good and keep the curls defined for more than a day. My hair is very fine and pretty flat and there’s not that much of it, I’ve always thought it was straight because when I was young it was and even now if I brush it when it’s wet and let it air dry it will dry straight or with the the very very slightest wave but get a bit wavier if it’s rained on etc and I don’t brush it while wet. in the first and second pic I washed it with colour wow shampoo and used a conditioning toning mousse for my colour so didn’t use conditioner (most conditioners are way too heavy for my hair and leave it looking limp and greasy anyways) and then used my sisters curl products (clever curl wonderfoam and gel) and scrunched them into my hair upside down and let it air dry\nI really liked how it looked once I scrunched the cast out and put a little dry shampoo in for volume but the next day most of the curls lose definition- I don’t have any good pics of it really but the third photo kind of shows how the waves/curls don’t stay defined. The last pic is what it looks like when it’s a bit longer but that was over a year ago and I don’t remember the details, although routine would’ve been similar. Is there any really lightweight but strong hold products I could try or shampoos/conditioners that would help but are also very light weight (especially the conditioner) and are colour safe?? Maybe my hair is straight and I’m just forcing it to have some texture by using curl products?? Honestly I’m so lost please help",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",

I wash my hair twice a week and struggling a bit with day two an three after diffusing - it tends to go back to the flatter waves and all the nice diffuser effects are lost. What can I do to keep it fresh on day two and three?\n\nCurrent routine - curlsmith volumising shampoo and conditioner (with a clarifying shampoo once every few washes), curlsmith oil in cream after each wash, and jvn oil on my fringe (I have a micro fringe which I like to keep straight and sleek). I'm not a fan of gels and happy with my product routine - the diffuser is very new to me so just want to make sure I'm using it right! \n\nThanks :)",
