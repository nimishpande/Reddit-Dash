      "title": "Before &amp; After Cutting Length and Dyeing My Hair",
      "content": "Hi! I’m sharing my current curly hair routine and would love any feedback.\n\nHair &amp; Background:\n\nI have medium-density curly hair. I recently cut my hair from mid-back length to a medium length (just above the trapezius/collarbone area) and also had it professionally dyed. I don’t chemically straighten my hair.\n\nWash Schedule:\n\nI wash my hair every 2–3 days. Between washes, I thoroughly rinse my hair with water only.\n\nCleanse:\n\nOn wash days, I start by rinsing my hair thoroughly with water. I then use VIONA 2% ketoconazole shampoo, applying it mainly to my scalp, letting it sit briefly, and rinsing thoroughly. About once a month, I use AG Care Balance &amp; Boost Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo instead.\n\nCondition &amp; Treatments:\n\nAfter shampooing, I condition with SheaMoisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Shine Conditioner, applying it to mid-lengths and ends and rinsing it out fully. Every 1–2 weeks, I use AG Care Nourish Snow Mushroom Moisture Mask in place of regular conditioner, leaving it on for a few minutes before rinsing. About once a month, I also use AG Care Balance &amp; Boost Apple Cider Vinegar Conditioner.\n\nLeave-In &amp; Styling:\n\nImmediately after turning off the shower, while my hair is still very damp, I apply my leave-in and styling products. First, I use AG Care Fast Food Leave-On Conditioner (about a half baby-carrot sized amount), scrunching it into my hair and up toward the roots. Then I apply AG Care Re:coil Curl Activator, using about 1–2 pea-sized amounts, and scrunch again.\n\nDrying:\n\nI diffuse my hair, spending time diffusing all the way down to the scalp to maximize curl definition and spring.\n\nSleep Routine:\n\nI sleep on a silk pillowcase. I used to sleep with a silk bonnet, but found it compressed my curls too much overnight. Since my hair is shorter now, the pillowcase alone has been working better for preserving curl shape.\n\nNotes:\n\nSince cutting my hair shorter, my curls feel noticeably bouncier, springier, and more alive. My hair is much easier to manage and control at this length, and my curl pattern really shows up better overall. I’m really happy with how light and healthy it feels now.\n\nOpen to any routine feedback or styling suggestions. Thanks!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi! I am very new to my natural hair, but have high hopes😊 I have been endlessly researching what routine to use for my hair, but there’s so much information online it’s a little overwhelming, and I would love tips if from seeing my hair and hearing my routine, you see even a couple initial glaring issues.\n\nI have course, middle-eastern, 2C hair, but it’s thinned a lot. My scalp gets oily fast though my hair itself is always super dry. My hair takes a minute to get fully wet, and a good amount of time to dry fully (maybe medium porosity?)\n\nI just cut like 11” off my hair as a refresh. In the pictures I show for context what my curls looks like now, what they looked like long, and what they looked like long with no product at all.\n\nMy current routine is using the Odele ultra sensitive shampoo and conditioner, squeezing out excess water with my hands, adding a generous amount of Trader Joe’s leave-in conditioner, a smaller amount of their hair oil, a good amount of “Miss Jessie’s Multi Cultural Curls” cream, another quarter size amount of her “Jelly Soft Curls” gel, spray my whole head with Pantene non-aerosol hairspray (level 4), cover my hair in Tresemme heat protectant spray, and then scrunch my hair upside down like crazy. The only combing I do is when I run my fingers through my hair to evenly distribute the products.\n\nI let it air dry and continue to scrunch, then when it’s almost dry I will diffuse for a second, then take off the diffuser attachment and scrunch my hair as I lightly dry it. I’ll scrunch in a little more oil to help frizz. I go to bed with a satin bonnet. Second day curls require me to re-wet and diffuse again for a second.\n\nI’ve never used a curling brush and I’ve never used a deep conditioner - from reading it sounds like something to maybe look into. I would so appreciate any advice, product suggestions, or tough love😅 you might have from seeing my hair and hearing my routine. Even haircut tweaks would be appreciated! Thank you so much in advance!",

My scalp is normal to dry and my hair has always been pretty frizzy/feels dry (could be because I have very coarse hair or because of hard water or improper care). I don't have an issue with volume but I usually just end up looking like a used cotton swab (fluffy, coarse, and frizzy lol). I wash my hair every two to three days with shampoo but sometimes (in between shampoos) I will wet my hair in the shower to comb conditioner through it and then rinse it out.\n\nI am hoping for some shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner, and any other recommended products (like curl cream or styling products). Any help would be amazing!\n\n  \n\\- I’m reposting this because I got 600 views the first time but not a single comment :( -",

Ewan q but i never had this problem before. it can't be seen clearly in the photo but when i do my routine, this is what i see. my skin became more reddish, pinkish and all my breakouts are always in  that area, even if i clean my face a lot. a friend of mine whom I always see alot, i think she has the same case. ( I'm not sure tho) her skin was pretty clear before but when she turned older like 18, it started for the side of her cheeks too. it's reddish, always breaking out in the area, and usually it's hard to get rid of the pimples. i fear I'm also having the same case that's why i think it's hormonal acne... I also switched my cleanser from the garnier anti-acne to the celeteque, and  stopped using actives that much(i used to alternatively put them, like monday niacinamide, Tuesday vit c, etc.) but now i just use cleanser,moistur and honestly sometimes spot treat my pimples every few days. i want to know how to prevent this from worsening and how to fix this?? also I don't know what it's called . thanks! forgot to mention they're ITCHY ITCHY",

I have significantly frizzy and poofy roots no matter how much water and product i put in my hair. sometimes i feel as if i have naturally frizzy hair lol.\n\nfor more context, ive been constantly going through hair transition phases due to heat or chemical damage. this time im serious about not using any heat tools (except diffuser). i recently got a hair cut to remove a lot of the damage. and now im 6 months  in with the new hair growth. so when i say i have frizzy roots, im talking about the new healthy growth. in fact, the damage parts look great. its as if i have 2 different porosities. my ends take a bit longer to dry and absorb the product really well and get wet pretty quickly. while my roots literally get wet and dry in the same second, are ALWAYS frizzy no matter how wet they are, and a proper curl pattern just never forms. \n\nmy routine lately: i shampoo twice with the live clean clarifying shampoo. I apply k18 in sections and let it sit for a few minutes. then i rewet my hair and use the tresemme botanique conditioner and detangle in sections. then i use the shea moisture manuka honey intensive hydration mask. then i detangle again (i have significantly dry hair that gets tangled pretty easily). after fully rinsing, i apply a bit of leave in conditioner The Hair Addict (egyptian brand), then i hop out of the shower and prep the styling routine. of course by then my roots are already dry and frizzy without a pattern.\n\ni get my spray bottle and fill it with water and some curl cream The Hair Addict (egyptian brand; doing this helps form curls). i section my hair into small pieces and rewet it. then i detangle again. then i apply gel everywhere root to end (also The Hair Addict). Then I use the denman brush to style. and repeat. Note: sometimes i see people applying leave in/cream then brush styling then scrunching in the gel, i have to say that scrunching makes my hair significantly more frizzy.\n\nthen i diffuse, break the cast with the Locken serum (egyptian brand). and when i sleep i use a scarf and bonnet.",

      "title": "[Acne] Accutane?",
      "content": "I've been struggling with hormonal acne for about 5 years now and I have had some good periods and some way worse than in the photos. Growing up I never really had any acne until my second year of college. I started taking birth control my freshman year, then sophomore year I went to a dermatologist and she changed the kind I was on. That, along with prescribing spironolactone and tretinoin put my acne at bay for a while. I stopped taking birth control and about a year later is when my acne returned. I have tried antibiotics, spironolactone, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, tretinoin, cutting out dairy, pretty much everything. I currently live in Spain but I am from the US, so when I went to the dermatologist they prescribed me a clindamycin and tretinoin combined topical cream/gel thing called Treclinac. I have been using that since November trying every other night, but admittedly I have had to take some breaks because it was burning the skin on my eyes. Now, I have found a routine to not burn my skin lol and am applying every night. My current morning routine is the inkey list salicylic acid cleanser, a hypochlorous acid spray, vanicream sensitive skin facial moisturizer and innisfree daily UV defense sunscreen. Night routine is the prequel oil cleanser followed by the la roche posay toleriane dermocleanser, then I use the same morning moisturizer, and treclinac on top. I try to limit my non-fat milk/dairy consumption and drink either whole milk or almond/oat. I notice bigger breakouts when I am less strict on trying to eat whole foods, but now I am noticing more breakouts and texture on my forehead, which is luckily something that has never happened before... it just feels like my last solution is to go on accutane, but I am worried for my mental health, as I have heard so many people in my life tell me they became extremely depressed. I did have a dermatologist once reccomend it to me, but he was not a doctor I trusted and made me feel very rushed into it.. I also really do not want to be on birth control but at this point I am just about willing to do anything to solve what is going on with my skin. I am just looking for any advice or insight anyone might have..... TIA!!!\n\nThe first 3 photos are current and the last 2 are from October, right before I started with treclinac again.",
