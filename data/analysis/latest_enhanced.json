      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Now I love my hair and I'm trying my best to take care of it but I can't tell what type it is or if there's something wrong with my technique or products. I have to restyle it every morning and I'm not sure how to style it so it's soft instead of in a rigid middle part. \n\nSo my routine is this so far. I start by shampooing my hair thrice, once with a gentle wash, then with a curly hair shampoo then with a two in one shampoo and conditioner. I then use coconut conditioner, brush, ten minutes and wash. After that I apply Aunt Jackie's Leave in, brush and separate into the top part of my hair and the bottom. Apply mark anthony curl cream and Aunt Jackies mousse to the bottom and curl with a curl brush. Do the same to the top. I'm not sure how to use gel without it creating wet frizz so I don't use it anymore. Scrunch with a silk cloth and let it air dry. That's it! I'd love any advice!",

Unfortunately I’ve heard back and the pharmacist has said:\n\nIn line with guidance in the British National Formulary, we do not prescribe topical retinoids for women who are not using effective contraception (e.g. contraceptive pill, implant or injection).\n\nThis seems quite extreme in my opinion! For context I have been on contraception before but have had bad first-hand experiences with it and decided I wouldn’t be using it from then on.\n\nHas anyone else been in the same boat here and if so, what did you do?\n\nI’m wondering whether to push back as I don’t plan on ever having children (have been talking about getting my tubes tied but they won’t let me because I’m too “young” lol).

The clinic said since it was my first treatment they would start at a low level and healing would be quicker and only take 3 days.\n\nThe first few days healing felt normal I had the feeling of sunburn and scabbing but nothing concerning. Now I’m on day 10, I feel like I’ve healed and have no pain or scabs, but I’ve still got the bumps from the laser all over my cheeks and forehead.\n\nToday is the first day after treatment that I’ve worn makeup and the bumps are even more noticeable.\n\nIs this normal? I’ve emailed the clinic but they haven’t replied yet and I’m worried that this is going to be permanent.\n\nIf anyone has any experience with this happening before I would love to hear from you, and also if you have any recommendations for what I should do.\n\nWeirdly, despite getting the laser on my whole face it’s only really on my cheeks and forehead that there are these bumps.\n\nThanks so much in advance",

Overall I have plenty of closed comedones that are visible when I stretch my skin near my chin/cheeks, and a rough looking forehead even though it's relatively smooth to the touch.\n\nI'm feeling a bit out of my depth here, I struggled with quite severe acne when I was 17, two years ago at this time, and adapalene/benzoyl peroxide fixed me up. For a few months. My barrier was certainly never perfect but moving to a different climate this year and starting university had some effect on my skin, and it's not happy anymore. I don't use any actives right now, I'm focusing on gently healing my skin barrier, although I'm not entirely sure how. \n\nI currently do use makeup wipes and rinse with water at night and would like to stop doing that in favor of a cleansing balm and water cleanser combo. I don't know. I use a mild cerave pm moisturizer morning and night. \n\nTL;DR my skin barrier is damaged and I'd like some recommendations if you have any.",
