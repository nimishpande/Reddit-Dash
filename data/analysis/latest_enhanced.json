Because it looks so slick, but when I try to heat style the front of my hair, I have to do the whole lenght or otherwise it looks bad.\nI have less hair than her but the same type. What most bothers me is that in the front i have baby hairs and making my hair fall more into my forehead seems impossible. :/ I tried with a straightener, small curlers, big curlers...\n\nAny tips? Thank you!",

I have a constant itch in the balding areas but my derm has confirmed that there is no inflammation, no dermatitis, no dandruff, etc.  My derm has suggested that my genetics are simply pulling me down the baldness path and that he can't help any further (I'm also using keto shampoo, laser cap).  Other than increased estradial, my bloodwork is all good.  I've been considering a topical adunct treatment such as Pyrilutamide or Alfatradiol but I'm not sure why one might work better than another.  When I research both products, both seem to offer a different type of assistance.  For an itch and constant miniaturization, why would one work better than the other?

It's a rather strong one I would assume, as it's a 10:9:1(%), PHA:AHA:BHA mixture. After my shower I applied a thin *film* once my face had dried, washed it off after 10 minutes, and proceeded to put moisturizer on. My questions are:\n\n1. How many times a week should I use this mixture? After using it today, I felt a bit *hot* (idk how to describe it) like 30 minutes afterwards on the areas where it was applied. Now and a few hours later I still feel a slight tingle on my face as if I have a very light sunburn, but no redness. \n\n2. I live in Sweden, so currently the sun goes up at around 7:30, and goes down at 16:00, with an average UV-index of 1. In other words, I do not see the sun, so do I still need sunscreen? \n\n",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

But than I started to get acne. These past 2-3 months it has gotten out of control. My cheeks and jaw has so many acne, like soooo many. They hurt too. I can't tell you how sad I am. I''m 27 years old and my face is full of acne.\n\nI'm using very good cleaners for acne prone skin, I use azeleic asid and everything but nothing helped so far. Than I saw that many woman have this problem after birth control.\n\nRecently I started taking zinc, omega 3, magnessium. I cut dairy products, I only drink vegan milk. I clean my face and make sure to hydrate. So far nothing helped. This made me so insecure about myself.\n\nAny recommendations?",

      "content": "I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I can’t think of a better place. But how do I get a shower routine that I actually enjoy? I love feeling and smelling good, and having a good routine. I used to really enjoy showering and taking baths before my chronic illness got worse. I have very low energy and being autistic makes the sensory aspect of showering worse. As of right now I’m also 2 weeks post op for a hysterectomy and that has been so wild.\n\nAt some point showering just became a matter of how fast I can get in and out while still getting myself clean. I don’t want to be that way anymore. I want things to be more intentional with bathing and not cry every time I’m in the shower because I’m cold then wet, hot and then wet, cold and wet again, cold and dry, etc etc. It’s so distressing and I feel icky. I want to invest more time into a nice routine. Maybe not pull out all the bells and whistles right away. But right now all I do is use shampoo for everything, then lotion, and deodorant.\n\nI have a few skincare products I use after showering but it’s just a serum and moisturizer. I have more skincare products (double cleanser, essence, toner) I just find it hard to do the whole thing and be excited about it- or at the very least not dreading it.\n\nI see all this stuff in the shower aisle and get overwhelmed, but it’s intriguing at the same time. I wanna be one of those girls who always smells so good and has soft skin and nice hair.\n\nPlease help me put together a list of a few products to get soon, and how to do everything properly. I feel really pathetic right now. Here’s some things I know I like about products (that’s such weird phrasing my brain is mush. I hope I’m making sense)\nI like things that have a good lather but leave my skin not too dry\nI like lotion (love it) but not stuff that leaves me feeling too greasy. Light body oils are okay too.\nI like sweet smells, more berry and floral than vanilla though. \nI prefer exfoliating without a body scrub. I hate the gritty feeling.\n\nI should also add I’m a huuuuuge perfume girly. My favorites are YSL Flowers &amp; Flames and Marc Jacobs Perfect Absolute. I just tend to only wear it when I go out because it’s expensive. But I’m also not going anywhere lately lol. Maybe time to invest in some body mists to do after everything else? \n\nI’m sorry again for the weird request. Thank you, and I hope you all are having a good day :)\n\n",

(I’m open to any non-comedogenic suggestions!!) And, random question, if I spray SPF45 Sunbum on (heavily and rub it in!) then slap on a hat and sunglasses - is that enough protection for an hour walk outside or do I need more?\n\nBut now comes the retinol. I wanted to know what everyone’s first step was. I bought this CeraVe as I read somewhere it’s a good starter. Shall I start with that MWF and increase weekly if all is well, and then go onto something stronger? What’s a good next level retinol?\n\nThanks for reading if you’ve made it this far lol\n\nTLDR: Beginner to retinol, is this a good place to start?",

If a dermatologist saw my actions, they would probably see hell on earth. Everytime I had some sort of blurt in my face, I just plucked or scratched it off. Yes, I knew it was definitely a bad choice, but that was when I was very much still careless. Plus, my parents didn't know what to do with me, being a lazy teen.\n\nNow, I just woke up with a single huge pimple on my chin, and an army of dark, scab-like (?) results left from the acne/pimple where I used to scratch off my forehead. Although It isn't an award-worthy type of bad. I still think I need to make a move before it becomes worse.\n\nCan anybody please give me some advice? Like,  What type of routine should I stick with? What should I avoid doing? What type of skincare  products here in the Philippines are good and/or cheap? \n\n",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

Sometimes, I really don’t want to spend all that time diffusing and let my hair just dry on its own. \n\nI have SUPER thick hair. It was way curlier when I was a kid and got wavy (and now almost straight when air-drying) as an adult. Do I really just have much straighter hair now and the diffuser is creating an illusion of waves/curls? Or could I get a similar look with different products / methods. \n\nCurrent routine is put curl cream on when it’s soaking wet out of the shower (I use Garnier Fructis Curl Air Dry Cream, just combing it through with my fingers), scrunch in a gel (I usually use one either by Sebastian (the Texturizer Liquidgel) or the Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Gel), let it fully dry (I usually either micro-plop or plop in a microfiber towel or t-shirt) and then put a little serum on to control any frizz (I like the John Freida Frizz Ease Serum). Sometimes I swap out the gel for a mouse (got 2b Twisted by Schwarzkopf) but usually need a gel for more hold. \n\n",

I’m not 100% sure if it’s purely acne, post-inflammatory marks or maybe something like fungal acne in some spots.\n\nCan you please suggest:\n• Products available in India that helped your body/back acne\n• Any creams/tubes that actually worked for pigmentation / dark marks\n• Body washes or treatment lotions that made a visible difference\n\nI’m open to medicated products as well, just want to start with the right routine instead of randomly trying stuff.\n\nThanks in advance!\n",
