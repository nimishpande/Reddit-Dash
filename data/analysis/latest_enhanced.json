      "content": "Notes from a skin cosmetologist.\n\nIndian skin tans easily, marks easily, and holds onto pigmentation longer. Ik, it's a little sad. Mostly because our melanin response is very active (thanks to sun + heat + inflammation).\n\nIf you're dealing with tanning, dark spots, or acne marks, here are ingredients that actually work, and (istg this is more important) how they work:\n\n1. Mulberry Extract\nA gentle tyrosinase inhibitor. What this does is it slows the enzyme that makes excess pigment. Good for people who want brightening without irritation.\n\n2. Niacinamide\nDoesn’t lighten melanin!\nInstead, it reduces melanosome transfer, which means less pigment gets passed to the surface layers.\nAmazing for acne marks, PIH\n\n3. Alpha Arbutin\nA stable brightening ingredient that also inhibits tyrosinase, but gradually\nGreat for uneven tone without harshness.\n\n4. Licorice Extract\nContains glabridin + liquiritin. Magical as they are, both work as tyrosinase suppressors + anti-inflammatory... Licorice is giving 😌\nSo it treats dark spots and the inflammation causing them.\n\n5. Centella (Cica)\nMy favourite when it comes to formulating! Not a brightener by itself, but reduces inflammation + oxidative stress, which are major triggers for pigmentation.\n\nBiggest rule for pigmentation :\nREDUCE INFLAMMATION FIRST.\nBrightening only works when the skin is calm.\n\nHope this helps!",

      "content": "I see so much negativity about DUT. I had a hair transplant in 2019, and it fixed what I wanted it to at the time, but I was still diffusely thinned. I had never even heard about finasteride until the surgeon told me to get on it immediately, and ideally delay the surgery. I declined delaying it as I had travelled to Turkey. However, I got on it as soon as I got home. \n\nAfter going on fin for 3 to 4 months, I realised my hair was no longer brittle. My hair grew back nicely in the transplant area and all my hair felt less brittle. In 2023, I was happy and added oral minoxidil to the mix. I definitely felt some more thickness after the first shed, but not as much as I had hoped for.\n\nAbout 5 months ago, I added dutasteride to the mix three times a week, still taking the full dose of fin to try and avoid a shed. I am not quite sure why, but adding this has had an absolutely insane effect on my hair. I am in my 40s and have been thinning since I was 17. I would say my hair is now thicker than when I was 18. Loads of small hairs.\n\nAt the barbers today, I looked in the mirror and with my wet hair I could not see any scalp. I honestly cannot remember the last time I saw that. I have come home and shone my phone light on my scalp looking in the mirror and there are so many new short hairs with fresh regrowth. I was planning to ditch fin after six months, but I might just keep this stack now as it is working so well.\n\nI just wanted to give a perspective from someone who has taken fin and min for a long time, and the thing that worked the most in the mix several years later has been Dutasteride.\n",

However, around twice a year, I get the same 1.5 pimples on the SAME EXACT spot on my forehead, which then goes away after 1-2 weeks. I think it’s a pustule.\n\nIt’s so consistent that I have a single acne scar there that can never fully go away because the pimple keeps showing up when the scar should start to fade many months later. This is also how I can tell the pimple always grows on that EXACT same spot.\n\nWhy does this happen, and how can I prevent this other than general good skincare and cleansing?\n\nI would understand if I got occasionally got a pimple in different places, but this is just so consistently one spot?? How is this possible? I don’t think the answer is to just “cleanse better” since the rest of my skin doesn’t break out?\n\nPlease help, as this is driving me crazy!",

I just started using La Roche Posay Purifying Foaming Cleanser and I don’t know how I feel about it yet but it does make my skin feel clean\n\n\\-Oil cleanser when I wear makeup: softymo speedy cleansing oil or house of hur purifying cleansing balm (recently bought)\n\n\\-Moisturizer: soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream\n\n\\-Paula’s choice 2% BHA: typically 4-5 days a week. I had high hopes for this one but I feel like it hasn’t done much for me. Never really helps with my occasional acne. It does make me look shinier on the days I use it which I don’t hate \n\n\\-Used to use the ordinary Niacinamide serum which I liked. I will probably start using this again\n\n\\-Sunscreen: skin 1004 Hyalu-sica water fit sun serum\n\nI’m not sure if I’ve been doing something wrong, but exfoliants haven’t ever helped much with the appearance of my pores, even stronger exfoliants like the deep red aha/bha serum from the ordinary. Oil cleansing has helped me the most, but there is still a lot of room for improvement",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I’m addressing the source now, and it should be improving eventually, but I’m having a really hard time not hating my hair. I miss my old hair. It defined easily with minimal product and effort and pretty much always looked good. Now I put in 3x the effort for 1/3 of the results, and they’re inconsistent too. I don’t know how to have anything but resentment towards my hair for reflecting health issues that could’ve been caught earlier if healthcare professionals bothered to check anything. It’s also been falling out since February and isn’t stopping. I rarely like how my hair looks now, and I don’t know what to do about it. It is not a length thing, as my hair was starting to loosen up when it was still shorter too. I’ll list my routine, so really anything helps. Maybe from people who have my current hair type? I haven’t felt compelled to give up on caring for my hair in a long time, but this has definitely taken me there. \n\nHair type now: wavy, coarse, medium density \nHair type before: curly, coarse, high density \n\nCurrent routine: Innersense clarity hair bath and hydrating cream conditioner. Styler is usually 1 lightweight foam and 1 gel,  ex. the tgin miracle foam + innersense I create curl memory. Usually brush styled with a denman or bounce curl definition brush, scrunched, diffused.

      "content": "Hi there! Looking for help with my skincare routine. For reference, I am a 27 year old female. I struggled with acne growing up and continue to have imperfections years later. I have gotten more into skincare over the past 2 years but honestly idk what I’m doing/what I’m doing wrong. I struggle with dullness, uneven skin tone and texture (small bumps all over face), black heads on nose and chin, large pores, inflammation, 11 lines, and my biggest issue is deep creases under my eyes that go across my cheek and deep creases from my nose to the edges of my lips. So basically every issue. I also get occasional large zits (have multiple pimple patches as I type this). I feel like I look much older than I am and want my skin to be tight and glassy. I see my other friends have perfect looking skin and all they do is wash their face and moisturize but when I’ve tried that, I break out and look more dull. \n\nFor reference, I do live at the beach. I drink socially occasionally, never smoke, and drink a lot of water. I’m not interested in botox at the moment as I do like my natural expressions and don’t want those to change. Please see my routine below…\n\nMorning: \n- gua sha with Bio Oil \n- remove excess oil and wash face with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser \n- ice face \n- Naturium Vitamin C Serum \n- Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer\n- Elta MD Tinted Sunscreen\n- Tatcha Dewy Skin Mist \n\nNight: \n(My usual routine is below, but I rotate each day with one of these products: RoC Retinol cream, Paula’s Choice BHA Exfoliant, light slugging with Aquaphor, rest day, repeat) \n- remove makeup with Garnier Micellar Water\n- Nuface Microcurrent \n- CeraVe Foaming Oil Cleanser \n- Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser \n- CeraVe Hydrating Toner \n- Omnilux Red Light Therapy Mask \n- COSRX Snail Mucin\n- Ordinary Nicinamide \n- Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer\n- Frownies \n\nOpen to all suggestions and feedback but please be nice :) I’m wanting to learn! As you’ll see, I am committed and time is not an issue… but maybe I’m doing too much and ruining my skin in the process? Please let me know! \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Now im looking to upgrade and make life a little easier and less cluttered with a 5 in one. \n\nTypically I just do the front of my hair with a straightener so its more neat and tidy(wavy hair girl here) so im wondering if the 5 in one is worth it. I keep seeing mixed reviews about the shark flexfusion and need your advice! Is it worth it? Also saw a Babyliss 5 in one, but the reviews were low on that. Definitely dont want to break the bank with a dyson but could MAYBE be swayed since holiday deals are happening. So any input and recommendations you have im all ears!\n\nOh ya, I saw someone mentioned they wished they repurchased a Revlon blow dry brush instead of the shark, would love to hear more on that! \n\nLast tid bit, my blow dryer and curling wand are on their way out which is why I'm considering a 5 in one.\n\nThanks for the help!

Does this kind of weekly structure with separate retinol, peptide, and barrier‑support nights actually make sense for someone my age with dry skin, or is it overkill and risking my barrier?  \n\n2. What specific products would you recommend?\n\n3. How would you tweak this routine to keep the anti‑aging benefits while minimizing dryness or irritation (for example, changing retinol frequency, simplifying steps on active nights, or changing how I layer products)?  \n\n4. If you had dry skin and starting to see fine lines, what would your core night routine look like?\n\nI’d really appreciate product recs and any changes you’d make to the schedule ChatGPT gave me so it’s more realistic and skin‑barrier friendly.\n\nThanks a lot! 😊",

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "Struggling with body acne, im 21 currently and it’s been bothering me since multiple years. I thought it would go away as i got older but it never did and it kills all my self confidence. It’s there on my back (very severe), chest, shoulders and upper arms too.\n\nI tried multiple things last year, benzoyl peroxide spray + body wash and SA spray + body wash and nothing seems to work. Currently I’m just using a SA body wash but it doesn’t change a thing.\n\nChatGPT suggests me to use a Ketoconazole Shampoo like Nizoral on my body. I asked chatgpt if i should rather go with a Sulphur Soap bar as i saw many people recommending it but it said it’d be too drying and won’t be as effective as Nizoral.\n\nNeed desperate help and guidance 😭 Thank you :)",
