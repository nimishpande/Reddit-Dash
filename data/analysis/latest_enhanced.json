      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe‚Ñ¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Hello there!! I‚Äôm hoping to get maybe some tips or advice for the top of my hair because I‚Äôm kinda stuck. \n\nMy hair routine so in the shower includes: \n- Eufora urgent repair (a clarifying shampoo- product buildup loves me) \n-Eufora aloe therapy shampoo after that for moisture (I‚Äôm considering dropping these bc they‚Äôre expensive so if you have any store bought recommendations lmk)\n- if I wash my hair more than once a week, I use the L‚ÄôOr√©al Elvive Hyaluron+Pump - I bought this specifically bc I think I have low porosity hair? I get confused bc in the shower my hair gets wet right away but when I‚Äôm starting w dry hair &amp; spraying it with my continuous misting sprayer, I really have to spray a lot and do praying hands over my hair or else it just sits in beads on top of my hair.\n- Mielle Babassu &amp; Min Deep Conditioner OR \n- Not your mother‚Äôs Tahitian gardenia flower &amp; mango butter conditioner \nProducts out of the shower include: \n- Not your mother‚Äôs nourishing curl talk leave in (my hair loooooves this) \n- For gel, I‚Äôll use either Miss Jessie‚Äôs Jelly Soft Curls or just straight 100% natural aloe Vera gel (my hair likes the aloe better) \n- if I use a mousse, it‚Äôs going to be the Herbal Essences Curl Boosting Mousse in the purple bottle \n\nI get my hair trimmed every 8 weeks &amp; i get my roots touched up w/ a brown-copper every 16 weeks. I do sleep with a silk bonnet and if im wearing my hair up, it‚Äôs always with a banana clip or a claw clip. \n\nNow, my main problem is the top of my hair, from basically the tops of my ears and up. It‚Äôs super flat and just doesn‚Äôt want to curl. I used to get my hair bleached (highlights) so normally I‚Äôd say that was the issue but it‚Äôs been so long that I don‚Äôt have any left in my hair. The bottom of my hair is super curly. Everything above that, I basically have to force to somewhat curl with a comb (I‚Äôll brush it and twist it around the tail end of a rat tail comb like one would with a denman brush). A few months ago, I cut my hair up to my shoulders and got a lot of layers to see if that would help the top of my hair curl but alas, it did not. \n\nI‚Äôve attached photos just to show exactly what I‚Äôm talking about. The non-collage one best represents what my hair looks like after my full routine and you can see the top is just meh and ive sorta forced it to curl (btw im a natural sandy-blonde and when im outside a lot, the top of my hair gets a lot lighter - that‚Äôs why i stopped bleaching my hair). I understand that I could just have different curl types and it can truly be that drastic of a difference between the curl types on one person‚Äôs head, but the top front of my hair near my face just started to curl up right at the root (it‚Äôs never done this before- image of this also included) so I think there‚Äôs potential and I‚Äôm not sure what else I can do to bring those out. \n\nAny help or recommendations is greatly appreciated ü´∂üèº",

      "content": "# Dry/flaky/itchy/hot‚Ä¶ HELP\n\nHi all!\n\nI had pretty good skin since I got through puberty. Some breakouts due to PCOS, but generally well balanced, well behaved skin.\n\nThe day I turned 30 it all went sideways. That week I tried the Aztec clay mask my SIL loved, it was almost like my skin was burnt and has been dry and temperamental ever since. I‚Äôm now 36.\n\nI‚Äôve had eczema around my eyes over the last number of years; it flares up from time to time, I‚Äôve used RX steroids to keep it in check (a very tiny amount on occasion, not used in over a year now).\n\nWell, now my face is like a pendulum, it swings to dry, hot, flaky, itchy all over my face, viable red ‚Äúpatches‚Äù that are worse. And then it sort of settles out and is just clear, mostly fine skin. It could be smoother, it could be less red, but generally it‚Äôs fine in those periods.\n\nWhen the hot, itchy phase passes, it‚Äôs very very dry, very flaky. On the occasions I‚Äôve ‚Äúexfoliated‚Äù with a soft wash cloth to get the flakes off, the skin under is tender but very smooth and seems to absorb lotion better.\n\nWhether it‚Äôs angry or happy I tend to the same (boring, plain) products that doesn‚Äôt seem to make anything worse.\n\nLRP toleriane dermo cleanse \n\nTower 28 SOS lotion \n\nPaula‚Äôs Choice ceramide ‚Äúbooster‚Äù, on occasion \n\nAtobarrier 365 moisturizing cream mist, on occasion\n\nRarely I'll use Dermalogical Milkfoliant to get the flakes off when I just can't stand it anymore, it doesn't seem to cause a flare up of anything and does take the flakes down which is helpful\n\nIf I wear makeup (rare now that my skin is so temperamental) I use the Naturium balm cleanser to take it off and then go to the LRP.\n\nI‚Äôm lost. My skin is making me so uncomfortable and I feel like an ogre with these red angry patches day to day.\n\nI haven‚Äôt been able to track a food, environment, or product that seems to set the dryness off.\n\nI‚Äôve tried Clinique moisturesurge, I found it didn‚Äôt have enough oomph to make me feel hydrated.\n\nI‚Äôve tried cerave lotion and cream, it tended to sit on top of my skin and sort of feel greasy without sinking in.\n\nSnail mucin makes my skin itchy.\n\nLRP hylau b5 serum I found very fragranced so I cut that out a few years ago when I found my skin getting more sensitive.\n\nAnything with vitamin C seems to almost burn my skin.\n\nAll that to say, please help me.\n\nAny thoughts, suggestions, product recommendations are welcome and encouraged.",

Then I decided to just use a gentle cleanser and moisturizer that I am sure is not clogging my pores because it hasn't in last 3 months-i am still getting new pimples like this every day.They aren't painful they aren't itchy they are just red and persistent.\n\nI have a BHA exfoliator but I only used it once and was scared to continue as I felt it might irritate it more and cause more breakouts? I don't know what should I do and dermatologist never helped me,I went two times and both times she told me to use benzoyl peroxide 5% two times a day AS A CREAM ON MY WHOLE FACE. I didn't think much and did it and it burned me so bad i had to stop after a few days because my skin was horrible. I then picked some asian beauty products and my skin finally healed until september started.... \n\nIf anyone has any tips please reply!",

Currently I am at a bob length with a fringe (first pic) and I am doubting if I should fully grow it out once more. The last picture is from when I was 17 and my hair a lot thinner there due to trauma. I loved the pixie cut. It was so easy to style and I felt so feminine and sexy, but I has been at least 10 years since I have had really long hair. My hair is fine, but dense. It has difficulty holding onto volume. \n\nWhat hair cut would you advise if I go long again? And do you think long hair would suit me? ",
