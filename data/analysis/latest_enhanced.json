I need help because I’m trying to work with my natural curls more &amp; use less heat. \nWhen I let my hair air dry with no products in my hair curls in a more of a ringlet shape.

When I try to add a products to get more uniformity in the ringlets my curls just don’t look the same at all when they dry. It looks more like straight hair being forced to curl.\n\n I’ve experimented with different products &amp; application methods. Scrunching never looks good but I’ve also tried rubbing the product in with my palms, either way I just fully lose my ringlets. \n\nMy current routine;\nShower products: For shampoo I alternate between Aveeno Blackberry &amp; Quinoa Shampoo &amp; L'Oreal Paris EverPure Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo &amp; for conditioner sally’s brand deep conditioning keratin mask.  \n\nLeave in products currently (used in picture) : Creme of Nature Pure Honey Curl Activator &amp; Cantu Coconut Oil Shine &amp; Hold Mist\n\nI do like the way my hair curls naturally &amp; I’m just looking for a way for my ringlets to all be defined &amp; preferably the same size. \n\nThank you!!",

      "content": "First off, I know my hair is wavy not curly (please curl police spare me lol). But I can't even post on wavy hair subreddit cause they don't allow any mention of hair type or porosity or density etc. \n\nMy routine: Davines love curl shampoo and conditioner, Ouai leave in, curl products (NYM curl cream, Davines curl mousse, Kaleed (local brand) rice curl gel), scrunch, plop 30mins, diffuse until half dry, air dry. For context I live in high humidity tropical country, hard water, and low porosity hair with high density.\n\nI have tried every routine. I found that only using mousse still makes my hair frizzy (pic 3) and puffy when dry, with low definition on my waves. Mousse and gel gives some hold but never last overnight (pic 4), and I still get halo frizz. Cream and mousse and gel give me the best hold that last me 2 days (pic 5). However, my waves are much tighter when my hair is wet after plopping, and dries with much looser waves. I wonder if I force it to be tighter during products and scrunching? Is there such a thing? If not, any suggestion on how to keep the tight waves when dry? \n\nAlso if anyone has advice on lesser effort for wavy routine that keeps frizz at bay lol. I did wavy hair routine last year for about a month, then quit cause it was too much effort. Went back to only shampoo (not even conditioner), air dry, then claw clip or bun my hair almost all the time. When I need to style my hair, I either used curling iron, or heatless curl overnight that gives me neck pain in the morning. I just got back to do the routine last month and I'm close to quitting again 😭. My hair takes 4-5hrs to air dry completely without products, 6-8hrs to air dry with products on. Diffusing to half dry on low heat takes 1.5 hours, with luck (if it's sunny, 75% humidity), the rest will completely dry in 4hrs. If it's rainy (96% humidity), I'd actually sleep with half dry (scalp area dry) and hope for the best for the rest to dry overnight lol.",

She bathes more than that but just gets her hair wet, so we apply leave in conditioner after. We never brush her hair dry. In the mornings I use water and a little leave in conditioner to style her hair. She usually requests some sort of braid to keep it out of her face. If she wears in down like in the last picture I add a small amount of curl cream. First two pictures show her hair after she’s woken up without styling it. \n\nI’m worried there is product build up and that her hair is just in general too dry. It now feels straw like when I wash it. Is this normal? \n\nI’m thinking I need to use a clarifying shampoo but don’t want to make the dryness worse. \n\nAny recommendations for a clarifying shampoo, how often to use it, and what moisturizing products to use between washes? Bonus if it’s low on fragrance. I don’t love the smell of most strong fragrances. \n\nShould I be getting her a silk pillow case or having her sleep with her hair a certain way? \n\nWe love her curls and want to start from a young age teaching her the proper maintenance. I research online but get overwhelmed with all the different possibilities and would love some guidance on simple routines that have worked for others. ",

I was on adapalene and isotretinoin in 2020 and it cleared my skin but I shifted to Delhi in 2024 and it took a toll on my skin!😣\n\nI came in June and skin started getting worse! Went to a dermatologist in October but he kept on prescribing very expensive hyaluronic acid, vitamin c and niacinamide serums even when I told him I’m allergic to niacinamide😒\n\nSo finally in November my neighbour aunty told me to give raw aleovera a chance and started using it everyday at night after my skincare routine and cleared my skin😭😭😭\n\nMy cousin who is around 18 has acne since he was 14, just how my skin looks. Even he started aleovera and he’s happy with the results! (I will post his before and after in few months)\n\nWith aleovera I followed a simple skincare routine: \n\n1. Facewash : Simple Facewash (using it since 3 years now)\n2. Moisturiser: Formula rx hydra veil moisturiser (love of my life💝)\n3. Sunscreen : I was using reequil matte during the summer season and currently using minimalist fluid sunscreen 🧴 \n4. Bioderma Micellar water or Deconstruct cleansing balm for makeup removal 🎀\n\nI use to 10-15 step routine before this and I have over consuming way too much! \n\nHow I use the aleovera:\n\n1. Cut a piece from plant\n2. Clean it with water\n3. Keep it in water for 20 mins (it ensures all the yellow part is removed)\n4. Apply it after 1 Hour after doing my skincare routine which is just applying my moisturiser \n\nTo anyone who is going through acne just give aleovera a try! Please please please😭😭\n\n*Some people are allergic to aleovera too so do a patch test! ",

      "content": "I came off the pill in 2020 after being on it since 2016, and by August 2022, my skin developed painful, cystic acne. I was prescribed Duac (Clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide) , which worked great at first, but after about 13 months, I was told to stop by the GP. Since then, I’ve tried retinol, Epiduo (benzoyl peroxide and adapalene), Lymecycline, and Dermatica formulas ( Adapalene 0.1%, Niacinamide 4% , Clindamycin 1%) with mixed success, plus lifestyle changes like going gluten-free. My skin always clears up when I’m abroad, but it flares up within a week of being back in the UK. Epiduo eventually made my skin sore, so I stopped it and switched to a more soothing routine.\n\nSince mid-2023, I’ve been getting random episodes of redness, heat, and flushing, plus swelling and pressure under my jaw when I’m off treatment, like deep nodules forming under the skin. I’ve done multiple rounds of antibiotics but don’t want to rely on them anymore, and I’m hesitant to go straight onto Accutane.\n\nMy current routine is as followes: AM wash my face with just water form the tap and a wash cloth, I then I then spray my face with filter water which I follow up with hypochlorous acid spray, I imidiatly go in with Byoma's Barrier Repair Eye Cream under the eye, wait about 10 mintues and use Byoma Hydrating Milky Toner and Hydrating Serum to lock in moisture leave all to spoke in then I finish with The Inky List Dewy Sunscreen SPF 30.\n\nPM I use Elims Elemis Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm which I work into my skin for 5 mintues add water and emulsify for another mintue, I then use Byoma Creamy Jelly Cleanser which I rise off, I then spray my face with filter water, I dry my face with a clean paper towel and the use Byoma's Barrier Repair Eye Cream under the eye and layer over Some By Mi Retinol Intense Advanced Triple Action Eye Cream and add Cerave Healing Ointment to my lips and every second night I use The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% on the other nights I use Byoma Hydrating Milky Toner and Hydrating Serum. I leave the product on my skin for 10 mintues I then finish with Byoma Barrier+ Treatment moisturiser, this has been my routine for the past month.\n\nI’d really prefer to try spironolactone first, as it seems like it's hormonal. My skin right now is as bad as it was in 2022, but more swollen and unpredictable. I’ve got a dermatology appointment in December, but I’d love to hear from anyone who’s had similar symptoms or knows what this could point to, whether hormonal, immune-related, rosacea, environmental, or something else entirely.

Right now I don't have hard water after moving in August but before that I had like the hardest, grossest water you can imagine. Like chokes a brita in a month bad. Like drink it unfiltered and you get more thirsty bad. So I'm wondering if I would benefit from chelating my hair once or twice to make sure the buildup is gone? My hairs been crazy tempermental and I think this might have something to do with it. I've heard it can make hair seem like its low porosity when its really not but also all my hair is new as of the past year and a half so it doesn't have any heat damage or color treatments. Its very fine and coily and dense where its had the chance to fill in but thin on top since that is still working on growing in\n\n  \nRoutine as of now:\n\nInnersense Detox clarifying shampoo once every 2 weeks\n\nNot your Mothers curly hair shampoo\n\nOuidad Curl Quench conditioner\n\nInnersense I create Hold Gel for styling like maybe one pump at most\n\na little bit of jojoba oil on days after wash day \n\nI wash every 3 days or so and use a silk pillowcase and a bonnet but its just so frizzy no matter what I do and it seems like it hates too much product. I usually also diffuse a bit upside down then air dry and my hair on top of my head is way shorter than the sides since its got a lot of catching up to do since it suddenly started growing back in December. Trying to find a style that I can manage to do every morning but also compliments my face well. Thanks in advance for the help!",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "Hello everyone! As the title says i would love to get your thoughts on what foundation I should get from Sephora. (I don’t have sephora or anything high end where I live but im going to Greece next week, so I want to get one)..\n\nFor reference, for everyday use I use my Catrice True Skin Hydrating Foundation for everyday and it is one of my favorites and matches my skin tone perfectly (030 natural sand). I have some acne scars and sensitive acne prone skin, but mostly (knock on wood) it has gotten calmer and better over the past year or two, and now im working on resolving the last bit of acne left with my derm. That’s my little side rant sorry.\n\nBack to the point. For bigger events, last year i bought the Estée Lauder double wear foundation in 1W2 Sand. I love it. It is even more of a better match than the catrice one. However I find that it separates at the end of the night for me very often. Maybe because of my skin type. I have normal skin with it getting oily in my t zone sometimes. But mostly normal combo skin if that makes sense.\n\nSo I guess my question is. I want to get a foundation for big events that wouldn’t break me out (honestly i haven’t noticed any foundation breaking me out but i figured id mention that anyway), that is long wearing, not too heavy on the skin, but still gives full coverage and doesn’t separate or get cakey or patchy or separate on me over the night. I want to use it for special occasions like birthdays, weddings, work events etc because I love doing my own makeup. And I wouldn’t change my Estée Lauder if it didn’t separate on me but idk what to do. What do you guys recommend?\n\nI see very mixed reviews about the House labs foundation, and I have always wanted the one NARS foundation that the OG beauty gurus used back in the day.\n\nI would really appreciate if you would give me your holy grail full coverage, acne safe, beautiful and lasting foundation recommendations! Thank u so much in advance ❤️ I hope this wasn’t too long, sorry.. i only got one shot so i figured I would ask here",

      "content": "Recently purchased PURITO's Oat moisturizer and noticed a sweet smell. I know the company labeled it as fragrance free, and others have posted reporting chemically or faint oat scents. This has sparked my concern, and I worry it might be a fake... I agree it's slightly chemically, but no oat smell.\n\nHowever, I purchased it by going to the official PURITO site and following their own link to their official Amazon Storefront listing. It is listed as \"Ships from Amazon, Sold by PURITO KOREA\". Additionally, the box came with an authenticity sticker (see image 3) which I scanned and was taken to PURITO's official site where it verified the authenticity and said it had only been scanned that one time. There is also another sticker saying it was distributed by HINATURE Inc. if that helps.\n\nI felt like the QR sticker was enough to guarantee authenticity, but I'm still skeptical because of the scent. Do you notice a distinctly sweet scent? Is it possible that the label could've been fabricated somehow??\n\nAll advice and help is greatly appreciated.",

      "content": "My hair was cut way too short (instead of 4cm, over 20cm) 4 month ago. It is still something I am really upset about because I hate short hair on me. I normaly wore my hair very curly and scruntched before but I can not do it now because my hair would be then like chin length. Straightend it is nearly armpit length. It is not really curly. Like 2c/3a I think. But it is really puffy and springs up a lot because it is quiet thin.\n\nI would like to get more length by weighing down my hair more.\n\nMy Routine: Right now I wash it with an medical shampoo because of Seb Derm and the condition it with canto conditioner. After that I comb it and take a moisturising curl balm ( Wella Professionals Invigo Nutri Enrich), some Schwarzkopf Gliss Kur Elixier Oil, Lola From Rio Vintage Girls Creme Alisante and Taft x Gliss straightening cream. I then put it wet in a low bun.\n\nIt still gets puffy and I do not get any length. I feel so imensly ugly, like a clown or old woman, while being only 27. I loved my curly hair before but now I cry everytime I look in the mirror. I mean I can not wait like for 2 - 2 1/2 years until I look normal again.\n\nDo you have tips ?",
