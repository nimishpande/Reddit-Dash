It was very difficult to maintain it and had to learn how to take care of it. I'm planning to grow it out for another 1-2 years and see how it goes. \n\nRoutine: Normal Shampoo, Dove Conditioner/Mask, Leave-in Conditioner while damp, Coconut Oil also to keep the make the hair weigh down. Otherwise it would get frizzy and reach for the ceiling lol.",

I just don’t feel feminine anymore and have been feeling very insecure ever since. \n\nI’ve never had hair this short before and I genuinely don’t feel like myself anymore. I don’t feel feminine, I feel super insecure, and I’ve even been avoiding leaving the house because suddenly even my favourite clothes don’t look good on me anymore. It’s too short to put into a ponytail, too short to slick back, too short to clip up. I just feel kind of stuck and ugly, honestly.\n\nI know it sounds dramatic but I’m really struggling with it mentally more than I expected.\n\nSo I’m begging for any tips at all:\n\n• How do you style a bob so it looks cute and girly and not just… blah?\n\n• How do you make short hair feel more feminine / flattering?\n\n• What helped you emotionally when you cut your hair too short and regretted it?\n\n• Is there anything that actually helps it grow faster?\n\n• Also dumb question but… am I supposed to condition it still or just shampoo?? I have no idea what I’m doing with short hair …\n\nI’d seriously appreciate any advice. Please tell me I’m not alone in this.\n\nThank you!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Doesn’t help that I always feel like I’m rushing between home, public transport and work. \nMy makeup never lasts all day, my clothes look frumpy.. I don’t know what to do! \nI’ve stopped getting my nails done which may add to that feeling and will try to get them done regularly again. Do you have any other advice?

I tried Amika’s entire line (hydrating shampoo &amp; conditioner, curl cream, gel, mousse, &amp; once every 2 weeks did a clarifying shampoo), &amp; while it give some semblance of life, my curl pattern is just completely changed. \n\nI know it’s probably just how it is, but has anyone experienced this, &amp; done anything to improve/get back to their original curl pattern. I really miss my hair. \n\nI am not really looking for advice on products or  application. I know all the curly girl methods &amp; have tried them all to attempt to improve my curls, &amp; nothing has worked. I’m looking for any advice or hopeful stories on curl pattern returning to its previous state. Thanks! ",

I have a chronic baby face that comes with cheeks that everybody wants to pinch, but that's not a major issue. What bothers me is that my side profile looks horrible. No jaw line at all. And I don't want smth super duper defined, I just want it to at least be there😭\n\nPlus I feel like I'm starting to develop a double chin... somehow? I've always had a tiny pouch there but it's slowly starting to grow more visible. I did some research and I might have a recessed/weak jaw. This is self diagnosis and guesses i didn't really ask a professional. (If it helps, I had braces for 2 years bc my teeth were messed up and my bottom jaw was recessed. Teeth fixed, jaw not not much) Also, the skin under my chin is a bit stretchy. I heard that this could play a role in the double chin appearance..\n\nI really don't know what to do abt it. It's my biggest insecurity. I heard that I should just get surgery to fix my jaw, but I don't have the money for it rn and even if I had I'm absolutely terrified. Some advice I saw was to drink more water to stop water retention and do a specific kind of massage. Would these actually work? Does anybody have other suggestions?🥲",

It is also sensitive, I have a lot of redness and really big pores everywhere, not just the T zone. \n\nI have tried La Roche Posay, Bioderma, Cera Ve, The Ordinary, Mixa and none of those helped. I tried niacinamide serums and pore minimizing serums and they didn't work. My routine is mostly just a cleansing gel and moisturizing cream in the morning and evening, when I was trying out serums, I layered them correctly. I wear makeup every day and not even primers work (mattifying or pore minimizing). I do not have acne but I get small white zits or some zits appear under skin (mostly cheeks and around the nose) almost every day. I have some blackheads but I don't have a lot and I can exctract them, they arent a problem. Please also note that I change my face towel regularly, always just dab my face, change my pillowcase regularly and so on. I really try with everything. I do my routine regularly, I am aware that consistency is key, but nothing has helped me so far. I hate it because I hate the feeling of oilyness on my face and it also affects my hair, it gets oily even faster bc of my face. I also cannot walk around with no foundation because I am insecure about the pores and redness, but also if I don't wear foundation, my face gets oilier even faster and even if I dab it or wash it with water, it gets oily again after an hour.\n\nAny suggestions on which products, routine would work for me? A friend suggested retinal, which I havent tried, what do you think?",

With the perm, it's wavy to very loosely curly (depending on the section of hair and when I last did anything to it).  I bought a wavy shampoo and conditioner and was also using my daughter's (preschooler with curly hair) leave-in spray.  \n\n  \nDuring Christmas week my scalp got SUPER itchy.  Could not stop. I ended up doing 2 rounds of clarifying shampoo and an ACV rinse, and that helped a ton.  It's been itchy off and on.  Saturday it got bad again, did another round of shampoo and ACV rinse (not nearly diluted enough).  My scalp has calmed down a lot, but it's still a bit itchy off and on, and the backs of my ears too.  My hair is a bit dried out, understandably.  \n\n  \nI'm now kind of afraid to add any moisture, even though my hair is drinking it up.  I'm not sure what I did or how to fix it. ",

      "content": "hiii im new here and kind of worried, im sorry this is so long its 2am im trying my best here lmfao i hope atleast a few people care enough to read this:) im 20 and canadian for reference. this photo is immediately after cleansing, i use a very sensitive cleanser (nutribiotic non soap fragrance free) and ive never had any issues with it. i used to have really bad acne, i started using hypochlorous acid and it cured it. my skin is still fully clear and theres never any redness aside from after washing my face. now im worried, since i had such bad acne and was so insecure im just starting to gain my confidence back, i really dont want more acne. its scary. this reaction is strange, its typically just redness on my nose and cheeks if anything - not showing specific acne dots or any redness on my chin/beside my mouth like here. i do know quite a bit about skincare, just good ingredients and stuff, definitely not as much as you guys. recently, long after i healed my acne, i noticed my skin texture and tone wasnt the best. i decided to invest in paulas choice 2% BHA liquid exfoliant (and their anti aging eye cream). i used the exfoliator 2 days in a row before seeing someone online talk about only using it a couple times a week, as its harsh. im wondering if these bumps and redness are all going to surface and give me a hugeee breakout from the exfoliant. if so, will that be beneficial? i know about resurfacing and it says it unclogs pores so is that what its doing? is this what thats supposed to look like? it doesnt sting or burn. the eye cream has also given me a couple bumps which went away but still, unsure. i thought this was a universally good brand, everyone praises them so much. anyway, i put my regular skincare on after this reaction, which i will list. the one thing i think you guys are gonna flame me for is using cerave resurfacing retinol nightly.. didnt remember it said resurfacing until now honestly. i feel like that might be a bit harsh but i like the texture of it, i like to apply something before my moisturizer and i dont have anything else right now besides the more harsh exfoliant. ive been using that cerave stuff for a couple years because every time i run out, i break out. i use eucerin face Q10 revitalize for my night time moisturizer (another retinol thing.. i didnt realize until now) and bioderma sebum hydra for day time. after typing it all out i understand im using too much retinol but i want some suggestions, what other ingredients should i prioritize the most? is the inkey list good? i just saw some for cheaper at winners, maybe ill get some of their products if so. i also put aquaphor over my skincare tonight due to the irritation, and aquaphor doesnt irritate me or clog my pores. and yes i know should be wearing sunscreen but i havent found one that doesnt break me out. i have oily/combination acne prone skin. i hope you guys arent mean lol thank you if you’re nice/helpful, im posting this and going straight to bed so ill see and reply to any comments/questions tomorrow:)",
