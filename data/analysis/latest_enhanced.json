      "content": "I have had acne since 2020. I was on adapalene and isotretinoin in 2020 and it cleared my skin but I shifted to Delhi in 2024 and it took a toll on my skin!😣\n\nI came in June and skin started getting worse! Went to a dermatologist in October but he kept on prescribing very expensive hyaluronic acid, vitamin c and niacinamide serums even when I told him I’m allergic to niacinamide😒\n\nSo finally in November my neighbour aunty told me to give raw aleovera a chance and started using it everyday at night after my skincare routine and cleared my skin😭😭😭\n\nMy cousin who is around 18 has acne since he was 14, just how my skin looks. Even he started aleovera and he’s happy with the results! (I will post his before and after in few months)\n\nWith aleovera I followed a simple skincare routine: \n\n1. Facewash : Simple Facewash (using it since 3 years now)\n2. Moisturiser: Formula rx hydra veil moisturiser (love of my life💝)\n3. Sunscreen : I was using reequil matte during the summer season and currently using minimalist fluid sunscreen 🧴 \n4. Bioderma Micellar water or Deconstruct cleansing balm for makeup removal 🎀\n\nI use to 10-15 step routine before this and I have over consuming way too much! \n\nHow I use the aleovera:\n\n1. Cut a piece from plant\n2. Clean it with water\n3. Keep it in water for 20 mins (it ensures all the yellow part is removed)\n4. Apply it after 1 Hour after doing my skincare routine which is just applying my moisturiser \n\nTo anyone who is going through acne just give aleovera a try! Please please please😭😭\n\n*Some people are allergic to aleovera too so do a patch test! ",

This particular stylist had good reviews and has been in the business for around 30 years now so I figured I would give her a shot. It was only supposed to be a 2-inch trim, cleaning up my layers, and cleaning my face framing bangs. \n\nSomething definitely felt off during the actually cut. She kept spinning me away from the mirror so I couldn't see and gradually stopped with small talk. Fast forward to now, I feel like the back is uneven and the layers seem horrendously choppy so me. I included a couple shots of me looking straight forward, looking down, and to either side to show how it all lays.\n\nAm I overreacting?

Last september I added 1x 0.5mg dut to my 7x 1mg fin regimen. I even improved my hair thickness for 6 months. BUT I started to shed after the end of this 6 month.\n\nIn march 2025 I started to shed like crazy… This shed lasted until today, and still going. I tried to increase my dut dosage up to x2 and x3 with x7 fin per week but nothing changed.\n\nTo clarify, I do not use generic brands. Only propecia and avodart.\n\nSo, the question rises now: What should I do?\n\nA) Stop dutasteride fully because it gives damage (?) to my hair and only stick with finasteride. 9 month is already enough.\n\nB) 2-3x dut is not enough so increase it to ED.\n\nFor the option A, I do find it weird to be honest because some people say that I might not be responding enough to dut But dont forget, I have never stopped using 7x fin.\n\nCould you guys help me, or just share your ideas please? I am planning to see a doctor but they are generally useless since they are mainly not pro fin/dut in my country.\n\nI appreciate all the help and comments",

      "content": "Hi, for as long as I can remember, I’ve gone for the classic very short sides and trimmed on top look. I’ve decided to grow it longer but I’m struggling with how it looks. It’s occasionally great, but in between then, can be quite bad. \n\nThe first 13 pictures are of how it looks when bad. The next 3 are the type of hairstyle I would like to move towards and the last 4 are examples of occasions when I think it looked good. \n\nWhat I want to ask is:\n1) how should I ask for the barber to cut it? I ask you this because I’ve gone to many different ones and they give different advice, like some say short on the sides and long on top while others say it would be better to have sides that are quite long.\n2) how to style it. I blow dry generally and wash my hair once or twice a week. Conditioner maybe once a week. My hair is naturally quite greasy but dry shampoo works very well for this. Most products that I use tend to make it look too greasy, like hair spray, powder or clay. Sea spray too. \n\nYou need to consider that I have a double crown and my hair grows forwards on one side of my head but downwards on the other side, so symmetry is difficult. \n\nWhen I style it in the mirror, it tends to look good, but very quickly will go out of shape and look weird, especially when I leave the house and there is even the slightest breeze, either looking frizzy, or very flat around the center of the forehead, or spreading too much to look like a mushroom. My hair tends to be lightweight, so it is difficult to keep it in place without heavy use of products, which then makes it too greasy looking. \n\nAs for the cut, I think it tends to look like a mushroom if I don’t cut it short on the sides. Any advice on exactly how to cut it would be helpful. \n\nWould really appreciate any advice you have, please don’t fear being harsh, I need to fix this. It has been an issue for too long and I’m always touching my hair to keep it looking as decent as possible. ",

      "content": "Hi guys. As the title suggests I really need some advice on my skin. As a teen/tween I had bad breakouts on my face and chest and terrible KP on my upper arms and chest area as well. Im now 18 and don’t really struggle with active breakouts but all the breaks out that I used to have, have left a myriad of dark spots, hyperpigmentation and scars all over my face, chest and upper arms. I’ve been struggling with those marks for years and they make me feel terrible, it’s gotten to a point where I don’t wear anything that shows my upper arms or chest and I never leave the house without full coverage makeup . Please help me out 😭I wanna feel comfortable and wear cute clothes again.\n\nExtra info to my skin: Chest - oily skin Upper arms - dry skin Face - combination (Nose, chin and middle of forehead oily. Cheeks and sides of forehead dry) - so basically  inner face oily and outer face dry if that makes sense.\n\nRoutine: I don’t really have a consistent routine I keep up with, but I do wash my arms and chest with a 5% urea body wash and I use the ordinary 7% toner on them with a cotton pad bidaily and lotion with a 15% urea body lotion. I also had a cream prescribed for my dermatologist for my KP. It’s called selgamis by galderma and it’s 50 Mikrogramm trifaroten /g creme \n\nAs for face I use an 5% salicylic acid face wash (eucerin)  and double cleanse with an oil cleanser (balea) to get all my makeup off. I’ve used vitamin C and niacinamide and retinol (the ordinary) but I wasn’t consistent and I don’t use them anymore (I ran out lol)\n\n \n\nI am also based in the EU which means some products may not be super easily available to me but please recommend whatever works best. I appreciate any and every advice. Thank you guys so much",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I'm hoping to get some ideas on how I can potentially help out my roots. They don't seem to have the same curl pattern as the rest of my hair. It's not that I particularly mind that it's different, it's just idk how to properly take care of them in the same way. It doesn't look good at all and idk what to do. I just started my curly journey a couple months ago. I had finally went to a curly salon and she gave a lot of great tips, but when it came to my roots she told me to do the same thing to them as the rest of my hair, but clearly it isn't working out. I've tried using a bounce curl brush, denman brush, and now I finger coil, but still no luck. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I thank you all in advance!\n\n✨️\n\nRoutine:\n•Wash my hair twice a week\n•Wash only top of my hair with Herbal Essence sulfate-free shampoo, condition only bottom of my hair with Herbal Essence sulfate-free conditioner\n•Use Ouidad Coil Infusion Deep Conditioner on whole head once a week\n•Clarify whole head with Olaplex Clarifying Shampoo once a month\n•Put Rizo's Curl Cream on soaking wet hair (whole head including roots)\n•Put Ouidad Advanced Climate Control gel on wet hair (whole head including roots)\n•Finger coil whole head, using fingertips to pull at roots to make them not so kinky (which isn't working)\n•Add a small amount of Kenra No.9 hairspray\n•Diffuse with Babyliss dryer\n•Use small amount of Kenra Luxe Shine Oil to break cast\n•Sleep in silk bonnet and silk pillowcases",

I normaly wore my hair very curly and scruntched before but I can not do it now because my hair would be then like chin length. Straightend it is nearly armpit length. It is not really curly. Like 2c/3a I think. But it is really puffy and springs up a lot because it is quiet thin. \n\nI would like to get more length by weighing down my hair more. \n\nMy Routine: Right now I wash it with an medical shampoo because of Seb Derm and the condition it with canto conditioner. After that I comb it and take a moisturising curl balm ( Wella Professionals Invigo Nutri Enrich), some Schwarzkopf Gliss Kur Elixier Oil, Lola From Rio Vintage Girls Creme Alisante and Taft x Gliss straightening cream. I then put it wet in a low bun. \n\nIt still gets puffy and I do not get any length. I feel so imensly ugly, like a clown or old woman, while being only 27. I loved my curly hair before but now I cry everytime I look in the mirror. I mean I can not wait like for 2 - 2 1/2 years until I look normal again. \n\nDo you have tips ? ",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

Ive been using The Ordinary 2% granactive retinoid with no effect on them. Just got Paulas Choice retinaldehyde and i'm gonna try it for a few months, but i just read an article that both of these degrade really fast so i have low hopes. My skin isnt very sensitive so i dont want recommendations for \"weaker starter products\" i just want something strong to make these go away. \n\nI also wonder if im doing something wrong to cancel the effects. Does vitamin c lotion applied after retinol make it less effective? Ive just recently stopped because i read something indicating it might. In which case which moisturizer can i use with it?\n\nThis is my full routine incase anyone spots something im doing wrong\n\nMorning-\n- Algenist cleanser\n- cheap drugstore toner\n- Algenist essence\n- The Ordinary vitamin c serum\n- body shop vitamin c moisturizer \n\nnight-\n- algenist cleanser \n- 2% bha toner\n- the ordinary 2% granactive retinoid on everywhere but forehead\n- paulas choice retinaldehyde on forehead\n- the ordinary eye serum\n- pacifica night time eye cream\n- prose custom moisturizer \n\n\ni use sunscreen when i go outside but im not usually outside for more than a few minutes.

Just water its self will have it springy and curly\n\n3. Next once the kinks and knots are gone I put a shine pomade in my hair also made by ( Carole daughter) it’s kinda thick so you wanna rub it around your hands until it softens the apply enough that you can get all your hair, the shine pomade stops your hair from frizzing, it’s made for rough, dry, textured hair. Then I brush it through so it spreads evenly. \n\n4. I wrap a towel around my shoulders to catch any access water from dropping on me and I stay like that and let my hair air dry bc that’s the best way to do it for curly hair because either causes more defined bouncy/ springy curls. And that is my routine.",
