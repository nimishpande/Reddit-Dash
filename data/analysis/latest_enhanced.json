      "content": "Hello Curly People! I’ve lurked in this group for about a year now, and finally decided to make my own post. \n\nToday, I tried out the Ulta Hair Analysis (curiosity), and I was shocked that it said my hair was mostly wavy and only 2% curlies. I think it’s very wrong. My hair is mostly 3B curls, I think, with some 3A and a couple 3C curls for funzies. Am I crazy?! Is the app crazy? Anyone else get weird, inconsistent results either this app? Definitely hoping for the latter, hah!\n\nI’ve had very short, curly hair with teeny tiny baby bangs most of my whole life. A few years ago, I decided to see what my hair would look like if I grew it out. Now that I’m getting older and have some grey hairs, it’s so fun to watch as it swirls with the curls. I’m also learning how to diffuse and am looking for my favorite products/ gels. \n\nAnyways, if you have similar hair to mine, what’s your favorite cream and gel? \n\nRoutine: Usually, I shampoo/condition w/ either Redken frizz dismiss, Biolage Hydration, or Ouai for medium hair. \n\nThen, I use Unite/Boing Curl 7-Seconds detangler spray (right after the shower, brush upside-down while wet), scrunch with Pattern Leave-in Conditioner (still upside-down), and Curl Keeper liquid gel (upside-down). I just ran out of the Curl Keeper gel, and have been trying out Eco Gel. \n\nAfter upside-down scrunching, I flip my hair back, and diffuse by cupping the curls up to my scalp until mostly dry or I let my hair air dry. It takes a long time to dry. Still learning how to care for my hair as it gets longer and more grays appear.\n\nHappy New Years, my curly headed folks!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I use miccelar water instead.\n\nMy hydration routine is simple: Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream morning and evening after washing face, I also tried using a second moisturizer before this one for extra hydration - Skin1004 Centella Hyalu-cica Moisture Cream. It is not helping much, I think maybe I need some kind of serum instead? I’ve used The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Serum in the past, I think it helped with hydration, but my skin felt bumpy while using it.\n\nIt is winter right now where I live, during summer my face is more balanced, sometimes a bit oily around nose.\n\nAny recommendations to manage tightness and flakiness, and clear up the tiny bumps on chin and forehead?",

      "content": "Last pic is the before. I've been cutting and occasionally dying my own hair for years now, and I've been wanting to get a peekaboo shag. Two days ago, I went for it! I'm so happy with the results!\n\nRoutine for cutting and dying:\n- start on non-washed hair without products. \n\n-Make an inch-deep, three-inch base width triangle for the bangs. Clip em. \nMake a sharp horizontal part from ear to ear, clip up the top half. Bottom half is what I bleached.\n\n-I had black lowlights where I wanted to bleach, so I separated those first and applied Schwarzkopf extra strength bleach. Left that for 15 minutes before applying bleach on the kids and ends of the entire bottom half. Left that for another 15 minutes before bleaching my roots, including those on my bangs, leaving them for another 15. The length of my bangs was already bleached, but caramel, so I bleached those for only 7-10 minutes at the end, right after applying to the roots. Total bleach-in time was 45 minutes. I know I didn't spend a lot of time bleaching the roots or my natural color length, but despite my natural hair being pretty dark, it lifts very easily. \n\n-During this entire process I was checking each inch-wide, super thin bleach section in the back with two mirrors, you really have to make sure to stay on the part for this to turn out not muddy. \n\n-Rinsed out the bleach, keeping the top part clipped up not to mess with my parts. Used a bond-building treatment for bleached hair, then blow-dried on cold and low. \n\n-Applied black-brown dye to the top part of my hair, especially since that was also heavily highlighted and I wanted the peekaboo to really stand out. \n\n-After applying the top half and pinning it up again, I applied Schwarzkopf pearlescent white toner on the bleached parts, since my natural undertones are very warm and my hair always comes out very brassy after a bleach. As you can see, it didn't take every bit of brassiness, but I didn't really want it too since too-cool tones don't look good on me.\n\n-I kept the brown-black dye in for 45 minutes, the toner for 25. Then rinsed, used another moisturizing and bond building treatment. \n\n-Then, the cut: \n-I first cut about 5cm/2in off the total length of my hair by just sectioning it out and cutting the same amount everywhere. \n\n-I then pulled my bangs down and cut them to right below my nose. \n\n-I cut my layers by first cutting another inch off the black-dyed part to make the peekaboo more pronounced, and then by taking vertical sections throughout the hair and blending.\n\n-I then pulled vertical sections beside my face and blended the bangs, ending at the sides of my jaw.\n\n-I then dried my hair without products and looked how everything was laying. As my curl pattern is a lil shifty throughout my hair, I cut off any pieces that stood out, then I dry-cut my bangs until they fell right below my eyebrows.\n\nAnd there we are folks!",

      "content": "I'll be 22 years old in a month. I've used a low dose of retinol by the brand Good Molecules about a year ago but wasn't consistent with it for more than 2 weeks. I'm American but have been living in Korea for a month now and will continue to be here for one more month before heading back home. Of course with my stay here, I have completely dove into all the K beauty having a full skin care routine for the first time in a year. I've used chemicals and had a very consistent skincare routine for a while before taking this year long hiatus from everything other than a basic skin cleanser so my skin isn't sensitive to chemicals on the face. With that being said, i've now been using this 5X retinol complex + PCL serum by CNP Lab for a month now in my nighttime skincare routine with no problems of sensitivity, burning, or peeling. In fact I've noticed the fine lines I do have reduce a lot. Of course I'm using other products such a hyaluronic acid, sunscreen, vitamin C, and others that also probably add to my improvement in overall skin texture. I started using retinol based products as preventative skin aging, and have seen that it's okay and sometimes recommended to start in your 20's, but I'm also seeing things about how it can have the opposite effect and reduce natural collagen production in the skin the older I get. I've been feeling and looking fine now but it has only been a month of these products, also i'm not using a straight retinol now but more so a retinol complex. Am I okay to continue use? Or should I stop before I create damage?\n\nI have an oily T-zone, the rest of my face is just normal. Not too dry, not too oily. I don't really have issues with acne other than the occasional pimple around my menstruation cycle. I am however more prone to blackheads, clogged pores, and textured skin, but my routine so far has seemed to help with all of those. I don't know if this matters but I'm mixed with black and white so i'm rather tan, but I know everyone should use products to prevent sun damage no matter what complexion you are, so I am religious about sunscreen use. ESPECIALLY with using chemicals like retinoids.",

      "content": "Lost my big curls\n\n\nHi there\n\nI used to have big curls but over the years my hair changed and it turned into smaller curls and now it’s stringy. I’m at a point where it’s hard to even get them defined. \nA few weeks ago my hair was so bad/dry that it could just stay in a 90 angle position after I removed my scrunchie.\n\nSince I dye it I thought Olaplex could help.\nSo I did a round of n°1 and n°2 and I’m now using n° 3 as maintenance. I did help a bit.\nBut since it seems I was lacking moisture itches wasn’t enough.\n\nI’m overdue for an haircut and I’m going next week so it might help but I still thinking something is missing to have better looking/healthier hair.\n\nI have to use a special shampoo for now for something I can’t mention here because of the rules of this sub.\nWhich of course affects my routine as I had to look for products that would not make the situation worse so my options are limited. \nOnce it’s under control I can reintroduce some products (I have a bunch from Shea Moisture, Giovinni, Olaplex…).\n\nSo right now my routine is:\n- Double shampoo with the special shampoo (otherwise I was using Smooth as Silk deep moisture shampoo from Giovanni) \n- I stoped using hair mask at the moment but before I either used Nutrafix hair reconstructor or Smooth as Silk deep conditioning hair mask both by Giovanni)\n- then I use an AA Keratin &amp; Peptide Hair Serum, a French local brand to squish to condish on wet hair. Before I used the Direct leave in Weightless conditioner from Giovanni which I loooove to squish to condish but I have to hold back right now. That’s when I try to form big clumps. I tried brush styling with a Denman but I was not really good at it I have to do so many sections that I was kinda discouraged. \n- at this step I would use a mousse (from Giovanni again) before gel but I couldn’t find one compatible with my situation now (I found some references that I could try to find online though but I’m hopeful I can soon come back to my usual products) \n- then I use gel with hyaluronic acid and flax seeds, same French local brand. It doesn’t have a strong hold. I have a better one from Kerasoin that again I can’t use at the moment. \n- then I diffuse on cold setting. \n- I sleep on a satin pillowcase and I’m waiting for a silk bonnet that I ordered.\n\nSo I know my routine is impacted by my situation right now but I’m hopefull I could use regular products soon. And even with regular products my hair doesn’t look much better.\nI wish I could have those big curls again that I like better than small curls but now it’s not even curly at all anymore it’s just stringy. \n\nAs for the haircut I’m going to go for a shag even though I don’t have much length to work with. For some reason it’s shorter behind, I think because I lost so much hair detangling as it was so dry. \n\nSo if you have any recommendations whether styling, products (even I can only use them once my situation is under control) or if you see what the problem could be (moisture, protein…?) I would be grateful.\n\n",

Plain products are available only at a very higher price; mid and lower ranges are filled with unwanted acids. Even if it is available without acids- 2 months later the company rebrands and remakes the same cream as “enriched with hyalaron”.. ! Is it compulsively “essential” to use acids nowadays?

I believe I have medium porosity, medium density and medium/coarse finish. My routine for this result was in order: Aveeno Apple Cider Vinegar Clarifying Shampoo, OGX Volumising Biotin &amp; Collagen Shampoo, Moogoo Milk Protein Coditioner (scrunched out with water), Microplopped with a cotton shirt until damp, Cake Curl Crush Jelly Scrunched in on damp hair (admittedly I didn't use a lot because I was scared it would be way too crunchy) and diffused upright leaning over slightly. Is there anything better I coild be using instead? Particularly shampoo.

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",
