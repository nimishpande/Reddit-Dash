      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Where do I go from here? What am I doing wrong? Are these ridiculous long locks worth salvaging despite the time, effort, and expense, or was this a fun experiment I should move on from for my own well-being? I've been growing my hair out with only two very minor trims for two plus years now. I don't know if I had/have a particular goal or vision, it was some kind of combination between \"I'm loving my little ringlets, maybe I love them even more the longer they grow?\" and a bit of a trauma response to the overwhelm of becoming a parent a bit over two years ago. \n\nWhen my hair was much shorter, I had gotten pretty great at figuring out cheap and easy-ish routines that yielded results I really liked (that would get me stopped in the street about) using Aussie Miracle Curl conditioner or Ethique's curl conditioner bar and just leaving in some of the product before plopping with a t-shirt for 30 minutes, and bam - another good hair day. I got by that way for the first year and change of growing it. I experimented with homemade flaxseed gel and had really good success with that too as my hair got longer. I started tying my hair back to get it out of my eyes and face and liked that look too... my curls make me feel powerful on good days. \n\nBut at some point a few months ago, something changed, and everything went downhill. My old standby, Aussie Miracle Curl Conditioner (paired once or twice a week with their shampoo) started making my curls stringy as soon as I put it on, rather than help the curls nicely adhere together like I swear it used to. I tried Shea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine Conditioner and had no better results. My hair started taking 7 to 10 business days to dry, even if I dragged out the plopping to an hour or more or tried a second dry t-shirt after soaking the first (and I don’t think my scalp has  been loving all the trapped moisture, incidentally). I started using handfuls of Eco Style Olive Oil gel in the shower in hopes it would help the curl shape and minimize frizz, to mixed and short-lived results. Pic 1 is the current best-case scenario, plopped and then patiently air-dried for hours. Still lots of frizz, the overall shape is weird, and the only way to keep hair out of my eyes seems to be to tie at least some of it back. Which leads me to pic 2, six hours later, tied back with the rest of the curls frizzing the heck out despite all the gel I thought I’d prayer-handed in that morning. Pic 3 is a typical end-of-night look, when the hair tie comes out and it all feels and looks like an old pile of hay from someone’s abandoned barn. Kind of makes me want to buzz it like I did after that boy broke my heart sophomore year of college. But then again… I don’t know that I will ever have the patience again to grow this much hair and endure all the awkward lengths, so would I come to regret getting rid of it all? \n\nI just did the float test on a strand of hair and when placed on the water it floated above it, but when I submerged it manually it sank to the bottom. Is it possible my hair used to be lower-porosity and now is more porous for some reason? Or am I misinterpreting things?\n\nThe five last pics after that are from 9-10 months of growth or less (Aussie Miracle Curl conditioner or Ethique conditioner bar, maybe some flax gel, a brief plop and then air dry), when good hair days felt attainable and I enjoyed the ego boost of a compliment from a stranger every now and then.\n\nI love absorbing wisdom and hairspiration from this amazing sub, but lately I’ve felt weighed down by the ADHD of it all. The thousand options for steps I \\*could\\* take have led me to total paralysis and a shame-spiral of disliking my hair and therefore not taking care of it and therefore liking it less, lather rinse repeat.\n\nI know there’s no SHOULD, but… “should” I (or would you):\n\n* Get all the ends trimmed? Get it totally reshaped? Get bangs of some sort? Go back down to a skin fade on the sides and a few cheeky ringlets on top and save myself a bunch of time and effort? Should I pony up three figures for the X-curly-technique-certified stylist or just seek out someone well-reviewed in my hood with a curly cut I like in their IG feed?\n* Do some sort of triage/deep conditioning repair treatment for my unhappy curls?\n* Try blow-drying/diffusing? I’ve never done this but am very intrigued by the potential time-savings and benefits. Can’t decide if I should get some cheapo secondhand dryer/diffuser just to try it out or splurge for a top-of-the-line situation because it’ll be \\*that\\* life-changing (Dyson Supersonic Nural or similar?)\n* Sleep in a bonnet and/or use a silk pillowcase? Would this potentially really lead to hair I could wear down on a second day without a shower?\n* Try some other holy grail products that worked for you in a similar situation? I like the idea of a simple, low-cost, low-plastic routine but if really great curls are going to require a shift in values... I'm willing to try something new, though I don't know how much capacity I have at this point for exhaustive experiments to dial in the perfect regimen.\n\nAny words of wisdom, real talk, encouragement, and/or product/routine recommendations are much appreciated &lt;3",

      "content": "This Phase II trial randomized 180 Chinese men with androgenetic alopecia into six groups to receive topical GT20029 at 0.5% or 1.0% either once daily or twice weekly, plus matched placebo groups, for 12 weeks. \n\nThe main outcome was the change in target-area non-vellus hair count at Week 12, with additional tracking of Week 6 hair count, hair width, and the terminal-to-vellus ratio. \n\nAll four GT20029 groups increased hair count from baseline by Week 12, but the cleanest placebo-separated results were seen with 0.5% once daily and 1.0% twice weekly: the 0.5% once-daily group showed a least-squares mean change of 16.80 hairs/cm² versus 10.10 hairs/cm² for placebo, and the 1.0% twice-weekly group showed 11.94 hairs/cm² versus 4.57 hairs/cm² for placebo, translating to net advantages of about 6.70 and 7.37 hairs/cm² respectively. \n\nThe 1.0% twice-weekly schedule also produced the strongest thickness signal, improving hair width at Week 12 versus placebo (0.54 vs −0.02), and it even showed an early Week 6 hair-count separation in the repeated-measures analysis (2.93 versus −7.45). \n\nThis makes 1.0% twice weekly the most convincing overall regimen in this short study, with 0.5% once daily close behind. \n\nA reasonable critique of why the 1.0% once-daily group did not clearly outperform placebo is that this was a small, short-dose exploration trial with only about 30 people per arm, the daily-dose arms did not show a clear dose-response pattern, and separate placebo groups for daily and twice-weekly schedules can drift differently by chance. \n\nIt is also plausible that a PROTAC like GT20029 has a non-linear sweet spot so the intermittent higher exposure produces cleaner androgen receptor degradation than higher continuous dosing, and also daily use of the higher-strength formula could add subtle irritation or short-term cycling noise that blunts visible separation over just 12 weeks.\n\n24 weeks (6 months) would probably show better data that we can rely comfortably on. But so far, this is a good signal for this mechanism of action!",

I had minimal break outs my skin stopped feeling flaky and such. now I’m dealing with tightness after every face wash that doesn’t go away despite how much I “load” up everything else.

What??? Somehow I saw it, but I can't compute it. \n\nI've never had success clumping my hair how it wants to and I don't want to accidentally poorly train my hair. Are some patterns not a good fit ? Can I train my hair to all go where I want? Does it somehow really not matter can your hair can flip flop? \n\nCurrently washing with Kitsch shampoo bar and switch conditioners pretty frequently but am using shea moisture right now. Dry brushing and applying jojoba oil before shower to the lengths and tips, a small amount afterwards and Aussie lock gel. \n\nGot a shag cut and suddenly my whole head is curly!!!

      "content": "I have thick 2b–2c hair, and my routine has always been pretty simple. I use Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner, wash my hair twice a week, and do a clarifying shampoo/hair mask every other week. After I shower I use NotYourMother’s mousse and cream. I refresh my hair about once a week, and I try to diffuse when I can, but most of the time I just let it air dry.\nI also have big sensory issues, so wet hair is tough for me but I manage \n\nMy real struggle is sleeping. I put my hair in a big scrunchie bun at night, but when I wake up, it looks like a hot mess. I leave early for school and I’m not sacrificing sleep. absolutely not. So I don’t have time to fully refresh it every morning\n\nFor some reason, the back of my hair ends up super tangled even though I’m not a crazy sleeper. My hair feels almost “stiff,” my curls separate, everything turns frizzy and flat, and the front is the absolute worst. I have grown-out face framing pieces/wispy bangs, and the entire front section just looks WRECKED. I like wearing my hair down, so it’s honestly a nightmare\n\nI also get product buildup really easily- maybe it’s the products I’m using, maybe it’s just my hair type, I’m not sure. But advice would be greatly appreciated!! 🫶",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
