      "content": "May 2025 —&gt; December 2025\nFinally learned how to love and take care of my curls in the past few months and I’m now obsessed with my hair. I had grown up always just brushing my hair out and then I learned how to use a flat iron and never looked back.. Until I started bleaching my hair. So I decided to put down the heat tools and learn how to do my natural hair.\nMy routine: \n1. I wash and condition with Redken Extreme Length (struggling to grow my hair because with it becoming healthier it also shrinks a lot) and usually do a hair mask every other washday. \n2. I use Sun Bum Leave in Conditioner, Sun Bum Curl Cream, Not Your Mother’s Gel, and a Bounce Curl Volume Brush. I also diffuse my hair upside down (I ❤️ volume) \n3. I scrunch and shake out my hair with Mielle Hair Oil\nI don’t do refreshes, I wash my hair around 2x a week, usually oil everyday, and I sleep in a silk bonnet. I also usually only wear my hair down to avoid breakage. Would love any hair growth tips!! \n",

      "content": "I saw the same hairstylist for the past 5 years and they’ve seen me through all my hair phases: pixie, short bob, long hair. The first photo is how they cut my hair the first time I saw them since I was growing out my pixie and realized I have naturally wavy hair. This was 2 years ago and I’ve since grew my hair out well below my shoulders. Looking back at pictures with my short hair, I really missed that era and went to cut my hair with them again. I showed them the reference and explained exactly how I want it to look but (third picture) this is what my hair looks like right now after trying to somewhat decently style it. The fourth photo is immediately after the haircut. I just don’t know what went wrong or what I should do… I realize my hair probably has to grow out before I do anything else with it but how do I go from this to the voluminous, wavy hair in the first and second photos? Any advice will be greatly appreciated 🙏\n\nMy usual styling routine are the Odele volumizing shampoo and conditioner, then the Twist by Ouidad lightweight styling gel and a styling foam. I usually diffuse my hair but it looked horrible with this haircut so I ended up straightening it. ",

I have dozens of these in my hair. A few times a week I sit down to search for these in my hair, and cut them off. I am worried it will start to make a difference in the length of my hair. I would love to avoid having to cut my hair like this. Does anyone have ANY tips on how to prevent these tiny single-strand knots? Is it OK if I just leave them there, and don't cut them off?? Because I would be down to do that, if there isn't a problem with it. it's SO FRUSTRATING because these knots are most often near the middle of the hair strand instead of the very end. I just cant resist cutting them off!!! Here is my routine:\n\n\\* 2 days a week I wash my hair, this is when I fully detangle by brushing it out with a Wet brush  \n\\* I let my hair air dry which takes several hours  \n\\* on wash day, I use two different leave in conditioners and curl cream  \n\\* every night I finger-detangle my hair (mostly) and put it into two braids  \n\\* every night I oil my hair while it is braided\n\nAs you can see, I try to minimize tangles as much as possible. But since my hair is so long, it's so hard, its practically always tangled. Please give me tips!",

But after spending way too much time reading studies, browsing forums, and listening to dermatologists explain this stuff, I realized something I hadn’t understood before: a lot of follicles don’t actually die, they just go dormant. That completely changed how I looked at the problem. If hair is inactive rather than gone, then things like stimulation and how anything actually reaches the follicle probably matter way more than just throwing random products on the scalp. I’m not claiming miracles or saying this fixes everything, just sharing something I really wish I’d understood earlier instead of assuming it was already too late.",

      "content": "Posting in this in case it helps someone else! I have fine curls that when I followed a routine and thought I did everything right most of the time they would not clump, come out stringy, and fall flat and limp and thin. I tried different products in different orders,  on different levels of wetness, etc, and eventually chalked it up to humidity and things out of my control. \n\nI was under the impression that since my curls were fine it was very important to get as much water out of my hair as possible (I almost never diffuse, and airdry instead) as to not weigh them down. After applying my product on wet hair I would use a cotton shirt and scrunch upwards and pulse as much water out as possible. Doing this also removed a lot of product and therefore reduced the hold, and my clumps would get ruined. \n\nAnyone else find this to be the case? What I’m doing now is applying my product to super wet hair out of the shower, use a cotton shirt to scrunch and pulse upwards the same but this time only doing a couple passes, before I would do it continuously until I got it as dry as possible. So my hair now air dries more damp and my routine seems to be working alot better! Not perfect but a good improvement!\n\nHair type: fine, oily\n\nEvery other day: double shampoo roots with garnier curl nourish, (will sub out for Nizoral or ouai detox shampoo as needed based on buildup, usually atleast 1x/week) \n\nAs needed (maybe 1x/month): exfoliate with ouai scalp scrub and scalp brush\n\nOn soaking wet hair in order: Not your mothers leave in spray curl talk conditioner, tresseme extra hold volumizing mousse, and curlsmith in shower style fixer gel\n\nApplication method: with head tilted, rake in and praying hands with tension to form clumps, then gently scrunch upwards only a couple times. Use cotton shirt to scrunch upwards again to absorb some water but not all, and air dry damp, in the morning I scrunched out the cast. I didn’t pineapple or anything over night (it always gave me mixed results)",

      "content": "Hi, I came off birth control to swap for a copper iud about a year-and-a-half ago and have suffered with acne ever since! My GP was treating it up until June &amp; then I started seeing a consultant dermatologist. I’m normally just a scroller on these forums but I would be really grateful for some help now…\n\nIn the photos, my ‘clearer’ (totally conscious it wasn’t perfect) is when I was on my GP’s course of treatment which was Epiduo in June. The latter photos are from my dermatologist’s current treatment (December). I’ve been on spironolactone (terrible side effects and didn’t do anything for my acne), and am now on Winlevi and azelaic acid alongside Aklief (a 4th gen retinol) in the evening.\n\nMy skin has clearly got worse since seeing this dermatologist and now he’s pressuring me to go onto Accutane which I don’t believe is necessary if I can get my skin back to how it was previously. I could have another course of antibiotics too, but it caused severe flushing and I don’t miss how reactive my skin was to the sun! I don’t know if I sack off this dermatologist &amp; try to sort it out myself using Epiduo again?\n\nI should also note that I do have some hormonal issues, and I would not be surprised if these things are all interlinked, but in June my skin was almost clear and that was using a topical cream so i’m determined I can get back to that whilst still trying to deal with the hormonal issues. Also, asked my dermatologist if the copper iud could be an issue but he said no sooo…\n\nI don’t know if I stick to what the dermatologist has prescribed in hopes it’ll fix itself, I couldn’t get another appointment until Feb so I would have to wait another month or so until I see them.\n\nI just don’t know what to do anymore and my acne is making me miserable, I miss who I was prior to it and have lost all self confidence!\n\nCurrent Routine: \n\nAM:\n\n\\- cerave hydrating foaming cleanser \n\n\\- winlevi \n\n\\- skinoren cream \n\n\\- cerave hydrating moisturiser\n\n\\- la roche posay invisible fluid 50+\n\nPM:\n\n\\- cerave hydrating foaming cleaner\n\n\\- winlevi \n\n\\- cerave hydrating moisturiser \n\n\\- Aklief retinol ",

But right before I stopped using it, they introduced a \"new formula\" for it. Suddenly, I'd have oily hands after applying it. And I know it was oil because no matter how I scrubbed, water wasn't washing it off.\n\nI started using Redken because it was often suggested here, however it's WAY too expensive, has to be ordered online, and has the exact same problem; oily hands. My hair gets greasy way too quickly because of it.\nI don't really understand why they're trying to give conditioning properties to shampoo, it defeats the purpose.\n\nHas anybody else noticed this and/or got suggestions for colour-safe shampoos available in Europe that are sulfate-free and oil-free?",

It feels really good for my skin but if I overdo it I breakout.\n\nTirtir Milk toner which unfortunately does break me out a bit but I like the feel.\n\nI have a CeraVe daily moisturizer which I stopped using since I liked tirtir more\n\nYesterday bought Geek and Gorgeous 0.05 to start retinal\n\nBeauty of Joseon sunscreen (Sun aqua fresh rice).\n\nAs you can see, I have a tiny very minimal routine and am open to trying more things.

Most days I straighten the mids and that’s how I style it. Most of the hair care videos I see online are related to curly hair routines, which is know is not for me. But, I don’t know what IS for me. If anyone could help guide me in the right direction, I’d greatly appreciate it 🙏🏻",

I shave mostly, but I do own an at-home wax machine(I do find it hard to keep up with because there are days when I need smooth legs, but it's not time to wax yet, so that's why I prefer shaving). I also sometimes get more red bumps after waxing. I'm tight on money right now and live in a country where a lot of products aren't available(Balkans), so I have purchased the Balea Urea lotion, and I'm looking into getting the Ordinary Glycolic acid. I also got a body scrub for exfoliating.\n\nDo you think getting the Cerave SA lotion would be good, and are there any other tips and/or products that you might recommend? I'd also like to hear if you have any experience with Urea.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jcrf1cos0e7g1.png?width=225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfdb049a315bc41a0fa5ed1b6e731307ca05e897\n\n",

I was prescribed Minoxidil 5% + topical Finasteride 0.1% by a dermatologist, and I did experience good hair regrowth. However, I failed to notice this improvement, maybe because the improvement was gradual, and I didn't keep track of my hair well enough.\n\nThis caused me to panic, and thus, I visited a different dermatologist, who suggested I discontinue Finasteride, as it wasn't ideal for my age. It's been about a year since I did so, and now, I notice that my hair thinning has been exacerbated.\n\nA hair transplant centre suggested 6 sessions of PRP to me, and said I will notice regrowth after about 3-6 sessions (each session being a month apart from the other). My research on Google, ChatGPT and Perplexity suggests that PRP will helpful, and will thicken my hair. On the other hand, though, many users on Reddit state that PRP isn't helpful at all.\n\nI am confused about what my next action should be. Please help me.",

As you can see from the pictures my face is significantly red compared to my neck. \n\nAnd I would love if there is a product that helps with smoothing out the overall texture of my face. If there is no such product, is there a treatment I could look into that isn't me just getting a face-lift or something? Lool \n\nAny and all advice is wholeheartedly appreciated and welcomed! \n\nMy current routine is washing face and neck at night with a mild soap (I use a dove bar), follow up with an apricot toner. In the morning I use heartleaf moisturiser and spf 50. Not mentioning brands but I can share if this is useful info! I also used to use Azeliac acid but I found it did nothing for me! ",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I’m desperately seeking help and advice for something that has been giving me extreme anxiety lately. This past spring, I got 2 rows of hand-tied hair extensions done by a very reputable stylist that I drive a pretty long way to see. The initial installation was amazing, and I went 8 weeks before my first move up. Not a single bead slip, broken string, etc. The first time I had them moved up, I had a string break… and the row come loose. I went back for her to fix it, and we chalked it up as these things happen. I had one more move up that went okay, and then things started to go sideways. The last 2 times I’ve had them moved up, I’ve been getting bead slippage. The stylist swears she doesn’t know what’s going on, that she never has this issue with anyone else, etc. The last time I had them moved up was by far the worst, less than 2 weeks later both rows started coming loose. We had tried a smaller bead thinking that maybe my hair was too thin for the bead she had been using… even though she said that she has clients with much thinner hair than me that this never happens to. The smaller bead almost made it worse. I had to have an emergency repair from another stylist while I was away for work… this girl used a bead that seemed to hold in my hair better but did not do as many stitches as the stylist that I normally see. The beads that the emergency stylist used have held steady. But the stitches seem to be coming loose now (2.5 weeks since the emergency repair).  In the meantime, my top row started coming loose and I was just able to see my actual stylist again for a fix. I thought the string was broken, but she said it’s not, just that the beads were slipping for some reason. She went back to using the initial size of beads she had always used and said she doubled stitched thru every single bead… it felt super secure in there except for the fact that I just now realized that one of the beads is not attached to the weft! I literally saw her 3 days ago. How can this be happening?!? I use the same exact hair products that she uses on me in the salon. I even brought her my brush to show her thinking maybe it was the brush. She said it’s not. Is it the way I’m sleeping?! Is there something either of us can be doing differently to help this not happen? I seriously love this stylist, I think she is amazing… is it possible she thought she stitched thru every bead but actually just missed one? It’s giving me extreme anxiety because I travel a long way and pay a lot of money to see this girl. And at my next appointment we are supposed to install all new hair. I’m so scared of basically throwing my money away for these extensions to keep coming loose like this. I’m desperately seeking help or advice, thank you so much for reading! ",
