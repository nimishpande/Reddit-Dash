      "content": "I've always been skeptical of the $2 drug store gel, even after hearing about it for years. Surely there was no way it could be as good (or better) than the $30+ gels I was used to buying! Well the other day I ran out of the gel I had been using (Brightbody Flaxseed and Oat) and didn't have time to trek out to the zero waste store for a refill. I had also run out of my \"backup\" products,  Curlsmith Hold Me Softly and Miss Jessie's Pillow Soft Curls! I was at Walgreens pondering my options when I spotted the legendary blue gel....it was only $2.50...and the bottle is so big...and everything is so expensive these days as it is....so I decided to give it a try.\n\n  \nAND WOW! I cannot believe this worked so well, especially considering this was after I left my hair plopped for way longer than usual (like an hour??) and fell asleep with my hair wet. 🤯 I officially apologize for having ever doubted the blue gel. \n\nRoutine:\n\nShampoo - Filaree Wild Orange Vanilla\n\nConditioner - Filaree Wild Orange Vanilla \n\nGel - LA Looks blue gel/extreme sport\n\nPut gel in soaking wet hair with praying hands, raked through, scrunched out the excess water, plopped in a T-shirt towel for an hour, fell asleep, scrunched out the crunch in the morning once dry.

I paid $650 for a syringe in NYC. I looked up prior to the appointment if I'm supposed to tip. Overwhelmingly, everyone on the internet said no way, that it would almost be inappropriate. I went to finalize payment, and the screen popped up \"add tip? 15%, 20%, 25%?\" I panicked as I hadn't planned on an additional $100. I work service, so I'm not cheap, however, I am confused. I'm going back this weekend, am I supposed to tip? Is it customary, or is this office in the wrong? Thank you in advance!\n\n  \nEDIT: Thank you everybody, very helpful info.! I checked, and the spot does offer many facial options, so it may be an automatic POS thing. Appreciate everyone answering!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I have a very basic shower routine that doesn't really work much but anyway it's:\nUse an anti eczma shampoo cause I have a super dry scalp \nMonday moisturizing conditioner which I brush through in the shower\nPat them scrunch with a towel \nScrunch in john freida curl creme \nDefuse until like half dry then air dry the rest \n\nAs you can see I have diabolical amount of wet frizz and just frizz in general. I have included pics of wash day, waking up the day after, and after a full day. You can see that my hair loses so much definition and gains frizz. Also idk if this is important to note but when I brush my hair in the shower I also try to style it I suppose you could call it. I just brush downwards to try and stop clumping and add more definition. I am very stuck here so some direct advice would be amazing.",

      "content": "I’m genuinely curious how castor oil has shown up in other people’s beauty routines, because everyone seems to use it a little differently. Some people swear by it for lashes and brows, others say it’s been a game changer for dry under-eyes or brittle hair, and a few say it absolutely did not work for their skin at all. That mix of opinions is what makes me wonder how much comes down to application, consistency, or just skin type. When I tried castor oil, I kept it very minimal and focused on beauty-related uses only. A light touch on lashes and brows a few nights a week, sometimes pressing a tiny bit around my eyes after moisturizer when my skin felt tight. I noticed more conditioning than dramatic growth, which made me think it might be more about strengthening and protecting than forcing hair to grow faster. That alone felt valuable, especially for lashes that tend to feel dry after mascara. I picked up a small bottle while ordering a few other beauty basics from Alibaba, and it’s lasted forever since such a small amount goes a long way. I’m still experimenting, but I’d love to know how castor oil has helped you specifically. Did it work best for lashes, brows, skin, or hair? And how long did it take before you noticed a real difference?",
