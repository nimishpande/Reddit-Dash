      "content": "Thanks to this post https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/b8jtf7/black_orchid_large_hair_diffuser_hack_when_it/\n\nI don’t think the OP posts anymore but thank you nonetheless! It was so annoying having to put the diffuser back on every couple of mins. I didn’t have any elastics big enough so I tried using a shoelace and it worked perfectly. This solution allows me to use the hairdryer without the diffuser too. \n\nI thought about using a rubber band or tape to give the inner rings more grip but I wasn’t sure how they would hold up against the heat in the barrel. \n\nI have 2B-2C hair. My current routine: \n\n• Wash with Tresemme Clean &amp; Natural shampoo every other day\n• Condition with Herbal Essences Hello Hydration and clip my hair while I do my other washing, and shaving, if needed. Comb out knots when I’m ready to rinse\n• Apply LUS All-in-One Styler, about 2-3 pumps, followed by a tennis ball sized thing of Herbal Essences Body Envy mousse, all while standing right side up. I don’t style upside down much anymore \n• Diffuse for about 10 mins and air dry for 45-60 mins\n• Scrunch out the crunch \n",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "So here's my problem: I've been struggling with my curly hair my whole life, was never taught how to properly care for it, and every advice I've gotten hasn't worked. I've been recommended wide-tooth combs a lot, but I can't even pass fingers through my hair. It gets tangled and matted so fast! \n\nMy living conditions are also far from ideal. I work in wildland fire in the summer, and chainsaw work in the winter. So I wear hardhats all the time, in very hot and very cold conditions, I always end up with twigs and branches struck through my hair, which end up damaging my hair when I try to pull it out. \n\nI also live in a dry cabin with a woodstove, so its very dry inside in the winter, and I don't have a regular access to a shower. (I setup a camping shower in the greenhouse this summer and it's been awesome, but it's now winter and I'm not showering outside at -30 😅)\n\nSo far, my routine has been to shampoo, condition and use a detangle brush every time I shower, then air dry. It varies from everyday up to a week between a proper overhead shower. I'm not brand-loyal when it comes to toiletries, but I try to avoid the cheaper brands.\n\nI always wear hats, but I'm hoping for a way to get better coils/waves instead of a giant poof in the back of my head. Please help!",

      "content": "Hi! Long story short I am a 35F who has had pretty low maintenance skin for most my life. I was using a curology formula but stopped about 2 months ago to just save money and buy other stuff. I got influenced into adding a retinol, so I bought CeraVe Renewing Retinol Serum because it seemed ok for beginners. Same with vitamin c, so I added the vitamin c serum too. However the past 2 weeks it suddenly started to break out around my mouth and chin. This did cause me to freak out, stop the retinol, and start trying everything to fix it. Now I have a million products and could use a suggestion on my routine...   \n\nCurrent routine.. \n\nAM: No cleanser, anua 70 glow rice toner, The Ordinary nicinamide and zinc serum, Rhode barrier cream or Pyunkang Yul moisture cream. Beauty of Joseon sunscreen. \n\nPM: micellar water or Peach and Lily oil cleanser (only if I wore makeup), then peach and lily hydrating gel cleanser, anua 70 glow milky toner, anua azaleic acid serum, pyunkang yul moisture cream. \n\nPreviously... My AM was Rhode glazing milk, Rhode barrier cream, boj sunscreen. \n\nPM: micellar water, elf cleanser, Rhode glazing milk, holika holika black snail mucin, Seoul cuticles ultra retinol serum, Rhode barrier cream. \n\nSo yeah... As you can see I have various things here and no idea when or if I should use them. Dang me being influenced by my insecurities. \n\nSuggestions?? Product list below! \n\nSeoul cuticles ultra retinol serum \n\nNutrium vitamin c serum \n\nThe ordinary nicinamide and zinc serum \n\nElf holy hydration cleanser \n\nAnua azaleic acid serum \n\nCeraVe Renewing Retinol Serum \n\nHolika holika black snail mucin cream and emulsion \n\nMedicube zero pore pads (when do I even use these?!)\n\nPeach and Lily ginger melt oil cleanser and power calm hydrating gel cleanser \n\nRhode glazing milk, peptide fluid and barrier cream \n\nPyunkang Yul moisture cream \n\nGarnier micellar water (I literally have the pink one the blue one and the new vitamin c one) \n\nAnua 70 glow milky toner \n\nWhish face oil \n\nMy curology formula was: zinc pyrithione .25%, niacinamide 4% and azaleic acid 2%. \n\nUnsure on skin type, I think maybe combination sensitive? \n\nThank you for the advice!

I don’t think they are strong enough. I started using a cheap nylon brush from Target that works better.\n\nI need something with power behind it.

I am not opposed to it but its expensive af. Do yall think these spots will fade without professional intervention and I can just continue on my current routine? Of note I use Vitamin C, AHA, the Faded Topicals cream (which has TXA, niacinamide, kojic acid, and azelaic acid) and 0.005% tretinion (its a small concentration but its my first time using tret so my next bottle will be 0.02%).
