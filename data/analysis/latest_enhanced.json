I’m trying to achieve even 10% of what she has.\n\nI am currently on day 3 after washing. My current routine for this week was: I shampoo with moisturizing curl talk shampoo, then I do Mielle rosemary mint strengthening hair mask. Then I do 3-in-1 Curl Talk conditioner and don’t fully wash it out and squish in a bit to my ends before exiting the shower.\n\nThen I praying hands Pattern styling custard and drag it through a bit on top.  I then use them bounce curl clips while diffusing on warm setting for heat and low intensity with minimal movement to set the curls. I fluff out the roots after dry with the bounce curl volume comb. I scrunch in Ouai hair oil once dry.\n\nToday I sectioned my hair out while using tresemme keratin smooth weightless anti-frizz finishing spray at the roots and using the bounce curl volume comb diffusing where I sprayed after using the comb on low cold setting to set the spray.\n\nI’m pretty happy with the results, but looking for more tips if anyone has any? \n\nI may just need a hair cut. I just can’t seem the back to achieve the same volume at the back that I get around my face. At the side part it seems flat as well.  Amy other hair spray, how to cut the hair (I just cut my own hair how I feel like, so I’m not scared to try), or technique tips?\n\nI also want to understand how they do her lazy messy updo (see photo)??? I’m totally lost on how that is achieved.\n\n\n",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nSo normally I don’t post much, but wanted to drop this as a warning for anyone buying products purely on hype and regretting later.\n\nBack in September I got into fitness, and by December started protein supplements. My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily.\n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

I’ve been using 1 mg finasteride for 3 months, and I just started using the (cheap) Kirkland 5% minoxidil solution once a day.\n\nI started on the recommendation of a trichologist, and she did a baseline evaluation with a trichoscope.\n\nAll the vellus hairs you can see in the images are brand new—similar length, very tiny, but pigmented.\n\nThe images cover a 4 mm × 7.5 mm area (about 0.3 cm²). The white patches are residue from the cheap minoxidil/vehicle.\n\nI know these vellus hairs most likely won’t become terminal, but I’m impressed by how quickly minoxidil can push hairs into a growth phase and make them sprout so fast, seemingly all at the same time. It gives me hope it will positively impact my terminal hairs too (I’m currently around \\~30 follicular units per cm² on an NW7 pattern, with a lot of thin single-hair follicular units), so I can eventually go for a transplant.\n\nI’ll keep updating this.\n\nCheers.\n\n",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nSo normally I don’t post much, but wanted to drop this as a warning for anyone buying products purely on hype and regretting later.\n\nBack in September I got into fitness, and by December started protein supplements. My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily. \n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

I’m looking for a good, budget-friendly hair detangler that actually works on knotted, matted hair.\n\nI’m an ICU nurse, and unfortunately many of our patients receive little to no hair care during long stays. By the time they’re recovering, their hair is often badly matted and ends up getting cut , which feels unnecessary and avoidable.\n\nOur hospital doesn’t allow us to bring in outside hair products and only provides a basic plastic comb, so I’m planning to quietly stock a small “hair care stash” in my locker and cover the cost myself.\n\nI’m hoping for recommendations for the cheapest but most effective detangling spray or conditioner. I’m also buying brushes, hair ties, and silk caps, so I need to keep costs low (nurse budget 😅).\n\nThanks so much for any suggestions. I really appreciate it!",

I have acne (pretty much a new whitehead every day 🙄), so I’m assuming some type of moisturizer with acne fighting something?\n\nAlso the easiest way/product for cleansing?\n\nThan you all so much ❤️ (I’m working with my doctor to adjust my meds dose, so 🤞I can get myself feeling better soon)\n\nEdit to add: oily/combination skin, age 23, female (let me know if anything else is needed to help!)",

Recently I moved and went to a stylist in town, she assured me bleach isn’t damaging if done right. I gave her the opportunity to do what she thought would look good, she decided blonde highlights full foil. Once stepping out of the chair I had an extremely orange line across my hair line. I told her before I left the chair and she gave me toner to leave with and said it should help. I reached out and she did a root smudge and proceeded to tell me she’s never see this and told me I was overthinking my hair. She tried rebleaching it to get it out. I told her we can tone it way darker to hide it and she didn’t wanna make it less blonde. She told me she’s doing me a free service to help me. I’m noticing after 2 weeks the orange hue is coming back. I’ve NEVER had this happen with highlights. I affirmed her service and I honestly feel like it WAS NOT worth the price at all. ",

I’m 16 and I don’t wanna overcomplicate my skincare and cause more harm than good.\n\nMy current routine is first aid beauty cleanser every night, I use Paula’s choice bha 2-3x a week, then follow it up with beauty of joseon dynasty cream, on days I’m not using bha I use snail mucin before moisturizing, then every morning I go in with a skin 1004 sunscreen.\n\nI’d also like to mention that I’ve never really struggled with acne, I do struggle with dry skin and an overall dull complexion + hyperpigmentation around my mouth and eyes, my skin has been really red on the apples of my cheeks, chin and forehead for pretty much my whole life, and I also have some texture, primarily on my forehead. I used to have really bad black heads all over my face but the Paula’s choice really helped reduce them despite being inconsistent.\n\nAlso, my cleanser and moisturizer are almost finished (after months of inconsistently using them) and I don’t notice any improvements on my skin besides reducing blackheads (which I assume was done by the bha?) what would you recommend me to stop using / swap / stay the same?

So I was wondering if it's ok to put retinol on in the morning with a SPF moisturizer? I know everyone says to not apply retinol in the morning because it makes your skin sensitive to UV and that UV makes the retinol less effective; would the SPF on top negate any sensitivity? I also heard somewhere that leaving retinol on for like 20 minutes is just as effective for leaving it on overnight or something? Is this true? Because if I do apply it in the morning during my AM routine, I'm not leaving the house/out in the sun for at least another hour.",

This was my hair 2 days after being washed.\nMy routine is that I use Aveeno clarifying shampoo then Aussie hydrating shampoo, then I use As I Am hair cream, I section my hair and apply it, use a styling brush then use curlsmith hair gel (strong hold), I do that to all sections of my hair then air dry. I sleep with my hair tied up in a pineapple with a bonnet. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week. I tend to airdry rather than diffuse.\nI have dyed my hair a few months ago and find that it's affected my curl pattern which is looser, and my hair is more dry. Am I applying too much hair products? I've tried mousse and it doesn't make much of a difference, I don't add oil because it looks greasy, I have had people comment that it looks \"full of products\". \nI also struggle with my hair in the morning, the day after I wash it, when I take my hair down it doesn't naturally fall, just stays awkwardly all over the place so I end up tying it back because it looks terrible. But if I don't use a lot of products, it becomes so frizzy, and I don't have the patience to finger curl.\nWhat am I doing wrong?",

Mostly around my chin but also some on my forehead. I dont *think* its acne(??), just 2 or 3 really stubborn spots that keep popping up at a time. I'm also a skin picker when I'm stressed and they sadly tend to be the targets of it when I'm not paying attention so theyre often raw and take weeks to clear. (i know thats not good, Im trying to stop, its only when Im really not paying attention)\n\nI eat pretty healthy (current festive season aside) so I dont think diet is the issue. Ive never had to think much about the produts I use but my skin has been really frustrating me latley and making me feel so insecure so I just what to know is there anything I can add/change to help (preferably not super expensive or having to use like 30 products)\n\nMy ''routine'' at the minute is\n\n\\- Morning: wash face with just water, moisturise (cerave moisturising lotion) and suncream (biore uv aqua rich) I dont wear much makeup, just some mascara and drugstore consealer under my eyes\n\n\\-Night: wash face (Cerave foaming lotion), moisturise (cerave moisturising lotion)",
