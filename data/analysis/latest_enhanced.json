      "title": "Help me, my curls keeps falling flat ☹️",
      "content": "(Btw first picture is how my curls looked in the summer, second is how it looks now, and third is all the products i use. Oh and this isn’t my hair, i’m a hijabi so I can’t show my hair but this is very very similar to how my hair looks and looked)\n\nSo I have what I think are 3a curls. For my whole life, I just thought I had frizzy straight hair until people told me I should try a curl routine. Last summer, I finally tried curl cream and mousse. Surprise, surprise, it actually looked nice for the first time ever! I went down a total rabbit hole wanting to define my curls even more. Since my hair was down to my butt, I decided to get a layered cut to help with definition.\n\nI went to a hairstylist while on vacation in my home country. I only asked for a layered cut, but she ended up pressuring me to blow dry and straighten my hair. I caved and did it, even though it totally defeated the purpose of me going to the salon. When I got back and washed it, I expected my curls to bounce back, but they didn’t, they just stayed straight. I waited, thinking they’d come back, but fast forward seven months and my hair is still only slightly wavy and barely curly compared to how it was last summer.\n\nI don’t think it’s heat damage because my hair is still very soft, I get regular trims, and I haven't used heat since I was 10 years old until that one day. Before the cut, my hair was straight in length and I had plenty of bouncy ringlets. Even before my hair dried, the curls would be pretty prominent. Now that I have the U/V shape layers, it’s done the opposite of what I wanted. I have maybe 2 ringlets in the front of my shirt that falls flat as well after a few hours. I’ve been told by some people that it’s the cut, and by others that the salon straightening ruined my pattern.\n\nAt this point, I’m just trying to make my curls look good again. Whenever I style it, it looks okay ish right after I put products in, but after a few hours of air drying, it falls flat and looks more wavy than curly. I sleep in a bonnet using the pineapple method, but by the second or third day, it falls even flatter. By day four or five, it looks like 2a waves if I'm lucky. It’s so frustrating.\n\nFor my routine, I shampoo twice, use a hair mask for 20 minutes, and then the blue Skala conditioner. Out of the shower, I use the orange Skala leave in, curl cream, style with the Bounce Curl brush, and finish with mousse.\n\nBack in the summer when my hair looked best, I only used cream and mousse, no masks or leave ins. so I don't know if I'm weighing it down or if it's the lack of a diffuser and gel. My mom won't let me buy or use gel because she’s convinced it bad for your hair.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to make my hair hold its shape for more than a few hours? Thanks 🥹🙏",

      "title": "6 months post-HT in Turkey - Did my homework and saved $8k compared to US clinics, My comparison breakdown",
      "content": "Hey Tressless fam,\n\nLong-time lurker, finally ready to share my experience. I'm 6 months post-op from my hair transplant in Turkey and wanted to share my research process since I see a lot of questions about going abroad.\n\n**Background:** 28M, Norwood 3, been on fin for 2 years which stabilized things but wanted to address the temples. Got quotes from 3 US clinics ranging from $12k-$15k for \\~2500 grafts. That's when I started researching Turkey.\n\n**My Research Process:**\n\nI spent 3 months comparing options. Here's what I looked at:\n\n**Turkey Options I Researched:**\n\n* **Smile Hair Clinic (Istanbul)** \\- 4.9/5 on multiple platforms, 4900+ reviews\n* **Vega Hair Clinic (Antalya)** \\- Solid reputation, beach location was tempting\n* **MediHairs (Istanbul)** \\- Good reviews, slightly higher price\n* **ꓧеаꓲtһꓧор packages** \\- Found them through Reddit actually, they work with vetted clinics and handle all the logistics ([https://healthhop.com/hair-transplant-turkey-exclusive-package/](https://healthhop.com/hair-transplant-turkey-exclusive-package/))\n\n**What I compared:**\n\n* Surgeon credentials (this is CRITICAL - don't just go for cheapest)\n* Actual before/after photos (not stock images)\n* What's included (hotel, transfers, aftercare)\n* Technique (FUE vs DHI)\n* Reviews from multiple sources (Reddit, RealSelf, Google)\n\n**My Decision:**\n\nEnded up going through ꓧеаꓲtһꓧор's all-inclusive package ($2,700 vs their regular $3,300 - caught a promotion). Here's why:\n\n1. They pre-vetted the clinics (saved me anxiety)\n2. Everything coordinated - hotel, transfers, translator\n3. 24/7 support (used it twice, super helpful)\n4. Same surgeon did my entire procedure (some clinics use techs)\n\n**What was included:**\n\n* 3 nights at a legit 4-star hotel\n* All transportation (they picked me up at airport)\n* The actual procedure (\\~2800 grafts, they went higher than estimate)\n* Post-op kit and meds\n* Follow-up care\n\n**6 Month Results:**\n\nNot gonna lie, months 2-4 were rough (shock loss, ugly duckling phase). But now at 6 months I'm seeing real density. My hairline looks natural, not pluggy. Still have 6+ months of growth to go but already worth it.\n\n**Cost Breakdown:**\n\n* Turkey (ꓧеаꓲtһꓧор): $2,700 all-in\n* Flight: \\~$800\n* Extra expenses: \\~$300\n* **Total: \\~$3,800**\n\nvs US quote: $12,000+ (just the procedure, no hotel/travel included)\n\n**Saved: \\~$8,200**\n\n**Would I do it again?** 100% yes. But DO YOUR RESEARCH. Not all Turkish clinics are equal. Some are hair mills. I spent hours reading Tressless posts, checking doctor credentials, and comparing options.\n\nHappy to answer questions. Also still on fin (1mg daily) and added min to the routine post-op.\n\n**TL;DR:** Did extensive research, went with vetted Turkey clinic through medical tourism coordinator, saved $8k+ compared to US, 6 months in and results looking solid.",

Once they had a little natural length, I soaked them off, then got a gel manicure on the natural nail with some cute designs.\n\nIt’s been about a week and I already had three nails break/peel, several are cracking, and most are super bendy. I know one salon visit isn’t going to undo 25+ years of biting, but it honestly feels like the acrylic set and then gel set made already thin nails even weaker.\n\nI’m thinking I need to go back to basics: let them grow under regular polish and forgo enhancements for now. I’m going to the salon today to get plain polish, but I’d really like some advice on pre-treatments or strengthening routines I can do before or ask them to do first.\n\nSo I guess my questions are:\n\n• Any recommended brands or products (serums, oils, hardeners, etc.) that helped you?\n\n• Any salon-appropriate preps or in-chair treatments I can request?\n\n• Should I avoid certain salon services while building strength?\n\nIt’s discouraging to see progress and then have them snap off, so I want something that actually helps instead of just masking the problem.\n\nThanks in advance!",

It takes me like 3 hours to do my hair and it’s always a let down because it never comes out juicy. I’m currently growing out my keratin treatments for the first time in my 23 years of life. I have never dealt with my natural hair, I’ve gotten relaxers and keratin treatments my whole life. It’s impossible to deal with its always poofy, the front doesn’t curl its just a poof mess. I’ve tried miche gel and it works a but better than anything else but it still doesn’t help the front clump up and curl.\n\nMY ROUTINE: I don’t really use any curly hair shampoo and conditioner. I use whatever shampoo I find in the bathroom (ik tragic) and I skip conditioner and just go in with  Manuka Honey &amp; mafura oil Intensive hydration hair mask by shea moisture , I steam it with a steamer especially my roots. then I either use jamaican black castor oil strengthen and restore leave in conditioner by shea moisture . If I don’t style then I wait for my hair to air dry and put in a single braid. If I do style, I go in with miche gel in sections, focusing on the roots, and use a define brush. I have to force some type of curl in the front bc it just frizzes up and even when i force a curl it’s an extremely poofy curl in the front. In this particular pic I actually just twisted the fronts and when it dries I separate them a bit so they don’t look like just twists only in the front lol. Then I defuse and I make sure to focus on the roots first so they dry first before anything else. I have low porosity hair so even defusing it takes like an hour because it just takes forever to dry.  At night I use a silk bonnet, and silk scrunchy when i pineapple it.\n\nIdk how to refresh my hair without ruining it either lol so I literally just wet everything, brush it out with any conditioner (i dont have a specific curly conditioner) so i’ll just use the maracuja skala in the shower and rinse it out, and then do the miche gel steps again and defuse.\n\nI have two different curl patterns currently (thank u keratin treatments) so I just need help making the roots juicier and not as dry looking as I transition back to my natural hair. My mom is lowkey my biggest hater when it comes to my hair so I just want to prove her wrong that I can take care of it and I can make it look good.",

I think I might have combination skin.\n\nBefore switching cleansers, I was using the Cetaphil Gentle Foaming Cleanser for normal to dry skin. After washing my face, but before applying moisturizer, my cheeks and the lower half of my face would feel tight. I would then use CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion for normal to dry skin.\n\nA few weeks ago, I switched to the CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser for normal to dry skin because I thought it would help with the dryness and tightness. With this cleanser, my skin doesn’t feel tight after washing. However, I’ve noticed that it has caused many more small bumps on my forehead and has made my cheeks worse.\n\nI use all of these products at night. I originally followed this routine every night, then reduced it to every 2–3 days to see if that would make a difference, but the results were the same. I also live in the southeastern US, it’s very humid.\n\nAlso, not sure if this is relevant but I used to have eczema 6 years ago, it kinda went away on its own and I haven’t had a flare up since then.\n\n(2nd pic is my forehead btw)",

Haven’t touched it with anything since and cut my hair short as it grew out. Last cut was above my shoulder in April 2025.\n\nMy mom’s stylist said it would be more of an all over color than highlights and that we would have to work towards my goal. But my goal is only a bit lighter than what I was able to get when I first bleached my hair.\n\nAny advice or suggestions? Especially with other stylists in the 757 so I can compare quotes as well?",

I have fairly dry/damaged hair due to all the styling I did before, and live in a very dry climate. I feel like I have a fairly good wash day routine going, as I'm always happy with the look and feel of my hair after wash day. However, the morning after I wash it, my hair seems to have lost most of it's volume, and kind of mushed together if that makes sense. What can I do to fix this? Routine/care below, thank ya'll!: \n\nShampoo with camille rose black castor oil shampoo, then follow with Camille rose black castor oil deep conditioner for 20 mins. Rinse that out, then apply a small amount of Camille rose black castor oil +chebe buttercream as a leave in on wet hair. After that, I scrunch in camille rose curl maker gel and spiked honey mousse, and diffuse. Then, I break the cast with an oil, usually the cocoa nibs and honey oil from the same brand. I sleep in a bonnet, and refresh my hair when needed in the morning with the camille rose honey dew liquid moisture refresher. I usually wash my hair every other day, sometimes every 2 days.",

So first we treated the acne now acne is gone. She Told me to apply some tropical like nicinamide and retinol serum because as per my dermatologist i have hyperpigmentation , so I have been using nicinamide for quite some time now, like it's been eight months. yet I still feel that my face has been burned and there are no such changes in my skin texture tone. So recently I visited my dermatologist again after seven months, so she said that I have a lot of acne  scars. That is why this problem is looking more dominant and again, she suggested me to use retinol and asked me to done have some procedures done like micro needling  and chemical peels and also said only applying topical will not help me. I should go for some chemical treatment as well.\n\nShould I change my dermatologist and consult someone else? Or stick to this one and apply the topicals like retinol and nicinamide which are prescribed and i also use sunscreen daily .\n\nMy primary goal is to have an even skin texture and tone, like I want my face skin tone to be somewhat similar to my natural skin, which is on my chest and other body parts.\n\nSuggest me what should i do!",

I recently started skincare routine and I feel super beginner cause I never really did anything to my face, I was one of those that had a mother not that much into all the beauty things.I got sebaceous filaments that always made me self conscious. And always thought I had a TON of blackheads. That is why I started. I do have oily skin kinda sensitive.\n\nSo, I started with basic routine of double cleansing at night, and moisturizer at night and at the morning. Lighter routine since my skin never tried none of this. But my skin feels... Soft? But specially in the nose kinda oily? I don't know how to put it. It's not that oily that I felt before, maybe more greasy? So, I have no experience and here I am, asking if that is normal or maybe I look up to try other products.\n\nFor information, I started like a week ago. Maybe this is normal in the beginning, I dunno, any help is appreciated since I'm a nearly 30 y.o learning recently about skincare",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I’m 29 F, 8 months pp. I’ve had periorbital dermatitis/eyelid eczema since my mid 20s that was quite responsive to elidel. Over the last month or so, my flare up got quite bad and it didn’t respond to elidel. Likely flare is the dry and cold air where I live. My doctor prescribed me eurisca which cleared it up in 2 days (yay!), however these spots under my eyes have remained. I thought at first that this was maybe an extension of my eyelid eczema, but now I’m not sure if it’s milia or clogged pores due to me overplaying Vaseline and aquafor over the last month? What’re your thoughts? It takes a minimum of 3 months to get a derm referral where I live so thought I’d give this a shot. Thanks in advance!",
