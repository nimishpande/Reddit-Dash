I found this routine on tiktok, usually they don't go well but this one made me feel so great about my hair. I did use a hair mask on this specific day, it was Camille Rose cocoa and mango butter mask.\n\nI then sectioned my hair into 3 sections, went through the first section with a small amount of curl cream, then with the bounce Curl brush, I applied mousse after and then gel (still in that first section) after I did that , I proceeded to dry that section.\n\nAfter the first section I rinsed and repeated the above for the next section, and then once again repeated for the last top section. I found it cut down on drying time because the sections were smaller. Maybe each section took no more than 5 minutes to dry. Also easier on the neck and able to achieve volume easier. It sounds like a lot but I promise it was easier than plopping you head over for an eternity.\n\nThis will be my permanent routine as long as it continues to do me right. I am pretty excited. \n\nI wash my hair twice a week only. Rest of the time I just let her do her thing. If it looks too bad then I will put her up, but I find",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Which I'm not sure how exactly.\n\nIn past, I went to Dermtologist (around 2017), that time She recommended me Facewash and Clindamycin with tretinoin. And that worked amazingly. Took around 3-4 months and after that my skin had no pimples. But after that I stopped caring and I did not any products for 2 years and then I used same combo 1 more time and it worked again. But after that i stopped and never used the same cream in a fear that this on-&amp;-off use might result antibiotic resistance. After a 5-6 months when I stopped the skincare routine and started to getting acne again. after a year or so I got very big lumps of dried sebum under my skin which I pinched with hand and made it worse. Ultimately I stopped looking in the mirror coz my skin was really bad.\n\nBut last year I decided to try to correct that. Felt impossible but tried with simple face wash and moisturizer but results were very minimal but in July 2025, I started using Adapalene regularly and it worked. Skin is much better, smooth, bumpiness is way-way lower on my nose than before, but BIG PORES STILL EXIST which I'm not sure what how to correct.\n\nPlease give suggestions. Should I continue with Adapalene or Try Tretinoin?\n\nHow to reduce Pores and its size, on my nose?\n\nHow to correct the parts near nose as they are very darkened and rough.\n\nPlease suggest Decent less expensive Sunscreen for sweaty person (which does not stains the cloths, (2 ruined my cloths)).\n\nThank You!",

I started using CeraVe moisturizing face wash (the green one) along with Vanicream moisturizing lotion (in the little tube, not the blue jar). It cleared up my acne for the most part, but left me with really odd pigmentation and blackheads EVERYWHERE (especially in between my eyebrows and on my nose) — I’m still dealing with acne on my forehead as well. I’ve noticed my pores, especially around the inner corner of my eye / the outside of my nose, appear a lot larger than they used to.\n\nI literally almost prefer the cystic acne to this. The red spots drive me insane and the blackheads just do not go away. Recently I’ve been using the Paula’s Choice 2% BHA toner 2 or 3 times a week, but it feels like it’s doing more harm than good.\n\nCan anyone help me or give me product recommendations? I’m open to things like getting a chemical peel and whatnot too. I am just so over this, a year and a half ago my skin was pretty much perfect.\n\nAlso, I still use the CeraVe and Vanicream duo twice daily. Other than the Paula’s Choice every now and then, that’s all I use. Thank you so much in advance for any advice.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

However, every affordable product seems to have people on reddit talking about how they suddenly started losing hair with it after some time. Perhaps this was from overuse of the product, but still I wanted to ask, does anyone know of a product that's good to them and doesn't seem to cause spontaneous hair loss? And if you think everything I just said is a load of BS, then please at least recommend me a good shampoo for someone who wants to keep his hair for a while, even if genetics wants to steal it away from him.\n\nSome notes: I do NOT want to take hair growth meds like finasteride/minoxidil, I don't like that I'm losing hair but I don't want to be doing allat (I'd rather go bald atp, no offense to those taking it), so please don't do the reddit thing by recommending me some medical treatment.

      "content": "Want to share my personal experience with Myntra Support for all folks to be aware. For context, I've been buying from Myntra for many years and even part of their Insiders program.\n\n  \nMy pre-paid order from Myntra was supposed to be delivered 2 weeks ago. They initially sent me a wrong product. To my surprise, their app had no option to return it so I had to fight with the customer executive to raise an exchange request (which is already hard to reach because of their dumb chatbot).\n\n\n\nThey sent me the same wrong product again a week later. Now they're saying the product doesn't have a return policy so they can't process any refund, nor are they responding to any requests for a return.\n\n  \nI ultimately had no choice but to complaint to Consumer Helpline but the Myntra team immediately lied there as well and closed the ticket saying they already did the exchange. What's the point of an exchange if you're just going to send something useless again?\n\n  \nI understand this could be a scam from the seller itself that keeps sending users the wrong product but I'm extremely disappointed at how Myntra chooses to handle such requests and further refuse to refund any money or take back the wrong product I haven't even opened.\n\n  \nPlease be cautious when spending big amounts on Myntra. I'm glad it was approx Rs. 500 order I can forget as a reminder to never use Myntra again but if it was a big amount I'd have been mentally exhausted with how useless their customer support is.",

Bangs are already a bitch to grow out I don't wanna use too much. My hair was about 4-5x thicker than this till a lot fell out from stress several years ago. It started growing back 3-4 years ago but extremely slow until the last year or two. Probably in combination with poorly managed type 1 diabetes, lack of water, lack of sleep and stress. Yes I'm a walking depressed zombie ahahah.\nRoutine includes pretty curl girl strong hold. I don't like mousse and it doesn't gove me hold or volune. I diffuse with head tilted down and the hair in the bowl pushing up. Should I clip it instead? What kind of clips? I fingercurl them in big clumps but they never stay big and they divide funny and you can see my scalp a little on one side. Not sure what. It's not how it was when it was cut lol. My hair turns out how i want other than the bangs despite any product I use. Could just be how my hair is.",

      "content": "I've struggled with acne on and off for several years now, but over the past couple of years I seem to have developed some sort of lingering acne/texture on my forehead. Some of it seems to be in the form of closed comedones, and the texture of the skin is bad as well.\n\nI currently use tazarotene and azelaic acid as the only actives in my routine, a cetaphil gentle cleanser, sunscreen(boj/skin1004), barrier repair moisturizer (aestura and atoderm) and oil cleanser occasionally.\nI used tretinoin before and faced the same issue.\n\nThough right now I'm going through a little bit of a purge due to increasing taz concentration, apart from the active acne on my forehead, it's usually what it looks like.\nI have used a lot of different products and actives in my routine and the one thing that's stayed the same is my forehead, even when the rest of my skin was good, and I'm not sure how to fix it for good. I have seb derm in my scalp, though I'm not sure if its related.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with similar issues before and has any suggestions or advice it'd be much appreciated. I think l've covered everything here but may make an edit if i can add more context. Thank you!",

      "content": "I have an oily skin. I had acne during my entire college duration and with time it cleared up with clindamycin + nicotinamide gel and a simple facewash. My skin stayed good since last year until now.\n\nBut recently I suddenly broke out again and I have no idea why. Sharing pics in the post. I visited a government hospital dermatologist and got this prescription. You can ignore the hairfall and dandruff meds for now. I mainly need help understanding if this treatment looks okay. I have been on these medicines for around two to three weeks, not much improvements.\n\n**Medicines for acne**\n\n1. **Doxycycline 100 mg**\n2. **Isotretinoin 10 mg**\n3. **Fluconazole 150 mg**\n4. **Vitamin C 500 mg**\n5. **Vitamin B Complex**\n6. **Karehair Plus**\n7. **Levocetirizine 5 mg**\n8. **Calcium Gluconate + D3**\n\n**Topicals**\n\n1. **Clotrimazole lotion for scalp**\n2. **Texglow gel (Clindamycin + Nicotinamide)**\n3. **Clinstar (Nicotinamide plus salicylic acid) Facewash**\n4. **Ketoconazole shampoo**\n\nWould appreciate any advice on whether this routine looks right, what to expect, or if I should adjust anything. Should i visit another Dermat? How much time it may take to heal my skin? I’m mainly worried because the acne came back suddenly even though nothing changed in my routine.\n\nThanks.",

My hair is too thick for a bore bristle brush.\n\nMy hair always dries really kinky/has bends after i airdry it, and fluffs up. No matter how much moisture i put into it, it always frizzes up! I barely use heat btw! So it cant be super damaged i think?\n\nHas anybody got similar hair or overcome this issue?\n\nI was so sure my hair was straight, but now I'm wondering if it may be a little wavy and I'm doing the wrong routine?😅\n",

Started with just gentle cleanser and moisturizer or just rinsing in morning and it didnt help my acne at all. benzoyl peroxide has helped significantly so would like to keep that.\n",
