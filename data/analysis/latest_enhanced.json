      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "In south of Iran, we like to use ziziphus powder as a facial cleanser or a face mask, and we also use it as a shampoo substitute or as a hair mask and many uses. I love the ziziphus mask, and whenever I see my curls looking messy, I immediately make it. First, my scalp gets cleaned and it removes dan- druff and fun-gi from the hair and scalp. I have sebo-derm, and I feel like it soothes my scalp and reduce the problems. I'd be lying if I said it gets rid of it 100%. It does calm it down and might remove it, but it eventually comes back. I use it once every two weeks❤️\n\nRoutine: I washed my hair with water only then I mix 6tbsp of Ziziphus, 3tbsp Amla powder ,4tbsp Aloe Vera powder, brahmi powder 5tbsp, Bhrjintaj 5tbsp, 4tbsp of Shikakai powder I mixed all these with hibiscus tea. I waited 30m till I saw ziziphus bubbles spread everywhere. U should leave it 30m so the ziziphus becomes more effective 👍🏻. I put 2 drops of Indonesian Cajeput essential oil, after 30m I put the mask on my wet hair then I cover my hair very well and leave it for 15m then I washed it only with co wash I used the co wash 3 times to make sure my hair is clean and no ziziphus stuck in my hair.\n\n\nStyling products: Inhasi leave in spray frangece free, Lola From Rio gel, brush with bounce curl volume brush and diffuse with Dyson Nural. \nHave u ever tried a ziziphus in ur hair or face? Let me know what was ur experience 😍",

It’s lightweight, absorbs quickly, and never feels greasy, which makes it great for daily use or under makeup. It’s gentle and affordable, so it’s one of those products you don’t feel bad slathering on. The downside is that it’s not super rich, so in colder weather it might not be enough on its own, and it definitely doesn’t help with oil control if you’re on the oilier side. But here’s what surprised me the most: whenever my skin suddenly gets red or irritated, I put two or three pumps on at night as a thick layer and seal it with Vaseline. Every time I do this, I wake up with the redness noticeably reduced. So overall, it’s a reliable, no-drama moisturizer that works well for everyday hydration, even if you might need something heavier for extreme dryness.",

      "title": "[Review] Tried Cardi B’s full K-beauty lineup (Fully &gt; Anua &gt; Mixsoon &gt; Missha) and here are my thoughts",
      "content": "I'm obsessed with Cardi B so whenever she posts about her skincare favs, I am sat! She recently posted about Fully, so I thought l'd try out her whole line up and share my honest reviews.\n\nFrom what l've gathered, her routine goes like this:\n1. Fully Green Tomato Clay Mask Cleanser\n2. Anua Niacinamide 10 TXA 4 Serum for Brightening and Dark Spots\n3. Mixsoon Bean Essence\n4. Missha Perfect Cover Serum BB Cream\n\nQuick about me:\nI'm 33 (just like our queen), with combination skin, oily nose, dry cheeks and forehead, and I use retinoids a few nights a week. I try to keep my routine short and sweet, so I only reach for products that are doing the most.\n\nMy experience:\nFully Green Tomato Clay Mask Cleanser: Starting off strong, this was my first time trying Fully and I was pleasantly surprised. Normally I hear clay mask, and run for the hills with my dry skin, but not this time. I loveddd the texture, it's super lightweight, and dries down so fast. I was nervous about it stripping my natural skin barrier, but it didn't at all. It can be used as both a mask and a cleanser, and I can really see myself reaching for this product as a cleanser. After one use, my pores felt clean and less congested, my blackheads cleared out, and my skin looked brighter, without sacrificing hydration. While it's no miracle product, it left my skin feeling clear and smooth, and I'd say it's definitely barrier friendly. Makes me excited to try out more products from Fully!\n\nAnua Niacinamide 10 TXA 4 Serum for Brightening and Dark Spots: Full transparency, I've actually used this one before. I went through a phase where l'd get acne on the sides of my face every time my period showed up so I would use this afterwards to clear up those acne marks. While I do like it, and I agree that it does exactly what it says it does, it takes time, so be prepared to be consistent with it for a while before you see results. I stopped using it, bc I've found other products I prefer for my skin type, so I switched it out for the Numbuzin No.5+ Glutathione Vitamin Concentrated Serum, but thennnn I started on tretinoin and now don't have acne flare ups, so I don't prioritize dark spot correctors. That said, I did try it again for the sake of trying Cardi's full routine, and my skin is nice and bright afterwards. I think it would be great for someone with dark spots that needs brightening, but I also think Numbuzin and CosRx have products that are just as good if not better. So, no complaints, but not going out of my way for it. It is a good price point though!\n\nMixsoon Bean Essence: I've been using this product for a while now and it's my daily go to, so this will be biased. I usually switch off between this Mixsoon Bean Essence and the Aestura Hydro Essence. I really love how moisturizing it is, my skin always feels so hydrated and glowy afterwards. And my tone is more even. The texture was a little off putting at first, as it is a bit tackier than other essences l've tried, but once I got past that and saw the results, I was sold!\n\nMissha Perfect Cover Serum BB Cream: This was my first time using this product, and I got the shade Warm Beige No. 25. I don't normally wear a full face of makeup, so a BB cream is right up my alley. First impressions, it's super lightweight and feels great to wear all day, and has decent coverage for a BB cream, and blends out so easily. It feels very nourishing on, like mixing a serum with a lightweight foundation. It delivers exactly what it says! And I can really see myself reaching for this on days I want to wear a little more makeup. It's perfect for the no-makeup makeup look.\n\nTLDR: Cardi B is spittin FACTS! All her \"most loved\" products really stand up to the hype imo, and are worth trying out. Of course, all skin is different, so there are some I liked more than others, but I'm excited to keep using the Fully Green Tomato Mask and the Missha BB Cream!\n\nIf anyone knows of other products she loves, leave them in the comments, I'd love to try them!",

Cystic acne, especially on my forehead and also whiteheads and blackheads everywhere.  Cystic acne on my nose, my chin, my jawline, my temples, you name it.  It seems to come and go, which to me might imply that it’s hormonal.  I don’t have perimenopause as far as I know, my hormone tests came out normal.  It could also be the moisturizer or foundation im using, or maybe it’s my diet or the awful water quality here or the dry environment.  Really no idea!  I started using the Fresh Rose hyadraulic acid moisturizer around the same time my acne exploded, could that cause it?  \nI also have an IUD but it’s not hormonal. \n\nI just don’t know what to do and the Dermatologist hasn’t been helpful here. I’ve been on Accutane and I’ve done antibiotics. I’ve done all the medicated creams. Nothing has stuck or worked other than the Accutane for a few years and then it just went back to frequent  breakouts. I’m so frustrated. Does anyone have any thoughts on how to determine what is causing it? Any thoughts on what could be causing it? Any help would be welcome thanks.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
