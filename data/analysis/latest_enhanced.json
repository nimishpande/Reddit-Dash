      "content": "For starts i’ve been told by POC and by red heads that my hair is curly and that i just don’t take care of it right. Here is my hair routine for some background. \nI wash my every 2-4 days. \nI always wash with Hairitage Shampoo. I will either use Native or Hairitage conditioner. \nWith shampoo i massage it into my scalp with a scalp massager and my nails to hopefully stimulate hair growth. \nWith conditioner i put it all over my hair. I use my fingers to brush the conditioner form scalp to ends to help detangle it and then i let it sit for a few minutes. (i have heard back and fourth in weather or not to use conditioner on your scalp but when i started to use it on my scalp i saw benefits) \nWhen im out of the shower i let it sit in a towel for 5-10 min and then take it down to air dry. \nAt night i sleep with a silk pillowcase. \nI dont use heat on my hair except maybe once every 6 months. I have added a picture of my hair after it’s already been brushed. i forgot to take a picture pre brush. im sorry. \nWhen i do brush my hair it turns into a massive frizzy mess. it truely looks like a rats nest. Before i brush i can see individual curls and curl pattern but its very obvious needs to be brushed so i do brush it. No matter what anti frizz product ive tried or how much i brush it always looks bad. PLEASEE HELP \nSo long story short: Is my hair actually curly? If it is… what can i do for my specific hair? i’m at a loss. ",

He prescribed me the following treatment (he only asked whether I go outside or not, and I told him that I don’t. He didn’t mention applying sunscreen) :\n\n1. Benzoyl peroxide gel – He told me to apply it daily in the morning on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer.\n(He didn’t suggest any moisturizer; I’m using the Minimalist Vitamin B5 moisturizer)\n\n2. Tretinoin gel 0.025% – He told me to apply this in the evening around 6–7 pm on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer.\n\n3. Vitamin C serum – He told me to apply this at night after washing my face (he didn’t mention applying a moisturizer after it)\n\n4. He also gave me tablets, which I have to take once daily for 30 days\n\nToday is my second day of following this routine, and my skin feels itchy, looks reddish and I’m noticing more acne/bumps.\n\nIs this normal?

      "content": "[Routine Help] \n\nHello everyone, I had a nasty pimple and did my usual washcloth exfoliation on the pimple, but when I got out of the shower I noticed how red and inflamed it was. I didn’t exfoliate hard, but I use a prescription benzoyl peroxide wash, and a differin retinol, I use glycolic acid after I get out of the shower, and use neutragenas “stubborn texture” face wash, which includes a small amount of glycolic acid alongside salicylic acid.\n\nIt burned like a bitch when I put my benzoyl cream on after my shower, but the retinol didn’t hurt. Like I genuinely yelped it hurt so bad. I use cetaphil lotion on my face usually, and even that burned so so bad. The only thing that stopped the burning was the topical mupirocin, but i know that can build an antibiotic resistance, and that’s not good for me, or any of us in the long run.\n\nI’ve struggled with my skin for years, I just moved into a new house and I think it’s got some mould problems, causing acne, causing me to overdo my skincare routine. I have ocd so having pimples really stresses me out, and I just pick them until they’re “gone” and I have a gash. So I don’t want to pause my skincare routine while this heals.\n\nI have a otc topical to help treat infections and inflammation, taro-mupirocin, and it really helped me out when I put it on last night, my whole cheek was red and burning, and now it’s only on my inner cheek, I can link a picture if needed, I don’t even know if this post will go through. \n\nAny tips to keep my acne away, skin moisturized, but also doesn’t strip my skin of its barrier like I keep doing? I know it’s not healthy &amp; I want to fix it, but my ocd makes me want to scrub and pick and scrub and pick again.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "I don't know why this is happening! I've had mild chest acne before only at the sternum when I was around 13-15, and it eventually cleared away after I started properly exfoliating, turns out it was just oil and dead skin build up, and sharing the same washcloth as my family AND hair conditioner run down. It's never been like this though :( it's getting worse as the days on, it's getting lower to my breasts which has never happened before, and frankly I'm just feeling really gross and generally ugly. \n\nThings I can think of: \n\n\\- Recently switched from pink/rose dove soap to Irish Spring. Thought Irish Sprint was the problem, switched again to Dove soap unscented, no difference. \n\n\\- Come from a traditional South Asian family where we all share the same washcloth, previously had terrible acne because of this. I use my own now, I thought maybe the heathens used mine because I left it in the shower, washed and laundried it, no difference. \n\n\\- Recently started using a deodorant spray, thought maybe that was the issue. Stopped using it, no difference!🫠 \n\nThings I can't think of: \n\n\\- How to make this stoppp😭\n\nHelp",

      "content": "Thanks in advance to all you beautiful people reading this. Been growing my hair out recently and trying a variety of different things to help establish a curl pattern. I have super tight curls in the back/ very bottom of my hair line so I know it can happen! But I’m getting discouraged as even when trying products and methods my hair rarely looks good.\n\n**I swim 3x a week and use a shampoo that removes chlorine in addition to the pictured products. I know some people don’t wash their hair as often, that is not an option for me since I need to get that chlorine out! I live in the Midwest so it’s cold and dry out right now as well but tbh my hair is always frizzy no matter the weather.\n\nFirst pic is minimal maintiance- I use the chlorine shampoo, pictured shampoo(focus on roots) conditioner (focus on non-roots), barely rinse that out after a few minutes and then spay pictured leave-in and wrap in microfiber towel for 10-15 minutes then hair dry. I usually shower at night (I swim after work then hop in the shower right after) so to preserve my hair I have tried using a silk bonnet. I don’t use it every time right now maybe 1-2/week. \n\nSecond pic is adding in more steps- same shampoo/conditioner routine in the shower and using a wet brush to get the leave in (and adding in hair milk- little black botttle) evenly distributed in my hair. After taking out of the towel I put some mousse (not pictured but it’s Aussie brand) and scrunch that in, then use a dryer with diffuser to form curls (which always seems to result in a MESS) with warm heat low power. I don’t aim to get it fully dry with that, but after it’s like 90% dry I see the frizz is coming back and use some oil (clear bottle) on top\nof my head where the frizz is the worst. Of course that doesn’t really seem to help after 10 minutes the frizz returns.\n\nI know this shampoo/conditioner is not really helping but at this point I think I am needing help with the technique/ putting the steps in the right order. This is the first time I have really tried putting effort into my hair so very new, thanks again to anyone willing to give some advice and help me turn this around! ",

I did not have any issues using my skincare products before I had to change my hormonal medication (for endometriosis). The medication has caused my skin to be even drier than before. It is also very flaky, sensitive and uneven now. Almost all my skin products has started to cause burning sensation on my skin. The sensation doesn't last long, only a few minutes but it is intense. I'm so frustrated and don't feel like using more money than I already have to change all of my products so my possibly stupid question is can I keep using them? Any idea what is causing the burning sensation? I am also open to product suggestions. I'm located in EU (if that matters) and do not have that much money to spend.\n\nRight now I'm using Lumene Hellä toner, Lumene Nordic Hydra Aqua serum or Corx Snail Mucin Essence (which is the only thing that doesn't burn but I ran out of it for now) and then CeraVe moisturizing cream which I absolutely LOVED but now it has started to burn also.\n\nI am no expert in skincare, I actually only recently started using more skincare products than just soap and random moisturizers. I chose these products because they used to make my skin feel and look good. Now I don't know what to do.",

Maybe grease gives my hair hold 🤣 I think I have medium everything hair, eg porosity. \n\nRoutine: \nShampoo: currently Aussie Bouncy curls (Not Your Mother etc seem to flatten my curls - too heavy - but not set on the Aussie yet as it has sulfates)\nConditioner: Aussie 3 minute miracle (love love love this)\nLeave In (on the ends): A random aussie one again \nCurl crème: Only Curls hydrating curl cream \nGel (followed up with bounce brush): Eco style olive oil \nEither air dry / hover diffuse with a dyson after a quick plop. I will scrunch some V05 high volume mousse in once it is a little more dry. \nI tend to clip up my roots in a claw clip and then use some volumising hair spray for szush. \n\nI refresh with water, then the Only Curls curl crème and strong hold gel (trying to use everything up). I sleep with a silk bonnet and a pineapple underneath with a silk scrunchie).\n\nPicture is day 5 curls I think with multiple refreshes. First day is way poofier frizz and zero hold - despite all the product :( Do I just need more product from the start? Maybe different shampoo?  \n",

      "content": "Hi all! I’m curious if anyone has noticed something similar.\n\nI’ve had adult hormonal-pattern acne (chin/jawline and lower cheeks) for seven years. What’s weird is that when I spend extended time in certain places, (usually it's the west coast of the U.S.) my skin clears almost completely; without ever changing my skincare routine, makeup, or medications. When I return home, the acne reliably comes back.\n\nThe biggest difference I can identify is seems to be water quality and climate. Where my acne is worse, the water is very hard and the air is dry. Where my skin clears, the water is softer, humidity is higher, and air quality seems better overall. This has made me wonder whether hard water/mineral content might be exacerbating inflammation and making hormonal acne harder to control. \n\nI use a very gentle routine (Vanicream cleanser, minimal actives, tret only every few days, no over-exfoliation), which is why the environmental difference feels so striking. I don't feel like I'm changing my diet or other factors dramatically enough that they might impact my hormones, but maybe I'm just really unsure. I also have suspected PCOS, so I know my skin may be more reactive to inflammatory triggers even though the acne pattern itself is hormonal.\n\nI’m not looking for a diagnosis just wondering:\n\n* Has anyone else noticed their acne improve or worsen depending on water quality or climate?\n* Has anyone had success trying to emulate water conditions from their travels back at home? (I live in an apartment and this just seems tricky to do effectively)\n* Did shower or faucet filters help at all?\n\nI’d love to hear if others have experienced this or found anything helpful. Thanks in advance!!!",

I started double cleansing with vanicream/Prequel SA cleanser, and it felt... fine? I definitely still had breakouts but everything seemed chill, and the Prequel cleanser is super high in glycerin so I kept using it in hopes it would continually improve my skin. I would pat dry with a towel and follow that up with Cerave hydrating toner, and then apply some Cerave moisturizing lotion and then layer on some Cerave intensive moisturizing lotion (the one with urea). It sounds like a lot, but my skin always felt so parched that this felt necessary; however, I ran out of the vanicream face wash and thought I could level up to a more 'intense' cleanser, so I grabbed the cosrx low pH good morning cleanser. simultaneously, I tried to stop towel drying my face and just let it air dry before applying moisturizer (still the Cerave stuff) onto damp skin to try to get as much water as I could into my skin. All hell broke loose here. I don't know what happened, but applying the moisturizer on air-dried, damp skin made my face go BEET red and get super hot and inflamed (I wish I had pictures, but sadly I do not). So then I reevaluate after like two days of doing this twice a day, and I repurchase the vanicream face wash, vanicream moisturizing lotion, and I pick up The Ordinary skin smoothing and barrier repair serum. I've been using the vanicream/Ordinary stuff for a few days now but my skin is still getting a little irritated ONLY when I put on moisturizer? I've started waiting around 10 minutes after applying the serum to moisturize, and this seems to help. But still, even if I apply aquaphor at night (which used to let me wake up to baby-soft skin), my cheeks feel rough and are still a bit red in the morning. it's just so bizarre. do y'all have any tips or experience with this? I don't understand how I could've screwed my skin up so much in the span of, like, two days. also also, if aquaphor is basically the only thing that feels 'good' on my skin right now, how could I wear it throughout the day? I'm definitely foregoing makeup right now but I hate the greasy feel/look of an aquaphor-slathered face out and about, especially on top of the fact that applying sunscreen over aquaphor feels super gross... anywho I've rambled for too long, thank you in advance for any replies!! &lt;3",

      "title": "FUE transplant questions: doctor involvement + finasteride confusion",
      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently in the middle of my first hair transplant and wanted to get some perspective from people with experience.\n\nI’m 24 years old and undergoing a 2-day FUE procedure with 4,000+ grafts. Day 1 is done and took around 9 hours. The clinic is PADRA.\n\nI have two main questions.\n\n1) Doctor involvement during the procedure\n\nThis is how the procedure has been handled so far:\n\n- A doctor administered local anesthesia at the beginning.\n\n- After that, most of the hands-on work was done by a technician or nurse.\n\n- This included graft extraction, incisions, and implantation.\n\n- Another staff member occasionally helped with graft sorting.\n\n- The hairline design was done by a nurse, and my first impression of the design is good.\n\n- The doctor mainly supervised and was not hands-on for most of the session.\n\nBefore this, I consulted reputed clinics in India, and I received different explanations across clinics:\n\n- Some clinics said the doctor is heavily involved and personally performs most of the procedure, staying hands-on for a large part of the transplant.\n\n- Other clinics said the doctor mainly does the hairline design and incisions, while technicians handle extraction and implantation under the doctor’s supervision.\n\nBecause of this, I’m trying to understand what’s actually normal.\n\nQuestion:\n\nIn well-known or highly reputed clinics, especially for large FUE sessions that take many hours, which approach is more common?\n\nIs it normal for technicians to do most of the work under supervision, or do top clinics usually have doctors hands-on throughout?\n\n2) Post-transplant medication advice and conflicting opinions\n\nMy second concern is about medication.\n\nWhen I was around 20, I was using finasteride and topical minoxidil for less than a year. During that time, my hair was actually getting better. \n\nAfter that, I got a second opinion and was told to stop both medications.\n\nThe reasons given to me at the time were mainly about side effects. \n\n- People generally know what the concerns around finasteride are, and I was told it wasn’t a good idea for me to continue at that age. \n\n- I was also advised to stop minoxidil. Based on this, I was told to stop everything, stay off medication, and wait until around 25, then reassess and think about a transplant.\n\nI followed that advice and stayed off all medication for about 3-3.5 years.\n\nLooking back now, I do regret going with that option, especially because I had seen improvement before stopping.\n\nMore recently, when I started caring about my hair again and consulting clinics at 24, I received completely opposite advice. \n\nI was told to restart medication, and specifically to take both finasteride and minoxidil orally. \n\nThe reasoning given this time was that even my donor area is genetically affected, with thinning and miniaturization, and that medication was needed to stabilize my hair loss and improve donor strength.\n\nI was also told that this would be a long-term thing, including after a hair transplant.\n\nI followed this advice, restarted both medications orally, and stayed on them for about 6 months before surgery.\n\nNow, after starting the transplant, the current doctor has advised me to:\n\n- Stop finasteride\n- Use topical minoxidil only\n\nSo at this point, I’ve been told to stop, restart, and now stop again, all at different stages.\n\nMy concern isn’t really about the transplant itself. It’s about not wanting to lose the hair I’m transplanting or go through the same cycle again, where things improve and then worsen because I stopped medication.\n\nQuestion:\n\nAfter a hair transplant at 24, is it common to stop finasteride and stay only on topical minoxidil, or does that usually increase the risk of losing transplanted or existing hair over time?\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing from people who’ve been through similar situations or who understand how this is usually handled.\n\nThanks.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n24M, mid first FUE transplant (4,000+ grafts over 2 days). Some reputed clinics say doctors are hands-on for most of the procedure, others say doctors mainly do design/incisions while technicians handle the rest under supervision. Which is actually standard in top clinics?\nSecond, I used finasteride and minoxidil in my early 20s, stopped after a second opinion, regret stopping, then restarted both orally on advice due to donor thinning, and now I’m being told to stop finasteride again. After a transplant at my age, is staying only on topical minoxidil common, or does it risk losing transplanted or existing hair?",
