      "content": "Chemist at Play Underarm Roll On:\n\nMy absolute favourite super gentle, absorbs fast, and actually helps with both odour control and underarm darkness over time. no burning, no sticky mess, no weird white residue. I use it after showering and I’m good for the entire day. \n\nEasily a 10/10 WRP!!\n\nNivea Pearl &amp; Beauty Roll On:\n\nVery average. It was the first one i used (canon event). formula feels slightly sticky for the first few minutes. No sweat control, it just mixes the smell with the deo’s. And no visible brightening. \n\n6/10 WNRP because there are better options now.\n\nRexona Shower Fresh Roll On:\n\ndecent for odour control but way too strong for sensitive skin gave me a slight burning sensation especially on freshly shaved days. works if you need something heavy, but it’s definitely not gentle. \n\n7.5/10 WNRP for me personally cause i have too sensitive skin.",

Then total burning sensation. I realized that i pumped three full shots of Minox into my throat. Oh boy. What a terrible, terrible taste. And you can imagine that it really didn't help with the coughing... Immediate thoughts of how dangerous this could be, but i drank a lot of water out of the sink to get rid of the taste and to thin the Minox in my stomach... Almost threw up... What an evening. Now my head feels warm and i have a terrible taste in my mouth. But i am also richer in experience.\n\nDon't make the same mistake as me.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I have 3B hair, and shower on about every 3-5 days, sometimes more.\n\n**How much hair is this, and is it a normal amount?**\n\nOn a related note, I've been considering getting protective styling for my hair because I'm a little tired of doing so much to care for my hair (hence why i stopped with the heavy styling). How much should I expect from that? Thank you all!",

Routine: brush before shower, then used Maui brand in Coconut, the blue, moisture level 2 shampoo and conditioner. So far is the most satisfactory. Then wrung out my hair and put it in a turbie twist for a couple of hours, let loose and it air dried like this. I’m at a loss at what type curls these are (they are not trained, they have just been twisted in the towel and then air dried, my hair only does this in the front, meanwhile the underneath remains straight (always been told it’s because my hair is heavy, I do like layers however it doesn’t help the underneath parts). I don’t do anything special when sleeping, I’ve never had chemicals in my hair ever as well, no dye. \n\nSome background: as a kid I had pin straight, silky blonde hair. Enter puberty: my hair got coarse, thick, darker and was a frizzy, poofy mess when brushed. Neither parent has curly hair so I was never taught how to manage it, always took a brush to it and used the most damaging shampoo (Nizoral). I’ve spent probably over a hundred, maybe more on products. Tried Not Your Mother’s, Shea Moisture, Mielle. Shampoo/Conditioner has been so much I can hardly remember. Photo 3 is my hair when brushed out dry, and Photo 4 is after some salt-water at the beach a couple years ago for some variety. I guess my question is whether or not my whole head can be trained, or if I’m just unfortunate enough to have my front pieces curl and the rest (like the back) just isn’t. \n\nI’ve never posted anything on here so do correct me if I made a mistake or didn’t understand the rules correctly. I’m just very exhausted trying to figure out what direction I should go in after trying what feels like everything but curl resetting and training. ",

Any ideas or tips are greatly appreciated.\n\nWash Day\n\n\\- at night, in shower, shampoo and massage scalp with Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo (every couple weeks I will substitute it for OUAI Detox Shampoo)\n\n\\- let shampoo run down strands to help wash out product\n\n\\- condition everything past my scalp with Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Conditioner by thoroughly using praying hands and squish to condition methods\n\n\\- use wide tooth comb to gently detangle my hair from ends to roots, rinsing conditioner in the process\n\n\\- out of shower, don't even touch hair with towel, keeping it consistently wet with continuing spray bottle during styling\n\n\\- use praying hands to apply Love Ur Curls Step 3 All-In-One\n\n\\- use praying hands to liberally apply Love Ur Curls Irish Sea Moss Gel\n\n\\- use Denman brush to simply divide hair into clumps-- not so much doing the entire rotation method but just using the initial side set of teeth\n\n\\- lean down and strongly scrunch my hair\n\n\\- let air dry completely into a gel cast\n\n\\- before bed, tie up into pineapple bun and sleep on satin pillowcase\n\nDay 1\n\n\\- pull hair out of pineapple in morning, scrunch and shake to loosen up the cast for the day\n\n\\- pineapple again before bed\n\nDay 2\n\n\\- mist hair with water to try and reactivate product, maybe throwing in a little diluted leave-in conditioner spray\n\n\\- pineapple again before bed\n\nDay 3 (wash day again)\n\n\\- mist hair again (usually needs it) and dream of when I get to wash it again\n\n\\- same routine as last wash day",

      "content": "Short story: I'm an idiot.\n\nLong story: I saw a bunch of people online with amazing results using adapalene and thought it would take care of those stubborn comedones I hate, since I want this year to be the year I get hot. I bought a generic Differin dupe and, following the instructions on the box, applied it every night before bed. That turned out to be a bad idea.\n\nDays 1-2: Mild itching, a few small pimples, but I heard that was normal. It was nothing too alarming.\n\nDay 3: My skin started burning after moisturizer, but it faded after a few minutes so I ignored it.\n\nDay 4: The burning was lasting longer.\n\nDay 5: My skin was peeling and burned any time it got wet. At one point I cried (for unrelated reasons) and ended up with a painful rash under my eyes. *It literally hurt to cry.* That’s when I stopped.\n\nWhat’s confusing is that my face didn’t look that bad aside from some redness in my cheeks (which I already had beforehand), but it hurt a lot. After stopping adapalene, I followed the internet's advice and switched to a very gentle routine: mild cleanser, barrier-repair moisturizer, and a thin layer of Aquaphor to seal it in. It stung at first, especially when my skin got wet, but the pain improved day by day and now my skin no longer hurts to touch.\n\nHere’s where I need advice:\n\nAfter that experience, I’m honestly a bit scared to try again-- but my comedones did flatten and it seems to have helped a bit with the texture, so I do *want* to try. But how long should I wait? If I restart adapalene now, am I likely to damage my skin barrier even more? Should I wait longer before reintroducing it, and if so, how long? I obviously won’t be using it nightly again, but would something like once a week be reasonable? Or is this a sign that my skin just doesn’t tolerate adapalene at all?\n\nI’ve seen a lot of conflicting advice online and don't have a solid answer, so I’d really appreciate any guidance, especially from people who’ve had similar reactions or know more about retinoids and skin barrier recovery.",

      "content": "I'm 32F, located in the USA, and I have very sensitive skin. My skin's natural state is dry, but through many years of skincare, that aspect has gotten better - though it does get dehydrated looking and oily.  I'd still consider my skin type as \"combo\".\n\nI also have mild to moderate acne, usually more on the mild side. Most of my acne is closed comedones that can be extracted and have a waxy material come out of them. Sometimes, these turn into white heads, usually if I've picked at them, which I'm working on. On occasion, I get a few deep painful pimples that are just red or uncolored big bumps that go away on their own after 2-3 weeks if I leave them alone. Sometimes I just get little whiteheads on their own as well. But overall, it's mostly option 1.\n\nI also have very visible pores that have become more visible over time. Unsure if this is tied to the fact that my skin is oilier than it used to be.\n\nI went to a derm and they prescribed 0.025% Tretinoin, but they asked me nothing about my skin, what I already use, etc. They just gave it to me in response to me describing the type of acne I get. Because my skin is so sensitive and my acne is mild, I am hesitant to just jump into a stronger treatment.\n\nMy current routine includes:\n\n* Bioderma Sensibio Micellar Water\n* Malezia Hyaluronic Acid Gentle Cleanser\n* Revive LED Panel on Red+Blue+Amber\n* IUNIK Beta-Glucan Serum \\[shout out to the Redditor who recommended this to me last  year - it's helped my skin a lot!\\]\n* Rejuvi Skin Healing Gel (Aloe vera gel, Chamomile extract, Glycerin, Allantoin, Methylparaben)\n* Malezia 2.5% Micronized Benzoyl Peroxide Gel Cream\n* Malezia 5% Urea Moisturizer\n* Hydrocolloid acne patches\n\nI was just going to buy Differin and start patch testing that since it's cheap-ish and seems potentially less irritating than Tret may be. But I do have some Malezia BHA PHA that I haven't tried yet. Their website says it's not technically an OTC acne treatment, but it has Salicylic Acid, so I'm kind of confused by this?\n\nNote: While my goal is to better treat the remaining acne and clogged pores I have, anti-aging and pore visibility treatment would be nice too.\n\nSo... should I try Differin next or my BHA+PHA? Or just try the Tret?\n\nI am super self conscious about still having acne at my age (especially because it shows as VERY red on my complexion), so I'm a little afraid of making my skin significantly worse or having a horrible purge.",

I stopped using it June 2025 and switched to differin gel &amp; azelic acid. I have been consistent with the differin gel using it each night however i only use the azelic acid once or twice a week. Ever since around november my skin has been getting progressively worse with around 50 closed comodones forming in my forehead and at least 10-15 active spots on my face at a time when from June-August my skin was almost completely clear. I don’t know what to try next. I’m considering low dose accutane. Or tretinoin gel alone. Or increasing my azelic acid use. I’m just lost with what to try anymore. Or to add a salicylic acid toner? Please help with recommendations.\n\nMy current routine: Cerave blemish control cleanser 1x per day, differin 1x per day, azelic acid 1-2x per week, cerave oil control moisturiser 1x per day. Occasionally a vitamin C serum and a hylauronic acid serum. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

After that I use not your mothers curl cream, gel and mousse with some random hair oil I bought at some random beauty store. I then let it air dry. \n\nHello, I started my hair journey about a month ago. I have straightened my hair probably everyday for the past 3 years as well as dyed and bleached it for about a decade now. I always hated my hair due to it getting puffy. I recently found out it gets puffy because I have wavy hair and my hair is dead so it can't hold its \"wave\" pattern.\n\nI did some research and found so many people saying to use not your mothers products, so I bought them. I got the curl cream, gel and mousse. I started to use it but noticed it made my hair hard and crunchy. It also made my hair look wet all the time which I hate. I looked online and it said I was using too much product, so l used less; but it still happen. I did some more research and it said it was cause of the mousse so I stopped using it but It would still happen so I stopped using the gel.... and it stilled happened. Another thing I hate is how stringy it looks....\n\nI just came here for some advice. Am i still using too much product? Am I not using the right products for my hair? Is my hair just not naturally wavy and i'm forcing a pattern that's why it gets like this?",
