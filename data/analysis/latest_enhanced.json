      "content": "To start off on routine, i have been using New Wash by hairstory as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner for about a year now. (I hadnt used shampoo and conditioner for a YEAR 😭)\n\nI would also use their balm to style. Occasionally i used curlsmith hold me softly and in shower gel, as well as not your mothers curl talk foam to refresh. Id let my hair air dry, sleep with it in a bun (which is why its so frizzy all the time), and rewet it every morning using a bit of the styling products. \n\nLast year, i went to a new hairdresser who recommended new wash to me. I liked what it did to my curls, so i got what she used on me. Unfortunately, she didnt explain that it was a cowash (hairstory doesnt really explain either) and essentially framed it as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner. I was not aware of how cowashes work or how they should be used (i am still confused tbh)\n\nHere i am, a year later, with insane scalp build up and significantly thinner hair (said hair dresser also decided to give me a mullet i did not ask for 🥲). \n\nBefore this, i was putting in a lot of effort into my hair. I used hairtage for shampoo and conditioner, would use not your mothers mousse, the curl smith products i mentioned, and Silk by biosilk. i cant remember if i air dried or diffused in the fourth photo. \n\nFirst photo is most recent using hairology, miss jessie’s leave in and a curl cream, and diffused. Second photo is when i still used just new wash and was after my most recent cut. Third is an average day side profile while still using new wash. Fourth is my routine before new wash. Fifth is what it looked like on an average day. \n\nI think my hair is 2c/3a high porosity(pls confirm or deny) and now it is low density (it used to be so thick 😭). \n\nIm looking for advice and recommendations for shampoo and conditioner. I need to tackle my scalp build up above everything else. \nI also want my curls to stay curled longer. I think i will try using mousse but maybe not gel due to the weight. I think i will get one of those curl shaping brushes as well.\nIve also never found a solution for sleeping with my hair. Every bonnet ive tried has scrunched up my hair or has slipped off at night, but putting it up is causing so much damage. I cant use a satin pillow case for sensory issues. \n\nSuggestions welcome ❤️\n",

      "content": "(Hair type 1b/1c I think. Definitely low density. Gets straighter as it gets longer an heavier, but much more wavy when it's at my shoulders and shorter. At those shorter lengths the ends of my hair flip up and out as if I had them in rollers all night and I hate it hahaha.) \n\nI cut all of my hair off back in September 2021 into a **super short pixie**. Basically as short as you can go without buzzing it all off. At that point i started growing it again from scratch. My hair is almost back to my tailbone and it's allll virgin hair.\n\nI take really good care of my hair. Only need a tiny trim every 6 months or so whenever my hair tells me it's time with that slow onset of increasing dryness at the ends. The split ends and breakage are extremely minimal.\n\nWill using a semi-permanent dye damage my hair? Is there a gentler route I can take? I definitely do **not** want to use permanent dye whatsoever. \n\n**In case my hair-care routines affect whether or not you think I should color it here's what I do.**\n\n- Wash it twice a week. I never friction-dry it. I *loosely* plop it up in a microfiber hair wrap for about 15 minutes while I dry off and get dressed. \n\n- I let it air dry for a good 30-60 minutes before even brushing it (I look like a silly mess lol) and then I use my Dyson dryer on low to make sure my scalp and the thicker part of the hair on the back of my head is thoroughly dry. Takes like 6-10 minutes. By then the length is almost entirely dry anyways. \n\n- I **never** go to bed with wet hair. \n\n- I **never** use any heat on it other than that twice-a-week gentle Dyson time.\n\n- I loosely French braid my hair before bed, and I sleep on a satin pillowcase that I change every week.\n\n- Small amount of argan oil in the ends in the mornings. \n\n- I never have any tight hairstyles. Always braid it or gently clip it up whenever I'm doing activities / chores. Most of the time my hair is braided. (And I keep my braided hair away from zippers omg.)\n\nOther than that I'm just overall very gentle with it. I can't think of any other specific things I do with my hair in the moment.\n\nPlease help a girl out. It's there a realistic way I can get my hair a darker, richer brown without compromising it's integrity?! My hair is my everything so I know it's probably stupid to even want to touch it but ughhh the desire is killing me.\n\nThank you! ♥️",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "title": "Oily + Acne-Prone Skin Ruined After 2 Years of Wrong Skincare - Please Help🙏🙏",
      "content": "21M with oily, acne-prone skin.\n\nMy skincare journey started around August 2023. I began using only **Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid Cleanser** and **Pilgrim Vitamin C serum**. I did **not** use any moisturizer or sunscreen at that time.\n\nAfter the Vitamin C finished, I switched to **Minimalist Niacinamide serum**, but I noticed my skin actually got worse. Over time, I kept starting and stopping skincare randomly. For almost 2 years, I was basically just using the salicylic acid cleanser without proper moisturizing or sun protection.\n\nAfter researching, I now realize that skipping **moisturizer and sunscreen** probably damaged my skin barrier.\n\nI stopped all skincare for 1–2 months and recently restarted. I don’t plan to visit a dermatologist due to bad past experiences and lack of good dermatologists in my city.\n\n# Current Routine:\n\n**AM**\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n* JOY Almond &amp; Honey Body Lotion (on face)\n* Deconstruct Gel Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n* JOY Almond &amp; Honey Body Lotion (on face)\n* Minimalist Vitamin K + Retinal Under Eye Cream (for dark circles)\n\nFrom my research, a **simple 3-step routine** seems best:\n\n* AM: Cleanser + Moisturizer + Sunscreen\n* PM: Cleanser + Moisturizer (+ retinol later)\n\nI’m thinking of **changing my moisturizer**, since I’m currently using a body lotion on my face.\n\nI’m not in a rush at all — even if it takes **1–2 years**, I just want my skin to heal properly.\n\n**Looking for suggestions on:**\n\n* Whether my current routine makes sense\n* If I should stop or limit salicylic acid\n* Moisturizer recommendations for oily, acne-prone skin\n* When (or if) I should introduce retinol\n\nAny help would be really appreciated 🙏",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I don't have troubles with body odor (even without deo/antipersp.), but I hate the feeling of wet armpits I get especially at work. \n\nI have found some recommended antiperspirant brands on this subreddit (Mitchum, Secret). While they are not easily available to me, I will try to order from abroad if you suggest they work and don't stain.\n",

I use keracolor cleanditioner right now, usually I shampoo after conditioner to avoid weigh down.\n\n\\-scrunch in r+co high five shine and moisture cream and sometimes colorwow volume and texture spray, diffuse(mostly hover) or air dry. Diffusing makes it slightly curlier vs air dry.\n\n\\-I use aphogee protein treatment (the kind you don’t have to blow dry), my hair loves protein and is somewhat damaged.

I’m a 20-year-old with a normal to medium skin tone and have DPN — small, dark, mole-like bumps on my face. It’s a harmless condition, and I’ve already seen a dermatologist, so I’m not looking for diagnosis or medical advice here. Laser removal was mentioned as an option, but it’s purely cosmetic. What makes the decision difficult is the social response. Some people say it looks natural and doesn’t need to be changed. At the same time, many older relatives openly comment that it looks bad and suggest I should remove it. Even when something isn’t medically concerning, hearing that repeatedly can still affect how you feel about your skin. I’d really appreciate your opinions regarding situations like this.\n\n(what I feel that These bumps might look cute on fairer skin tones but I have a medium/dusky skin tone (exactly like in the first image). On my skin they tend to stand out in a way that isn’t usually seen as flattering in my country .....so most people end up commenting negatively about them.)\n\nI’m just trying to make a decision for myself and would appreciate straightforward opinions.",
