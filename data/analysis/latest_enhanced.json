I think I can do a great job at home but it does hurt my back 😅. \n\nI just feel like no matter where I go, the pedicures I get are such a disappointment. Am I a perfectionist? Not exactly, but I would hope you’d do a better job than me. \n\nEvery single time: \n- Cold water\n- Cut, scraped, or pinched\n- Polish on my cuticles\n- Constantly fixing the paint job after the fact\n\nI’m always polite and tip well. $10 for a $50 pedi. I never say anything about this stuff. But like - come on? I hate shelling out my hard earned bucks for such a consistently awful experience. \n\nIs it that the people can’t see? They don’t care? \n\nI’m literally currently leaving an appt with a scrape on my toe from the nail file… I think that’s the third appt in a row where I’ve left bleeding. \n\nI’m about to buy some of those magnifying glasses so I can start doing my pedis at home. \n\nAnyone else???",

I can no longer keep up with a normal hair routine,  Brushing my hair, applying product and diffusing all causes me too much pain now.  i had to find a better way that was easy, accessible, affordable,  and maximized the beauty i wanted.\n\ni decided to experiment and this is the routine  that created  the hair above, the hair i have wanted for literal years:\n\n dry brush and detangle (my dad helps me with this)\n\n Shampoo really well\n\n Conditioner in mid section and ends, not roots\n\n Squeeze out excess water and blot with the towel\n\n Take a curl brush with slightly damp, NOT REALLY WET, hair, brush upward against the grain of your hair from the underneath brushing up, this is done to create curl sections\n\nflip your head upside down, gently loosen your roots with your fingers so your roots are not stuck your  head, and then scrunch all the way to the root\n\nflip all your hair forward infront of your face. air dry like that, you basically have to look slightly down till its dry.\n\nonce fully dry flip upside down, fluff the roots, then spread your fingers wide, slip your fingers in the mid section of your hair, and shake. do not brush out  the curls with your hands, just shake.\n\nflip right side up, fiddle with it for i minute, fluff where you need to, and your done.\n\ni know this wont work for everyone, for some this will dry out your hair too much, but i did everything the beauty industry tells you not to do with curly hair and my hair has literally never looked better. i don't  care if this is somehow unhealthy for my hair, im simply too disabled to do more effort than this. maybe if it gets dry I'll do a night with coconut  oil to rehydrate, but this is my routine  forever  now.\n\n I wasted so many years thinking there was something wrong with me or my hair or that the way I wanted my hair wanted to look was not possible,and it was just lies. the thing that was making my hair look bad was product. my hair has always been hypersensitive  to product, even a half dollar size of mouse weighs down my hair. with nothing my hair is so soft, light, and fluffy. i have the volume i want, the definition, everything.  And I do not care if I was possibly using the wrong product and different product would help my hair more,  Like I've said I'm too disabled for a 5 step product routine these days. this routine  is what I've  needed. its perfect.\n\n Maybe you don't need 5 different $30 hair products, maybe  the issue isn't  the wrong product, its product at all. maybe with no product  but the right styling  method, you can have what you want ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯. maybe try going no product and air drying, then slowly incorporate each product to better understand your hair, idk. \n\ngood luck to all others on your curl journey. im very happy i finally  figured  this out. oh also please do not give me any advice, im content with what im doing! &lt;3 i just wanted to share this success in hopes it can help others.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "Hi there. I guess many of you are familiar with Doctor Pitella from Brazil. Along with Zarev from Bulgaria he is known as the 2nd best hair doctor in the world. Some tie him to Zarev. I like them both to be honest. His IG [https://www.instagram.com/dr.felipepittella](https://www.instagram.com/dr.felipepittella)\n\nThe thing that Pitella does is he usually gets people with advanced hair loss. Norwood 5, 6, 7, and he transplants to them anything from 10K to 15K grafts in one session. Taking hair from the neck, beard, and chest, if needed.\n\nI keep reading here in this subreddit that it's useless to get a hair transplant without finasteride. Well, this doc, one of the best in the world, has said several times that he has a different opinion. Every case is different, and he often transplants people that don't take finasteride and will keep most of the results. From now on I will write DHT blocker instead of fin.\n\nIt really depends on these factors:\n\n1. Is the hair loss process still early and under progression? then the patient will lose hair withing the years. The recommendation is not necessarily immediately a DHT blocker. It could be, another hair transplant in 5-10 years. Or, to take fin, as desired.\n2. Is the hair loss pattern diffuse in conjunction to being early? also DHT blocker might be needed here.\n3. Is the hair loss more or less stable and the patient has good thickness of hair? then DHT blocker is optional here.\n4. Is the hair loss stable and the patient is older than 45? then DHT blocker is optional here.\n\nIt really depends of the patients age, the pattern of loss (is hair keeping thickness or not) among other things. Not everyone needs a DHT blocker. And certainly if you do what he does (huge amount of grats transplanted that are not DHT sensitive to patients older than 40 yo) it's on average not needed.\n\nSo, don't say that ALWAYS finasteride is needed. It really depends on every case.",

I’ve always had issues with frizz and getting my hair to cooperate, but I feel like it’s finally time to ask for help, lol. \n\nHere is my routine: \n\n1. I wash my hair every other day. In the shower I use Pantene pro-v repair and protect shampoo. Once that’s washed out I use Monday curl define conditioner, and I brush it through my hair with a wet brush. I let it sit while I soap/shave and washing it out is the last thing I do before I get out of the shower. \n\n2. I dry it with a microfiber towel until it’s just damp, then I use Jamaican black castor oil leave in conditioner from the body shop. I get a blueberry/grape sized glob, rub it on my fingers, and then do my best to spread it through my hair without running my fingers through it to mess up the curls. \n\n3. Once it’s all spread through I scrunch my hair up with my hands for a bit, and then I let it air dry. I don’t brush or comb my hair unless I’m in the shower with conditioner in it. \n\n4. I typically only use the leave in conditioner when I’m planning on going out somewhere, but I get frizz whether or not I use it. I’d really love to see my hair with more defined curls, especially at the top of my head, with less of the frizz of course!! Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ",

      "content": "I’m been on oral finasteride for five and a half years, so my hair loss is stable and the quality somewhat improved overall. But I’m not satisfied, so I added topical min about a half year ago in the hope to get some extra density up front and reactivate those miniaturized hairs. But up until now, I don’t see or feel much of a difference.\n\nI understood that microneedling can improve minoxidil’s efficacy drastically over just min alone. So about three weeks ago I started with that. I’ve tried both 1mm and 1.5mm. Both once or twice a week, not sure what’s best. \n\nBut now I’m seeing an increase in hairloss, especially of those new grown ‘pointy’ hairs, both the shorter and lighter ones, as well as those who are a bit longer and darker. It frightens me because I feel like I damaged my hair follicles and because it is specifically those hairs that I desperately want to keep. Do you guys have any advice on how to proceed with both minoxidil and dermastamping? And what’s causing this shedding all of a sudden, and is that a good or a bad thing?",

      "content": "Like many people, my hands get really dry in the winter. Like, skin-cracking, bleeding dry. But I hate using moisturizing lotion because every one I’ve tried gives me a reaction. First it stings really badly, and then my skin gets red and I’m left with this burning sensation over the irritated area and these weird bumps (the attached photo was taken just now a couple minutes after applying Vanicream). After the burning mostly subsides, the redness and bumps stick around for a bit and my skin just feels really weird. I don’t know if it’s an allergic reaction because I don’t have any other allergies. I know I’ve tried Cerave, Cetaphil, Eucerin, Aquaphor, Dove (something for sensitive skin that my coworker let me try), and Vanicream. I know nothing about skincare and just wash my hands with soap and (admittedly too-hot) water. Has anyone else experienced this issue? Did you figure out how to fix it, or did you just learn to deal with the burn? Are there any products that won’t make this happen? Thank you :(",
