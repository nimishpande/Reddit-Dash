      "content": "For starts i’ve been told by POC and by red heads that my hair is curly and that i just don’t take care of it right. Here is my hair routine for some background. \nI wash my every 2-4 days. \nI always wash with Hairitage Shampoo. I will either use Native or Hairitage conditioner. \nWith shampoo i massage it into my scalp with a scalp massager and my nails to hopefully stimulate hair growth. \nWith conditioner i put it all over my hair. I use my fingers to brush the conditioner form scalp to ends to help detangle it and then i let it sit for a few minutes. (i have heard back and fourth in weather or not to use conditioner on your scalp but when i started to use it on my scalp i saw benefits) \nWhen im out of the shower i let it sit in a towel for 5-10 min and then take it down to air dry. \nAt night i sleep with a silk pillowcase. \nI dont use heat on my hair except maybe once every 6 months. I have added a picture of my hair after it’s already been brushed. i forgot to take a picture pre brush. im sorry. \nWhen i do brush my hair it turns into a massive frizzy mess. it truely looks like a rats nest. Before i brush i can see individual curls and curl pattern but its very obvious needs to be brushed so i do brush it. No matter what anti frizz product ive tried or how much i brush it always looks bad. PLEASEE HELP \nSo long story short: Is my hair actually curly? If it is… what can i do for my specific hair? i’m at a loss. ",

He prescribed me the following treatment (he only asked whether I go outside or not, and I told him that I don’t. He didn’t mention applying sunscreen) :\n\n1. Benzoyl peroxide gel – He told me to apply it daily in the morning on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer.\n(He didn’t suggest any moisturizer; I’m using the Minimalist Vitamin B5 moisturizer)\n\n2. Tretinoin gel 0.025% – He told me to apply this in the evening around 6–7 pm on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer.\n\n3. Vitamin C serum – He told me to apply this at night after washing my face (he didn’t mention applying a moisturizer after it)\n\n4. He also gave me tablets, which I have to take once daily for 30 days\n\nToday is my second day of following this routine, and my skin feels itchy, looks reddish and I’m noticing more acne/bumps.\n\nIs this normal? I did read that tretinoin can cause this, but it usually happens after 2–3 weeks and it’s just the second day for me.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

This is how it looks now… included a couple good hair day and bad hair day pics haha. \n\nroutine: ogx coconut curls shampoo and conditioner about 4x a week, and I don’t use any gels, creams, mousses, or hair spray. I brush my hair with a Wet Brush while it’s still wet, which seems to be effective at detangling, and towel dry/scrunch. I don’t do anything for sleeping, just a normal pillow.\n\nI always see lengthy, multi step, multi product curly hair routines but I don’t have the time or energy to do them every morning before work with a toddler next to me lmao! Are there any other shampoos or conditioners I should try? Or small steps/couple products I could use to reduce frizziness and define my curls a little more? ",

      "content": "Thanks in advance to all you beautiful people reading this. Been growing my hair out recently and trying a variety of different things to help establish a curl pattern. I have super tight curls in the back/ very bottom of my hair line so I know it can happen! But I’m getting discouraged as even when trying products and methods my hair rarely looks good.\n\n**I swim 3x a week and use a shampoo that removes chlorine in addition to the pictured products. I know some people don’t wash their hair as often, that is not an option for me since I need to get that chlorine out! I live in the Midwest so it’s cold and dry out right now as well but tbh my hair is always frizzy no matter the weather.\n\nFirst pic is minimal maintiance- I use the chlorine shampoo, pictured shampoo(focus on roots) conditioner (focus on non-roots), barely rinse that out after a few minutes and then spay pictured leave-in and wrap in microfiber towel for 10-15 minutes then hair dry. I usually shower at night (I swim after work then hop in the shower right after) so to preserve my hair I have tried using a silk bonnet. I don’t use it every time right now maybe 1-2/week. \n\nSecond pic is adding in more steps- same shampoo/conditioner routine in the shower and using a wet brush to get the leave in (and adding in hair milk- little black botttle) evenly distributed in my hair. After taking out of the towel I put some mousse (not pictured but it’s Aussie brand) and scrunch that in, then use a dryer with diffuser to form curls (which always seems to result in a MESS) with warm heat low power. I don’t aim to get it fully dry with that, but after it’s like 90% dry I see the frizz is coming back and use some oil (clear bottle) on top\nof my head where the frizz is the worst. Of course that doesn’t really seem to help after 10 minutes the frizz returns.\n\nI know this shampoo/conditioner is not really helping but at this point I think I am needing help with the technique/ putting the steps in the right order. This is the first time I have really tried putting effort into my hair so very new, thanks again to anyone willing to give some advice and help me turn this around! ",

I will scrunch some V05 high volume mousse in once it is a little more dry. \nI tend to clip up my roots in a claw clip and then use some volumising hair spray for szush. \n\nI refresh with water, then the Only Curls curl crème and strong hold gel (trying to use everything up). I sleep with a silk bonnet and a pineapple underneath with a silk scrunchie).\n\nPicture is day 5 curls I think with multiple refreshes.

I don’t dry it with a hair drier , I just tap it with a towel until the most of the humidity it’s gone and then just leave it like that. I wash my hair twice a week and sometimes I just put some water to style it , I also saw that it’s so dry sometimes and I feel like it just needs to be hydrated. I don’t use bonnets or stuff like that going to sleep. I work as a chef also. ",

      "content": "Hi All! \n\nI’ve recently bought a few products to start my skincare journey! \n\nOne of the items I got was the Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner which contains organic rose water.\n\nHowever after applying, my face felt a burning sensation that lasted minutes. \n\nI also recalled similar burning when trying out the FRESH rose deep hydration face cream 2 months back. \n\nNo redness or patchiness or itchiness. Just the burning sensation.\n\nNot sure if this is normal when applying Rose Water or whether my skin is just sensitive to it!\n\nAppreciate all your advice and any good alternatives for a Toner!! \n\nMy current items are:\n\nCleanser:\n\n1) caudalie vinopure (salicylic acid) for morning \n\n2) caudalie vinohydra (hyaluronic acid) for night\n\nToner: pending redditors’ advice \n\nSerum: caudalie vinohydra serum\n\nMoisturizer: \n\ncaudalie vinopure moisturizing mattifying liquid \n\nSunscreen: yet to decide \n\nThank you in advance for your help :) 🥰",

Maybe twice a month I use the Oui detox shampoo\n\nI double shampoo, then condition halfway down my hair. Leave mostly wet and comb with a wide tooth comb to get my part... Rake in curl cream and scrunch then prayer hands glaze the gel on and scrunch more. I either plop or leave my hair to air dry maybe halfway then I diffuse till dry and scrunch out the crunch. To sleep I usually flip my hair down and use a soft scrunchie to gather my curls without combing through too much. \n\nI think I have between a 2c-3a hair? Really not sure. But my hair is very fine and gets oily pretty fast. I'm currently washing between 2-3 times a week. I'm curious if any of my products are contributing to my hair getting oily fast or weighing it down. I feel like the first day my hair looks great and then second and third day it just looks weighed down and stringy. \n\nAny product changes or advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm definitely looking to keep my product semi affordable. I can't be at 30+ for every step of my routine. ",
