      "content": "no sugarcoating this but I’ve always struggled with underarm odour.  Winter, summer, monsoon, AC room it doesn’t matter. My underarms just refused to behave and it honestly made me feel humiliated especially when wearing sleeveless.  \n  \nI’ve tried several underarm products before, mostly budget friendly ones, but nothing really worked long term. So in that trial phase, I decided to give the be bodywise underarm roll on a chance too. It’s been few weeks now, and honestly, it’s been pretty good to me. It keeps things fresh for a long time, doesn’t sting (only purpose for me particularly) additionally doesn’t feel sticky either. I wouldn’t call it magic but compared to what I was dealing with earlier it’s been a noticeable improvement.  \n  \nAs it’s been only few weeks-  i wanted to know if anybody honestly has been using it for long term and seen good results ?",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "title": "Since a lot of people asked in my last posts, I made a rough guide/tutorial (In Post Body)",
      "content": "Before I get in to the actual details I think a lot of it is just genetics. I got blessed with good hair color, and my hair is naturally thick and doesn't break easily. A lot of my routine is based around minimizing frizz because my hair will naturally form curls very easily. The first two pictures I attached to the post were Day 3 morning hair so you can see some frizz showing up. The last one is after being out working in humidity for that full day.\n\n\n\n# Basic Care\n\nThe one thing I think I have done for my hair that's been super beneficial is that I have never used heat products. If you straighten/curl your hair on certain occasions you're probably fine honestly, I choose not to just to play it safe.\n\nBesides that you probably already know most of the things. A silk bonnet or a silk pillow case is always a good idea, not dunking your hair in buckets of dirt and grease (or just using too much product) will also definitely help. Keep it tied back during physical activity in order to prevent knots and frizz.\n\n\n\n# Wash Routine\n\nA lot of my routine is based off of the Curly Girl Method (CGM). While CGM does take it a bit far in my opinion a lot of my routine is taken from it. If you are interested you can find a lot of guides on reddit, but be careful as it can cause product build up.\n\nWhat I have found works best for me is-\n\n1. Get hair DRENCHED as much as possible\n2. Detangling with a curl defining hair brush (skip this if you have fine hair or hair that easily tangles)\n3. Shampoo (2x a week, or if hair is greasy/dirty)\n4. Rinse thoroughly\n5. A LOT of conditioner, brush through with curl defining brush.\n6. Let conditioner sit for \\~3 minutes\n7. Rinse thoroughly \n8. While hair is still dripping wet use product, comb through or just scrunch in depending on product (skip if you feel like you are starting to get product buildup or if its just not needed)\n9. Scrunch extra water out with hands\n\nAfter that my hair is still \"wet\" by most standards but I normally go to sleep since I shower right before bed. There is probably a hundred reasons not to do that but when I wake up its always tangle free and I just need to scrunch/shake it out which is really nice in the mornings. I use a silk pillow case so I just \"whip\" my hair on to it before I sleep.\n\nThis is what I have found works for me, if you know something doesn't work for you personally just swap it out or skip it.\n\n# Products\n\nI say this with complete sincerity there is one product I would literally go to war for. [Lush Super Milk](https://www.lush.com/us/en_us/p/super-milk-conditioning-spray/100ml) is my absolute saving grace. I never skip using this, it prevents frizz and smells amazing. The only other product I use is [Function of Beauty Curl Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Function-Beauty-Curl-Cream-Curly/dp/B0CT2FY1S5), it helps to revive my hair but I don't use it every time.\n\nFor shampoo and conditioner I honestly use anything that says curly on it. However what I normally use when I can get my hands on it is the [Aussie Miracle Curls](https://www.amazon.com/Aussie-Miracle-Curls-Collection-Conditioner/dp/B0886XTJDN) line (the link has the full set but I recommend just getting the shampoo/conditioner).\n\n# Closing\n\nLike I said this is definitely not perfect for everyone but I find it works nicely for me. If anyone has any advice for me I would love to hear it. Improving a routine never hurts :)",

I’ve been using a little dandruff shampoo for about two weeks now, about 2 X a week. The redness hasn’t went away so far. I have extremely dryyyy and sensitive skin this winter. I tend to be dry and sensitive anyway but for some reason this winter has been the worst. I use vanicream in the tub or cerave lotion to moisturize my body and face. If I’m having a bad flare up I only cleanse with cerave hydrating cleanser and just moisturize. I’m eczema prone but this doesn’t feel/look like my typical eczema flare-ups at all. It’s not really itchy, it’s mainly raw and sore feeling if that makes sense? It seems like when I cleanse with my typical cleanser like cerave salicylic acid or Differin my skin gets angry and that’s never really happened before. I’m definitely making an appointment with the dermatologist, but has anyone had anything like this before?? If you have, do you have any suggestions on how to calm it down? It seems like vanicream is the only thing keeping my skin somewhat at bay. ",

I feel like my skin needs more than this, but I’m not sure what to start with or how to introduce new products without irritating my skin.\n\n**What I’m Looking For**  \nI’m hoping for suggestions on:  \n• Specific ingredients that can help with pigmentation and dark spots  \n• What can improve **texture** and dullness in dry skin  \n• Affordable product recommendations (preferably under ₹700) for serums or treatments\n\nAny insights is much appreciated! :)",

I did research on my own and I’ve come to the conclusion that I have either fungal acne or closed comedones but I’m not sure which?\n\nright now I just bought the ordinary azelaic acid 10% for my hyperpigmentation spots and I’m hoping that it works (anyone else have results with this?).

      "content": "Ordered 3 products from Deconstruct’s official website — Vitamin C serum, sunscreen, and retinol (Order ID: 622166).\n\nAt checkout, the site clearly promised 2 freebies:\n\n• a travel pouch\n\n• a 10 ml Vitamin C serum\n\nWhen the package arrived, none of the freebies were included.\n\nI contacted the brand immediately. What followed was a masterclass in poor customer service and shifting excuses:\n\nFirst, they said freebies were “temporarily unavailable.”\n\nThen they said freebies “cannot be added retrospectively.”\n\nThen they said the offer “was not active that day.”\n\nMeanwhile, the same freebies were still being shown on their website.\n\nWhen I asked for a simple solution — either send the promised items or take the order back and refund me — they clearly said:\n\nthey won’t provide the freebies\n\nthey won’t accept a return\n\nthey won’t issue a refund\n\nNo accountability. No concern. Just scripted apologies and contradictions (screenshots attached).\n\nThis is not about “free stuff.”\n\nThis is about false promises, misleading promotions, and zero responsibility after payment.\n\nIf a brand advertises something to push customers to spend more, and then refuses to honor it — that’s not a mistake, that’s deceptive practice.\n\nI’m now left with 3 products and zero trust in the brand.\n\nPosting this so others can decide if this is the kind of brand they want to support.\n\nTransparency matters. Trust matters. And Deconstruct failed badly here.",

      "content": "Hi everyone :-) \n\nI recently tried making homemade flaxseed gel (1/4 cup to 2 cups of water), and I wanted advice on how to use it in styling/a good routine? I have very long (not waist length but maybe half way down my back), thick and dry hair maybe a 2C/3A pattern but I struggle with my hair being a bit frizzy and some sections curling nicely with others being just frizz/strings.\n\nSo i was wondering how much flaxseed gel are you meant to use in styling if its homemade and is it better to use in combination with other products like a leave in conditioner or mousse? (and if yes, how much ballpark of those products should i be using?) - i also air dry my hair or very partially diffuse it mainly due to length/thickness diffusing takes alot of time for me!\n\nToday i trialled maybe a 1/4 cup of flaxseed gel, 2 golf ball sized pumps of a strong hold mousse and two pea sized pumps of a curl cream - results were okay but same issue with some areas being stringy/frizzy and my hair also feels a bit stiff/frizzy even after scruching with a silk scarf and oil. I also dont think this would hold over multiple days.\n\nAny and all advice would be greatly appreciated! TYIA",

The bumps are tiny, rough, and kind of feel like thorns or goosebumps. They’re not very inflamed but make the skin texture really uneven.\n\nWe were thinking of trying the Dove 1% Salicylic Acid body wash and wanted to know if it actually helps with this kind of back acne / clogged pores. Has anyone used it for similar issues?\n\nAlso, how long does it usually take to see results, and is it safe for regular use? Any advice or alternative suggestions would be really appreciated. Thanks! 😊",

Any advice on how to get my roots and back of head to curl? Or is it just going to take way longer for the roots to start curling? Is it just my hair type or am I doing something wrong?\n\n\n\n🎀 HAIR ROUTINE 🎀\n\n   Ask for face framing long\n\n\\- \\[x\\] 1st Week: Hydration Week → Hydration Shampoo, Hydration Hair Masque, Hydration Conditioner (add Hydration Masque only once if washing more than once that week) Jan 27\n\n\\- \\[ \\] 2nd Week: Protein Week → Hydration Shampoo + bonding protein treatment. “Bond repair masque” green bottle \n\n\\- \\[ \\] 3rd Week: Hydration Week → Hydration Shampoo + Conditioner (Hydration Masque if dry) \n\n\\- \\[ \\] Clarify Week → Clarifying Shampoo (2 lathers) + Protein Masque\n\n⸻\n\n🧴 Wash Products\n\n1. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo\n\n\t•\tUse: Weekly (non-clarify weeks)\n\n\t•\tHow: Focus on scalp &amp; roots only. Massage with fingertips (not nails). Let suds run through lengths as you rinse.\n\n\t•\tRinse: Thoroughly with lukewarm water.\n\n2. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner\n\n\t•\tUse: Weekly (after Hydration Shampoo, except Clarify Week)\n\n\t•\tHow: Apply to mid-lengths &amp; ends (avoid roots to prevent heaviness). Use wide-tooth comb or fingers to detangle.\n\n\t•\tRinse: After 3–5 minutes, rinse lightly (leave a little slip if your hair likes it).\n\n3. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Masque\n\n\t•\tUse: Every 1–2 weeks (instead of conditioner).\n\n\t•\tHow: Apply generously mid-lengths → ends. Detangle with wide-tooth comb. Smooth with “praying hands.”\n\n\t•\tWait: 10–15 minutes (cover with cap for extra effect).\n\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n4. SheaMoisture Protein Masque\n\n\t•\tUse: Once a month (after Clarifying Shampoo).\n\n\t•\tHow: Section hair, apply mid-lengths → ends first, then lightly on roots if needed. Brush through for even coverage. Light scrunch to help curls.\n\n\t•\tWait: 10–15 minutes.\n\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n\t•\tConditioner: Skip (this masque replaces it).\n\n5. SheaMoisture Strengthen &amp; Restore Clarifying Shampoo\n\n\t•\tUse: Once a month (Clarify Week).\n\n\t•\tHow: Do 2 lathers — first lifts buildup, second deep cleans. Focus on scalp, let suds rinse through lengths.\n\n\t•\tFollow with: Protein Masque (not conditioner).\n\n6. SheaMoisture Bond Repair Masque (optional/alternate)\n\n\t•\tUse: Every 2–3 weeks or when hair feels weak/breaking.\n\n\t•\tHow: Same as Hydration Masque — mid-lengths → ends, detangle, smooth in.\n\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n⸻\n\n🌿 Leave-In &amp; Styling Products\n\n7. Curlsmith Frizz Rescue Curl Retainer\n\n\t•\tUse: After cream (daily).\n\n\t•\tHow: Scrunch into damp hair, focusing on mid-lengths &amp; ends. This helps lock curl shape and reduce frizz.\n\n\t•\tTip: Use hands or microfiber towel to “cup &amp; scrunch” upward.\n\n8. Curlsmith Frizz Rescue Finishing Serum\n\n\t•\tUse: After styling, when hair is 100% dry.\n\n\t•\tHow: Warm 2–3 drops in hands, then scrunch out any crunch or frizz. Glide lightly over surface for shine.\n\n\t•\tWhen: End of styling, or as touch-up on dry hair between washes.\n\n⸻\n\nIn shower process:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT TO DO\tWHY\n\n1\tDetangle only with conditioner in\tPrevents root stretch\n\n2\tRinse conditioner thoroughly\tSlip flattens roots\n\n3\tLight scrunch before turning water off\tEncourages curl memory\n\n4\tExit shower with hair clumped\tPreserves pattern\n\nWash day styling:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT TO DO\tWHY\n\n1\tKeep hair soaking wet\tCurl forms only when wet\n\n2\tDetangle once (wide tooth, straight down)\tNo shaping yet\n\n3\tApply Curl Retainer FIRST (diluted)\tRoots need early hold\n\n4\tRoot Pinch: small sections, pinch curl upward at scalp (2–3 sec)\tShortens curl path\n\n5\tOne gentle scrunch (mid → root)\tActivates curl upward\n\n6\tDirectional set: push hair forward → back → side to side\tPrevents straight drying\n\n7\tOptional: ½ pea cream on ends only\tSoftness without slip\n\n8\tOptional micro-plop 2–3 min max\tEncourages curl, protects roots\n\nDiffusing for root curl:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT TO DO\tWHY\n\n1\tSet diffuser to low heat + low airflow\tPrevents stretch\n\n2\tStart diffusing at the roots first\tSets curl near scalp\n\n3\tHold diffuser bowl close to scalp but not touching\tEncourages lift\n\n4\tDiffuse in short holds (15–30 sec), then move\tPrevents frizz\n\n5\tTilt head side to side, forward slightly\tCreates root bend\n\n6\tDiffuse lengths last\tPrevents pulling curls down\n\n7\tStop at 90–95% dry\tAvoids over-dry stretch\n\nAfter shower:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT TO DO\tWHY\n\n1\tLet hair cool fully\tSets curl\n\n2\tScrunch out cast gently\tSoftens curls\n\n3\tSeparate only thick clumps\tLess Victorian look\n\n4\tOptional serum on ends\tSeal, don’t weigh down\n\nFront hair line:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT YOU DO\tHOW / NOTES\n\n1\tHair fully wet + styled\tCurl retainer already applied\n\n2\tApply extra-light retainer at hairline\tUse residue on hands only\n\n3\tRoot pinch at hairline\tSmall sections, pinch upward 2–3 sec\n\n4\tTilt head slightly back\tNOT upside down\n\n5\tPlace diffuser bowl close to scalp\tDo not press into skin\n\n6\tHold diffuser 15–20 seconds\tThen lower gently\n\n7\tMove bowl along hairline\tTemple → center → temple\n\n8\tStop when hairline is 80–90% dry\tOver-drying flattens\n\nPinch → tilt back → bowl close → short holds\n\nDay 2 refresh:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT YOU DO\tHOW / NOTES\n\n1\tLightly mist roots first\tSpray or wet fingertips\n\n2\tOptional: diluted curl retainer\tPea-size TOTAL, watered down\n\n3\tRoot pinch at flat areas\tEspecially hairline + crown\n\n4\tOne light scrunch mid → root\tStop early\n\n5\tDiffuse on low heat + low airflow\tSame settings as wash day\n\n6\tStart diffusing at roots\tRoots before ends\n\n7\tTilt head side-to-side\tEncourages bend\n\n8\tStop at 90% dry\tPrevents frizz &amp; stretch\n\nMist roots → pinch → light scrunch → diffuse roots → stop early",
