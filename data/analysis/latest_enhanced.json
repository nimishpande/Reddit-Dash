I’m wondering whether it’s a curly cut or if anyone knows which way she cuts her hair? Also I know that her hair isn’t freshly styled and probably multiple days in\n\nMy routine consists of herbal essence shampoo and conditioner and I detangle in the shower. I don’t usually style my hair (I braid it in a protective hairstyle) but when I do I just go in with the Marc Anthony curl cream + the mousse, umberto giannani gel and diffuse my hair upside down and occasionally I’ll put a claw clip while I diffuse at the top for more volume. I wear a silk bonnet to sleep. Also, my hair wet reaches my upper thigh so it’s pretty long",

It’s always frizzy and I can’t figure out what to do. \n\nIn my routine I use this basic dove shampoo and conditioner (last pic) every night when I shower, I comb through it with a pick, and then if I feel like it I’ll use this Cantù cream, (which usually does nothing). I tried a silk pillowcase but it wasn’t much help. I let it air dry mostly, but I help it along with a towel, or I give up go to bed with it still a little damp.  Sometimes I get a crazy good curl but I don’t know how to replicate it. \n\nI’m looking for any suggestions of products or techniques I should try, I would really like it to look pretty instead of a frizzy mess.

      "content": "I (54F) have 2B-3B 20% virgin grey hair, and I'd like to try something fun with it. I was thinking about trying a semi permanent colour, something fun and vivid, like deep red or royal purple, that would really make the white streaks that frame my face pop. However, when I've tried semi permanents in the past, my curl does NOT like it. My hair gets drier, curls don't clump properly and get looser. I've already lost so much of my curl pattern since menopause (gone from a solid 3B with lots of density and consistent curls that needed minimum help to define or style to much looser overall, with a real mix of mostly 2B-3B, and a couple of small pieces that are closer to 2A. But I am not happy with my hair - I'm 20% grey,  especially around the front (incl. 2 cool white streaks at the temples) and the loss of volume and curl means it's so much flatter and harder to style than it used to be.\nI have dyed my hair before, about 8 years ago, with E-Salon, when my hair had a tighter more consistent curl pattern and full density (I've lost 25-30% of my density since then), and it always took a few weeks minimum to recover. Now, with the current density and curl pattern, as well as being on the drier side of normal, I'm worried that I will just end up losing much of the remaining curl and volume. \nHas anyone had any experience playing with colour on their curls? What effect did it have on condition, curl pattern and styling? \n\nMy routine:\n\nShampoo: Carole's Daughter Goddess Strength (once or twice a month)\nDaily conditioner: Carole's Daughter Goddess Strength (every shower)\nMask: alternating between Carole's Daughter Goddess Strength and Verb Hydrate Mask \nClarifying shampoo: L'Oreal Everpure (as needed - I don't get a lot of product building up as I don't use a lot of product)\nLeave In: LUS All in One for curly hair\nStyling: LUS Sea Moss gel. Have also tried Curlsmith Curl Souffle and FX texturizing paste.\nMethod: squish to condish, then before getting out of shower, apply the LUS All in 1 prayer style, comb through w wide toothed comb, wrap in microfiber towel to soak up excess water, then section and curl brush and either air dry or, if going out, apply LUS Sea Moss gel to hair prayer style, section and curl brush to clump, then combo of scrunch/hover diffuser on low gentle heat until about 80-90% dry (live in a very humid climate). If I'm using texturizing paste, I do it right after taking off the towel, but don't use both that and gel.\n\nAlso, please note that photos show my hair air dried, not diffused and styled (which would be fuller and curlier). And I'm planning on getting a shorter cut to reclaim some of my curls and volume.",

I rinse my hair thoroughly after every shampoo, to the point where my scalp literally gets squeaky clean. \n\nI've been washing my hair every other day for around 4 years, but since the start of this month, I've been needing to wash my hair every single day because of how oily it gets. \n\nA friend recommended using a clarifying shampoo, so I've been using Pantene's Sheer Volume shampoo once a week since the start of this month. Nothing has changed. \n\nI wash my pillow case and my hair brushes once a week. \n\nI alternate between blow-drying and air-drying my hair. \n\nIt might also be important to know that I have 1A hair, and I'm East Asian.

Blood work shows my dht levels are very high. \n\nTried fin about two years ago for a year but I kind of played around with the dosage. Took 1 mg for half a year then switched to EOD. Didn't notice much of a difference in fact hair got worse. \n\nNow ready to give it another try. I'm going to be continuing my minoxidil and nizoral but also incorporating microneedling and ghkcu. \n\nNow I would go with dut but my only gripe is the potential for it to affect facial hair growth. I'm a firefighter and have a stache and a great one in fact that I don't want to ruin. So there is my dilemma.

I squeeze the water out of my hair with a T-shirt then I use a diffuser to dry my hair.

My favorite for a LONG TIME was from Suave, but it has a grey cast. Tried Batiste for dark hair and I love it but the dark coloring makes my hands look dirty if I've been touching my hair. Tried the Not Your Mother's plump for joy dry shampoo and it's about as good as the Suave, but also has the grey cast. Beginning to care less about the grey cast since it can be fluffed out a bit.\n\nI really wanted to like the IGK, I wanted to treat myself to it, since it's expensive compared to others.   \n**But it makes my hair feel so unbearably dry and grippy** that I immediately want to wash it out. I've never had a dry shampoo I immediately wanted to wash out. I even tried spaying it with rose water to re-hydrate it and then brush it out after.\n\nSomeone help 😭 Please, who has a good dry shampoo suggestion that works but doesn't feel so dry and chalky? It feels like it makes my hair very prone to breakage after using it.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

It’s 100% mineral yet feels smooth and silky, not cakey dry, or chalky like most mineral sunscreens, and it leaves a very natural finish that’s neither greasy nor flat. I use the tinted version (they also have non-tinted), and it blends in so well. Makes my skin look naturally but healthy.

      "content": "So I've been at this for a few months now and I still cannot find my curly people.  My hair does NOT like any of the typical curl advice.  Conditioner is too heavy, heat styling does not hold.  I get my best hold from cool air diffusing/air drying.  Tension styling destroys my pattern.  Dripping wet styling does not work.  also please don’t come at me for my hair color I’m growing out black box dye 😭\n\n  \nMy hair seems to respond best to:\n\nstrong clarifying/chelating shampoo\n\nvery light or no conditioner\n\nprotein gels (especially cheap ones honestly)\n\ncool air diffusing + air drying\n\nletting clumps form while dripping wet, pulling apart where I feel separation in my mid lengths, and then locking them while still damp but no longer dripping\n\nMy absolute best result was when I used crappy shampoo on a small section in my sink and then quite literally the cheapest protein gel I found at WalMart.  Protein gel, even with zero conditioner and strong clarifying + chelating shampoo, makes my hair so shiny and soft, it literally looks like a hair commercial.  I need SOME slip for clump integrity, but even Verb Ghost conditioner is too heavy.  (Trying Odele leave in as a rinse out next wash) \n\nI have used conditioner maybe 3 out of my last 15+ washes and my hair looks and feels thicker and healthier than when I was using it regularly. \n\nI just want to understand my hair better and learn more about routines that will actually work.  But all I can find is the usual heavily moisturize/oil/etc advice. the last photo is from the first day I used no conditioner. The one before that was a wash day when I still used it regularly\n\nthe photo of my wet clumps was my best clump day yet. it never stays like that when it dries, but I’m willing to sacrifice definition to keep my length. I know that’s a huge limiting factor here.   \n\n\nFull routine used today:\n\nKristin Ess chelating shampoo 2x\n\nNot Your Mother's conditioner \n\nScrunch with tshirt/no product until not soaked\n\nAmpro protein styling gel\n\nI threw on some Clear Ice styling gel half way through for funsies.  My hair tolerates a LOT of product and really loves protein gel (but hates protein foam)\n\nDiffuser on high heat/speed set on sink while I hovered around it to dry my roots\n\nLift/hover diffuse on cool followed by air dry\n\nScrunch out with a small bit of Olivia Care Shine Hair Elixer\n\n",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I just want to clarify what the recent policy shift at the Food and Drug Administration actually means.\n\nThe reform does NOT alter the structure of drug development. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 trials are still required, and the FDA review period still typically lasts six to ten months. What has changed is a long-standing practical expectation: historically, even when a company produced a strong positive Phase 3 trial, the FDA often expected a second independent confirmatory Phase 3 before granting approval. This was not explicitly mandated by statute, but in practice it frequently operated as if it were.\n\nUnder the revised approach, a single, large, well-designed Phase 3 trial demonstrating a clear and clinically meaningful benefit may now be sufficient. The only time potentially saved is the time that would have been required to conduct a second confirmatory trial, which typically amounts to roughly one to two additional years.\n\nLet’s apply this to PP405. The drug is currently in Phase 2 and will still need to complete a full Phase 3 trial. \n\nUnder the old standard, even if Phase 3 results were strongly positive, the company would likely have been expected to conduct a second confirmatory trial before filing for approval. That requirement alone would have shifted approval into the early 2030s.\n\nUnder the new framework, if the initial Phase 3 results are compelling and robust, approval could proceed after that single study. \n\nIn that case, a late 2029 or 2030 approval becomes plausible, with 2028 representing a theoretical best-case scenario under exceptionally efficient execution.\n\nThe same applies to any other Hair loss drugs like VDPHL 01 and Breezula.\n\nIn essence, without the reform, even favorable data would probably have entailed one additional major trial and an attendant delay of roughly two years. With the reform, that extra step is no longer presumed. The ultimate determinant, however, remains the strength, consistency, and clinical significance of the Phase 3 evidence.",
