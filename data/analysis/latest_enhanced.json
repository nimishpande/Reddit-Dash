My face is clear now and the occasional spots fade within a week or two, but my body takes forever. For my face, I use cerave's benzoyl peroxide and retinol.\n\nIve tried the ordinary's glycolic acid and salicylic acid but they irritate my skin (i have eczema). Now I've been using Cerave SA cream for bumpy skin for the past month and it smoothened my skin initially but I think my skin is flaring up from it too now? Like my shoulders and breast skin gets inflamed, but my tummy, back, and butt seem fine with it.\n\nNow im worried these spots could be permanent since I've had them for so long.

I asked an employee with visibly well maintained coily/thick hair for advice and she said Shea Moisture was way too heavy for me with my fine hair - that it contained glycerin and was too heavy for her hair type, so it was definitely the wrong choice for me. She recommended Nexxus Pure and Clean shampoo and conditioner and I'm trying it out now with nothing else changed in my routine, but my curls fall out of their curl pattern within the day. I spend the days between wash days with hair that looks like someone with wavy hair tried to straighten it.\n\nSo clearly this current shampoo and conditioner is not for me, but was she right that the other was too heavy for me and was weighing down my curls?\n\nWhat kind of products and routines do you use for your fine curly hair, and how long do your curls last?",

      "content": "Ugh!! My curls are dying on me. I am dealing with hair thinning &amp; loss, for one, so my hair is looking pretty ratty these days. I do get Ouidad curly cuts - last one done on 9/27. \n\nAs far as shampoo/cond I used to use Kevin Murphy Hydrating &amp; then switched to Davines Love curl, which worked for awhile &amp; then started to make my hair feel like straw. At the time I paired it with Davines Curl Building serum, but didn’t think it was creating nice curls. \n\nSwitched to Ouidad Curl Quencher sham/cond when I got my first curly cut, and paired that with the Ouidad Whipped Curls, but felt like that combo was too much moisture &amp; was weighing down my hair. \n\nA few weeks ago I purchased some Curlsmith Full Body Weightless sham + Milk Cond and then tried various combinations of the Hydro-style flex jelly, Weightless air dry cream, and Vital Curl, none of which seemed to do much for me. I get much better definition from the whipped curls than the vital curl gel. In fact, by day 2 on Vital Curl, my hair was totally listless and lost curl. \n\nToday’s routine:\n1. Washed &amp; conditioned with the CS Full Body\n2. Whipped curls (I literally used like a teaspoon or so &amp; mixed in some Vital Curl gel\n3. Combed thru w wide tooth comb (only to disperse product)\n 4. Sprayed some extra water and then plopped as usual with a microfiber cloth. But \n\nAnd my hair just looks greasy &amp; lifeless. \n\nI am at a loss. What is wrong with my hair and what should I change? I believe it’s low porosity (I tend to dryness, but get weighed down easily) but too much protein or something? I don’t know. My curls used to look so much better, but maybe this is just my hair on menopause + a year on GLP-1. \n\nFirst pic is this past July 20, the last 3 are today. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!! ",

      "content": "Image one: New ingredient list for the co-wash\nImage two: Old ingredient list for the co-wash\nImage three: Curlsmith statement about the rebrand\n\nHey all! I know a lot of us LOVE Curlsmith and I have been a loyal follower of them since early 2022! I have been using their curl quenching conditioning wash for nearly four years now, and recently when I picked up my new bottle… I noticed something new. Not only did I notice the new packaging, but also the change of ingredients that I have not found anyone else talking about online. Curlsmith used to pride itself on being “phthalate-free”, however it looks like that has since changed without informing customers other than removing “phthalate-free” label from the bottle. \n\nI also noticed this brand new ingredient in the other products I bought from them recently as well (I am not sure if it is in all their new products now either,  however I am speaking from what I noticed from the products I purchased). I do not know much about phthalates and whether they are harmful or not, so I will not preach on whether you should be cautious or not around the product. However, I’d recommend if you are concerned about phthalates to do some scientific research about it to see if discontinuing using products with phthalates is right for you or not! However, I do know a large majority of people avoid these ingredients and I think raising awareness about this is necessary so everyone can be happy and safe! \n\nStay safe everyone! Hope this helps raise some awareness about this other aspect of the rebranding. :)\n\n(Not allowed to post without clarifying my “routine” so here it is: Shampoo every Saturday with varied gentle cleansers or gentle soaps to clarify (Curlsmith core strength shampoo or Three Sisters Apothecary shampoo body bar mix). Follow either with a hair mask or conditioner such as the double cream quencher by Curlsmith. Style with whatever leave-in and gel I have available and comb through and scrunch! I cowash every Wednesday.)\n",

I have curly blonde hair and I really love it, but I feel like it’s starting to look flat and boring with how long it’s getting. I also want to switch it up a bit, but I don’t want to cut it too much because I’d like to grow it out a bit more. I’ve been considering getting layers since that should help show the curls better and also give my hair some form (hopefully, I’m not very knowledgeable about hair, this is just what I’ve seen and heard). My only problem is I also want to be able to pull back my hair. I like braiding it and pulling it into pony tails when it gets in the way, and I’m worried if I get layers I won’t be able to do that since the front pieces would be shorter. Are there different hair styles you could do to allow both? Again, I’m not very knowledgeable about hair so any advice is well appreciated!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "I’ve struggled with hormonal acne on and off for a long time (10+ years, currently in my mid twenties). What’s helped me most has been seeing the dermatologist and using prescription topicals, primarily \nTretinoin. Over the past year my skincare routine has been the following: \nAM:\n-wash with cera ve hydrating facial cleanser \n-moisturize with cera ve daily moisturizing lotion\n-skin 1004 spf\nPM:\n-remove skin makeup with bioderma micellar water and eye makeup with cera ve cleansing balm \n-wash with cera ve hydrating facial cleanser\n-moisturize with cera ve daily moisturizing lotion \n-apply tretinoin 0.05% (every other day) \n-moisturize again with cera ve moisturizing cream\n\nI have always had very oily combination skin. I then began to struggle more with dry skin. It was very noticeable since I wear makeup every day to work. Specifically around my breakouts which are mostly on my lower cheeks and chin would get super dry and flaky, and I realized that my skin was always feeling tight after washing and that the cera ve moisturizing lotion didn’t make my skin feel moisturized in the morning before makeup. I was at my wits end with my hormonal acne and decided to see if it was due to a damaged skin barrier. Recently I switched to the following skincare routine in order to replenish the moisture into my skin: \n\nAM: \n-wash face with water \n-moisturize with vanicream daily facial moisturizer \n-skin 1004 spf \n\nPM:\n-remove makeup with skin 1004 oil cleanser\n-wash with vanicream facial cleanser \n-moisturize with a mixture of vanicream daily facial moisturizer and vanicream moisturizing cream\n\nI have definitely noticed an improvement in the tightness and dryness of my skin. I still see some dryness around my breakouts, but I have definitely noticed an immediate improvement/lessening in those as well. \n\nI stopped using tretinoin in an effort to restore my skin barrier, but am still having texture issues around my chin/jawline with surface level breakouts and congestion/little bumps (pictured). Should I add an active back into my routine to help with this? I am hesitant to add anything to my routine as my skin is fairly sensitive. Any help with my routine would be greatly appreciated!",

I know that everyone loses hair naturally and when curled it will build up and all wash out at once, but it is still such a shock to see so much hair our when usually I never had anything out with straight hair. Even just combing through lightly I see hair leave. I'm guessing around a few hundred from every wash at least 300-500 or so.\n\nCan anyone reassure if this is normal? Or anything I can do to help?
