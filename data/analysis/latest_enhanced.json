Also leaving a bit of conditioner in the hair is an amazing tip. Thank god for this sub. No plopping this time either, as it just doesn't work for short hair I think. Or maybe I need to try it with better scrunching out, idk. But im happy!\n\nRoutine: Dove shampoo + Balea Traum Locken from DM + Locken curl cream. I didn't co-wash. ",

      "content": "I’m focusing on getting my curls healthy and bouncy after years of using damaging h.eat and heavy protein products, I’m finally finding what works for my hair type. \n\nIn the past I’ve been using h.eat on it ever since I was a kid to go to church or parties, without any protection oil ( the 90s), just damping h.eat from the h0t cur/ing ir0n. I got my first chemica/ re/axer at 12, which burned my scalp and caused a painful swirl of scabs and hair which was too painful to pull or comb. The things I’v done with my hair through the decades… But today a new day, a healthy way forward!\n\nIn 2024, I stopped using high h.eat, completely avoiding f/at ir0ns, and also quit co/oring my hair. At first, it made my hair look kinda worse, but thanks to these Reddit subs like this I think I’ve figured out part of the problem and the solution. Turns out I was overloading my curls with protein, and that just doesn’t work for my hair type anymore. Still figuring it all out, but I feel like I’m finally on the right track.\n\nWhen I used to si/k press my hair, I think it needed that superficial glow to look healthy, but wasn't, so I ended up using heavy coatings and lots of protein-based products. Now that I’ve stopped and don’t damp it in or anythin, the products just seem to sit on top of my hair instead of absorbing. I don’t really know the science behind it, but that’s what it feels like and look like.\n\nSo after a big clarifying wash this summer and switched products to light or none protein based product. I started washing with apple cider vinegar, only 1 time, I used way too much, because my hair looked scary dry. But I kept on using the new products and it’s already improved in just a couple of months and it feels like it is getting better with every wash.\n\nThe photos serie starts with my Day 7 hair  from last week, I was out and about, windy, traveling etc.\nSo when I got home I washed my hair when and kept my conditioner in overnight, too tired to style it. \n\nI documented the process, with a before &amp; after.\n\nI’m very much open to tips and advices!\n\n\n\n\n*Hair Routine + products in the photos \n\nProducts in order of use\n\nOnce a month Clarifying:\nGiovanni 50:50 Balanced hydrating clarifying shampoo.\nCurlsmith Mask Double Cream Deep quencher.\nRegular washing: 1 or 2 times a week\nKerastase Shampoo Curl Manifesto.\nKerastase Conditioner Curl Manifesto.\n\nStyling:\nGiovanni Curl defining Leave-in Curl Habit.\nGiovanni Curl shaping Gel Curl Habit.\nCurlsmith Frizz Rescue Curl Retainer.\nUmberto Giannini Boost Mousse Rosemary.\nMixed Chicks H.eat and Humidity protection serum.\n\nTools:\n-The Bounce curl brush  \n-Blow dryer diffuser with low h.eat and cold settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I asked an employee with visibly well maintained coily/thick hair for advice and she said Shea Moisture was way too heavy for me with my fine hair - that it contained glycerin and was too heavy for her hair type, so it was definitely the wrong choice for me. She recommended Nexxus Pure and Clean shampoo and conditioner and I'm trying it out now with nothing else changed in my routine, but my curls fall out of their curl pattern within the day. I spend the days between wash days with hair that looks like someone with wavy hair tried to straighten it.\n\nSo clearly this current shampoo and conditioner is not for me, but was she right that the other was too heavy for me and was weighing down my curls?\n\nWhat kind of products and routines do you use for your fine curly hair, and how long do your curls last?",

My skin type changes all the time. It used to be extremely oily, then for a while it was dry, and now it swings between oily and normal. I’ve always dealt with acne around my face and chin; blackheads primarily on the cheek, pimples (blind, whiteheads, etc.) everywhere. And then the scarring/PIH from picking at all of it… I’m so so tired of looking at my face especially when I have hair all over like I cant even call it peach fuzz; it makes my upper lip hair so prominent.\n\nI’ve started this skin care routine as of one week ago ago but please tell me what to remove and what to incorporate:\n\nAM\n\n\\- La Roche Posay (ew i know) Effacular Purifying Foam Gel Cleanser; circular motions; 30-60 seconds\n\n\\- Olay Super Serum; all over\n\n\\- Olay Total Effect Moisturizer alternating with Olay Super Creme\n\n\\- Super Goop Unseen Sunscreen\n\nPM\n\n\\- Rinse my face with the same face wash\n\n\\- Olay Total Effects Moisturizer\n\nOR\n\nPaula’s Choice Renewal Mask (1-2 overnights a week)\n\nProducts I HAVE:\n\nStar face cleanser and moisturizer with salicylic acid (plan to use this soon since I’ll be running out of my face wash). Obagi Medical Retinol. Obagi Daily Hydro Drops. Pan Oxyl wash.\n\nWhat do yall recommend I do? What other stuff should I use/incorporate?\n\n  \nThank you so much!",

Over the past month I gave up on all skincare and only wash my face with cetaphil cleanser after I run thats all and my skin has been getting much better? Much less acne redness had gone down but I had a dermatologist appointment yesterday and they prescribed me lymecycline and epiduo.\n\nJust looking for advice really on weather I should start using the lymecycline and epiduo as my skin has became much better and I don't want it getting worse again my main issue is the redness around my mouth from post inflammatory erythema which won't be helped from the lymecycline or epiduo also the acne I am getting is much smaller now and does not really bother me its just the redness I know most people recommend azelaic acid for redness / post inflammatory erythema but whenever I use anything like that my skin just becomes more irritated.",

It's either full of fragrance and foam that leaves your cheeks tight, or it's so gentle it barely cleans at all. \n\nMy skin's been yo-yoing between Sahara Desert and the oil refinery all month especially in this humidity. So, I've been experimenting with switching to the mild/gentle side of cleansers (the ones that claim to \"respect your skin barrier\"). \n\nAnd honestly? the difference hit me on day 3. No more that dry, squeaky feeling after washing. My skin actually feels normallll? Like I don't have to rush to slap on moisturizer immediately. \n\nApparently, these newer barrier -safe cleansers use things like ceramides, hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and other fancy humectants that keep your microbiome balanced (and I didn't even know we had one till last week).\n\nStill testing a few- Simple, Ponds, CeraVe, and this newer one that claims to have \"Vera-hyamino\" something. \n\nAnyone else switched to gentler facewashes lately??",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "I’ve always had itchiness and maybe dryness on my nose, but **since moving to an area with harder water**, it has turned to redness and worse. It has been nearly a year.\n\n**I am not prone to acne.**\n\n*I think* my skin type is combination dry but oily on my nose, although maybe it’s just dry considering my problem. I just think it’s oily because after a day it feels like build up there on my nose (I’m not an expert on this), but the red area itself is dry, flaky, and rough texture. My nose is also prone to blackheads.\n\n**Before moving to this area with harder water, my routine was a cetaphil daily cleanser and la roche posay triple repair daily moisturizer**. This usually held off the itchiness for the most part but still temporarily. Redness like this was never an occurrence.\n\nI don’t know much about skincare only browse here a bit, but after finishing the la roche posay I thought I should switch to something else as I figured it being “triple repair” that maybe it’s not good to continue a possibly strong/heavy product. I switched to vanicream around the same time that I moved and this worse redness has been the result.\n\n**My current routine is cetaphil gentle exfoliating SA cleanser, the ordinary glycolic acid exfoliating toner, and gold bond retinol overnight face lotion at night, and same cleanser la roche posay triple repair moisturizer during the day**, I went back on the latter hoping it would save me as it has in the past. I tried adding a toner to see if it would help. This routine helps a lot for a few hours / most of the day, but it doesn’t fix/cure the problem.\n\n**I use beauty of Joseon sunscreen**.\n\nI should note that as an adolescent over a decade ago, I was getting a big in-grown pimple on my nose that recurred two or three times. I don’t think it ever really popped, it just went away.\n\n**I should also note that I have mild psoriasis. It’s possible it’s that, but I have just never had it on my face before so it hasn’t occurred to me until now.**\n\nWith it being itchy I’ve wondered if I need something antibacterial? I don’t know. Any help is very much appreciated. I’ve dealt with this itchiness for much too long! \n",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
