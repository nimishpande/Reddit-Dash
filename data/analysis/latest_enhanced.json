Long story short, I didn't have the styling for a shaggy cut down for quite some time, as I was used to do a lot for my hair. I think I finally got it down, first picture is before cut, second picture after cut but styling struggles, last one is the final result. Routine, wash and condition with Q+A curl defining shampoo, and conditioner. Styling, Curlshow curlstyle milk, Curlshow multi use styling cream, Curlshow Curl Creator. Refresh, Curlshow curl style mousse. So, I rake the products with my fingers through my hair, scrunch, hover dry with diffuser, cast starts forming, diffuse, cast gets a little harder, start scrunching it out. Diffuse, hair dries more, cast start forming again, scrunch it out. I repeat this until it's as good as 95% dry. Little bit of black castor oil, rub it in the palm of my hands, apply to hair using praying hands method. ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

My mom does have the best skin despite being the oldest of all her female cousins by 10 to 20 years.\n\nThe markers that really do show their age are their necks, and even more so, the decolletage.

I also don't know how to make the styling last because my hair gets messy after sleeping and I always just brush it. My waves are still there after brushing it but they're less defined. Anyway, I used the OGX curl shampoo and conditioner, towel dried until damp, and then scrunched in curl cream. \n\nRoutine: \n\n1. Wash with OGX curl quenching shampoo and conditioner\n2. Towel dry until damp\n3. Scrunch in OGX curl quenching curl cream\n4. Air dry\n\nLast time, I diffused it and didnt like how it looked. This time, I air dried it and I think my waves look a lot more defined. Advice on how to make my waves last would be helpful. My hair gets messy overnight so I usually brush it out in the morning. I don't have satin or silk pillowcases or a silk bonnet so I just sleep on a cotton pillowcase. ",

      "content": "Hi!! I need some help with a good styling routine for my hair. I find that I just can't keep the waves through out the day, as they tend to fall easily.\n\nI have fine and thin hair. I'm pretty sure my hair is high porosity because it absorbs water quickly but also dries quickly. My hair really loved humid days!!\n\nI've also had a history of bleaching my hair, but I have been bleach free for almost 2 years now, and have only done bleach-free hair dyes.\n\nI'd like to establish a good routine the fits my wash schedule. Because my hair is so fine, my hair looks oily really easily, so it weighs down my roots really easily and just makes me look like a mess. \n\nMy normal wash routine is to wash every other day unless:\n- i need to go out and my oily roots are not presentable\n- post-gym session\n\nI only wash my hair during the day/morning, because I find I sweat a lot at night and my roots end up looking oily and weight down the next morning. I have tried training my scalp before, but ultimately, it never helped significantly and my hair also got smelly (not sure if high porosity makes it easier at picking up scents...) I'm also naturally a super sweaty gal so my roots get gross quickly. Updos can only hide my oily roots so much, and I find I feel more hot and sweaty if my second day hair is significantly more oily than usual. Not sure how to describe it, but essentially if I'm on my second day hair and it looks decent before I go out, I find I feel more sweaty and hot at my roots and end up looking super greasy while I am out. I've even had some embarrassing comments asking if my hair is still wet from my shower... which just shows how bad my hair and roots look even on the second day.... \n\nMy current hair routine is:\n- shampoo with gentle cleanser (double shampoo sometimes too stripping, and moisturizing shampoo sometimes too heavy)\n- squish and detangle with moisturizing conditioner \n- squish to wring out water\n- apply curl cream and squish waves\n- towel dry with squish method\n- dry with wide tooth comb attachment (occasionally diffuser but it causes more frizz)\n- finish with lightweight oil to seal cuticles \n\nI try to keep my routine a bit simple since I have to wash my hair more often. But would love some suggestions on a different routine that may hold my waves better. Affordable product recommendations would be greatly appreciated as well.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n(fyi tried to post on r/wavyhair but couldn't get it to post - sorry my hair isn't really curly!)",

She’s fair-skinned, and I’m olive brown.\n\n\n\nWhen I put it on, it gives more of a K-pop pastel look, and it just doesn’t sit right against my skin tone. The formula is great (and expensive 💸), so I really want to make it work instead of letting it sit in a drawer.\n\n\n\nAny tips on how to wear a light mauve lipstick on brown or olive skin?\n\nI don’t want to waste this lipstick — I just need it to look flattering and not ghostly.\n\nPlease help a confused brown girl out 😭💄",
