      "content": "Hi y'all! I just recently started looking into how to properly take care of my hair and began trying out a curly hair routine a couple days ago. This is how it looked this morning after showering, putting in products, and diffusing. I know that it takes time for curls to reach their full form, but I know there's room for improvement and I need some advice from the experts! First, here is my current routine/products I use:\n\n1. Kristen Ess Extra Gentle Shampoo and Conditioner\n\n2. Detangle with Wet brush, apply Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream \n\n3. apply Curlsmith Hydro Style Flexi Jelly, flip head upside down and scrunch\n\n4. apply John Frieda Frizz Ease Curl Reviver Mousse to roots and scrunch again\n\n5. plop hair in t-shirt for a few minutes\n\n6. diffuse until mostly dry, scrunch to break the gel cast, and put the hair near my part in a claw clip for a bit for volume\n\nSo far, I'm happy with the results of this routine, as my curls held their shape throughout the day, though my hair got a little less voluminous as time went on (and there wasn't too too much volume to begin with). The biggest thing I'm concerned about is that my hair looks dry and a little frizzy, especially towards the ends where it's more damaged, which I think is affecting the definition of my curls. I believe hair oil is a possible solution, so  if you have any  brand recommendations (preferably not super expensive, I'm a broke college student) or other ideas on how to fix it, let me know! Here's a list of other things I would love some advice on:\n\n\\- My roots and front pieces seem to have a very hard time curling, should I use more product there or a specific method?\n\n\\- What's the best way to refresh curls after sleeping on them? I've seen a lot of people say that you should avoid wetting them every day, so if that's the case, then what should I do?\n\n\\- I believe I have medium-to-high porosity hair. Lots of mixed opinions about oil usage on these hair types. Should I use it, and if so, when should I use it (before bed, to refresh hair, on wet hair, dry hair, etc.)?\n\nOk-- question tirade is over. Thank you in advance for your time and suggestions :)",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Mainly, the L’Occitane Shower Almond Oil, which I was most excited about. I love almond, oud, gourmand scents, and I love to layer scents throughout my getting ready process, so I was very hyped to try this and see how it layered into my routine. \n\nOh man was it horrific. The bottle was sealed and packaged well; it was not physically damaged or bulging/bloated suggesting a spoiled product. Upon first removing the inner plastic lining, the smell was mild but pleasant. I went to use it and with a small dollop in my palm, the fragrance was suddenly overwhelming and… metallic. Specifically, it smelled like pennies. Copper. Dirty change. I was really bewildered and thought maybe it was the water from the shower head suddenly bringing up some minerals (I live in an area with hard water and heavy chlorine treatment). Maybe it was one of my products mixing with this shower oil smell and causing a weird chemical reaction. Maybe it was my nose. It definitely couldn’t be this very hyped, quite expensive shower oil. \n\nBut lo’ and behold, upon lathering this oil up, I smelled distinctly like pennies and once I connected the scent to that imagery, it was over for me. I’ve since returned the product and definitely won’t be returning for a second chance. \n\nHas anyone else found this product to smell weird? I’ve had plenty of almond scented products and none have ever been so malodorous. ",

I was a lazy teenager but extremely self conscious. So one fine day I decided, this is enough. \n\nWeight loss:\n *I HATED GYM SOOO MUCH* so I decided to go calorie deficit. I am supposed to take 1700 calories but I would take 1000 calories or so and within 6-7 months I went from 85kgs to 56kgs. \n\nThe key is not to starve yourself but portion control and be mindful of how much you eat and what you eat. \n\nSkincare: \n\nSkin type: Normal combination skin. \n\n1. Identify the issue: I was extremely extremely tanned and my skin was damaged from the sun.\n\n2. Start slow and safe: \n- I started using Pixi 5% Glycolic acid, once every 2 weeks and then eventually built the tolerance up to be able to use it every alternate day. Please use only at night. \n\n- Salicylic acid 2% by The ordinary, I never really had an acne prone skin but my T-zonw was pretty oily so I would use it on the days when I wouldn't be using Glycolic Acid. \n\n- Moisturiser and Sunscreen were both by Re'equil and they have AMAZING results but I recently read that Re'equil products contain Myristyl Myristate which are highly comedogenic so I stopped using it. \n\n- Current skincare and healthcare: \n\nI ensure that all my nutritional requirements are met especially protein, some cheat meals are fine but remember to balance it. \nFor example: If I am on periods, I know sugar cravings will kick at night so I take chicken and rice with some veggies for lunch. *TRACK YOUR CALORIES BUT DON'T BE OBSESSED WITH THEM.* \n\nFor skincare, I use 12% Glycolic acid now once a week, 2% salicylic acid (They are currently paused cus I started introducing retinoids to my skin) 0.04% retinal and Anua Tranexamic acid (the pink bottle), LRP/BOJ sunscreen and Bioderma Atoderm moisturiser. \n\nPlease feel free to ask for queries. Kindly refrain from DMing because I hardly open the chat box. \n",

Possibly because I wasn’t using it correctly or so.. \n\nMy hair feels coarse and VERY dry, and frizzes up very fast. And it’s also quite voluminous.. childhood photos show that my hair grew out very big, like a lion’s mane from what my uncle would like to call it.\n\nI figured out I have medium-high porosity hair with around 2C-3A curls, but I’m not completely sure about it yet. \n\nI’ve tried brushing my hair after shower but it just makes it flat and products barely hold on, so I might try brushing before shower but I often just hop in the shower so I have to remember ",

      "title": "[Routine Help] any advice on improving my routine?",
      "content": "Hi everyone! I’m posting on here to hopefully get some advice and helpful tips on my skincare routine. I’ve been using this one for a little over a month now but I’m not an expert and am not sure if I should be doing something different. The medical grade stuff (benzoyl peroxide wash, topical solution, and 0.05% tretinoin) were all prescribed to me by my doctor a while ago but I just recently started using the tretinoin consistently, using it every other night. I do the sandwich method with my tret and top it off with the cicaplast gel, which has seemed to improve my flakiness, but I still use an exfoliating mask about twice a week. My skin type is mainly dry and I deal with mostly hormonal acne (I’m 20F) on my cheeks and chin. Any advice is greatly appreciated!! Thanks guys.",

Have these red dots appearing on and off mostly on thighs and calves. No itch, no pain. Feels rough where the bumps are. Have seen doctor (GP only). They have no idea, no diagnosis… except suggested I change body wash. Hoping someone has / seen something similar and know what is this condition I have. I can then figure out what’s the cause and treatment. Condition has spread and over a year long. Thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions.",
