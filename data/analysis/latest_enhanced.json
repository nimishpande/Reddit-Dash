      "title": "I think my hairdresser is going to give me a different color because she doesn’t agree with what I want. What should I ask for specifically so she doesn’t do this?",
      "content": "(The first 4 pictures are of the color I want and the last picture is my hair currently)\n\nHi everyone, I need some advice and I want to make sure I explain everything clearly so everyone can understand the situation.\n\nI’ve been wanting to dye my hair magenta pink since September 2024, and this December I finally scheduled a professional appointment to get it done properly. My hair type is 4B, and I’ve tried to get this color by doing it myself FOUR times already. Every attempt didn’t turn out as expected because I don’t know how to do it properly, which is why i decided to go to a professional and pay over $300\n\nRight now my hair has long virgin roots and the ends are a faded ginger color from previous dye attempts. I’ve bleached my hair twice in the past.\n\nToday I had a conversation with my hairdresser (over text) about the color I want. I had already made the appointment before this, and shes already seen the color but I had a few questions on how she was going to do it, and if she thought she would be able to get me to that color. And after the conversation i genuinely think she isn’t going to give me the color I’m asking for because she doesn’t like it. Originally when I showed her the picture she made a face when she saw it. She asked me if I was sure I didn’t want to try out a different one and I told her no, that I was absolutely sure this is what I’ve want and I’ve wanted it for so long. Now back to the conversation tonight, she said she wants to do a bleach and then a “rinse out” to get my hair to the color I want. From what I understand a rinse out usually involves adding a different color first, and then letting it fade to get the color that you want, which is what they do for lighter or pastel colors, not vivid bold colors like what I want\n\nI told her that I didn’t think this really make sense for the color I want, because magenta pink is very saturated and vivid, not light or pastel. But she said this would be the best to get my hair exactly how I want it, and she suggested making the back of my head a darker color/darker version of whatever color she plans to put in for this rinse out in order to get it to “blend in” with the full color. I started getting a little frustrated because I don’t understand what it’s supposed to blend into since the color I want is solid throughout the entire head\n\nThis whole conversation makes me feel like she doesn’t actually agree with the color and might not give me the exact result I want, instead doing something she thinks will “look better” rather than following my reference.\n\nI didn’t want to push it and I didn’t want to upset her, (since you know I’m trusting her with my hair this December) so I just left it there and thanked her for taking the time to speak to me and I wished her a good day\n\nI want to make sure when I go in for my appointment that the hairdresser doesn’t change things up and I want to make sure I get the color I’ve been wanting for over a year, without any unnecessary adjustments or personal opinions about what “suits me.”\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on what exactly I should say or ask to make sure she follows the color I want? On how I can properly and kindly communicate my preferences clearly so there’s no confusion about any rinse outs, a darker back, and sticking to the vivid magenta pink I want? Are there any tips for getting the most vibrant result on 4B hair that has some previously dyed ends?\n\nI really want to get this right because I’ve waited over a year for this color and I’ve tried so many times on my own without success. Any advice, tips, or anything I can use with my hairdresser would be hugely appreciated.\n\n\nI don’t really have any other options except her, I live in a very very small town (I’m talking like one of everything and everybody knows everybody etc) and she is the only hairdresser here unless I want to drive hours to somewhere else and I’ll have to make a whole new appointment for that and look for a new stylist etc. \n\nI’ve seen her do highlights on people with natural/afro hair before and it always looks really good so I have faith in her.

It helped a *lot*, and I’m really grateful I found that combo, I still get a few whiteheads but they’re not all over my face anymore.\n\nI have always been interested in actual Azelaic Acid products, as it seems to help a lot for these red, tiny whiteheads I get but it isn't allowed in Indonesia and Singapore (where I live now for uni)\n\nHowever, Korean and Japanese brands are more available here, so I’m looking for alternative ingredients (especially for toners and toner pads) that:\n\n* help exfoliate small whiteheads / closed comedones, and\n* also calm/reduce redness.\n\nA bit more context: I get closed comedones as well, and I’m using retinol (but it doesn't seem to help much when I would breakout more). Any ingredient names, specific product types (pads vs liquid toners vs leave-on exfoliants), or product recs you’d suggest? Thanks in advance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3d6yhuinkzf1.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ac4a25f145bb391a432f912c86d5cb0f896d6ca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hy2s50tinkzf1.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f3d2a8be758e7356aa345aa0c895cd9ac8c3a6c\n\n",

Wrinkles?” 😅  \nThat’s when I realized she’s also become aware of her wrinkles.\n\nSo I wanted to ask: would it actually help if I bought her a **retinol cream or serum**?

      "content": "Hello! I've been doing the curly girl method for about four years now ever since the pandemic. My hair texture has changed throughout the years and I am convinced it is one part stress, one part stopping birth control, one part hair color, and another part being having low iron. I'm currently 22 and I was advised to stop taking it by my OB. After a change of vitamins and routine, I can say that my hair has slightly improved, but my post shower hair routine might need a few tweaks now. \n\nI was doing leave-in conditioner, gel, and an oil (in that order) for the longest time but I've learned its been weighing my hair down and making it more strangly so I've stopped reaching for the oils as an attempt for my hair to adjust without it. \n\nMy routine now is leave in conditioner and gel and I'm using budget friendly products available in my area however I think my hair gel is making my hair really crusty and stiff so if there are any suggestions on good lightweight gels that will enhance my curls, give it hold, but also make it soft, smooth, and not stiff to the touch and appearance, that would be very helpful. Another plus would be it being budget friendly. Also, if there are any alternatives that you guys might be using that will take the place of gel, anything is appreciated. Also, my hair is very dense 2c asian hair if that helps. \n\nTY SO MUCH IN ADVANCE!!!",

      "title": "[Routine Help] I've been a soap (on the face too) and moisturizer guy all my life. But I've wanted to get an at least half decent skincare routine and I need some tips on it. Please give me advice!!!",
      "content": "So basically, my daily routine looks like this at the moment:  \nWake up, shower before school, moisturize/sunscreen  \nCome back (1-4pm), shower immediately (house rule), moisturize and call it a day\n\nQuick background info: I have combination skin (so an oily T zone, normal everything else). I wake up with my face pretty oily and nasty feeling (probably because of me using soap on my face). I'm planning on adding a double cleansing I also have noticed laugh lines forming on my face (I'm 19) so I'm hoping to clear that up a bit with retinol. I'm also not rich so this has to be affordable\n\nBased on what I looked up here's what I'm planning to do:\n\nMorning routine:\n\n1. Wake up, step into the shower\n2. Clean my body with soap or whatever everywhere but my face which is only touched by water\n3. Either step out or while still in the shower, do a single step cleanse. **Though I'm not sure if it should be with a water based/foam cleanser or an oil cleanser**. Part of me thinks it's supposed to be the oil cleanser because like dissolves like and all that but the other part of me feels like the water cleanser is the better option to avoid over stripping my face (or does that not matter as much here because it's just a single step cleanse?).\n\nEither way, after the single step cleanse, I moisturize with a light, non-greasy moisturizer (would appreciate brand recommendations) and finishing with a generous sunscreen application. I heard mineral sunscreen is good but right now I'm using a chemical sunscreen. From what I understand, the chemical sunscreen isn't going to give me super cancer or anything and is about as effective as a mineral sunscreen, just not as greasy or thick feeling, which I like. Do I have to switch to mineral or is it fine as is? I'm using Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen if anyone was wondering.\n\nEvening/Coming home routine:\n\n1. Come home, immediately step into the shower. Again, clean off the rest of my body except for my face.\n2. **Here's also where I need help**. I'm trying to incorporate double cleansing as part of my skincare. Do I do that now? If so, I'd do it now, and then moisturize. I'd then just apply retinol at the end of the day as part of my bedtime routine when I brush and floss.\n\nHOWEVER, with the way people describe double cleansing at night, it reads to me like a \"right before bed\" kind of thing. But then if I'm supposed to double cleanse at night, what do I do when I'm in the shower in the late afternoon/early evening? A single step cleanse? With what, oil or foam cleanser? I'd presume the oil cleanser to get the cream, sunscreen and grime off my face from the day though I'm not sure. Either way, in this scenario, I'd do that single step oil cleanse, moisturize, and right before bed, do an actual double cleanse and apply retinol, moisturize and then go to bed. But I have a feeling that's doing too much...\n\nIf anyone could validate what I have so far and help me with what I don't get, that'd be really appreciated. I don't know why I've been doing what I'm doing for this long but something has to change. Also, I'm planning on getting my retinol from The Ordinary, as well as the cleansers too: Squalane Cleanser for the first oil step and Glucoside Foaming Cleanser for the second water step",

I did some follow-up reading suggesting this might be caused by retinol usage. So, I discontinued retinol. Shortly after, I found that my skin was becoming sensitive to CeraVe PM. It would get quite red, almost like a mild rash was forming. I have no idea why. A reaction to the niacinamide perhaps?\n\nSo, my skincare routine has been paired down to sunscreen and Vanicream. Vanicream is not causing any problems, but it's heavy and greasy. And I feel like my fine lines are becoming more pronounced without retinol in my routine. As well, my stretched pores have not resolved themselves.\n\nI'm a bit lost. I need something that will combat fine lines, shrink pores, and not react with my fairly sensitive skin.\n\nAny suggestions?",

I let my hair air dry and sleep in two plaits and a silk bonnet. \n\nMy hair currently has a deep wave that lasts all day, is very thick and below my shoulders. \n\nI’ve spent a long time trying products and I’m so exhausted. But I want to try again because I love my hair!!\n\nI shampoo twice and then condition. I was using the tsubaki mask but recently haven’t repurchased and I’m wanting something suited to my hair texture. \n\nPlease give me a routine and suggestion(s) if you have any!

An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
