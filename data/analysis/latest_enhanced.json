I think I need to take care of it differently\n\nthe current routine:\n\n\\- vichy dercos sensitive shampoo\n\n\\- the ordinary behentrionium chloride 2% conditioner\n\n\\- harologi rebuild spray, every third wash for 5 min\n\n\\- hask curl defining cream, scrunched in\n\n\\- air dry or dry with diffuser\n\nthe pictures have been taken on wash day after diffuser drying and brushing once completely dry\n\nI suspect that this routine is drying out my hair a bit too much and I think the curl cream is too heavy. I‘m not sure whether the uneven curl pattern is due to my products not being ideal (the top layer is quite dry) or if that‘s just naturally what my hair does now\n\nI‘d like to try new products and techniques but am having a hard time navigating the sea of options. Any advice I can start researching from is appreciated :) I kind of don‘t know where to begin, that curl cream belonged to my ex and I just stuck with it lol\n\nalso… please be very honest, I feel like the back of my hair looks tragic ;-; do you think I should cut it shorter? I love the way it curls in the front at this lenght but whenever I see a picture of me at a slight angle or from the back I feel pain\n\nthank you!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

It’s helped sooo much with the burning, especially around my eyes. I’ve been doing just those two for 7 days. Well I wanted to add in mosterizer so I did the one some suggested. The one I added in the photos. The calm and restore by aveeno. I immediately started feeling burning and redness. My stupid self waiting 5 minutes thinking it would go away. Wrong. So I washed it off and I got immediately relief. I’m so upset because I patch tested it on the my hand, neck, the back of my neck and near my ear for a week straight and I had no reaction. I’ve NEVER had a reaction like this before. I wanna know if this has happened to anyone else with this product and if anyone has any recommendations for moisturizers. ",

I use the derma-code serum and moisturizer my go to’s as you can see in the picture lol. And yes I collect my bottles they’re very pretty haha. \n\nOk so last time I asked about incorporating just one more product into my daily routine. I had some great recommendations one I adopted religiously for about a month was a vitamin C serum someone recommended. Whit it brightened my skin for a few weeks then disaster I started piling a lot. I’m not sure what it was. For context I like my routines minimal because of my sensitive skin issue. I just want one more product ti add. My current stack is cleanser CeraVe, followed by derma- code serum then derma-code moisturizer, and lastly my sunscreen from EltaMD. \n\nI feel my routine is too basic and I don’t use or care for tretinoin or anything that’ll mess with my barrier. I finally have it under control with derma-code. \n\nFor image context I’ve been using this stuff for a little over 2 and a half months now and I use it day and evening and on days off from work I use it in between. I use more than I should because it’s the only stuff that makes my skin comfortable and fells protected. That’s why I have so many empties. \n\nMy question 🙋🏻‍♀️ what is one more product worth adding to my routine for a basic routine? What’s missing? I would mind trying vitamin c serum again but one that stays consistent and doesn’t change over a few weeks. So based on my skin concerns which are very close to being obsolete. What can I do to maintain my current glow for the long run. I don’t want it to begin fading again. \n\nThanks and looking forward to recommendations from everyone. ",

I wasn’t sure exactly what to tag this, as it could be either acne, ingrown hairs, some skin condition, or all three maybe, but you can take a good look at the pictures and see that my skin is all bumpy, and acne filled too in some places. The skin on my hands look wrinkly, and that’s after i put on lotion😭 fyi, i have a lot of body hair, i hate all of it and try to shave the hand hair off consistently, while shaving my arms every month or so, but it seems like it either A. Always results in looking this, or B. It looks like this regardless, and I just don’t know what it is. I’ve tried various different methods of shaving to see if it helps. I use tree hit bare - moisturizing shave oil (coconut lime) while I shave, and then I use Loasu soft serve after shave oil as my after shave. I’ve tried multiple shaving devices. I’ve used 2 or 3 different shavers, mainly the Philips morello one blade 360, but also the Philips Norelco Bodygroom Series 7000. I have tried one razor, that being the gilette Venus, but it usually turns out with this same result. I’ve tried shaving using these things with and without the shaving oil, I’ve tried applying and not applying the aftershave, that doesn’t work too well either. And of course, it doesn’t really seem like any lotion makes it look much better either… I’m really not that well educated on this stuff so I really apologize if this post seems really dumb, but I have no clue what’s supposed to work for me, and I can’t stand my arms and hands looking so gross, especially only at 19 years old, in fact, this is happening in literally any place I shave accept maybeeee my face, which still looks kinda yucky. Maybe it’s because I’m a man, I’m not sure if that has to do with anything, but that doesn’t mean I like it. So if anyone could please help I’d really appreciate it.",

I’ve been using curl cream for years on someone else’s advice and I didn’t realize what it was really for. \n\nI didn’t want that springy condensed look for my hair, so now I can get visible length and stretch with the gel.

      "content": "Honestly this will sound like more of a rant because I'm convinced I will never find a solution, and I know I probably sound dramatic too. I'm open to trying ANY other tips and suggestions that I haven't done already. The only thing I physically can’t use is anything with lanolin or any variant of lanolin since I’m pretty sure I’m allergic now. I would prefer no essential oils or fragrance or menthol too, but I’m desperate so I’m willing to just put up with it.\n\nI have tried every single notable lip product and balm that’s popular right now. Laneige, Ole Henriksen, almost all Asian beauty lip masks and balms, pretty much all the popular squeeze tube lip balms/masks on the market right now, lanolin, THE WORKS. I've tried applying face moisturiser after my shower and using a sealant like Vaseline on top. I've tried using hyaluronic acid and using a sealant on top. I've tried every single Vaseline variant you can think of. ALL forms of Aquaphor, Jack Black and Blistex – including the medicated ones. I’ve tried gentle exfoliating acids like mandelic or lactic. I've tried 8 glasses of water daily with avid electrolytes to boot. I’ve changed my toothpaste so that it no irritants or SLS or fragrance. I’ve tried plain natural oils and butters or natural oils and butters mixed together. \n\nFor context, I’m 19 and live in the UK, so the air is not too humid or dry; it's more so just cold and dull all the time. On top of that, the free healthcare here means that they only really give you bare minimum advice. When I went to my GP, all they really said was to drink water and use Blistex or Vaseline. I know it can’t possibly be due to ageing or hormones, since my blood work and hormone levels are always good, and I already stated my age so that’s that. \n\nMy lips are never dry to the point of extreme bleeding or extremely intense cracking (unless I go more than a week without Vaseline); it’s just that they are chapped and hardened and dry ALL the time. I know I sound like I’m complaining, but they're never soft or smooth, ever. The only things that have ever worked for me are Vaseline and lanolin. Usually I’ll apply a thick coat of Vaseline, and after an hour or so, if I wipe it off, my lips are fully smooth and “hydrated” with no cracks or lines or dryness at all. This lasts about 2 minutes (no exaggeration) unless I apply Vaseline again. I know I’m being picky, but I don’t love the feeling of constantly having Vaseline on my lips, and on top of that I need to keep reapplying it every 30 minutes if it isn't a thick coat, because it usually whitens up or disappears anyway (and a thick coat out in public on me looks kind of crazy). If I don’t apply Vaseline after wiping the thick coat off, I can physically feel my lips drying up more and more every minute. \n\nLanolin worked for me the same way Vaseline did, but I soon developed what I assume to be an allergy and ended up getting actual dry, painful bleeding like never before; it gave me an odd scaly texture as well. I quit using it quickly, but I still tried Aquaphor (even though it has lanolin alcohol), thinking it might be better since so many people swear by it and it isn’t PURE lanolin on its own but mixed with other ingredients. Big mistake, the same bad results that I had with the lanolin happened, and when I tried Jack Black variants with lanolin, it happened again. \n\nNo part of my face is this dry besides my lips, and I would say I have pretty normal skin overall. As far back as I can remember, my lips have always been this way, ever since I was a kid, just always chapped. They're not extremely scaly or keratinised to the point where I might have to consider the fact that I have a condition. Just never ever soft or smooth or hydrated. If I don't use Vaseline, they usually just have a dry hardened layer on top and are chapped. I assumed maybe my lips had become dependent on Vaseline, so I stopped for a week or so and used other treatments, but they were just the same throughout. I don’t use any fragrance allergens or makeup that could cause my lips to be this way, so I don’t really understand what I’m doing wrong. I have zero nutrient deficiencies, and my day to day diet is healthier than the average person - I know it is because I improved it extensively over the past year just to see if it would fix my issue. I don’t pick at, bite, or lick my lips either. \n\nEvery single treatment or balm or variant I mentioned above simply sits on top of my lips, even when applying a thick amount, it just floats on top of my lips, I can still feel the dryness and chapped feeling underneath it; it never goes away even if I literally just sit still for a few hours and do nothing/wipe it off after. I’ve tried using products overnight, nothing ever changed. I know I sound like I’m complaining, but I don’t know what else to do. I feel like I just wasted time and copious amounts of money for nothing. I’m a uni student now so I can’t even afford that anymore, so within the past month I fully gave up and just use Vaseline occasionally, but I really don’t want to be like this forever. \n\nI know that people say you need a combination of humectants, emollients, and occlusives in a lip product, etc., and believe me, I’ve tried. I can recite some product ingredient lists by heart I’ve checked so many. I’ve done a bunch of research but nothing has worked, no lip product I’ve tried works for me. Again, the only thing that Vaseline is technically doing is just exfoliating off the dead skin layer. I’ve tried sugar scrubs and lip scrubs and lemon and honey, etc.; all it does is either cut up my lips or maybe keep them tasting nice for a bit lol. I’ve tried menthol or peppermint in lip balms, but that just burns and irritates my lips for me, and most essential oils and fragrances in products give me hyperpigmentation after prolonged use (most of the lip treatments above have done this damage as well). I don’t ever wear any lip makeup now because it just ends up looking terrible due to my lips underneath. \n\nI went into detail and context so that no one would waste their time giving me advice that I have already tried and proved to not work for me, so I’m sorry for such a long essay. \n\nI just want to know if there is anything left out there for me at all, I just want to be normal for once, I feel like out of everyone I know I’m the only person with this issue. If there is anyone that has any tips or product recommendations AT ALL, please, PLEASE let me know.\n\nThank you\n\n",
