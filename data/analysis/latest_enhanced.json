For back story, I had dreadlocks for 10 years and recently cut out the parts that were damaged by bleaching/coloring and brushed out the rest to get a nice restart back into the curly girly lifestyle. Keeping length is really important to me as my curls are so tight, it takes a while to get any length. I feel like the hair dresser took off more than needed and my hair is shorter than when I first had it cut 6 months ago. \nI've uploaded two videos for reference, sorry if they're not that good, I barely take photos or videos 😭  the one posted is the current cut. I feel like it's very short and round. I'll post the other vid in the comments. It was from last week.

My hair gets dirty at around day 3 but I heard I should shower once a week instead because of my hair type. I also heard that your hair being a little dirty is normal and shouldnt warrant a wash day unless its super dirty, but idk how true that is. My hair doesnt really get oily but having a dirty scalp makes me feel so icky.. BUT If I wash it too early my hair might get damaged??😭😭 Idk anymore. \n\n\nWhen do you wash your hair and why do you wash it that often?\n\n\nI have 2c-3b, very high porosity, medium thick hair.\n\nMy routine:\n1.

I dyed it black in march, used 3 box dyes, then touched up the roots in may and beginning of june. I decided I don’t want it to be black anymore and decided to have a balayage. My hairdresser informed me it would get damaged.\n\nSo, here’s the timeline of how things went down: \n11th of june had it bleached and dyed brown\n12th of june had it dyed brown again, because the color wasn’t what we wanted\n25th of june had the actual balayage done\n\nall this with professional dyes and bleach in a salon setting\n\nIt didn’t look that bad for the first month or two, but right now it’s terrible. I had it trimmed a couple of times the last 2 months and each time, after less than a week, white dots appear on the ends and after a few days the ends get split. this is my main problem. I don’t mind it being dry but these split ends are killing me, especially because they re-appear in the span of a week after trimming them. I tried the l’oreal elvive bond repair routine, followed it for roughly two months, and nothing changed. right now I am using professional deep cleansing shampoo and a hair mask, that I buy from the salon, and wash my hair every 2-3 days. “stop using heat” isn’t applicable in this case because even without heat it’s the same thing.\n\nI really need help with this. I’ve thought about dying the whole hair brown, so that the split ends aren’t so obvious, and because hair dye sometimes makes the hair appear healthier. I don’t want to cut it short, because then it would look weird because the balayage is grown out, and because split ends would appear again. my roots are around 8cm since the balayage.",

Ended up waiting a few days and attempted to bleach again (both times were 20 vol for about 30-40 minutes) which did come out a little bit more even (last pic) and then covered with 5A semi permanent dye. I left it on my roots longer to attempt a root smudge but my natural hair is almost like black so I probably needed to do that with a darker dye. \nThe goal here is to have some blonde highlights, obviously not gonna get super light with all the dye that has now gone on them. Wanting to attempt another shot at highlighting with a 10 volume and maybe just toner afterwards but unsure if I should color strip my whole head now or should I just hope some comes out as I wash my hair?? In some lightings it looks kinda good, in others it looks really uneven so I’m just up for any suggestions. \n\nAlso how can you tell if your hair is okay to bleach again? I didn’t have any breakage but it was pretty dry afterwards. I do plan on waiting a few weeks before trying again and using olaplex, hair oils and hair masks in the meantime.\n\nDisclaimer: I’m aware I am not a professional, the salon is not financially accessible to me right now and in the end it’s just hair. If I fuck it up it’ll grow back. ",

My skin often looks dull and tired, and it feels like it’s lost its glow, plumpness, and elasticity. I’m just starting out with skincare and honestly don’t want to overwhelm myself with too many products or spend a fortune.\n\nRight now, I’m thinking of getting a gentle cleanser (something that won’t irritate my dermatitis), a serum (not sure whether I should go with niacinamide for calming inflammation and oil control or vitamin C for brightening and elasticity), a lightweight moisturizer, and a good sunscreen that won’t make my skin greasy or irritated.\n\nMy budget is about ₹1200 max for the essentials. I’ve been looking at some Minimalist products (seen my good minimalist reviews here)  but still confused about what to prioritize, especially the serums.\n\nIf anyone has similar skin issues or has suggestions for effective, beginner-friendly products that won’t break the bank, I’d really appreciate your input. Also, any tips on how to introduce these products without messing up my skin would be awesome.\n\nThanks so much!",

I want to stop it from getting worse and hopefully lighten them a bit.\n\nCan you recommend:\n\n- Lip balms that won’t cause more hyperpigmentation (bonus if they reduce it).\n\n- Lip tints/lipsticks that actually show up nicely on pigmented lips.\n\n- Lip liners that work for medium Indian tones.\n\n- Ingredients or habits to avoid (things that darken lips).\n\nI’m currently eyeing mars velvet lip tint in shade three words, and also I am currently using Vaseline rose lips for night, and dot &amp; key spf 50 lip balm for day, and blue heaven water tint for outings -should I change something?\n\nAlso open to natural or tinted options that don’t dry the lips.\nWould love to hear what worked for you all ✨\n\nThanks in advance!",

I’m in Australia so preferably products that are sold in Australia or products that I could easily ship here. I have a mixture of different types on waves throughout my hair, I also have straight hair on the underside which is very annoying. My hair was bleached for around 6 years, I think this is why I’m struggling with straight ends even on the wavy strands from damage. Sidebar: does anyone have any tips on how to remedy this or do I simply need to wait until the damaged hair grows out and chop it off? One side of my hair is significantly more wavy than the other, I presume this is also stress and damage from me sleeping on one side. Pics 1&amp;2 are the same day but shows the difference between both sides of my hair. I do try to wear a silk bonnet to bed but I find it uncomfortable and usually will take it off in my sleep.\n\nMy current routine is: I wash my hair 2-3 times per week.\n\n•\t⁠Shampoo and condition with redken extreme anti snap.\n•\t⁠Once a week I will use k18 bind repair treatment in place of conditioner.\n•\t⁠After my shower I use kerastase nutritive lotion Thermique sublimatrice heat protectant.\n•\t⁠Then I use Kristen ess leave in curl crème, I apply this in sections through my hair, then use a curl creating crush to brush it through and separate strands, then I scrunch my hair. I do this all round my hair.\n•\t⁠Then I use the not your mother curl talk sculpting gel and follow the same process as above.\n•\t⁠I then plop my hair using a microfiber towel to absorb excess moisture and product for 15 mins or so. Then I let it air dry.\n\nI really struggle with frizz, my hair is sometimes even frizzy while it’s wet, so I struggle to find a balance between the right amount of products and my hair either being crispy, or not-defined and frizzy. I’m not entirely sure I’m using the correct products for my hair type either. All hair care and styling recommendations and tips will be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",

I see online there are different shampoos, blow dry techniques, pre-styling products, etc beyond just putting some clay in your hair after showering and moving the hair around until it's going the direction you want. I've been to barbers that'll do that last part but I'm not satisfied and I'm wondering if I can go to someone that'll go above and beyond and teach me the routine I need for the results I want. Does this exist for men with relatively short hair? I live in NYC if anyone has specific recommendations but more general what to look for suggestions are great too.",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
