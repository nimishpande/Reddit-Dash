The pictures are taken almost exactly one year apart.\nMy routine includes a clarifying and a moisturizing shampoo from a drugstore in my country (Rossmann - the brand is called Isana). \nAfterwards I use the Garnier “Method for Curls”-Mask as a conditioner.\nI brush in a gel (also by Isana - Curltastic Scrunch Gel), and afterwards a foam (mostly Wellaflex - Curls Definition Mousse). I do this on soaking wet hair because it tends to bring out the best results. I then scrunch my heart out (first with bare hands, then into an old tshirt) spray on some heat protection (Elvital - Defeat The Heat spray) and diffuse on medium heat, medium speed.\nLastly I scrunch out the remaining gel cast with the Pantene Pro-V Argan Infused Oil.\nI sleep with my hair up in a bun on a satin pillowcase. No refresh routine.\n\n",

      "content": "*Sorry for the long text and all the pictures. It’s my first time on this sub, so I hope it’s okay here. (Please bear with me, English is my second language🙏🏻.)*\n\n**Quick summary :**\n\nBasically, I would love to achieve a slightly longer hairstyle and be able to retain volume without losing coverage on my forehead. As explained below, I struggle with my texture, so any suggestion/advice/opinion would help (haircut, products, knowledge...) I feel like my hair is a weakness, and I want to change that 😉\n-----\n\nSo, I cut and style hair for friends and family all the time, but I never figured out my own 😅. Every time I come close, the texture changes…\n\nFor most of my life, I had wavy hair. But the older I get, the curlier it becomes, and recently the change has been particularly noticeable. I’m actually excited about it — I love textured hair — but I’m completely lost right now.\n\n**About my hair:**\n\n• I think I have low density, coarse hair\n\n• I have a large, square forehead, which makes it hard to get a full-looking fringe. \n\n• My front section grows in the opposite direction -- *when I get a buzz cut there's a clear V-shape above my hairline where the hair changes direction*\n\nBecause of this, my hair naturally wants to stand up on top of my head, and I have to get it wet every morning to lay it back down. \n\nAs a teenager, when my hair was straighter, I would wake up looking like Syndrome from The Incredibles (included last picture just for fun😂).\n\nNow that it’s more curly, some days it’s giving Bob Dylan, some days Edward Scissorhands… and very rarely, it’ll look acceptable and I won’t touch it (picture 1 and 2 was one of those days.) *Still very messy, and the fringe is looking boneless 😬.*\n\n**Routine/Styling:**\n\nI’ve been meaning to grow my hair out a little — I think it would balance out my strong bone structure in a nice way — but every time it gets longer, I struggle. So for now, I just keep it short and style it like when it was straighter.\n\n• I wash it about 3 times a week\n\n• I use a mask. *currently, no conditioner*\n\n• When it’s wet, I lay it down and arrange it so it air dries nicely. For hold I either use matte paste when wet, or iI'll use powder later when it's dry. *At this point, it looks very flat and thin (picture 3,4 and 5)*\n\n• Once it’s dry, I rearrange it — with or without powder on my fingers (separate the strands, lift up the roots, etc.) *I add hairspray on windy days.*\n\n*I have no specific sleeping routine and I just refresh with water without adding products.* (Styled hair on picture 6,7 and 8)\n\nIt works for now, but I don’t actually love this flat hairstyle on me — somedays I feel like a playmobile and honestly, styling my hair is the worst part of my mornings…\n\nIn the past, I did try defining the curls with leave-ins or gel (although it’s been over a year, so it might look different now with tighter curls?) and it would always look weighed down and boneless, with my scalp showing — even with the smallest amount of product. Maybe my hair is just too thin to be in clumps 🤷🏻‍♂️.\n\n**Product list :**\n\nShampoo - Pantene (volume line)\n\nMask - Garnier Fructis (currently, the banana superfood one)\n\nMatte paste - Taft (molding styling clay)\n\nStyling powder and hairspray - Taft (volume line)\n\n-----\n\nOkay, that was all the important details, I think.\n\nSo basically, my goal is to get a longer, more free/natural-looking hairstyle, that compliments my texture. I would like to retain volume without losing coverage on my forehead. And if it could be low maintenance too, at least in the morning, that would be life-changing 😩.\n\nThanks for reading!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I've had blond foils mixed with my natural hair colour for the last couple of years as I was told this was the best way to cover it, and although the hairdressers did a good job, I personally hate being blond. In my past I've gone dark brown, pink, blue, purple. I'd love to go dark brown again. What's my best/ least maintenance option? Full head colour and keep doing the roots every 6 weeks (or less?), would brown foils help or not hide greys at all?  Can i mix brown and blond to hide the greys but have it mostly dark or does this look bad? Also I'm only grey at the front along the scalp, nothing at the back yet.\n\nI'm really lazy with my hair, it's straight thick medium brown, I wash brush and let it dry naturally, I don't do any styling and go to the hairdressers on average once per year, but will make an effort to go more often to do roots if i can have dark hair!",

Decided to try a curly routine with mousse and diffusing and it went really wrong!\n\nOn damp/wet hair I put a handful of mousse and rubbed it all through my hair from ends to roots and combed my hair. I then thought it looked too stringy so I put some more mousse in my hairs and scrunched the mousse into the ends. I then diffused for about 30 mins. After diffusing I scrunched out the crunch for about 10 mins with 5 drops of the oil in my hands. \n\nMy thoughts: it looked too stringy when the mousse was in so this is obviously part of the issue, should I try twisting my hair into thicker clumps? Also wondering if I used too much mousse or should never have combed it after the mouse was in? Any advice very appreciated.

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m looking for some advice and personal experiences. I was recently traveling for a long time and hit a \"perfect storm\" of travel stress and environmental changes that caused the worst stubborn acne breakout of my life. Because I was on the move, I couldn’t start any professional treatments at the time.\n\nNow that I’m back, my active acne has finally healed, but I’m left with dark spots, a broken skin barrier, and one very deep, pitted cyst scar with wall on my cheek that is my main concern.\n\nI visited a dermatologist, and she gave me these options:\n\nDermapen (Microneedling) + Exosomes (She recommended this as the \"best\" for my current state).\n\nFractional CO2 Laser.\n\nDermaroller (though I’ve heard mixed things about this for deep scars).\n\nShe also suggested regular chemical peels in between sessions. I had my first Salicylic Acid peel yesterday, and my skin is currently feeling very irritated and sensitive.\n\nMy Big Concern:\n\nWhile researching, I learned that if a scar is \"tethered\" (pulled down by internal fibers), surface treatments like lasers or needles won't lift it unless those fibers are cut first via Subcision. My doctor didn't mention this, and I’m worried about spending money on Dermapen if the scar is held down from below.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on:\n\nIf you had deep scars after a breakout, did Dermapen + Exosomes actually work, or did you have to do Subcision first?\n\nHow did you handle chemical peels while your skin barrier was still healing?\n\nFor those who did Exosomes, was the extra cost worth it for the healing speed and barrier repair?\n\nI’m nervous because this is my first time doing \"whole face\" treatments and the online reviews are so conflicting. Any guidance would be huge. Thanks!",

She told me not to use curl cream bc it was too heavy. While the waves are certainly more defined than they were, I’m still underwhelmed with the results.

Which would you suggest?\n\nOpen to other options too if a 20 ml bottle is below 800. I just happen to like minimalist a lot.\n\nThank you in advance!",

I've been trying to test out what the issue is for a while - I was using the new Umberto Giannini Banana Jelly and I think I discovered it was too moisturising and too heavy. However, this is still happening with new Flora &amp; Curl products I'm trying. \n\nMy hair feels soft to touch, so I'm wondering if they're still over moisturised and don't need any leave in/cream at all? I tried gel only with the banana jelly, and it still happened. I suppose I can try gel only with other gels like the flora &amp; curl but wonder if anyone has any ideas if there could be smth else? Maybe I'm not applying enough gel? This even happens when I brush style.\n\nI've been trying to work it out for a while now, hence me asking for some guidance.\n\nROUTINE:\nQ+A clarifying shampoo once a week \nUmberto Giannini curl jelly care shampoo and conditioner \nUmberto Giannini creme de curl + banana jelly or just the curl foam and banana jelly \n\nNow using the starter kit for Flora &amp; Curl. So the cream shampoo + conditioner, and curl defining cream and gel \n\nI usually rake and brush through creams and leave ins, then praying hands for gel. Then I micro plop as if I plop my hair properly it always ends up stringy no matter what I do 😭 then I diffuse. I use a satin bonnet for sleep and I refresh sometimes with just water. Sometimes I use a spray like atm in using curl bites 2 minutes refresh spray and scrunch.",
