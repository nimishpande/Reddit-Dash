      "content": "I’ve been going to the same hairstylist for about two years now. We have great conversations, she sometimes gives me free trims, and I’ve recommended her to a lot of people (I’ve brought her multiple new clients). I was also one of her first regulars after she graduated cosmetology school, so we’ve kind of grown together.\n\nHere’s where I’m struggling.\n\nIn my area, there aren’t many hairstylists, especially blonding specialists. Recently, I’ve been low-key stalking the Instagram of another stylist. the girl who works at the chair behind hers. I LOVE her work. She focuses heavily on hair health and does the exact style I’m looking for.\n\nSome of the issues I’ve had with my current stylist:\n\t•\tShe bleaches over already bleached hair\n\t•\tMy balayage isn’t blended the way I like\n\t•\tMy inspo photos never really turn out how I want\n\t•\tI’m worried about long-term hair health\n\nI’ve tried to trust the process, but after two years, I still don’t feel like I’m getting the blonde I want.\n\nThe hard part is the emotional side. She calls me one of her favorite clients, we genuinely get along, and I feel bad because she’s been generous with me and I’ve supported her business from the start.\n\nBut at the same time… I’m spending a lot of money on my hair and I don’t love the results. The other stylist’s work aligns perfectly with what I want, especially her focus on keeping hair healthy.\n\nSo now I’m stuck between loyalty/guilt and doing what’s best for my hair.",

It was the first one i used (canon event). formula feels slightly sticky for the first few minutes. No sweat control, it just mixes the smell with the deo’s. And no visible brightening. \n\n6/10 WNRP because there are better options now.\n\nRexona Shower Fresh Roll On:\n\ndecent for odour control but way too strong for sensitive skin gave me a slight burning sensation especially on freshly shaved days. works if you need something heavy, but it’s definitely not gentle. \n\n7.5/10 WNRP for me personally cause i have too sensitive skin.",

      "content": "Hi guys - I need some help as I’m not sure what’s going on… A couple of months ago, I noticed that I was getting dry, flaky skin on my eyelids. I assumed this was caused by, a) the winter weather and the heated air indoors, and b) migration of harsher products onto the more delicate eye skin during/after my routine. \n\nI came to reddit and one of the suggestions was to put Aquaphor on my eyes at the beginning of my routine, as in before any other products, to keep harsher exfoliants etc. away from them. Aquaphor was also recommended as being super moisturising. \n\nSo, I started using Aquaphor as my first product on a morning and evening and covered my whole eye contour with it. Then I would use my other products around it on the rest of my face. In the first couple of weeks of doing this, I did notice that the flaky skin on my eyes was healing up and the skin felt moisturised, so I kept doing it. \n\n After a month or so, it felt like the Aquaphor was less effective at healing up the dry skin (there was no flakiness anymore but still a slight redness and sensitivity on my eyelids), but it was preventing any new dryness from occurring and maintaining relatively healthy skin. \n\nFast forward to this morning - I wake up with very slight itchiness around my eyes, look in the mirror, and… I have huge dry patches mapping almost exactly on to where I have been applying the Aquaphor. \n\nI do not think this can be a reaction to the Aquaphor or any of its ingredients since I have been using it for weeks with no issues before now. Instead, I wondered whether putting the Aquaphor on at the start of my routine (before any of my moisturisers) had left my skin too dry in those areas since I was applying water and then nothing else except an occlusive? \n\nAssuming that using only Aquaphor with no moisturiser was the issue, I put my CosRX Snail 96 essence on this morning under the Aquaphor and it feels slightly better. But still, I’m confused as to why this reaction has happened so severely and so suddenly when I have made no recent routine changes - should I stop using Aquaphor altogether? \n\nAny help would be massively appreciated! See separate comment for current routine \n\n ",

Also in the humidity my curl pattern intensified to a 3b.\n\nI am travelling to Mexico for a vacation in a week and this time I am looking for advice. What products should I buy and bring to make my curls thrive in the humidity? How do I manage the halo of frizz that instantly appears the minute I step off the plane?

I ended up getting weft extensions a while back, which help with fullness, but the hair above the extensions breaks, so it can't be due the extensions.  I barely use heat appliances on my hair and wash every other day.   I got a filter for my showerhead too.  My hairdresser said the hair that is not highlighted is breaking too, so she doesn't think its due to the highlight ingredients.  And its not balding or getting thinner, just breaking.  My friend recommended that certain Keratase products work well, but the brand is very confusing.  Any Keratase experts out there or any other suggestions? I have tried everything and I'm desperate.

Also if someone could tell me why type of hair I have because some is relatively straight, some is wavy and I get some curls? Backstory with more info below\n\nAs a kid (probably started from 11) I had thick, long hair. It didn’t look thick but there was more than anyone thought. I danced growing up so always had tight hairstyles but my hair was generally still in good condition. At 16 I was put on lithium (medication) and this started the decline of my hair. It thinned quite quick and bad, falling out non-stop and it started to look visibly damaged. I tried nioxin shampoo and conditioner with little improvement. About a year or so later, had a few issues with malnutrition which probably contributed. I’ve never had any bald spots which is a genuine shock with the amount of hair I drop. I’ve had schwarzkopf semi-permanent dye in it on a few occasions (red, blue, purple, pink). \n\nI’m currently alternating between Redken all soft shampoo + conditioner and olaplex No 4 + No 5, using almost cold water. I put Olaplex No 6 on towel dried hair after brushing. I’m using a wide tooth comb to brush, only after shower when wet and starting from the bottom. I do straighten it once or twice a week but will always straighten the front pieces as they are opposites and don’t look good. I’ve gotten different info from different people and I’m just looking for the most effective way to reverse as much damage as possible. I’ve trimmed and cut over the years and the length doesn’t seem to change the appearance. My hairs the one thing I like about myself and I’m quite conscious of how it looks and how damaged it is. \n\nPoint is, I’m after recommendations for routine and products to start somewhat restoring my hair and at least minimising frizz. I have attached some photos but they’re not the best. \n\nTia x",

      "content": "I have oily skin (including my scalp) and never used to need lip balm. Last winter, my lips became extremely dry, and the skin around my mouth started flaring badly. Lip balms (I’ve tried cicaplast, nutritic, vaseline, aquaphor, etc…) initially felt soothing but eventually made my lips even drier and didn’t help area around my lips. The only thing that helped was face moisturizer.\n\nI used Sebamed moisturizer for oily skin (light texture, helped irritation), later I got Sebamed moisturizer for dry skin just on my lips and area around. \n\nOnce the weather warmed up, the issue mostly went away. Occasionally my lips and area around it would get dry, but using face moisturizer once in the morning was enough.\n\nRecently, things have gotten much worse again. At first, I thought it was perioral dermatitis, but after looking at photos, it seems more like lip licker’s dermatitis, even though I almost never lick my lips. If I don’t constantly reapply moisturizer, the irritation around my mouth becomes severe (and even with moisturizer, the redness is still there).\n\nThe skin around my lips is very dry, red, flaky and itchy. It’s painful and honestly affecting my confidence; I hate how it looks and don’t even want to go out anymore.\n\nThis is my current routine for my face overall (unchanged for a long time): \n\nCerave cleanser for oily skin\n\nGood Molecules niacinamide serum \n\nCetaphil mattifying acne moisturizer\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDoes this sound like lip licker’s dermatitis? \n\nWould La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume be okay to try? Or would something else be better? \n\nShould I change anything in my regular routine?\n\nTL;DR: Oily skin, but severe dryness and redness around lips (likely lip licker’s dermatitis).

I have struggled with acne breakouts and acne since I was a teenager, and it is going well beyond my adolescent years as well.\n\nA few years ago, I went to a dermatologist, and was prescribed:\n\n1. Oral Antibiotics (Doxycycline)\n2. Neostrata Clarify Face Wash\n3. Neostrata Oily Skin Solution\n4. Adapalene\n5. Sunscreen (Clinic Brand)\n\nWhen I used these consistently, my acne cleared up quite well and I had clear-ish skin. Only reason I dropped out was bcs it was getting too expensive to justify shelling out hundreds of dollars every few months.\n\nMy question now is, how can I replicate this without going to the dermatologist again?\n\nRegarding the Doxycycline, I can get it via referral at a clinic, and when I had it before I didn't really notice any of the side effects (such as stomach pain, nauseau etc.).\n\nThis is my routine as of right now (I alternate Adapalene Every Other Night as of rn):\n\nAM:\n\n1. COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser\n2. ANUA Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner\n3. Cerave Moisturising Cream (For Dry to Very Dry Skin)\n4. Y.O.U Triple Care Acne Sunscreen\n\nPM (Adapalene Night):\n\n1. COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser\n2. Cerave Moisturising Cream (For Dry to Very Dry Skin) (Sandwich Method)\n3. Adapalene\n4. Cerave Moisturising Cream (For Dry to Very Dry Skin) (Sandwich Method)\n\nPM(Non-Adapalene Night):\n\n1. COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser\n2. ANUA Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner\n3. Cerave Moisturising Cream (For Dry to Very Dry Skin)\n\nMy main questions:  \n\\- What affordable products can replicate what Neostrata Clarify face wash and oily skin solution were doing?  \n\\- Should I add benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid?  \n\\- When does it make sense to add doxycycline again?\n\nThanks in advance!

Honestly, I've always been clueless about my curly/wavy hair and no one to ever ask tbh.\n\nMost conditioners usually weigh down my hair a lot and I struggle with finding hair products that I'm not allergic to.\n\nFor a year my hair routine worked great until my hair started shedding like a dog, I was mortified because it came out of no where! I have kept the same gel and mousse but my new shampoo/conditioner is super drying. I tried to soak my ends in coconut oil but it was like it just vanished in my frizz.\n\nI was using volumizing shampoo and conditioner from Native (yikes, I know, but I swear it was working) Now I'm using Maui Moisture lightweight shampoo/conditioner. (Waaaay to drying.)\n\nThen I finger comb and squeeze curl mousse and gel from Herbal Essences and air dry.\nI wash my hair twice a week and use Eva Nye freshen up dry shampoo maybe once a week when my roots get a little greasy.\nI also only use satin pillow cases. A little note to make, I have two lock of hair I usually keep braided like rat tails, but they're usually two big ringlets. Rn they're so dry and frizzy though.\n\nNow, here's my problem. I have A LOT of allergies. I cant have any sort of proteins like soy or nuts, nor gluten or eggs. I know that's definitely hard when looking for good curly products.\n\nSince I have my two little \"padawan\" braids, my hair is at two different lengths unstyled. I knowwwww it looks pathetic right now trust me, taking a picture of the back of my head felt like a JUMPSCARE 😆🤡 The first picture was my curls at their peak even while using Native at the time.

I’m newer to being in LA while caring for my curls and I don’t trust a lot of “curl specialists” because wavy hair is kinda fragile and I’ve been burned in the past. Im overdue for a cut, and a fitting hair style is harder to find when there isn’t an existing one. Not looking for that same shag style cut everyone’s pushing for with coils hair because that doesn’t feel like me and I want to be able to do different styles. \n\nWash Routine: detox with Christophe Robin sea salt exfoliating scrub, shampoo with Curlsmith moisture cleanser, and then condition with Authentic Beauty Concept hydrating conditioner (gel like consistency, ran out of Curlsmith). I did squish to condish (scrunch with conditioner) and then tied it up in a bun to finish washing and shaving and then rinse. \n\nStyle/Dry Routine: After showering I brushed and then used Curlsmith hold me softly hair cream and then Curlsmith frizz rescue curl retainer gel and let air dry with some clips in. This is just scrunching in after brushing and no brush styling (trying to only brush style for holidays/special occasions). Still has a cast because I will use oil and scrunch out tomorrow using pineapple and a bonnet. \n\nWhat are you wavy ladies doing to find your wavy/textured stylist and haircut?

I also have college classes in the middle of the day, so I go from work, to class, back to work. My hair usually looks really bad at class, and I would like to know if it would be smart to use conditioner only before work so it doesn't look as bad.\n\nAnother thing, my hair goes down to the base of my neck, it's kinda like a weird mullet thing but not really idk, but it's very wavy and it forms loose curls and I wanted to know if there was any other products I should be using, is just use shampoo every 2 days and conditioner every day.

I took a look and noticed I had had a whitehead outbreak across my chin.\n\nI was wondering if this could be viral and caused by my cold sore, hormonal or caused by skincare products? I’m not used to getting this many spots, it’s very sore and itchy. Has anyone else had this issue.\n\nFor reference I have been using Bulldog face wash and moisturiser for months and have not had this problem. I have recently moved to the Body Shop Ginger shampoo for dandruff - I am not sure if this would cause a reaction on my chin, however.\n\nThank you.",

      "content": "This is how my hair dries naturally without any scrunching or curly hair products such as curl cream/gel.  🥰 I think the drier air in the winter makes my waves form so much better. Does anyone else feel this way?  \n\n\nI typically start my routine off with some coconut oil from OGX on the ends, and leave it for at least 10 minutes before i shower. In the shower, I use treseme shampoo, dove bond strength mask, then tresseme conditioner. \n\nWhen i get out of the shower, I wrap it in a hair towel for 5 or so minutes. Then I’ll go in with leave in products such as Not Your Mothers wavy leave in spray, and then I’ll go in with a veryyyyy small amount of the Olaplex No 6 and mix that in with Not Your Mothers air dry cream and olaplex oil. \n\n\nAfter i do all that, I will actually go back with a spray bottle and re-soak my hair, and allow my hair to air dry afterwards. For some reason this has been the best way to form my waves. I’ve tried scrunching, curl/wave specific products, diffusing, etc—but i feel like my wave pattern doesn’t suit these methods. I like the way my waves naturally form on their own without any mechanical manipulation to them. And i find that wave/curl specific products really weight down my hair. \n\nBut yeah this is my routine 😇\n\n ",
