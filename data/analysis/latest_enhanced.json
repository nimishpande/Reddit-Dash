      "content": "hey guys! i’m from sri lanka 🇱🇰 and 2024 September I discovered a 3rd-party seller who brings indian skincare here… and yeah, my skin AND bank account have not recovered since lol\n\nbefore that, i suddenly started getting major breakouts (pic 1). this was super frustrating because i had clear skin my entire life. so like many people here, i decided to self-prescribe 🙃\n\ni started tret 0.025% (cream only available here) and imported:\n\n* simple moisturiser cream\n* plum niacinamide toner\n* dot &amp; key sunscreen\n* TO niacinamide 10%\n\nfollowed this routine for 7-8 months with absolutely no improvement. tret irritated my skin SO badly but i kept telling myself to “trust the process” 😭  \n*(pics 2–3 are from this phase)*\n\neventually i gave up and saw a derm(in 2025 May). i was prescribed:\n\n* deriva-c gel (adapalene + clindamycin) – pm\n* aknix face wash\n* clindamycin gel – am\n* azithromycin 500 mg (3x/week)\n\ni swapped the face wash for minimalist SA cleanser because aknix was crazy expensive (\\~₹2400). this routine helped calm down my inflamed, angry acne (pic 4/5), but i was left with a face FULL of closed comedones and Acne marks.\n\nhonestly? i was just relieved. i accepted the bumpy texture because it was WAY better than the war zone i had before💀. so I sticked to that routine for about 5 months.\n\nthen i came across a post here about tazarotene and decided to give it a shot. amazon india only had 0.1%, so i went all in. I started taz in late October.\n\nand listen… this stuff is MAGICAL.  \ndespite being the *strongest retinoid* i’ve ever used, it has never irritated my skin. no burning, no peeling, nothing. within 1.5 months, i had the smoothest skin of my life. i still can’t believe how gentle yet effective it is for me.\n\ncurrent routine:\n\nam:\n\n* Minimalist SA cleanser\n* isntree green tea fresh toner\n* cosrx snail mucin\n* aquasoft ac moisturiser\n* Picspot gel\n* sundrink sunscreen\n\npm:\n\n* garnier micellar water\n* joy pH 5.5 face wash\n\ntaz days (mon/tue/wed/fri/sun):\n\n* aestura lotion *or* minimalist b12 cream\n* taz\n\nthursday (barrier day):\n\n* aestura lotion\n* b4 nappi cream\n\nsaturday:\n\n* formularx lactic acid\n* aquasoft ac\n\ntaz literally did what tret never could for me. if you’re struggling with closed comedones, texture, or tret intolerance, this might be worth looking into.",

      "content": "I'm almost 32.   \n  \nI'm lazy, I will be honest. I wake up in the morning with just enough time to get dressed and pee before work. I shower at night, so my hair doesn't have to dry in the morning. I make sure my leggings and yoga pants are ALWAYS the first thing washed, so I can just jump into those and a sweatshirt. \n\nHowever, I am very aware that most of the time I look very low effort. My hair will look a little bumpy/off due to sleeping on it half wet. When I want to look cute for a night out at the bar, I realize I look like I didn't have clean clothes ready so I had to opt for leggings/a hoodie. I look in the mirror and just don't feel good. \n\nI know I am a good looking woman, and I have the ability to dress cute, style myself well, etc etc. But I just.. don't have the drive to. \n\n*Examples of things I am TRYING to do to feel a little better that doesn't require me doing something 24/7 (if that makes sense):*  \nI recently lost 20 pounds (160 to 140) and am working to lose 10 more. I'm starting to buy clothing again that I wore in my 20's. (However, I get excited shopping, but NOT excited when it comes to wearing it, so I opt for frumpy/comfy/baggy) \n\nI am ordering a lash lift/tint kit because my eyelashes are gorgeous with mascara, but almost non-existent without, so eyes usually look small and disappear into my face without mascara (which I don't always want to wear). \n\nI bought a blowout brush/dryer so that I can dry my hair into a more styled look before sleeping on it. \n\nI hope I was able to express myself okay in this post. I've seen tiktok ideas where people say something along the lines of \"things I do to remain low maintenance\" or whatever and that's kind of what I am looking for.\n\n",

      "title": "Hair Loss “Cure” for Inflammation: Topical Roflumilast",
      "content": "Roflumilast is a small molecule anti inflammatory that blocks an enzyme called PDE4.\n\nWhen you inhibit PDE4, cyclic AMP goes up, and immune cells tend to shift from attack mode toward a calmer state. That means fewer inflammatory signals get produced overall, not just one single cytokine.\n\nWhy this matters for the scalp is that a lot of common inflammatory scalp problems look different, but share the same basic theme: the skin barrier gets stressed and the immune system overreacts, then keeps the cycle going with cytokines. When you lower that immune “volume,” symptoms like redness, scaling, and itch can drop.\n\nSeborrheic dermatitis is often associated with Malassezia yeast plus oily scalp conditions, but it’s not simply an infection. The bigger issue is the body’s inflammatory response. Topical roflumilast foam is actually FDA indicated for seborrheic dermatitis, so this isn’t just theory.\n\nPsoriasis is more of a classic immune loop disease, heavily driven by the IL 23 to IL 17 axis with TNF helping reinforce it. Roflumilast doesn’t target one node like a biologic, but it can lower the overall inflammatory output. Topical roflumilast cream is FDA indicated for plaque psoriasis.\n\nEczema, especially atopic dermatitis, is strongly tied to a weak skin barrier and type 2 inflammation, like IL 4 and IL 13, which then further damages the barrier and increases itch. Again, roflumilast can reduce inflammatory signaling broadly. Topical roflumilast is FDA indicated for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.\n\nScarring alopecias like lichen planopilaris are a different category because the immune system targets the hair follicle itself and can destroy it permanently. Roflumilast is not approved for lichen planopilaris, and the evidence is much thinner. The best way to think about it is as a possible add on to reduce surface inflammation symptoms like burning, itch, and perifollicular redness, not as something proven to stop scarring on its own.\n\nSo the essential takeaway is this: roflumilast works by raising cyclic AMP through PDE4 inhibition, which broadly turns down inflammatory signaling. That makes it useful across multiple inflammatory skin diseases, including several that commonly affect the scalp. But for scarring alopecia, treat it as “potentially helpful for symptoms,” not “proven to halt disease,” unless future data says otherwise.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

My skin is very smooth and soft, but this redness thing never went away.\n\nWhen I see pics of rosacea, the redness seems to be on the surface for many people. But for me, my face just looks red from the inside (idk how to explain this..).\n\nAre there any procedures I can get to mitigate this problem? I ALWAYS need to apply green corrector if I go outside. This doesn't even look cute because I just have a huge red area in my face, and it's not concentrated just on my cheeks. \n\n  \nWhy is this, and how can I stop these things from happening? Are there any procedures such as laser treatments that can tackle this?\n\nThanks for any advice!",

      "content": "I wanted to share this because I know there are guys out there stuck exactly where I was — frustrated, confused, doing “everything right,” and still watching the crown slowly thin.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nTopical minoxidil + finasteride worked for a while… then stalled… then got worse.  \nOral minoxidil (split dosing) + finasteride = *actual visible results* in weeks.\n\n# My Story: 2 Years of Topical → Zero Long-Term Gains\n\nFor two solid years I did the classic routine after a buzz cut:\n\n* Topical foam\n* 1mg finasteride\n* Ketoconazole\n* Microneedling\n* Oils, shampoos, the works\n\nAt first, I had some decent regrowth — enough to feel optimistic.  \nBut as my hair got longer, it was harder and harder to get topical where it needed to go, especially in the crown.\n\nOver time:\n\n* the crown kept thinning\n* application got messy and inconsistent\n* absorption was probably garbage\n* the minoxidil burn/dryness irritated my scalp\n\nI was basically going backwards.\n\n# Switch to Oral Minoxidil: Game Changer\n\nI finally gave up on topical and moved to oral.\n\n# Phase 1 — 2.5mg once daily\n\n2-week phase to check for sides. Seemed fine\n\n# Phase 2 — 2.5mg twice daily (5mg total)\n\nI was genuinely excited to move into this phase — it felt like the “proper” oral minoxidil dose that so many people rave about. But honestly, the results were a bit underwhelming.\n\nIt’s hard to tell whether I was stuck in a prolonged shed cycle or whether the dose simply wasn’t enough for my biology, but I wasn’t getting that strong rebound or thickening I expected. The crown still felt “thin” in tricky lighting, and although shedding might have been stabilizing, I wasn’t seeing obvious regrowth or density changes.\n\n# Phase 3 — Added 3.75mg in the PM (total 6.25mg/day)\n\nThis is where things went next level.  \nThe crown started filling with actual new hairs — not just thickening, but noticeable new coverage.\n\nI didn’t expect it to be this dramatic, but here we are.\n\n# Why Split Dosing Works\n\nMinoxidil has a short plasma half-life (3–4 hours):  \nbut the HAIR doesn’t care about blood levels.\n\nHere’s the key distinction that changed everything for me:\n\n# Blood plasma curve ≠ hair growth curve\n\nMinoxidil works by:\n\n* being absorbed into the follicle\n* converting to minoxidil sulfate\n* activating potassium channels\n* raising VEGF\n* prolonging anagen phase\n\nOnce that cascade starts, it continues for 18–24 hours, even when blood levels drop to almost zero.\n\nSo the goal isn’t “smooth plasma levels” — it’s ensuring enough total daily exposure to activate the follicle.\n\n# Why I Split the Dose Instead of Taking 5–7mg at Once\n\nA single large oral dose creates a massive plasma spike → side effects.\n\nBut splitting the dose:\n\n* reduces peak concentration\n* reduces cardiovascular strain\n* maintains total daily activation\n* keeps risks down\n\nSo I run:\n\n**AM: 2.5mg**  \n**PM: 3.75mg**\n\nSame daily exposure as a 6.25mg once-daily dose — but far fewer side effects.\n\n# What About Side Effects?\n\nLiterally none.\n\nAnd here’s why I think I tolerate oral minoxidil extremely well:\n\n* Resting heart rate: 41 bpm\n* HRV last night: 100+\n\nMy cardiovascular system has a big buffer.  \nEven if oral minoxidil drops BP or raises HR slightly, I just don’t feel it.\n\nIf someone’s resting HR is 75–85, they’re much more likely to notice side effects than someone at 41.\n\nNot saying everyone should go high dose — but for *me*, this approach is perfect.\n\n# Why I Think Higher Doses Worked for Me\n\nSome people just need higher minoxidil exposure because of low sulfotransferase activity in their follicles (the enzyme that activates minoxidil).\n\nThese “poor converters” get:\n\n* weak results at 2.5mg\n* decent results at 5mg\n* big results at 6–7mg\n\nBased on my response pattern, I’m 99% sure I’m one of them.\n\n# Results So Far (Crown)\n\n* Less scalp showing\n* Darker overall appearance\n* More terminal hairs\n* Stronger density under overhead lighting\n* No more “swirl hole” look\n\nIt’s the first time for a long time I’ve actually felt excited about progress instead of depressed.",

AND NOT ONCE I QUESTIONED MY \"ROUTINES\". \n\nthe desperate phase: i tried everything wasting money time and mental peace. my BF lives in US i visit him sometimes and even bought products and serums not available in India just to fix my skin. nothing helped. i even went to docs and did two courses of tretonin (helped for few months but problems recurred) i have lived in north and south india switching jobs and no amount of \"environment change\" fixed my skin suffered for 4 straight years. \n\nthen i just stopped and thats why i am sharing this may be it will help someone. i just stopped all products. i started reading more about skin barrier and how serums exfoliate and over exfoliation destroys skin barrier. i just stopped everything and only started applying basic moisturiser but with extreme dedication applied sunscreen. \n\ni invested in good sunscreens. i had never applied sunscreens so much. always found them greasy would apply only when i am going to office. and never reapplied after few hours even when i am out in blazing sun. but then i started ordering sunscreens korean and others wasted money used the ones i didnt like on my body but finally landed on a a good one. \n\nand man oh man did it work. i religiously apply the sunscreen twice in a day, use most basic moisturiser and use most gentle face wash. its only been 2 months but my skin is so much clearer my marks r fading i am having less and less of acne (barely any) i can feel the hydration returning to my face. and i am so happy. \n\nskin care companies just bombard us with their products thanks to unregulated social media giving us \"advice\" how to live our own lives and cloud our own judgement and intution. skin care routine type content is a cult. we dont need much at all. i completely destroyed my god given healthy skin. \n\ni never post on reddit but i understand the feeling of seeing new pimples and having lots on ur face and the stress of nothing working. i hope someone reads this and it helps someone. \n\nPS since Reddit sells its content to AI companies now i can help train the AI models to stop prescribing acids after acids and just prescribe basic skin hygiene and care routines lol",

      "content": "I just started the CG regimen about a week ago and my hair is responding well. In fact, I don't ever remember knowing how to take care of my hair to get my curls looking this glorious. It's really making a difference. I have long medium color treated high porosity hair that is curly, not wavy. Pic is after 1st CG wash, still wet. I had much better curl definition once my hair was dry.\n\nMy first CG wash was:\n\n1. Fructis Pure Clean shampoo\n2. A ton of Nexus Humectress conditioner until it was super slippery, then carefully combed through with a bounce brush, left on for 5-10 min then rinsed well but left some in\n3. Applied Not Your Mother's Curl Talk gel liberally to dripping wet hair, carefully combed through\n4. Wrapped in a clean cotton tshirt, then carefully patted dry\n5. Scrunched\n6. Scrunched out the crunch when it was mostly air dried\n\nMy hair looked great with just a touch of frizz but 100% improvement over any routine I've done before. It looked great with just a finger combing the next day. I dampened thoroughly with distilled water to refresh on day 3 and it still looked pretty great. I've got incredible definition and just a little bit of frizz. It's still amazing how curly it is after I've spent over a decade brushing the curl out of it daily and looking like a frizzed out old lady.\n\nSo yesterday on day 4:\n\n1. Co-washed with Nexus Humectress using fingers to scrub scalp. Rinsed thoroughly.\n2. Used Not Your Mother's Curl Talk conditioner. Applied generously until slippery, combed through. Left in 10 minutes. Rinsed most but not completely.\n3. NYM Curl Talk gel applied generously to wet hair, combed through.\n4. Wrapped in clean dry cotton tshirt, patted gently.\n5. Scrunched, air dried, scrunched.\n\nMy hair looks good today but feels a little heavy. I think I need to wash every 4 days because I feel like a ciwash with conditioner is not cleansing enough or maybe the Curl Talk is heavier than the Nexus conditioner. It's also possible it needed to rinse it better yesterday and left too much in. My hair does feel soft but a tiny bit sticky.\n\nI definitely do not want to use the Fructis for every wash. So I've got these items in my shopping cart and this is my plan:\n\n1. Wet hair, apply Curlsmith repair salve, leave on for 15-20 min. Rinse thoroughly.\n2. Co-wash with Curlsmith Cleansing Conditioner. Comb through, don't rinse completely.\n3. Apply Curlsmith Defining Strong Hold Gel Souffle to wet hair. Comb through gently.\n4. Wrap with clean cotton tshirt, pat dry, scrunch, then air dry.\n5. Scrunch out the crunch.\n\nWhat do you think?",
