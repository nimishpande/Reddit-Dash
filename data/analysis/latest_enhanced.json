I put on a timer to force myself to work as fast as possible I have super high density hair and the installation took an hour and 15 minutes in total. Then I proceeded to diffuse for 20 minutes, once I was done I just put my bonnet up and went to sleep, in the morning I diffused again for 20 minutes and took them out the next day. \n\nLittle tips : \n1. make sure your hair is 1000000% dry before unraveling\n\n2. Do NOT make that many flat twists if you have finer hair, you should try 4 in the back and 4 in the front if your hair is super fine and low density\n\n3. This style gave me a lot of volume, not poofy volume but defined volume, but if you're looking a flatter look, you should try doing 6 in back and 8 in the front. \n\n4. Personally damp hair works way better for me than wet hair but if the latter works better for you, then go for it, you know what's good for your hair. ",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I have been bleaching and dying my hair vibrant colors for over 11 years now, a little less than my whole life. I very sadly and reluctantly have to return to my natural brown colors as I am graduating college and understand that I will have a better chance of getting accepted for a job without the vibrant hair color. I am doing this very reluctantly and will greatly miss my hair. I dread the thought of returning to a boring brown color, so I am wondering what options there are that I could do with my hair to make it interesting, but still “natural” looking/acceptable for job interviews? Highlights? A different cut? What do you think would suit me? And what would be realistic to get done right away, in one sitting at the hairdressers, vs later on over time as the bleached areas grow out? Pictured is my hair as it is now after a blow out and curling for an event. Naturally it has a bit of a wave to it and is quite thick. Any help/recommendations/advice is greatly appreciated! ",

I’ve always done that.\n\nI recently went on vacation to Egypt (I’m from Scandinavia), and while I was there, the under-eye issue almost disappeared. It was still visible, but the difference was honestly crazy — so much better than when I’m home. I can’t understand why it improved so much while I was away.\n\nI had a consultation about fillers, but I was told I’m not a good candidate because I have fat pads under my eyes, or a mix of hollowing and fat pads. They recommended surgery instead, which I’ve already been considering… but is there really nothing else that can be done?\n\nPlease help — I’m desperate.",

The hairdresser was not my cup of tea: as a matter of fact, she was not a huge curls fan (She got her own curls straightned). I still need to decide if I feel pretty or not... It's so annoying. I hate looking like a lovey-dovey sheep or a sort of grannie😅\n\nAlso, She noticed that I'm losing hair. Since It tends to have a'lively\" shape, I treat It kindly with my hands and little water instead of combing it. So, the reason She noticed the fall may be this...\n\nThoughts about this last point? Thanks in Advance :)\n\nPS. I use a silk pillow case when I sleep. As shampoo, I clean them with a combo shampoo/conditioner by L'Oreal (the brand Is \"Ultra Dolce\"... Yes, Greetings from Italy) and I style them with the Osis cream by Schwarzkopf.\n\nPS 2: any advice on How to keep them tidy?",

For about two years now, I’ve been dealing with a strange rash that is only on the bottom half of my face (around my jawline). It’s not on my chin or anywhere else. From far away it might look like acne but it’s mostly flat and there are no bumps. Every time I google rosacea or some type of dermatitis, pictures of bumps or severe rashes come up and it doesn’t really look like what I have. Recently, I cut niacinamide out of my routine because I realized it was in every step of my routine and I heard that a lot of people are sensitive to it. But I still have no idea what is causing it. It used to get itchy sometimes but it doesn’t itch anymore. I was thinking maybe it’s laundry detergent but I don’t get this rash anywhere else. If anyone has had the same experience and has been able to figure it out, please let me know what it is or how to get rid of 😢",

And when I accidentally itch it, it feels like i’m scratching scabs (for reference on how it feels.) And it only appears on that portion on my forehead.\n\nAny advice would help tremendously! What it is and what I can use to help get rid of it. Thank you!\n\nFor context if it helps, I used to have acne in high school but it cleared up like 5 yrs ago (with the occasionally pimple popping up here and there) but my skin has been red since then.

Over the years, it has gotten worse. At the moment, I'm not taking any special action to change that. I've been studying hairstyles that would suit me, using artificial intelligence, and I came up with the second photo. I love this hairstyle, and since I have a slim, small face, I know it would be the ideal style for me. However, I don't know if it would ever be possible to achieve this without hair extensions. What should I do to get as close as possible to the hair in the second image? I am avoiding bleaching my hair with highlights; I last did them a year ago to prevent my hair from thinning even more. I thought about using minoxidil, but I have read that I would become dependent on the product because I would have to use it for the rest of my life to maintain the results. Thank you very much. \n\n",

      "content": "This Phase II trial randomized 180 Chinese men with androgenetic alopecia into six groups to receive topical GT20029 at 0.5% or 1.0% either once daily or twice weekly, plus matched placebo groups, for 12 weeks. \n\nThe main outcome was the change in target-area non-vellus hair count at Week 12, with additional tracking of Week 6 hair count, hair width, and the terminal-to-vellus ratio. \n\nAll four GT20029 groups increased hair count from baseline by Week 12, but the cleanest placebo-separated results were seen with 0.5% once daily and 1.0% twice weekly: the 0.5% once-daily group showed a least-squares mean change of 16.80 hairs/cm² versus 10.10 hairs/cm² for placebo, and the 1.0% twice-weekly group showed 11.94 hairs/cm² versus 4.57 hairs/cm² for placebo, translating to net advantages of about 6.70 and 7.37 hairs/cm² respectively. \n\nThe 1.0% twice-weekly schedule also produced the strongest thickness signal, improving hair width at Week 12 versus placebo (0.54 vs −0.02), and it even showed an early Week 6 hair-count separation in the repeated-measures analysis (2.93 versus −7.45). \n\nThis makes 1.0% twice weekly the most convincing overall regimen in this short study, with 0.5% once daily close behind. \n\nA reasonable critique of why the 1.0% once-daily group did not clearly outperform placebo is that this was a small, short-dose exploration trial with only about 30 people per arm, the daily-dose arms did not show a clear dose-response pattern, and separate placebo groups for daily and twice-weekly schedules can drift differently by chance. \n\nIt is also plausible that a PROTAC like GT20029 has a non-linear sweet spot so the intermittent higher exposure produces cleaner androgen receptor degradation than higher continuous dosing, and also daily use of the higher-strength formula could add subtle irritation or short-term cycling noise that blunts visible separation over just 12 weeks.\n\n24 weeks (6 months) would probably show better data that we can rely comfortably on. But so far, this is a good signal for this mechanism of action!",

My hairdresser suggested balayage and went with a blonde/copper color. Anyway, since menopause hit, my hair has become corkscrew curly and very dry and it all just looks crazy. The roots need to be done but between trying to figure out the new curls and all that, I’m just wanting the color gone. Is this possible? I’m trying not to ask my stylist because I don’t know if I’m going to use her again. Thanks!",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
