The next morning is when i start my routine, and i wet it like crazy and then section off the crown of my head. Then i work in 4in sections on either side of my ear (leaving a section in the back to avoid a part) and run the cream through my hair with fingers followed by the tangle tweezer detangling brush(9 bucks at target). I get the gel and run my hands flat along the sections (normally 3 per section of hair). Then i use the deranged brush to brush style the sections. When i finish the back doing the same method, i part 5 horizontal sections in the crown of my head and do the same thing. I like a side part so after i've styled my curls i work a side part. Then i go over with mousse with flat hands and scrunch. I get a cotton t shirt and scrunch the water out and then i blow dry my hair. I ride a bike to work and now work at an office job. When i ride my bike i claw clip my hair and wear a bandana to protect it from the wind and my hair lasts 5 days, albeit very frizzy on the last day. When i worked retail my hair only lasted a day lol.\n\nANYWAYS LOL \n\nthe first picture was a week ago and the second was two years ago. i'm so proud of myself. I was never taught how to style my hair as a kid and only learned when i moved out over the last few years. I was dying my hair very heavily at one point, split dye black and pink, until i realized how damaged my hair was; it could barely form a curl. I had finger curled my hair on the second picture but it looked so mangly but i was so proud in the moment. So i went all black but then the black faded on the side that was formerly pink, leaving that super light brown you see there. The light brown is only on the old pink side, so half of my head! The other half is the normal dark brown. But once i stopped dying my hair it became so healthy. I am a little overdue for a trim (i trim my own hair) but otherwise i think im doing great!!",

When I have medium length hair there’s a little volume but I feel like what I have looks kind of basic. I don’t know if I need layers? Or angles? I am pretty clueless when it comes to hair. My part a little off the middle because I don’t like a middle part so I don’t plan on changing that. \n\nI’ll take recommendations on shampoos and stuff too if anyone has any; I don’t really use any hot tools or styling products unless I’m doing it for an event (like a wedding or the holidays). I do blow dry my hair sometimes but mostly in the colder months because I don’t wanna be chillin (literally) with wet hair.\n\nAny advice or suggestions appreciated!

      "content": "Hello! I just recently decided to try out curly look (instead of straightening). I went to curly hair hairdresser, who basically gave me a short course on how to handle curly hair. I haven't tried styling my hair myself and decided to try DIY flaxseed gel as a leave in product, because most bought ones have some kind of strong smell.\n\nHairdresser actually used mousse in my hair and said it is probably better than gel, because my hair is very fine. She also said I don't need deep moisturizing.\n\nSo, because I'm doing this for the first time, I'm a bit lost on how much I should use the flaxseed gel? I did observe the hairdresser, when she applied the mousse, but like she said, you don't really get that much product in your hair, because mousse has a lot of volume. So I'm unsure about the amount of gel that's needed. My hair is medium length (almost bra strap length when straight) and not very thick)\n\nHere's how I made the flaxseed gel: I just made a small portion, 1 cup or water and 2 tbl spoons of flaxseeds. Boiled for 12minutes, until it became a thick gel. Strained, cooled and  stored in fridge during the night.\n\nI'll try to style it as I was advised, so the routine will be: wash, use conditioner (neither is made for curly hair), rinse. Then \"comb\" through my hair with fingers (I don't have the curly hair brush yet) and put in the gel, scrunch it, then scrunch few times with the towel and I was told I can also leave the hair in towel for a while. And then I will just let it dry (won't use hair dryer).\n\nBut my main question is, how much gel should I use? Tablespoon, a few?\n\nThanks in advance for suggestions, it's a totally new topic for me!",
