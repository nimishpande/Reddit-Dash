      "content": "Last few pics are from 2024. It was the exact day I thought, “Hm. Perhaps my hair isn’t straight.” 😂 And then I dived into the curly girl rabbit hole head first.\n\nMy hair was fighting for its life so the first thing I started doing was olaplex no.3 and curlsmith bond repair masks once a week. I alternated between the two.\n\nMy hair was also really thirsty from a lifetime of neglect so I did masks before I washed. This was usually a curlsmith mask. I’m obsessed with the double cream deep quencher. Smells incredible too. Now my hair is really soft so I do this once a month only. (Same with repair masks) I used to use curl cream too until recently. Not sure if I’m stopping completely yet - I’m going by hair feel on wash day.\n\nI tried lots of different routines for a while but one thing that was standard was always styling dripping WET and using a shit load of gel. Like a lot.\n\nCurrent 1x a week wash routine:\n\n•Tootilab shampoo and condish (detangle and brush here) - Clarifying shampoo around every 3 washes or so.\n\n•Tootilab gel. I probably use around a handful. Like a golf ball. I separate top and bottom half of my hair and comb gel through. I don’t usually brush style, I just make sure my hair is wet and smooth/seaweedy before a shake and scrunch. I go upside down, side to side, squish squish squish. You know how it goes. My fingers are pruned in winter.\n\n•Diffuse upside down!\n\n•When it’s around 70% dry - surprise! I add a tad more gel. Smooth it over and scrunch a bit more. Esp on the bottom layers which are a looser curl pattern.\n\n•I use a drop or 2 of olaplex oil for the crunch. Smooth over then shake shake shake.\n\n•I alternate sleeping with a … Bambon? I think it’s called. It’s like a cotton tube. And then I also have silk scarfs that I tie on. That usually works better.\n\n•Refresh is usually just wetting my hands and smoothing and scrunching again. Just to get that slight cast again. On the 3rd/4th day I use mousse and wet a lot more. On 5th/6th it’s cap or bun days with bangs styled.\n\nAny questions, shoot! It’s been a fun learning curve (:",

      "content": "My hair loss was something which affected me for more than 20 years. Hair transplant were not succesful 20 yrs back and I had Norwood Grade 7 at 25 yrs of age. Today I m nearing 45 yrs . \n\nI did a ton of research about hair transplant  in last 10 yrs and was with a hair patch for last 15 yrs. \n\nIt affected my confidence . In 2024 I finally decided to give hair transplant  a good chance and decided to use my scalp,  beard and chest .\n\n During my research in Patna , where I resided , I found my doctor through a google search. I was mentally prepared to go to Delhi. Seeing his past affiliation of doc , I decided to meet. \n\n He said \" you are my second patient in the city where I have newly moved in and we both have nothing to loose as you go back to the hair patch if the transplant fails , but if it is successful , it can be life changing. We will have a 3 to 4 Surgical  sitting  approach over next 1.5 yrs to protect donor aesthetics of scalp and body. We will use your beard in the hairline and crown over multiple sittings  and beard in the rest. He put his bet on my beard which is extremely good. I linked his multi step approach with a conservative hairline initially.\n\nSurgical procedure breakdown:\n\n• 1st procedure - total of 3300 grafts- 1300 from scalp ( very thin donor ), 2000 from beard ( He extracted beard below jawline and side locks ) . This covered my conservative hairline and mid scalp.\n\n• 2nd procedure-total of 2300 grafts- about 1500 from beard and about 800 chest( Further extraction from beard below jawline  and from cheek, 800 from chest 70% of which failed ) . This was used to construct my crown and back part of the head.\n\n• 3rd procedure-total of 2000 grafts- about 1000 from the scalp( these were finasteride dependent hair which thickened with 1 year of finasteride  and about 1000 from beard ( from neck, cheek ) \n\nTotal number of grafts so far = \\~7600 grafts\n\nA primary reason for this approach in regards to procedure was to manage the existing donor hair as well as achieve realistic density. \n\nExperience and recovery:\n\nMy 3 surgeries took 1 year and were placed 6 months apart. The approach was always conservative to slightly aggresive. There was risk of scarring on my cheek and practically after 3 times extraction from my cheek , sidelocks and below neck , there are virtually no visible scar, thanks to excellent post op care guided by the doc and executed my me.\n\n My final results is still 4 months away and last surgery was done in September 2025.\n\nResults (so far): \n\nI’m not trying to boast or claim that I have a “celebrity hairline”, but my observations indicate that hair growth is naturally improving, and I am beginning to feel comfortable again with my hairline as my confidence grows.\n\n I feel confident to go out without a hair fibres or a wig now. Doctor has suggested to go for scalp micropigmentation to further reduce the contrast and recommended use of chest hair to improve my mid scalp  if have he stamina to go for a 4th surgery from chest .\n\nMy advice to anyone considering an HT for extreme high grade baldness with poor donor : \n\n1. Find a doctor who is capable of scalp and body hair transplant.\n\n2. Find a doctor whose approach is conservative to aggresive , rather than vice-versa ( else a failed surgery can't be rectified ) . Even the best donors can fail to grow and worst donor hair can grow.\n\n \n\n3. Wait for your baldness to stablize before surgery and stick to medications like finasteride and minoxidil .\n\n4. People who have good body hair especially beard ( it gave me 80% of the density over 3 surgeries ) should get a good coverage .\n\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to ask I mainly posted this in hopes of providing some insight or motivation to people who have virtually no hair..",

My wash days aren’t turning out great (frizzy, wonky curls) and then seemingly as soon as I leave my apartment they go limp and stringy. The first picture is from this afternoon after washing and styling last night. The second picture is from a while ago but is more how my hair used to look. \n\nMy hair is long, fine, medium density, and I think low porosity, so it’s easily weighed down. I’ve always struggled with hold but not usually to this extent. I live in Canada so I think the dry winter might be part of it, but it hasn’t been this bad in the past. \n\nCurrent routine:\n\nWash with Pantene volume shampoo\n\nCondition with a small amount of pattern detangling nectar or herbal essences nourishing detangling spray\n\nScrunch out excess water\n\nApply Harry’s gel in sections and brush style\n\nHover diffuse (don’t usually pixie diffuse as I find it gives me wonky curls)\n\nSilk scarf to sleep\n\nI recently changed gels because I felt like my usual got2b gel was drying out my hair in the winter, so I switched to Giovanni LA hold, which made my hair feel even drier and had pretty weak hold, so I switched to Harry’s which gives a good cast but once I scrunch it out it’s like I have no hold. \n\nI’ve also been experimenting with different conditioners since my hair has been staticky (so I assume dry?), but they all just seem to make my hair even more limp. \n\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated, I’m at my wit’s end and my straightener is beckoning to me.

      "content": "Feeling so defeated. I was fortunate to have great skin up until roughly 10 months ago. I started getting hormonal acne which I tried to cure with skin care. It didn’t go away and after trialling retinol as well as visiting with 3 different skin care clinics trying microdermabrasion and hydra facials, my skin only got worse. It began to frequently get inflamed and turn red, developed little bumps, and slowly my PIH was getting worse. I tried to ease up on my skin and reduced my routine to only include a gentle cleanser, spf, moisturizer, hylauranic acid, and jojoba oil because my skin is naturally very dry in winter. My skin will periodically get better then when I think all I have left is to manage the scaring, it’ll get inflamed or develop acne again. 2 months ago I tried to get a dermatologist referral and the doctor would not offer it and instead gave me a prescription of spironolactone. After 7 weeks with no improvement, I decided I would try ipl. That was 8 days before this picture was taken. I’ve made another doctors appointment to try again for a referral but I’m just feeling so defeated. For reference I’ve already cut out dairy, exercise frequently, eat clean, and drink lots of water. I have a hormonal iud and have for about 3 years now.\n\nAny recommendations on what I could do if I am not able to get this referral?",

      "content": "I was hoping to get some advice for how to manage or at least find the culprit to my acne breakouts. Some important things to mention are that I got off BC in August 2025, I’ve been experiencing on and off acid reflux, I started Tretinoin over a month ago (every other day at 0.025), and just recently started using the Ordinary’s Azelaic Acid cream (morning and night). Everyday I use the Panoxyl Benzyl Peroxide acne wash and let it sit for a few minutes in the shower.\n\nSo my breakouts weren’t too bad before I started Tretinoin, but the breakouts have gotten significantly worse once I started. I recognize that Tretinoin has a purging period, so this could potentially be related, maybe? Honestly I can’t tell what’s purging vs regular breaking out. I have a history of cystic acne in my 20s (I’m 31 now) and so I can’t help but feel pretty fearful that it’s just going to get significantly worse. My stress levels are significantly lower now, but I think it’s one of those, if you’ve had cystic acne, you know the feeling.\n\nThe times that I am breaking out are before and during my period, as well as during my ovulation. So it’s pretty constant, it seems.\n\nI’ve been drinking spearmint tea once a day for about the same amount of time that I’ve been off BC, but not sure I’ve noticed a difference. Given my history of acne, when getting off BC, I tried to prepare by taking omega 3, magnesium, and prenatal vitamins. I recently stopped prenatal vitamins since I got freaked that maybe biotin can be contributing, also heard like B12 can have an effect? I also read that Zinc can help acne so wondering if that’s worth trying at least days leading up to the consistent breakout periods.\n\nSo I recognize there’s a lot happening here and I’ve been noticing more dryness in my skin so I try to take some days where I just hydrate with hylauronic acid and moisturizer even if it’s supposed to be a Tretinoin day, but I don’t want to not use the Tretinoin for more than 3-4 days.\n\nI’ve also started using high frequency wand a few times a week when I can.\n\nAny advice or even just picking out any patterns that make sense would be appreciated!

Please give me some recommendations for products and for my hair care routine\n\nMy current routine consists of me washing my hair two times a week and sometimes three. I’ve just been using shea moisture products for my conditioner, shampoo, leave-in conditioner, and curling cream. I also used a wide tooth comb to get knots out of my hair and I use coconut oil randomly to help with frizz. That frizz is a big issue on my list and it has been terrible in these colder months.

I never had issues like this before so I can pretty much link this to the usage of Finasteride.\n\nI don't really want to try Minoxidil topical because I just know I wouldn't be consistent with it and it would be kind of a hassle for me. At the same time, I don't really feel like risking all the side effects of oral Minoxidil.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts and thank you for your time!",

They appear mainly on the sides of my face, under my jaw, under my earlobes, etc. My usual program has always been Bioderma or La Roche Posay + La Roche Posay mattifying cream. Now I've switched to Cicaplast Baume 5, which makes my skin super moisturized, and I've noticed that I have fewer breakouts. It worked, but I notice that I'm getting blackheads and my pores are clogged. I also bought azelaic cream from The Ordinary, but it stings my face and doesn't help with breakouts at all; it only dries it out.\n\nI’m 30, so my breakouts are less, yet they persist.\n\nWhen I went to the dermatologist for cleansings and peels and other things, he prescribed me isotretinoin, but that also really dried out my skin, so I can't take it. The dermatologist said there was no other way. Has anyone encountered a similar problem? If so, what are you doing about it?",
