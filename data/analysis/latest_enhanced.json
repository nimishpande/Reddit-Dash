Any help would be incredibly appreciated! ❤️",

      "content": "Hi all, I am a 19 year old college student who recently began a combination of the typical doses of oral minoxidil and finasteride.\n\nTo those wondering, I did initially experience adverse side effects, like decreased libido and ED (at 19, crazy right), but they have since gotten much better 😉\n\nMy medication trajectory played out just as you might’ve imagined; I began and experienced an insane shedding. Now, keep in mind that I decided to take action against hair loss early; I probably could have gone another year without even noticing I was balding. However, I decided to be proactive. So I ended up losing a ton of volume in my hair, which stopped after about two months of constant shedding.\n\nSince the shedding stage stopped, I noticed small, ever darkening baby hairs growing at my hairline—I had hope. I felt that I was taking control of something that many cannot. However, I got ahead of myself.\n\nMonths have gone by, and I have noticed a gradual thinning of hair all over the top of my head. This has made it so that my once thick and luscious hair is now the consistency of thin strands of spaghetti. On top of this, it appears that my hairline is continuing to recede. The only affected (noticeable) parts during my initial shedding stage and overall alopecia before beginning the medication cycle was at my temples, or the corners of my hairline. I have since noticed that the mid section of my hairline is gradually going backwards. While there are many nearly invisible baby hairs growing here, I am very discouraged at the moment. The hair regrowth i experienced at my temples is also receding—but not as you might think. Somehow, the initial hair that has already began regrowth remains, but the hair behind it is receding?? I don’t get it. You can see it in the series of photos I’ve attached.\n\nToday marks month 5 of treatment, on the dot. I don’t know how to explain what’s happening because it’s truly been a rollercoaster. I don’t know if this is expected or if the treatment is even working at all. Did I experience a temporary positive from the minoxidil? Is the finasteride not slowing recession at all? I would love some sort of explanation or comparison if anyone here has any words to offer from their own experience or an actual scientific explanation.\n\nIf anyone can offer any words or advice or simply an explanation, that would be much appreciated. I truly thought this was going well and that starting so early would be a plus, but it doesn’t feel like it.\n\nThank you. If you have questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.\n\n5 MONTHS IN 🫡",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

When you flash a light directly on my eyes, the skin is a darker brown.\n\nI've tried so many different products. I wear sunscreen. I put Vitamin C on my face and in my body. I take Vitamin D supplements and live in a sunny area. I don't have anemia. I make sure to eat a lot of iron anyway. I get 8-10 hours of sleep on a regular basis. I don't smoke. I drink tons of water. I don't have puffy under eyes, I have DARK under eyes. \n\nRecently, I've seen people touting PRF and azalaic acid. I'm tired of buying new ingredients and I find it difficult to stomach the thought of spending the cost of an international trip on a cosmetic procedure. Is there anything else beyond going under a needle that actually helps dark under eye skin? ",
