Usually over the years i have stopped and restarted a few times, and every single time I had to deal with shedding for a few months but then always after the 4-5 month  the hair always bounced back stronger.\n\nSo this time i was silly and thought that i have been consistent for so long and maybe my results will hold up without the meds. Well today is almost 5 months ago i stopped and what i hoped would not happen happened. Major shedding and hair that is thin and look like a diffuse baldy person\n\nSo lesson learned:  this is a lifetime medication, guys. Never stop\n\n[this is me today](https://preview.redd.it/1ybx46qlt3zf1.png?width=1536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32dd8de372f05e85c8a6c57f091fc27f914138f5)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4bef1pot3zf1.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfef6a04a12ed3dcb77bc9a8bddc06faac93bb43\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5pt28jrut3zf1.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aa35cd4adebaf0473ad2ddeff22244c6298b31b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7pa03as0u3zf1.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a34c9045204cc001b3d2a6d694c45b57cb6c06b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s3lud3j2u3zf1.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2fb679ac958c0833120cffefe7dfc4fcde240c1\n\n  \n",

      "content": "I realize this question has been asked a LOT, but hear me out bc I wouldn't be asking if the other posts were totally helpful 🫤\n\nSo, yeah, best pube razor? \n\n1. When you look for \"dermatologist recommended,\" the answers are **immediately,** _\"Get a dedicated electric shaver!\"_ or _\"While this may not be a traditional close shave...\"_ As soon as I see that, I dip out 😄 I mean, yes, skin around the pubic hair is prone to ingrown hairs and/or sensitivity, but I refuse to believe **every single** female dermatologist has resigned themselves to a constant pube 5 o' clock shadow :P \n(I'm sure some of them get laser or waxing done. Dermatologists make _bank._ )\n\n2. I see women say _\"Anything with 5 blades!\"_ but hasn't it been shown that more blades = more irritation?? Honest-to-god, I think FIVE blades is insanity. I'm not saying I don't use them, but I feel like it's just clever marketing that has burned into the core of our souls that more blades = a closer shave. Maybe 3 blades MAX (I just feel like the additional blades mind help grab hairs that were left behind. I DON'T EFFING KNOW... I'm being super vulnerable here admitting I know jack shit about shaving, apparently lol) \n\nSo are they good or not?? I wish I knew 😭\n\n3. *SINGLE-BLADE RAZORS.* In recent years, single-blade razors with their old-fashioned handles have been touted as the \"best shave ever!\" Their reasoning is that fewer blades = less irritation; a good, sharp blade will always beat 5 not-so-great blades; they're more affordable, etc. But they don't really elaborate about the shaving experience beyond \"it's close!\" Obviously the majority are _men,_ but I've been seeing them advertised for women, too... Look, I have a feeling most of us understand that when it comes to a blade near your GENITALS, a single-blade razor housed in a metal handle, no flexibility, no guards, etc. seems TERRIFYING. I swear to God, I have always had the fear of nicking my labia (it hasn't happened.... YET 😅)\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I really have never seen one that has a flexible handle to help you reach hard places without being a contortionist.\n\nSo far the ONLY way I can shave downstairs without a ton of irritation is to wait until my pubes are soft &amp; \"fluffy,\" but I can never shave in between those times without patches of blood or razor burn 🙄 Could I wax? Yes. Do I want to? NO. In this economy?? Plus, it takes SO much hair to need to get waxed.I've invested in an at-home laser-flash thingie, but I'm not consistent (And it requires you to shave the area anyway!)\n\nSo what do YOU ALL think? Of course no one HAS to shave their pubes, but if you do, how in God's name do we get a close shave without irritation?? Be nice, y'all. This is a struggle we ALL have &amp; I don't want to see women being mean over something as silly as bushwhacking :P \n\n**TL;DR Finding razors is hard.** Finding women's stuff in general makes me feel like the whole \"sort yourself out\" bit by Mitchell and Webb 🫤 (do yourself a favor &amp; find it on youtube. It's less than a minute. It'll give you a giggle.)\n\nWe are but an afterthought when it comes to a lot of products...  ",

I have dry, sensitive skin.\n\nPersonally I think my evening routine is too long. I don't think I will repurchase the skin1004 serum, since I already have niacinamide in a few other products and vitamin c and retinol to help with hyperpigmentation. That serum contains tranexamic acid as well however, so I will be missing that in my routine. I definitely don't want to get rid of the two cleansers, the peptide serum, the daily innisfree retinol (0.015%), and the purito cream. I think the separate retinol serum (haruharu in this case) is necessary as well because I don't want to apply a stronger retinol on a daily basis. I definitely want an oil as well and a second moisturizer, besides the purito cream. So basically, I think the only way I can make the evening routine shorter is by finding a moisturizer with vitamin c and/or (a significant amount of) ceramides, and an oil with vitamin c and/or ceramides. Any suggestions?",

I’d say I get a new large pimple on my nose atleast once every month and as of now I’ve had two very recent ones in the last two weeks.\n\nThe first two photos show my most recent breakout on my right side, it doesn’t really feel like there’s a deep cyst and it’s not raised to the touch but it’s quite painful and there’s no visible head, the last photo shows the aftermath of a cyst I had from last month that regrew last week and drained again.\n\nAnyone have any advice for what I could do to help prevent these breakouts and reduce the redness because what seems to be working for the rest of my skin just isn’t working on my nose.\n\nThank you very much for your help in advance!\n\nAM Routine: Wash face with a natural olive oil soap bar, Apply moisturiser and sun cream\n\nPM Routine: Micellar water to remove sun cream\n\nWash face with soap bar\n\nAlternate between epiduo (benzoyl peroxide + adapalene) or a serum that contains (glycolic and lactic acid 6% and salicylic acid 1%)\n\nMoisturise",

About six months ago, I built a simple skincare routine with:\n\nNiacinamide serum (daily)\n\nMoisturizer\n\nSunscreen\n\nSalicylic acid (2x a week)\n\n\nThe breakouts have reduced a lot, but I still get 1–2 pimples here and there. What’s really bothering me now are the red marks that just won’t fade no matter what I do 😩\n\nAround two months ago, I added 0.3% retinol from Minimalist twice a week at night, and also tried azelaic acid cream from Conscious Chemist on non-active days. But the azelaic acid irritated my skin, so I stopped using it.\n\nI built this routine based on research and some AI suggestions, but I’d really love to hear from people who’ve dealt with similar skin issues. How do you fade post-acne redness while keeping breakouts under control? Any product or ingredient recs that actually worked for you would be amazing 💛",

My college is in Hyderabad, where the weather is usually dry  and my skin is perfectly fine there, more on the normal to slightly dry side.\n\nBut every time I go to Bombay for internships (where my family also stays), my skin completely changes. It becomes extremely oily, sweaty, and sticky the moment I step out. Since I’m constantly running around in formal clothes for court/office, by noon my skin looks super shiny, dull, sticky and just... disheveled. Like not the glowy kind of oily, it's the tired, heavy, “why does my face feel like it’s melting” kind. And it feels uncomfortable ngl\n\nI’ve tried blotting papers, which help for a while but even after that my skin feels heavy and sticky for some reason. I also tried the Innisfree No Sebum Powder, but it made my skincare kind of pill (that weird rolling feeling on the skin), and I hate that texture.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\n\nMorning:\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n2. L’Oréal Revitalift Serum\n3. L’Oréal Revitalift Hyaluronic Acid Cream\n4. Dot and Ket Watermelon Sunscreen\n\n\nNight:\n\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n2. Earth Rhythm Serums (I alternate between the CLEAR SKIN SERUM and 10% NIACINAMIDE SERUM)\n3. Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer\n\n\nI don’t wear makeup daily, maybe just sunscreen and Etude water tint. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, but my skin just hates Bombay weather. Is it the humidity? My routine? Any product or routine adjustments that could help?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice, I’m tired of looking like a greaseball by lunchtime 😭",

It’s frequently very very dry. \nHe uses a Costco argan oil shampoo and a random curly hair leave in from time to time. He used to only use coconut oil. It’s shorter at the moment, but he cut it all off last year because he didn’t know to take care of it. It would frequently break off. It’s growing out now and it just needs some TLC, and I have no idea how to help. Would LOVE to see him rock these and help him keep them healthy!! THANK YOU!!",

Anything that is not perfume-y, is affordable, and relatively accessible would be appreciated. Thanks!\n\n  \nHair type:  \n  \nSouth Asian thick curly non-porous hair, cropped med length, mostly S-curls on the sides and in the back, but tighter Cs in the front  \n\n\nRoutine:  \n  \n1. Shower daily, use tea tree oil shampoo 1x/week (or less) and R+Co Cassette conditioner 3x/week\n\n2. Pat dry a bit (before adding any leave-in / moisturizer) just to grab some of the excess water from dripping off, finger combed with the leave-in / moisturizer, and then left to air dry\n\n3. I only use curl product, noted in step 2. I've used the following for the past few years, and generally use a very small amount. I've always called them \"leave-in conditioner\" but I am now realizing there are many categories of curl creams / lotions.  \n\n\n\\- **R+Co High Dive**: Like it but need a little too much product and it comes in a 5oz bottle so it runs out quickly. Also would be interested in something smidge more defining than this. Smells but not overbearing.  \n  \n\\- **R+Co Waterfall**: Lighter version of High Dive. Prefer High Dive in almost all cases, think this one was a bit more neutral scented.  \n  \n\\- **Unite Boing Curl Defining Cream**: Not bad. Super concentrated and only need a finger nail's worth so the 8oz bottle lasts forever. Ultimately too defining for me, gives the curls a crunch that I don't love (although modulating the amount used does help w/ this). Didn't love the overly perfume scent though.  \n  \n\\- **The Doux C.R.E.A.M**: Not really a fan. Too much hold, too style-forward, requires way too much product application that stays in your hair for days even after showering.\n\n\n\nI think ultimately I'm looking for something in the sweet spot between R+Co and Unite. Here are some of the products I've bookmarked to try. Open to any suggestions / feedback. Thanks again!\n\n  \n\\- Unite Boing Moisture Curl Cream  \n\\- Unite Boing Curl Leave-In  \n\\- Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-in Conditioner  \n\\- Ouai Curl Creme  \n\\- Biolage Hydra Source Leave-In",

I started going to a salon a year ago to the same lady who told me my hair was dead so she chopped it to my shoulders- that was a year ago in November. She advised me to start using Pureology-shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioner. It was super expensive but I bought it. Ive been trying to take really good care of my hair, sleeping with a silk pillowcase, massaging, Kerastase hair serum, oiling my ends and sleeping with a braid in. My hairs been growing but every 3-5 months I go to get a trim. My hair grows about 2.25 inches during that time period and then she cuts my hair more than 2 inches each time I go. It’s extremely frustrating because it’s been a full year and there’s been minimal growth overall. My hair feels healthier, do I really need more than 2 inches cut each time I go??? I make sure to go between 3-5 months and been very consistent over the last year. Any advice helps. Thanks.",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
