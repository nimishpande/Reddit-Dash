My curls feel way less frizzy in the morning now.\n\nPicture was taken 2 days after washing.\n\n**The Routine:**\n\n* **Wash:** Co-wash with **Hask Detangling Curl Care Conditioner**. I spend a good couple of minutes massaging the scalp to make sure it’s clean, then rinse.\n* Apply **Cantu Curl Cream** to soaking wet hair and scrunch them\n* **L**et it air dry\n* Once it’s completely bone-dry, I Scrunch Out The Crunch to get rid of the cast and make it soft.\n\nThanks to everyone in this community for the tips and the motivation to embrace the curls! I know it's a pretty basic routine and theres definitely space to improve but it works for me.",

So yeah, whether you cut it yourself or get someone else to do it- let go of those dead ends. \n\nRoutine (pic 2):\nWash with Innersense clarity hairbath and hydrating cream conditioner.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

The back on 3rd day after washing\n4.Horrible first day after washing id been out for ages 😭 routine;\nSo i normally I use a tiny blob of bedhead thickening cream, and then I put on a decent amount of got2b curling mousse in an orange bottle, heat protectant and occasionally gel and my hair seems to look better and curlier when I diffuse upside down so thats normally what I do. My curl pattern stretches so easily and gets frizzy so quick in picture 1 I love the way it looks I like kind of unruly curls but I lose tbe volume so quickly I always have to shake it upside down. My bonnet never works so I normally end up sleeping with it in a bun. It doesn't look it but it feels quite thin id love to get it thicker aswell. But the main problem is just picture 4 if ive been out and havent looked at it for a while or its the first day after washing it will look like that and i absloutely hate it i want it to stay like picture 1. When I first wash it it often looks more waves than curls so maybe I have wavy hair? But anyway please ask anything or give me any advice and I'll try it all at this point thank youu ❤️❤️❤️❤️",

I know humidity can make curly hair curlier, but is there nothing I can do to replicate the results in a dryer climate? Or is what I’m seeing in this dryer climate more true to my actual curl pattern? It’s seriously making me wonder if I even have curly hair. \n\nI just recently started embracing my natural hair so this is my first time back at home styling my curly hair. \n\nRoutine: \n1. Shampoo and conditioner - dove curl repair \n2. I don’t use a leave in as I have fine hair and I find it’s too much product for it. I use the Marc Anthony strictly curls curl cream and the umberto Giannini scrunching jelly (at home I usually use a mouse as well, but I didn’t bring it with me)\n3. I style in two sections, my bottom layer first and then my crown. I apply the cream, then gel, style with my bounce define brush and scrunch. I do the same for the top layer\n4. I use a cotton tshirt for the excess water and then diffuse until fully dry and scrunch once more with an oil \n\nHeres a picture of what my hair typically looks like. \n",

      "content": "Hi!\n\nI've tried out my fair share of vitamin C serums and have had concerns of some kind with all of them - a lot of them about shelf life/oxidation/stability and/or price, effectivity or other ingredients included. I remember trying serums from a Finnish brand called Murumuru (my first one some years ago), Purito's Pure Vitamin C Serum and COSRX's The Vitamin C 23 Serum before settling for Beauty of Joseon's Light On Centella + Vita C Serum, as the earlier ones oxidized faster than I could blink (I don't remember having any adverse reactions to other than maybe the first). I generally enjoyed using the BoJ serum and it at least felt like it stayed unoxidized throughout the bottle, so I finally got a good bang for my buck.\n\nHowever, I've recently got increasingly annoyed about pilling (I have sensory sensitivities) and have phased out products containing silicone to ease that, which the BoJ serum sadly contains. Earlier this year I heard positive things about mixing vitamin C and ferulic acid together and bought the APLB serum as my next vitamin C serum as I was interested to try out the combination and it is affordable.\n\nAffordability brings its own suspicions and I've heard mixed opinions on APLB, or rather the amount of active ingredients they actually use behind their scientific-sounding concentrates or whatever those are (like 46.7% of Ferul Vita Cen™ containing ferulic acid, vitamin C and centella asiatica). I've been using the serum for maybe a couple/a few months now and I can't say I've noticed anything for better or worse. I acknowledge that I can be impatient with skin care and I want to see results at least during the time I use up one product, for which there is still time with the serum.\n\nStill, I was wondering if there is any way to figure out the ascorbic acid content? I've tried to \"research\" vitamin C lately and yesterday I watched a video by Doctor Dray where she mentioned that in order for vitamin C to work it (ascorbic acid) should be at a concentration of at least 8 %, which made me wonder if the APLB serum gets anywhere near that. I have my doubts, but could anyone help me out?\n\nI also appreciate any vitamin C recommendations for serums that stay usable/effective for the time it takes to use up a bottle of it. I use vitamin C every morning. Preferably in the price range the ones I mentioned represent. Or should I try to get past my discomfort (because of pilling) and go back to the BoJ serum since I liked it and I feel like it worked for my skin?\n\nTLDR: Is there any way to figure out the ascorbic acid content of APLB's Ferulic Acid Vitamin C serum?",
