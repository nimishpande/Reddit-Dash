      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Rosemary hair oil before washing my hair (1-2 hours prior)\n2. Using the L'Oreal clarifying shampoo (hard water) \n3. Carol's daughter Goddess Strength Repairing Cocoon Hydrating Hair Mask\n4. As my hair is dripping, I apply the Kinky curly leave in conditioner to my whole hair and scrunch. I like to alternate and use this as a wash off conditioner as well.\n5. I use the LA Looks gel and scrunch it out. \n6. I let my hair air dry. The first pic is taken 2-3 hours when I hair is 60% dry \n\nNight: I put my hair up in a pineapple bun, I sleep on a satin pillowcase and have a bonnet which usually comes off in the middle of the night lol\n\nIn the morning, I usually just use water to refresh but honestly my curls are hard to revive after day 1. \n\nAdditional info: low porosity, fine hair, with a super oily scalp and hair. I usually wash my hair 2 times a week\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?? 😭 Would really appreciate the help! ",
