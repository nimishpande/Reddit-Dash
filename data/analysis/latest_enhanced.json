I’ve aged, bleached/colored it (though I stopped doing anything to it about a year ago), and had a baby. \n\nI did the strand-in-water test and it floated on the surface so it’s apparently low porosity although it dries very quickly. I have had hairdressers say I have a lot of hair but the strands themselves are very fine. \n\nThe photos show my hair air dried after using my regular routine of OGX Bond Protein Repair shampoo and L’Oréal Elvive renewing conditioner. I wash it every other day because if I go two days or more my scalp gets very greasy. \n\nI live in a very dry climate and when I go to humid places it definitely forms more of a curl which tells me it needs a lot more moisture but I haven’t found a conditioner that won’t weigh it down a lot. \n\nI’d love to see what it would look like with the waves/curls more well defined.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Would it make a difference if I added sunscreen after my face wipe in the AM? I hear so many people say they put on sunscreen in the AM but I work from home and don't go out often.\n2. What is something affordable I can use to help with dark under eyes circles?  \n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n",

These definitely aren't normal age wrinkles, I'm young. When I first started noticing the scars/wrinkles, I switched to a less gritty/harsh exfoliator (recommended by the esthetician) and started using snail mucin in addition to my normal moisturizer (also esthetician recommended). \n\n  \nIs there anything else I could/should be doing? I wanna try to get ahead of this if possible. Is there anything else I can do to fix, conceal, or prevent this scarring?

I got a haircut last summer which I didn’t like due to the blunt shape which I tried rectifying by trying this Wayne Tuggle 4 section haircut on YouTube. I assume this is what left me with a gap in the middle essentially. I then had a haircut at a curly hair stylist in the fall to fix all of it and we agreed not to completely trim it all in regards to the hole in the middle of the back since it seemed to camouflage well. I cut some curtain bags myself about a week later. I also started using a whole new line of products (Innersense).\n\nThat was end of October. Out of curiosity I filmed the back of my head yesterday and was shocked to see the bottom layers. I did notice that my hair seemed to be thinner at the bottom (especially when both parts are pulled to the front) which I chalked up to hormones/vitamin deficiencies and the face framing layers I got. But the videos seem to look even worse. A noticeable gap in the middle (prior to this hair cut I did have long hair with no gaps) and generally straggly bits at the bottom. I don’t even know what this from nor how to fix it. The stylist I saw is the only curly hair specialist in town. I’ve attached two videos (in one). I’d really appreciate any advice!\n\nRoutine:\n\nShampoo: Innersense Pure Harmony Hairbath and Vichy Dercos\n\nConditioner: Innersense Color Radiance\n\nStylers: a concoction of Sweet Spirit Leave in and I create volume as well as I create hold and I create lift (all from Innersense)\n\n\\\\- a little goes a long way; it was my first time doing this particular mix of products on this wash day and the hair seems to be good. I emulsify product with water and take it in wet hair. Then I scrunch and scrunch out excess water with microfiber towel. I let it sit like that for 5 minutes and then cup diffuse upside down and from side to side. I then fluff it out. Refresh is just taking a bit of water with sweet spirit leave in and coating frizzy, undefined strands with that as well as a bit of I create volume and then scrunching it up. Often I don’t need to do that. I sleep with my hair in a pineapple. Sometimes I use I create finish on dry hair.",
