      "content": "Ms Chetali Chadha is back to her old tricks again\n\nRoasting products because they have fragrance in one reel and in a different reel, sneaking in a paid promotion for a product that has not just fragrance, but also color. \n\nYou may have all seen that series the influence with chetali . It has been running for two months now.\n\nI always had a feeling that Chetali was carefully and smartly, putting in her paid promotions inside the reels while making it seem like a genuine informed information and today I got the proof\n\nProof number one in one of her recent videos, she has spoken about the best moisturizer for oily skin, and the Foxtale suncreen has been shown as a clear winner, however, if you have been following her series, you will know that she is dead against fragrance, and any other additives Foxtale moisturizer has both. \n\nIn her latest reel for dry skin moisturizer, she has failed Himalaya and Nivea because they use a particular ingredient that has been banned in the European Union because they use fragrance, however logic did not matter in case of Foxtale. \n\nLastly, if you see her reels, clearly she has done paid promotion for requil, formula RX and Be body wise without making disclosures by just making a point that she is giving them a higher ranking\n\nIt is very easy to figure out which product has paid in which product has not paid. If you just go and put a timer on the reel and see how many seconds she dedicates talking about a product that is paid versus what is not paid.\n\n Incase you don’t have context she has done it before in 2024 and 2025 always roasting products that have fragrance and then promoting the L’Oreal glycolic serum which also has fragrance but at that time it did not seem to make a difference to her because she was paid for it. Her values keep changing based on who’s paying her and who is not.\n\nI cannot believe she has come down to this. I was really liking her content, and it was seeming genuine and educated but now knowing what I know, it is terrible it really breaks my heart. ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "title": "Completely Lost on Hair Type",
      "content": "I have experimented with hair products for the past year or two without much success or satisfaction, so I’m finally reaching out for some help. My hair has been short for almost all of my teenage years, and now in my early 20s, it is the longest it has been since I was a child. I have tried a few things to learn more about my hair type and how to take care of it. For about 1.5 years I did not get it professionally cut and instead lightly trimmed it at home. I also heat styled some parts of my hair daily without hair protection and without much apparent damage happening at the time. From some combination of the poor trims and heat styling, I had a build up of dead ends that left my hair getting tangled and taking forever to dry. If I walked around with clean, brushed hair going about my day, the underside of my head would be tangled into a solid mass within a few hours. \n\nA few months ago I went to a hairstylist and paid $90 for her to help me shape up my hair and cut off the necessary parts of the dead ends (she wanted to cut much more to give me a very fresh start). I noticed quicker drying time in my hair and less tangling. I still have issues with both of these things. It takes my hair about 2-3 hours to fully air dry.\n\nI’m so attached to the confidence the length has given me that I’m hesitant to cut more even if it would ease my tangling and drying issues. However, I think this may also significantly be related to my hair type and improper treatment.\n\nI think my hair is a bit curly. It is very thick, the porosity seems to be low, and it forms S shaped curls in the shower when it’s moisturized, especially when it’s squished to my head. It never lays quite straight when I treat it straight.\n\nMy routine has almost entirely been a straight hair routine: daily use clarifying and hydrating shampoo and conditioners (these were marketed as daily use and lightweight), very occasional deep condition masks, occasional clarifying shampoo. These are my products. My hair with a conditioning mask or some leave in conditioner will definitely form the S shaped curls while wet, and they’re somewhat visible after drying in the first few photos (1-3). Photo 4 is my hair before the cut a few months ago where it is visibly beginning to tangle on the inner (nape) hair sections despite the fact I was only walking around indoors that day. I should probably include a photo of my wet hair and the curl definition there, but I don’t have it currently. \n\nI’m very comfortable with accepting my hair is more straight than wavy/curly, but it has such a texture to it that I find that difficult. I’m not sure if it is defined enough to be wavy/curly though since I’ve used  conditioner masks, creams, and sprays to try to add definition and results never seem to hold. I’ve never used a diffuser or wavy/curly shampoo/conditioner combo, so I wonder if these would make a difference.\n\nI know my self care and approach to my hair seems a mess. It genuinely was, as was a lot of my life at the time. I’m currently trying to find what to do to make my routine and my life a bit easier while adding to my confidence.\n\nAny advice on what to do/try?",

The left side of my head curls perfectly and looks really good but the right side does not. It grows out and down rather than forming nice curls like the left side. We are unsure on how to handle this. I suggested maybe some sort of undercut so that the crown area can hang down over maybe those hairs will curl nicer? If anyone has any input it would be greatly appreciated. Anything from tips to make my bad side curl and lay/grow better or haircut recommendations such as what I mentioned earlier. I included some pics of each side. Good side(1) Bad side(2) Please let me know, thanks!\n\n\\*The pics shown are my hair after just washing and conditioning, no products\\*  \nThis is my typical routine:\n\nShampoo/conditioner: Not Your Mothers Curl Talk\n\nProducts: Camille rose moisture milk + not your mothers flash freeze gel\n\ndiffused\n\nsilk pillowcase",

I left the salon with literally orange hair 🍊\n\nNow that the dye has faded, I was thinking of going back to a new salon for blonde hair this time. But I don't want to spend that much money again on something that might not be what I asked for. So I thought I'd try it at home. (I want to go from pancake to honey picture)\n\nNow, the thing is... I have absolutely no idea how to do this, and I've seen a few tutorials, but never with the same products and for the exact shade I'm looking for. That's why I'm here, looking for product and process advice! I'm from France, so ideally I'd prefer products we can get in Europe, but it's okay if you don't know of any available here, I'll just look for a dupe :) I assume I'll need three types of products? Bleach, hair dye, and toner?\n\nFeel free to ask any questions 😊",

I can’t tell if its too dry though because its still really soft. All I added was the &amp;honey hair oil after a few hours because it was a little frizzy. But should I just stop usng conditioner? Maybe after a while it’ll stat getting too dry and I’ll have to use a hair mask but WHAT?? I have miss jessie’s leave in condish, and shea moisture hydrating mask and the moisture mask (idk which one to use so I use neither 💀) and occasionally I’ll use palmer’s coconut protein mask when I clarify once a week.\n\nAnyone have any experience with no conditioner?

Any tips?\n\nShould I stop all actives for 1-2 week? Or just reduce the frequency of actives? Do I need to replace my cleanser/moisturizer (I use typical drugstore cerave ones)? I'm thinking about using aquaphor more to help bring in moisturization?\n\nWould appreciate any and all advice.

      "content": "Hello, 23f here with what is primarily a hair question!\n\nAs you can probably see ive been bouncing around a few shorter hairstyles over the past few years, but haven't really ever settled on one as im not sure what suits...\n\nHence my post here! Ive included several different styles ive had over the past 4 or so ears just to demonstrate how i look w different lengths, styles, parts, etc etc. currently my hair is the length of the first pic :/ but im willing to go much shorter or grow it out if it might work. In most of these pics ive had my partner cut my hair- he seems to do a decent job but is only an amateur at it so if the cut looks a bit rough thats why.\n\nOf course im considering going to a proper salon if i plan on a change. :)\n\nIm also considering doing something new with the colour- maybe highlights or something more drastic, though im completely at a loss here. I am worried about a very blonde colour washing me out or emphasising my red cheeks but otherwise, yeah, have very little idea :P\n\nI dont really have many preferences. I do actually sorta prefer the look and convenience of having it shorter (like pics 5, 8, 10, 15, 20) but am concerned that look doesnt work for me? Plus a few people have mentioned they think it looks best a bit longer :/ Pic 20 was from when i was a bit younger but its the shortest its been\n\nUltimately though im just looking for suggestions so anything (suggestions for things i have or havent tried, notes on do's or dont's, for styles, lengths, bangs, or things that work (or not) for my face, things to avoid, realy anything) is welcome!\n\nThankyou! :)",

Now that I have a good length, straightening it all the time was not working out and I started my curly journey. I am relatively new to my natural hair but get pretty good hair and wash days every now and then. \n\nThrough it all, frizz is my one problem I’ve not been able to get rid of. I have tried various things but none seem to be working. I’m thinking it’s the products I need to change. The first and second pics are right after finishing my routine one day that I felt was my best yet. The pics after that, while not in the same wash cycle, are how my hair looks like in day 2 or 3. While some definition is there, frizz just makes me disheartened and ruins the hair. Can anybody please help me to get rid of frizz and make my hair look hydrated? I wouldn’t mind trading in a bit of definition for less frizz and more hydration.\n\nI shampoo twice a week with a clarifying shampoo every once. Routine after goes like this:\n\nConditioner and wait for 5 mins and then brush through while waiting. After rinsing, I apply Marc anthony strictly curls leave-in. Then SC curl cream. Then NYM’s curl talk gel after which I brush style and scrunch. Most of the time I use a diffuser to dry my hair. Light oil to SOTC. ",
