I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

Lighter products led to more defined waves/curls and healthier looking hair.

Gil said the first part of the year will be spent engaging with the FDA to confirm the trial design and endpoints.\"\n\nhttps://www.biospace.com/business/were-scientists-pelage-takes-hair-loss-beyond-lotions-and-potions\n\nMore about what is said: \n\n“There were people were running around saying, ‘Oh, this thing works in a week,’ or, ‘You’re gonna have a full head of hair in three weeks,’” he remembered. “\\[It’s\\] nice that people are excited, but of course, you don’t want there to be unreal expectations either.”\n\nInstead, PP405 takes a little bit longer than that and the results are a bit more subtle at first. The Phase IIa trial that read out in June 2025 showed that 31% of male patients with a higher degree of hair loss had a greater than 20% increase in hair density at week eight—which was four weeks after the completion of treatment. No patients in the placebo arm hit this exploratory endpoint.\n\n“Pelage is not alone in the burgeoning alopecia market. Veradermics is developing an oral extended-release version of minoxidil for pattern hair loss, which is in Phase III trials. Gil and Weng believe there could be combination opportunities in the future.\"",

I love the soft but grainy texture. I do have to use it twice to get makeup off though. 8/10\n\nVt Reedle shot PDRN 300- the pdrn leaves my skin looking more supple than any other hyaluronic acid I’ve tried. I’m looking at you Torredin. 7/10\n\nD-alba aromatic spray serum- the best mist I’ve tried to rehydrate my skin. I don’t like that you have to shake it before applying because I forget to sometimes….The mist is so fine. 7/10\n\nSkinceuticals phloretin CF- I tried the normal CE version of this serum but it was too greasy and would make my skin looking oily, not glowing from within. This is a staple in my routine now. Best vitamin c I’ve tried. 9/10\n\nI’m from honey mask- nothing gets my skin right back on track quite like this mask. When my brother was going through it with acne, he would beg me for more of this mask. It’s just so good and hydrating. I don’t like how you have to pick it out with your finger though, it doesn’t feel very sterile. 9/10\n\nTatcha the dewy skin cream- no words needed. It’s just the best. 100/10\n\nGlow recipe plum plum cream- I love this formulation for under makeup. It doesn’t leave a film of grease but it’s not a gel either. It’s the perfect in between. I wouldn’t use it with my night time routine thought as it just wouldn’t be enough. 7/10\n\nHaruharu wonder rice essence- I thought this essence was all hype but no bite but I still bought it and omg I’m never using another essence again. This stuff makes my skin actually glow for dayyyys. 1000/10\n\nAnua azalaic acid serum- this is a new incorporation in my routine. I was worried about using 10% on my skin but it has been quite gentle and has been working really well with the vitamin c. 7/10\n\nIlso sebum softener- also a new edition to my routine but it’s going no where. Holy moly this stuff makes my nose look poreless. I’m sure you can get the same effect with any toner and scraping tool though. I just love the procedural feel of this product lol 8.5/10.  \n\n ",

Literally the best hair day I think I've had since I got this lazy bob cut. The only thing I think could be better is the frizz, but that's a never ending problem for us curly hair girlies... :V\n\nRoutine: In a warm shower I wash my scalp with Shea Moisture shampoo, comb Shea Moisture conditioner through hair, rinse out conditioner with cold water, scrunch hair with Not Your Mothers Curl Talk, and plop everything with an old t-shirt. Once my hair is dry enough that it isn't soaking, I let it air dry.\n\nPLEASE let me know what else I should introduce into my regiment!! I'm definitely looking for advice. The #1 thing I have noticed that made a big difference is just using more product than you'd assume is needed. I'm also open to trying a different hairstyle (if you think that it would suit me better).",

      "content": "Hey All,\n\nNatural brunette here, cool skin tones. I made a post way back when about dying my hair blonde and just not liking it. I’ve dyed it blonde a few times before and it always came out looking great. But this time, for some reason it just…didn’t. \n\nI gave it time. I used purple shampoo per many people’s advice, and that did actually help a little. \n\nBut it’s been several months and yeah, nah, I can’t be in denial anymore: I hate it. I don’t know what happened this time but it washes me out like crazy. \n\nWearing a certain wardrobe and doing makeup helps, but I miss the days when I didn’t have to worry about what I wore so much to prevent looking washed out. \n\nWhat do you guys think? I dyed it in June, and the roots have grown to about my cheekbones. Should I:\n\n1. Say fuck it and spend $$$ to get it dyed back to my natural color;\n\n2. Make the most of my current blonde era until it grows out; \n\n3. A third option that I don’t know exists yet? \n\nThanks in advance! ",
