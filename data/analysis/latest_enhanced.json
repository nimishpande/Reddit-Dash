I’m trying to find the right products (&amp; routine) for me without trying a bunch because I just can’t afford it. Trial and error is totally part of the deal , but I’d love to get recommendations and avoid at least some heartache and unnecessary expense!\n\nPics for reference:\n\n1 - 4 are decent hair days \n\n5 &amp; 6 are styles but not good hair days\n\n7 is day 3 or 4 after brushing it before showering \n\nMe:\n\n\\- nonbinary, they/them pronouns (not a woman/girl/etc).\n\n\\- disabled and chronically ill with a weak neck, so I can’t tilt my head back to diffuse, do everything upside down, or do my whole routine standing\n\n\\- newly curly; my hair became wavy/curly a little less than 2 years ago\n\nMy hair:\n\n\\- Mid-back length \n\n\\- 2b/3b (I think)\n\n\\- medium/high porosity\n\n\\- medium/fine and medium density\n\n\\- smooth hair besides damage, very little coarseness/strand texture/hold\n\n\\- mixed healthiness and textures due to hormonal shifts; split ends and in need of a trim\n\nEnvironment:\n\n\\- I live in a high desert environment but use humidifiers inside and WFH, so low/medium (30% - 50%) humidity most of the time and then very low (like 15%) when I’m out. \n\n\\- very hard water (\\~120)\n\nCurrent products:\n\n\\- NYM Tahitian gardenia &amp; mango butter shampoo &amp; conditioner\n\n\\- NYM curl talk leave-in conditioner\n\n\\- NYM curl talk styling products that I use in different combos (obviously not all together), including flash freeze, hold, and spray gels, cream, mouses, and foam\n\n\\- NYM beach babe salt spray\n\nRoutine (\\~2x/week):\n\n\\- dry brush before showering\n\n\\- lightly scrub scalp &amp; then brush through shampoo\n\n\\- rinse\n\n\\- deep scrub scalp with shampoo\n\n\\- rinse\n\n\\- condition midlengths to ends thoroughly, brushing through; let sit while I shower the rest of me (\\~5 mins)\n\n\\- rinse\n\n\\- add leave-in while still soaking wet, brushing through &amp; scrunching\n\n\\- add styling products while still pretty wet, brush through, style, and scrunch lots; add water as necessary\n\n\\- air dry (sometimes I diffuse)\n\nI often try to refresh on day two to no avail and end up in braids.\n\nI use silk pillowcases but can never get a bonnet to stay on. \n\nWhat I’ve noticed:\n\n\\- creams seem too heavy\n\n\\- the flash freeze gel and mousse are sticky and hard for me to manage; the gel is okay when I get it into soaking hair but the mousse always seems heavy\n\n\\- the foam honestly works best, but I tend to use it on day 2 or as a touch up and I don’t like how it makes my hair feel\n\n\\- nothing ever holds all day\n\n\\- hover diffusing seems to do nothing other than speed up drying, but the finished look is the same \n\n\\- diffusing adds volume but messes up my curl pattern\n\n\\- roots are always flat\n\n\\- my hair is dry and frizzy by end of day and oily at the roots on day three\n\nI’ve tried a couple shea moisture products, all too heavy. \n\nPlease help!! And please be kind. ",

Looking for a moisturiser to use here, please suggest the best one.\n\nResults-\n\nCleanser: i’ve been using for about 6-7 months now and i dont know if it works but i have noticed that oil production has reduced in my T-zone. It has never broken my skin out or anything harsh like that so I’ll probably repurchase it and continue using it.\n\nSunscreen: Been using this since the start of summer this year so around March, and I quite like it. Again I honestly don’t know if it’s doing anything because I have fair skin with redness on my cheeks 😭. But I haven’t tanned so i guess it’s working? It’s light-weight, blends into my skin quick, no white-cast, and the texture is thin, not thick at all, hasn’t caused any breakouts so I have recently repurchased it and will continue using it.\n\nToner: Just bought it a week ago, no clue if it’s working or not, hasn’t caused a breakout, let’s see if it reduces pores as it claims. Will update in the comments if I notice improvements.\n\nSerum: Definitely noticed a difference from the first week itself, I used 5% for like 6 months and it hardly did anything so I started using 10%, I can see the redness reducing and other people have noticed it too so i’ll keep using this one.\n\nTLDR: Sharing my review of these 4 products &amp; Requesting y’all to drop some advice/comments about my routine, what other serums I can try to reduce redness and acne scars, and please suggest a good moisturiser for my skin type.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I just got my iud taken out and switched over the birth control 2 weeks ago but that doesn’t seem to have helped at all either. I don’t think it’s making it worse either, it’s really just stayed the same. I tried using Tretinoin cream and that works for a little bit but then it makes my skin so dry it flakes off, so then I just have flaky acne instead. My gynecologist prescribed me metronidazole gel for it but I don’t know if it’ll work or not. Can anyone one this subreddit help me figure out what’s going on with my skin and maybe give me some suggestions for a good skincare routine to help with it? Thank you all for reading!!\n\nTldr - bad acne ouch any suggestions?",

I’d really appreciate some guidance from people who’ve actually been through this.\n\nShort background:\nGrowing up, I didn’t really take care of my skin — lots of sun exposure, stress, and inconsistent habits. Over time, my face became darker and uneven compared to my hands/legs, which still look closer to my original skin tone.\nNow I’m fixing things slowly and properly.\n\n(I’m also posting a leg photo for reference so you can see the tone difference.)\n\nCurrent routine (doctor recommended):\n\nGentle face wash\n\nBrightening / depigmentation serum\n\nBarrier-repair moisturizer\n\nSunscreen (this is where I need help)\n\n\nMy skin type:\nNormal to sensitive. Not naturally oily, but some products make my skin look shiny.\n\nMain question (sunscreen):\nWhich would be better for my skin?\n\n1. La Shield Lite SPF 40+ PA+++\n\n\n2. La Shield Fisico Matte Gel\n\n\n\nI’ve read mixed reviews. I even saw one girl mention that she experienced white cast, which made me a bit confused. Since sunscreen is something I’ll use daily, I want to choose carefully.\n\nAlso asking for advice 🙏:\n\nHow can I gradually get back my original skin tone (face matching body)?\n\nAny habits, ingredients, or mistakes I should be careful about?\n\nAnything you personally did that actually worked long-term?\n\n\nGoal:\nHealthy, even-toned skin nothing extreme, just consistency and patience ✨\n\nThank you so much for reading. I’d really value your honest experiences 💛\n",

I’m also just considering switching back to Olaplex?\n\nIdk if it matters but I live in a really humid climate as well that makes a big impact on how my hair holds throughout the day for my everyday life so i’ve noticed some products help with resistance to humidity more than others.\n\nI’m also looking for a hair mask to use! I’m open to anything as long as its color safe and low porosity friendly, I know some people say porosity level doesn’t matter but to me it does because buying products with this consideration has made an insane difference to my hair :,)",

But I dont like the muted color of my ends.\n\nI used to get my hair professionally dyed by my aunt, but she passed away not to long ago.  As I dont want to spend the time or money to go to someone else, I have been doing my own hair. She has done every color (non fantasy colors) under the sun since i was a kid, so my ends have a lot of history.\n\nAfter all that background, my question is:\n\nCan I just re-dye with the same color? If not, are there masks or color shampoos that would be better? Any advise on my extremely faded ends?\n\nMy roots are growing, and my ends are faiding bad, so I want to re-dye, but i dont want to damage my hair beyond repair.

      "content": "Need sunscreen advice 🧴 + tips to get back my original skin tone (La Shield Lite vs Fisico)\n\nHi everyone 🌸\nI’m currently following a dermatologist-prescribed skincare routine and I’m genuinely committed to improving my skin in a healthy, long-term way. I’d really appreciate some guidance from people who’ve actually been through this.\n\nShort background:\nGrowing up, I didn’t really take care of my skin  lots of sun exposure, stress, and inconsistent habits. Over time, my face became darker and uneven compared to my hands/legs, which still look closer to my original skin tone.\nNow I’m fixing things slowly and properly.\n\n(I’m also posting a leg photo for reference so you can see the tone difference.)\n\nCurrent routine (doctor recommended):\n\nGentle face wash\n\nBrightening / depigmentation serum\n\nBarrier-repair moisturizer\n\nSunscreen (this is where I need help)\n\n\nMy skin type:\nNormal to sensitive. Not naturally oily, but some products make my skin look shiny.\n\nMain question (sunscreen):\nWhich would be better for my skin?\n\n1. La Shield Lite SPF 40+ PA+++\n\n\n2. La Shield Fisico Matte Gel\n\n\n\nI’ve read mixed reviews. I even saw one girl mention that she experienced white cast, which made me a bit confused. Since sunscreen is something I’ll use daily, I want to choose carefully.\n\nAlso asking for advice 🙏:\n\nHow can I gradually get back my original skin tone (face matching body)?\n\nAny habits, ingredients, or mistakes I should be careful about?\n\nAnything you personally did that actually worked long-term?\n\n\nGoal:\nHealthy, even-toned skin \nnothing extreme, just consistency and patience ✨\n\nThank you so much for reading. I’d really value your honest experiences 💛",

      "content": "Hi ladies, I‘m willing to invest time and money into getting nice skin but I’m not sure what’s the right next step for me.\n\nIn terms of my skin issues:\n\nAcne:\n\nI‘m acne prone (dealt with severe cystic acne growing up, did 2 courses of accutane). I am currently managing my acne with oral Spironolactone. I still have active small breakouts on my face for 7-15 days each month. My period, diet fluctuations, and stress affect which end of the range I fall in.\n\nHyperpigmentation and acne scarring:\n\nAside from my unfortunate genetic predisposition to acne, I’m also prone to hyperpigmentation due to my south Asian heritage. I have slight ice pick scarring on my cheeks from the acne as well.\n\nSkin texture and quality\n\nI have combination skin. I’ve been using topical retinol for years and my skin is fully acclimated to it, but it still causes dry patches.\n\nAs a result, I get this awful combination of dry peeling patches that get oily, which in turn causes my pores to get clogged with sebum and dry skin, turning them brownish gray. This happens primarily in between my eyebrows and on my nose.\n\nFacial hair:\n\nI an a woman with excess hair growth (hirutism) on my face, which I am currently getting electrolysis for (and it’s going well!). The excess hair growth caused me inflamed ingrowns, which resulted in scarring.\n\nCurrent skincare routine:\n\nMy skincare routine is a gentle cerave cleanser and moisturizer and biore sunscreen in the AM , 0.05% tretinoin every other day with cerave moisturizer on top in the PM, moisturizer and rosehip oil PM on my non tretinoin days, and Dr Dennis gross aha/bha peel once a week.\n\nOther skincare treatments:\n\nIn the past, I’ve tried chemical peels once a year to help fade acne scarring (which really helped!) and microneedling to help with skin elasticity and ice pick scars. Both were done at a medspa, not a dermatologist. I had decent results, but I don’t like the downtime of chemical peels and I’m not sure if microneedling is worth $250 per session.\n\nIs there anything I should change about my skincare routine? Should I shell out the money for a dermatologist or go to a medspa for specific treatments? Thanks!",
