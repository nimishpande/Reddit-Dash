I found this routine on tiktok, usually they don't go well but this one made me feel so great about my hair. I did use a hair mask on this specific day, it was Camille Rose cocoa and mango butter mask.\n\nI then sectioned my hair into 3 sections, went through the first section with a small amount of curl cream, then with the bounce Curl brush, I applied mousse after and then gel (still in that first section) after I did that , I proceeded to dry that section.\n\nAfter the first section I rinsed and repeated the above for the next section, and then once again repeated for the last top section. I found it cut down on drying time because the sections were smaller. Maybe each section took no more than 5 minutes to dry. Also easier on the neck and able to achieve volume easier. It sounds like a lot but I promise it was easier than plopping you head over for an eternity.\n\nThis will be my permanent routine as long as it continues to do me right. I am pretty excited. \n\nI wash my hair twice a week only. Rest of the time I just let her do her thing. If it looks too bad then I will put her up, but I find",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I knew i wanted to try platinum blonde sometime in my life, and a few months ago I felt bored of my hair and I did it. I spent a lot of myself and really damaged my hair, and now I feel only a 1/3 of myself. I have an alt, 90s gothic kinda style (think Gabriette Bechtel), and I feel like it doesn’t suit me at all. And I feel like it makes me look even more ghostly. You would think that since im naturally pale with light hair, black would wash me out and blonde would be better, but it’s the other way around. I felt way more vibrant in my black hair.\n\nNow I don’t know what to do. I keep telling myself that it’s just hair and to stop thinking about it, but I can’t. I just don’t feel confident at all. But I also don’t want to just dye it back to dark so soon- all that money, work and damage for waste.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas how to feel more confident in it? Maybe a different tone I should try? I don’t like warm toned hair, I have cool undertone and it doesn’t suit me.\n\n",

Hair grows fast anyways so it’s a nice change up!! \n\nI can’t wait to wash and style myself at home with these new water soluble products which is the KEY I learned!! \n\nRoutine from today:\n1. Shampoo : innersense hair bath shampoo (twice shampoo) \nConditioner : innersense daily conditioner \n2. Gel : innersense I create hold gel \nFoam : innersense I create definition styling foam \nMixed together the gel and foam in an empty container then prayer hands on the product with scrunching at the end \n3.

I never knew how to comb it and I never had the care it probably needed, and when it grew out it looked like steel wool.  \nWhen I was a kid I was more blond and my hair was much better — it had beautiful curls and it wasn’t tangled like it is now. I feel like everyone has better hair than I do.\n\nI started taking care of my hair a little more just over a month ago, but I only use shampoo, conditioner, and a leave-in cream. I bought better products for curly hair — a mask, etc. — but they’ll only arrive next week. Anyway, I’m letting it grow out and I feel like maybe I can get a good result. My goal isn’t to have super long hair; I just want to be able to look in the mirror and feel like I have nice hair.\n\nI get the impression that maybe my curls might look better once my hair gets a bit longer. In the back and in the front it seems better, but at the crown it still gets frizzy and the ends stick out, and I imagine it’s because I need more length and volume for the strands to fall properly.\n\nIf possible, I’d like some advice on what I can do to improve the look of my hair, so it can be more defined and give me better results.",

For context, I've been buying from Myntra for many years and even part of their Insiders program.\n\n  \nMy pre-paid order from Myntra was supposed to be delivered 2 weeks ago. They initially sent me a wrong product. To my surprise, their app had no option to return it so I had to fight with the customer executive to raise an exchange request (which is already hard to reach because of their dumb chatbot).\n\n\n\nThey sent me the same wrong product again a week later. Now they're saying the product doesn't have a return policy so they can't process any refund, nor are they responding to any requests for a return.\n\n  \nI ultimately had no choice but to complaint to Consumer Helpline but the Myntra team immediately lied there as well and closed the ticket saying they already did the exchange. What's the point of an exchange if you're just going to send something useless again?\n\n  \nI understand this could be a scam from the seller itself that keeps sending users the wrong product but I'm extremely disappointed at how Myntra chooses to handle such requests and further refuse to refund any money or take back the wrong product I haven't even opened.\n\n  \nPlease be cautious when spending big amounts on Myntra. I'm glad it was approx Rs. 500 order I can forget as a reminder to never use Myntra again but if it was a big amount I'd have been mentally exhausted with how useless their customer support is.",

I'm 28F so not that deep, but when I smile and stop, my skin doesnt bounce back. (I know this could also be dehydration, but drink a lot of water and use moisturizer every night)\n\nRight now I use a retinal prescribed about 1x/ week because it makes my face very dry particularly around the sides of my chin. Often I wake up with two red spots in other side of my mouth/chin after retinal - even when I slug with aquaphore after. I also have a bunch of different hydrating products like the neutragina water boost hyaluronic acid serum and moisturizer. I have used snail serum, and random other fad products but nothing has actually really made me stop and be like wow my skin looks great and all the same colour 😂\n\nI would love some help on routine product recommendations! I love skin care and I love to learn the science behind it and how it works so any info I would appreciate!!",

The problem is, it takes an eternity to dry, even when diffusing, and I have a life, you know? \n\nAm I asking for the impossible? I know there are lightweight curl creams out there, but I've never enjoyed them, I feel like they just don't do enough, and I do think the weight of the cream really helps keep the curls smooth and shiny. \n\nCan you have weight to a product without it taking an eternity to dry? I've used mousse instead, and that dries quicker, but my hair feels drier, less smooth, and gets more tangled. I have pretty high porosity (from bleaching 🥲), hair is both moderate thickness and density. I've used all sorts of gels and mousses, trust me, and I never get that smooth, moisturized feel without a nice heavy cream.\n\nY'all, I swear to god, the second ANY cream hits my head, even just a little, it doubles the drying time but GOOOOOOOOOD does my hair feel so much better.\n\nMaybe there's like, a really hydrating, thin, water-based leave-in out there? HELP. My arms are tired, I can't live like this for the sake of looking fabulous.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\ndouble wash with nizoral (scalp only) and it's a 10 moisturizing shampoo.\n\ncondition with pattern beauty heavy conditioner and sometimes the olaplex bond intense moisture mask\n\nstyle with a small amount of curl smith oil in cream and/or a whole lot of mousse (lotta body mousse or pattern mousse)\n\nstyle w bounce curl brush, diffuse (💪🏽😭)\n\nfinish w paul mitchell super skinny",

      "content": "Hello everyone. Sorry for the long post. I’m at my wits end. I have extremely dry, sensitive, reactive, AND acne prone skin. I went to a derm for the first time to address acne. Took doxy, used tret, it helped. My skin was pretty dry and stung, but it wasn’t bad. But my skin barrier was destroyed when I introduced clindamycin benzole peroxide ointment. I had to stop washing my face with face wash for a month and used water and intensely hydrating products. When I told my derm, he told me that he doesn’t recommend moisturizer for acne prone skin and to use the benzoyl peroxide face wash with tretinoin. Obviously my skin was super irritated already, why would I do that? So I stopped seeing him. Tried another derm. They put me on the same regimen and I tried to explain my super sensitive dry skin, they didn’t acknowledge it.\n\nNow I don’t know what to do. I have the most dry flaky skin, especially around my mouth and eyes. But when I use hydrating face wash (LaRoche or First Aid Beauty) I have acne flair ups. I have been trying Thayer’s ph balancing face wash and it’s fine but my skin is getting drier. My only other products are Avene cicaflate+ restorative cream, and Avene tolerance. My acne isn’t terrible right now, only a few around my mouth and chin, but my skin is SO DRY AND FLAKY. It is embarrassing. Around my mouth is red, flaky, and it just looks gross. It looks like I drank a red Gatorade like a toddler, and let it freeze to my face. My eyes look wrinkled and flaky. I can’t wear makeup at all anymore. I am allergic to a lot of things and so I can’t try a lot of other skincare products. I am genuinely frustrated to tears.\n\nPlease any recs at all would be so helpful. I just need something I can use that is hydrating, and doesn’t make me break out, safe for extremely sensitive, eczema prone skin. Please any assistance would be a blessing 🙏",

Then I dyed my hair and everything started to change, it didn't wave as much anymore, I cut it to remove the damage to my hair, and it didn't improve much, I dyed it again a few months later since I wanted to change the color and that was where everything got even worse, for it to curl I practically had to fill myself with products (cream, gel, etc.) when before I didn't even need them, I decided to shave my hair to cut all my hair and make it grow new (before that shave I had dyed it again since the color change was like an addiction) and months after the shave I reduced it again just in case, I used Mielle rosemary oil on my scalp to make it grow faster, apparently now it looks healthier, but it only curls when I put water or some cream on it and if I don't put anything on it looks straight, what would you recommend?
