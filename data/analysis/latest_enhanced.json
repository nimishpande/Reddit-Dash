      "content": "I dont know if its the OCD/Body Dysmorphia in me, also im not sure if its wrong to feel this way, do people generally feel this way when going through hair loss? but man nothing compensates enough for hair loss, stuff like \"shave and get buff and go to gym\" never really helps, its such a dumb saying, or atleast it never helped me get over the hair loss, its an attempt in compensating but its not enough, even if you go through with it you'll realise that all the muscles and being big is not enough to compensate ur actual insecurity and thats where the mentality of giving up comes in, atleast for me.\n\nIve been bald for 10 years since age 20 and im about to turn 30 next month and there has not been, through those years ive gone through like 10 different phases, working out for years and getting \"buff\" buying new fresh clothes and dressing well, buying all the latest fragrances but nothing is ever fucking enough for me to actually come out of my shell and do something besides go to work and home.\n\nI just feel like im a spectator and im waiting for this life to end or some miracle to happen so i can start living again(with hair), i went bald way too young and that was way too harsh, i never really got to live, i spent my 20s inside my house embarrased about being bald.\n\nAnyways i guess thats what the O in OCD stands for, obsession and im obsessing over hair for over 12 years now and ive been norwood 7 for 10 of them.\n\nFunnily enough i dont obsess over anything else besides hair, i got many more flaws but nothing i care about, also i didnt really have OCD or anxiety before i started balding, not sure if thats age related or hair loss triggering that for me, If i would get hair tomorrow (just even a nw3 at this point) i would do everything, i would literally be so fucking happy and outgoing, all the things i would do and get done, it would be unbeliveable, im just sad i got dealt with this shitty hand and im jealous of people who can go bald in their 20s and just get over it and live their life and not drop out of school and not get a job for years because of that.\n\nEven if u look someone like bradley martyn who has a physique that is literally 0.1% and not obtainable naturally STILL hiding behind his hat at almost 40 years old despite having insane physique.\n\nAnyways just a small rant about the \"shave and get fit\" only people with hair say that shit, even finding a motivation to get fit as someone who is bald is hard, just feel like giving up cause no matter how hard you try to compensate it wont be enough, if u care about hair in the first place you cant just get rid of the insecurity by having muscles.\n\nAnyways, take ur dut fellas, if u hate balding in ur 20s u still will at 30s and 40s.\n\ni lowkey i wish i just had a chance, give me a fucking norwood 3 at 25 or norwood 3 at 30 years old, not norwood 7 at 20 when i have nothing left to try or do, no transplant or no drugs help if ur that fucked.\n\nIll try this again at 40, maybe ill finally be fine with being bald at that age, if i could pay 50% of my salary every month for the rest of my life just to have hair i would do that in a heartbeat.",

I went to a derm many months ago and they prescribed me with a tretinoin % microsphere gel &amp; a clindamycin+benzoyl low percent lotion. they told me to alternate between them every night so I’ve been rinsing my face in the AM and using the foaming facial cleanser from cerave, then occasionally the eqqualberry swimming pool toner, then the prescribed gels, and then the purito oat in calming gel lotion in the PM.\n\nit has gotten a lot better than back then but I found it’s recently been surfacing again :,) and it makes me want to cut out all my skin care entirely so that’s what I’ve been doing the past days.

We also know that arrector pili muscles die when you are extensively bald and have major fibrosis. And then we have the issue of escaping stem cells.\n\nSo how did Pelage grow hair from bald areas when we know that progenitor cells and arrector pili muscles die. Also there's the issue of escaping stem cells.\n\n\nThe co-founder of Pelage at 24:25 is saying that the hair follicles are still there and they tested skin sample of a person who was bald for decades and had lots of growth.
