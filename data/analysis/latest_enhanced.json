      "title": "Can shampoo do anything other than cleansing?",
      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Most of the time, it ends up just looking like tight waves that curl at the end. But when I diffuse, the curls go up higher, and even where it’s not quite a curl I can see that there is a spiral, it’s just extremely stretched out. \n\nThere are also times when I don’t change my curl routine at all and I get full on ringlets and curls in some places. I know this isn’t just a case of me having an uneven curl pattern (though that’s probably true too) because it’s different pieces of hair. I honestly don’t know why this happens and how to replicate it because it’s so random. I think I’m probably styling it wrong, and I also think my hair might be too heavy since it looks like stretched out spirals, though I’ve had it short before in my freshman year of highschool. It looked a bit more defined but not by much (though I’m not sure I was really styling it much that could be part of it.) I’ve tried changing my routine in different ways and while it helps it doesn’t fix it. Can someone please give me advice 😭 \n\nI did bleach and dye my hair, which I know doesn’t help but my hair doesn’t really seem changed at all.\n\nRoutine-\n\nCurrently I exclusively use Not Your Mother’s curl talk products. (With the exception of the clarifying shampoo)\n\n\n\nI wash my hair maybe once a week, maybe more but never more than a couple times a wee. When I wash it I use their bond building shampoo and conditioner. \n\n\n\nI do the rest of this everyday regardless if I washed it or not but I always wet it in the shower- while my hair is still wet I spray in leave in conditioner and brush with a curly hair tangle tweezer (I brush it as little as possible but I have to brush it daily since it gets extremely tangled). Then I put their curl defining cream through my mids to ends and make sure it’s completely distributed by brushing it through a little. If it ever starts to dry during this process I spray it with water. Then I add their curl definition gel then scrunch, then I let it air dry.\n\n  \nOh and i also clarify occasionally if it feels like there’s a lot of build up with Maui Moisture Scalp Care Clarifying Shampoo but I don’t count that as part of my routine since I don’t do it often.\n\n  \nI probably have a lot of product build up but I’ve gone through phases where I only used detangler and my hair was a lot poofier,  frizzier, and undefined.\n\n  \ntldr: My hair usually looks mostly wavy but curly at the end, but sometimes it makes ringlets/tigher curls and it’s different pieces and randomly",

      "content": "Hello!\n\nI’ve tried various products over the years with minimal success but I think I’ve finally pinned down the issue: my hair just will not dry. \n\nI have very fine, very dense low porosity hair. I use the bowl method as that seems to work better at bringing out the curls than not using it. \n\nI’ve tried plopping before diffusing - up to 5 times with a different towel each time for maximum absorption. Not mention I squeeze a ton out over the bowl beforehand. \n\nI’ve tried diffusing hoods. \n\nI’ve tried just regular diffusing attachments. \n\nNo matter what, I’ve never been able to dry my hair all the way because I usually give up after about three hours. Besides which, I don’t have three hours+ in the mornings to spare while getting ready for work. Also, I have to refresh my hair every day even if I sleep with a silk bonnet.  There’s just so much hair and again it’s so fine that I have to redo everything or else it starts falling. \n\nI’ve tried air drying and that’s always a horrible mess. My hair is very long (I’m 5’7” and it touch the very tippy top of my butt) and so it moves a lot or else I have to move it a lot out of the way. This gets in the way of a cast forming. I’ve tried clipping my hair up which usually results in the ends of my hair looking n okayish but then the bulk of my hair is still wet. \n\nI can include my current “routine” but it should be noted that as of right now I’ve given up on taking care of my curly hair because the drying part is too onerous. Right now I just wash with a clarifying shampoo every other wash (Suave something or other, it’s blue and cheap) and I condition with The Ordinary’s conditioner when I use that shampoo. The other shampoo I use is the Maui Moisture one with flaxseed. Then I’ll “condition” with Alikay Natural’s Knots Be Gone.\n\nHow does anyone get their hair to dry?! This is awful! I’m so sick of throwing money at this stupid hair all for it not to behave the way anyone else’s does. ",

My hair is pretty average, normal porosity, medium density, finer hair in front and medium coarse hair in the back. \n\nCurrent routine: Garnier Fructis clarifying shampoo followed with Shea moisture hydrating hair masque once a week\n\nConditioner only every other day or every 2 days depending on greasyness and laziness levels\n\nSquish to condish \n\nKnot Today leave in conditioner while hair is dripping wet in the shower, scrunch so my hair isn't dripping\n\nOut of the shower, I roughly section a top and bottom section and do the bottom section first. When I style the top section I split it into 2 sections, left and right\n\nFor each section, I spray with water to moisten the roots more, comb away from my scalp with a wide toothed comb, put a bit of Shea moisture whipped curl cream in my hands and emulsify (not really necessary but I bought it to try so I'm just trying to use up at this point). I rake the curl cream through, then using praying hands to reform the clumps and scrunch. I microplop with a microfiber towel, then put a golf ball size (more for the top section) of Not Your Mother's mousse and apply with praying hands and scrunch. Spritz some heat protectant, then I diffuse upside down till a cast has formed and my roots are like 75% dry. Then I pixie diffuse right side up, flipping side to side. I use a small rounded hair claw to clip my roots where my section is to get some volume\n\nI shower at night, so I leave the cast in my hair, put on a satin bonnet, and sleep. I scrunch out any cast in the morning. Usually it's a bit wild at the start of day 1, but it flattens a bit as the day goes on. For day 2 (and sometimes 3), I just spritz with water in the morning to dampen, scrunch a couple times, then scrunch out the cast after it's dry. \n\nLately I've been more into mousse more than gel. Gel gave me more definition, but mousse has given me more consistent results. Plus it's easier to sleep in the cast set by mousse than gel 🤭 the amount of mousse I use is probably a lot but it works surprisingly well",

      "title": "My hair has been incredibly messy and unruly lately, I need some help!!",
      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m really hoping for some help because I’m completely at a loss with my curls right now. I’ve been obsessed with hair care for years and have had lots of ups and downs with it but lately it’s been looking so bad that I genuinely struggle to look in the mirror most days. These photos were taken right after drying.\n\nMy main issues:\n\nThere’s a strange separation between my bangs and the sides that makes it look like I have a receding hairline (seen especially from the side)\n\nThe sides of my hair stick out awkwardly\n\nMy crown/top is very flat\n\nThe back never looks right and feels undefined\n\nMy curls completely fall apart overnight, so I have to wash and style every morning\n\nSleeping in a bonnet actually makes my hair look worse, not better\n\nCurls form into these big coils that just look like worms, especially seen at the picture from the top.\n\nHalf my hair is defined, half is frizzy af\n\nI’ve tried many routines and products over the years and feel like nothing is working anymore.\n\nCurrent Routine!!\n\nShampoo &amp; Conditioner: Bali Curls moisturizing shampoo and Bali Curls conditioner\n\nI shampoo normally, then detangle my hair in the shower with the Bali Curls conditioner using my fingers. I rinse the conditioner out fully. Once a week I use a deep conditioning mask.\n\nStyling:\n\n1.\t⁠I lightly scrunch out excess water and briefly plop to remove dripping water \n\n2.I  apply a pea-sized amount of Bali Curls Curl Cream upside down, raking then scrunching it in, then style a bit with a Denman brush (not that much, i usually don’t have time, i just try to break up the big curls)\n\n3. I plop again\n\n4. I apply a small amount of Bali Curls Volumizing Mousse (also upside down), scrunching it in.\n\nDrying:\n\nI mostly diffuse upside down with a diffuser (a dyson knockoff) farther away from the scalp, then closer as the hair gets dryer.\n\nIf there’s a cast, i put a small amount of bali curls oil in and also scrunch.\n\nDespite all this, my hair ends up flat on top, puffy or awkward on the sides, and strangely separated in the front. I don’t know if this is a technique issue, a product issue, or something else entirely. Any advice especially for fixing crown volume, bang separation, and side shape would be incredibly appreciated. I feel like right now my hair looks so messy that it makes me look like a slob (sorry). Whenever i tell people i spend an hour on my hair everyday they’re like. Really? Nooo.. :(",

My mom says my thick hair is because I shaved my face with my father's razor when I was a kid. But I guess it's mostly genetic, anyway.\n\nI go to this local parlour in my mohalla. All the while she is threading my eyebrows she always complain about how thick my hair is. I mean girl that is why I'm here! \n\nThen she'll suggest I just thread my upper lips also. But I tell her to wax it only. Guess what she did today. She was melting the wax for half an hour. Without waiting for the wax to cool down or anything she applied the hot boiling wax on my face. Oh my god it hurt and stung like crazy. And because the wax was too liquid-y, it slipped and fell on my chest. I'm so annoyed rn. I was not crying but tears kept falling out of my eyes. \n\nMY SKIN PEELED OFF BECAUSE OF HOW HOT THE WAX WAS!! \n\nI'm never going back again. I'm going to learn how to take care of my face myself. I hate her. I hate her. I hate her.\n\nAnd just for the context I'm not insecure about my facial hair but because I've thick and dense hair on my face. My face becomes really itchy and i hate it. \n\nI can't wait to earn and get everything lasered. ",

I like scrunching best because it's so quick, but brush styling doesnt curl my roots and finger coiling is too time consuming.

In my experience, washing 24 hours after color shouldn’t affect the longevity because the color doesn’t continue processing &amp; the conditioner seals with an acidic pH. I’m confusedddd",

At first, Rogaine spray but this gave me a very itchy scalp. I progressed to the foam which I applied far more than directed every night before bed, to both my thinning crown and my receding hairline.\n\nThis made absolutely no difference whatsoever, and my hairline continued to worsen.\n\nIn November 2025 I switched from Rogaine Minoxidil foam to Sons combination spray, which is topical Minoxidil, Finasteride and Tretinoin. I considered taking Finasteride oral, however due to some unrelated medical conditions I have, my GP recommended against it.\n\nThe instructions say to use 4 sprays per day, however I shower twice a day, so I have to apply it twice, and also four sprays simply doesn't cover the areas well enough, so I end up using between 5 and 8 sprays. I then massage it in with my fingers.\n\nDespite applying twice a day AND using more than directed, I am still experiencing absolutely no hair changes at all. Nothing. No vellus hairs, no density increases in what's currently there, nothing.\n\nTo summarise, I've been on topical Minoxidil for 15 months, before switching to topical Min+Fin for 2 months. Zero changes at all.\n\nJust after any tips, advice, or if anyone has experienced anything similar? Should I keep on the Min+Fin for longer? Or is it time to give it up?\n\nThanks",
