      "content": "Started my natural hair texture journey like a month ago. Every day is a different look—volume/definition/softness/shininess—it all differs! I just wanted to share my like day 3-4 hair maybe! I know the curls are not defined on this specific day of my hair wash schedule by any means, and I have not perfected my refresh routine, but I want to say that I really dig voluminous hair looks. I want to look like a 🦁 haha! \n\nRoutine: Wash with Mielle rosemary shampoo and random generic Pantene conditioner. \n\nIn really wet hair, rake either Mixed Chicks Curl Sculptor thinned out with water and Aussie gel on top and scrunch. Try to comb crown of head backwards/horizontally and apply those products and scrunch for more volume. Avoid middle part as much as you can. Then, for this look in particular I guess: mix just a little bit of the The Doux Texture mousse/foam, The Doux Honey mousse/foam, Herbal Essences mousse, John Frieda mousse, and Dollar Tree Spa Luxury extra hold mousse. I mix them all together and rake from roots to end and then diffuse however I want, especially upside down for more volume. \n\nAnd then I actually ended up putting my hair in a curly bun with a side part. And the next day after when I took it down, I retouched/rewet my hair leave in conditioner from Dollar Tree and put some The Doux texture mousse around face framing and Dollar Tree coconut hair oil and CHI hair oil and hairsprayed with some Aussie hair spray for hold!\n\nMedia: 1) Hair down after refresh 2) Curly bun with side part before hair refresh day (ignore crusty ass makeup hehe)",

I don't know whether this will work for others, but here's the routine she did for me:\n\nShe began styling my hair when it was extremely wet.\n\nShe used much more product than I typically use. I have fine hair, so I always went easy on the product. She went section by section and coated that hair thoroughly. (It was a light foam for my fine hair, but could be heavier based on texture.) Each section of hair was carefully coated root to ends.\n\nShe applied some Innersense finishing spray to reduce drying time. I'm not sure all finishing sprays can be used this way - probably not - but I found several blow dry sprays on Amazon that are designed to cut dry time (e.g. Kenra,  Colorwow, Redken).\n\nShe finger combed it with a focus on creating ribboned clumps. (This was not tedious finger curling, just raking section by section to clump and ribbon the hair. She said anything that looks sloppy and haphazard while wet will become frizz when dry.\n\nOnce I had some ribboned clumps, she carefully scrunched the ribbons in her hand once, held the hair close to the head, and pulsed a few times. If you've ever \"squished to condish,\" it was just like that.\n\nShe used to diffuser for several minutes to hover over the hair and dry it a bit without touching it.\n\nOnce a cast started setting up, she gently picked up sections of the hair and put just the ends in the bowl of the diffuser. The goal was to dry the ends without disturbing the hair too much.\n\nFinally, when it was maybe 80% dry, she started to pixie dry the hair and scrunch it right up to the roots with the bowl of the diffuser. She had me tip my head to one side and then to the other to get a little volume toward the roots. She advised *not* to tip fully upside down, as it would disturb the hair too much.\n\nAt the end, she used some serum to break the cast. (I don't have serum at home, so I used a drop of LUS oil.)\n\nI've been sleeping in a bonnet at night, and my hair looks perfect the next day. The curls really hold.\n\nAll products at the salon were Innersense. I use LUS at home. ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "I guess I just need a place to rant because I'm so exhausted from my body being inflamed all the time. I cant remember the last time I could put my face on a pillow without pain, the last time I did my skincare without chunks of dead skin coming off, the last time I could apply makeup normally, the last time Icould put lotion on without my whole face burning, or the last time I could smile without being in pain because of the 10 cysts always present on both of my cheeks. I tried really hard to heal this without going on Accutane. I tried dapsone, winlevi, spironolactone, and tretinoin. Spironolactone was the only thing that worked for me, and I even had to stop that because it was giving me the worst side effects in my life. Right now, my skincare routine takes so fucking long, I have to plan ahead to make sure I do it. I use what my derm prescribed me, dapsone and winlevi in am followed by byoma serum, cerave pm moisturizer and sunscreen. then at night I do winlevi, tretinoin (every other night), serum and moisturizer. STILL HAVE DRY SKIN. I had to throw away so many skincare products and now I am so strict about my routine. I only use water-based products, and don't wear makeup on days I don't have to. I used to have porcelain skin, and now it's so fucked up. I don't feel beautiful anymore, and I didn't even realize it, but I'm becoming a shell of a person. And I can't stop picking my skin, and when I do its like so bad, the cysts erupt with so much force out of my face its insane. I get scared myself. I am so tired of this, and I also randomly developed perioral dermatitis too, so I'm on doxycycline for it, and it's helping a little bit, but my acne is RAGING. I feel like the PD will just come back as soon as I get off Doxy. And I am so fucking tired of making so many lifestyle changes for my skin. I just want to live like a normal person, and I can't even do that. After so long of not wanting to go on birth control, but my derm pushing Accutane for 2 years, I finally caved. But the worst part is that I am getting my consultation on Dec 29 and I won't even be able to start the Accutane until February because my fucking OBGYN QUIT AND MY PCP QUIT AND MY PSYCHIATRIST QUIT literally all in the same month, I shit you not, and I can't even get a goddamn IUD until February. SO Ihave to continue being tortured by my skin for another 3 months. I'm so sick and tired of going everywhere and constantly avoiding overhead lighting because it accentuates my acne. I sometimes catch glimpses of myself in the mirror and am horrified at what I see. I can't even get close to my boyfriend's face because I get so insecure about what he sees on my face. Its getting to the point where it's causing issues with me being close to him in our relationship. I feel so self-conscious that I will see someone from high school and they will see how terrible my skin has become. I try so hard to fix it Itry the spearmint tea, and destressing and avoid sugar and dairy blah blah , and I dont know what I did to deserve this. And the number of people who just blatantly tell me oh your skin looks pretty bad is insane. Like, do you think I don't know? I also developed the worst habit of picking at my skin every night. If Isee a whitehead, I HAVE TO POP IT, or if I even see a small opening to any of my cysts, I have to pop it. I KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE, but in my head, if I pop it, it means it will go away. I am very sad now because I feel like I have so many FUCKING HOLES in my face and theyre turnihng into CRATER-SIZED SCARS and I am so fucking depressed but I cant stop picking . On top of that, my period has not come this month, and my boobs hurt so bad (this has happened to me many times, not pregnant) because I have fibrocystic breast disease. its like as soon as I started college, my whole life fell apart. I have no energy for anything anymore. ANd its christmas, and I have to go to my boyfriends and I dont want his family to see my face, like I this its making myself want to end my self. I sound so superficial, but nobody understands me because it's not their face its mine, and I have been struggling with this acne for almost 3 years, and I am SO GODDAMN EXHAUSTED. bro I can't do this anymore. I don't want to cake my face in makeup every day im so sick of it. its ruining my life, and I'm so angry at my body. AND I AM A VERY STRESSED AND ANXIOUS PERSON, and there is not much I can do to change that, I take meds.",

I’ve immediately stopped using it and hoping the damage isn’t permanent. Any advice on how to repair the damage? I actually don’t have much of a sophisticated “routine” really but getting to the age where I stupidly thought I should start looking after my skin better only for this to happen! \n\nI use a face roller kept in the freezer under my eyes in the morning and apply Hyaluronic serum on my slightly wet face and use Estee Lauder DayWear moisturiser with SPF on top. That’s it really. I’ve also started to use the same moisturiser before bed since this damage happened and apply Vaseline on top to try to “lock in” the moisture. Once a week, I use a sheet mask or more of a deep cleanse though I haven’t done this since this occurred. \n\nI actually didn’t have much problems with my skin before starting this product so this is really stressful and disheartening! I was hoping to have a lower bleph procedure with fat transfer in the coming months too but not sure if this issue will make it more difficult. Please help! \n\nMerry Christmas to all. Thanks ",

I left the appointment feeling like I wasn’t really listened to.\n\nI explained to the dermatologist that I was on Accutane in the past, and ever since then my skin has been dry but still acne-prone. My skin feels tight and itchy after cleansing, but later in the day it develops an oily film. What I was really hoping for was guidance on how to manage or reduce that oiliness, especially since it seems connected to dryness.\n\nWhen seborrheic dermatitis was mentioned, I told him I’ve already tried antifungal treatments before and they didn’t help. Despite that, I was prescribed an antifungal wash anyway, which left me feeling dismissed.\n\nI do understand how this may have happened - my skin is complicated, and post-Accutane issues aren’t always straightforward. It’s possible the doctor didn’t fully grasp the full picture in a short visit.\n\nHas anyone else left a dermatology appointment feeling unheard or brushed off? How did you handle it?",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",
