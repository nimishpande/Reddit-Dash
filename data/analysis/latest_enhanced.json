      "content": "These are my legs before IPL and after a year with IPL.\n\nI used an epilator before but over time my hair started to ingrow and I was picking them. I'm a young woman and I was desperate because my legs looked terrible and nothing helped.\n\nThen I came across this forum and saw before/after photos of one lady, and her legs were incredibly smooth. Thanks to her I bought an IPL device and I don't regret. Then I said to myself that if it works I'll add my photos here too, maybe it will help someone decide to try. \n\nI am writing this as a positive message for everyone who has similar problem as me! There is hope, but it takes time :)",

It can be a PITA to find a hairdresser who will even do this \\*but\\* if you do find one, it’s often cheaper than even a normal cut as they don’t have to wash your hair.\n\nThe dry cut gets the shape right. Then I go home and wash/style it myself (to get it to curl again - it’s always crazy after a cut), and then I cut it curl by curl.\n\nYou want 2 snips per curl - one on an angle and then one to just take the tip off what you’ve just cut. You’re not trying to change the overall shape of your hair or make it shorter, just a shallow ish angle for the first cut and then the tip for the second. \n\nEach time I wash/style I’ll have a quick look for curls that need a snip, but generally it’s only a few that need a snip for the next couple of washes and I’m good to go until I need a proper cut again. \n\nIt’s actually hilarious cos my current hairdresser makes me send her pics when it’s ‘done’ so she can show other customers, but she doesn’t know I’m doing a secret squirrel curly cut at home after she shapes it 😂\n\nRoutine: professional dry cut, snip, snip!

      "content": "This is my lovely hair 🫶🏻 she’s been on the struggle bus for about the last two years. I want to add that I’ve avoided posting because I know you guys are about to fry me lol.\n\nI’ll admit I was very fortunate and uneducated in my youth and early adulthood - I could put whatever on her and she flourished.  Her best look was when I was using healthy sexy hairs tri wheat leave in and garniers spray gel. Then one day I thought I should start using actual curly products and it all kinda went to hell from there, slowly but surely. \n\nCurrent routine is:\n\n\\- wash every 2 days with redKen all soft \n\n\\- oribes hair alchemy fortifying treatment for leave in \n\n\\- I’ve tried numerous gels and mousses but the current one I’ve had luck with is miss Jessie’s pillow talk lotion which I comb throughout my hair then scrunch with a t shirt \n\n\\- air dry \n\nYou read all that correctly - I use no masks, have no protein (I just learned this is a big necessity which is wild), etc, no clarifying shampoo, etc.\n\nI’d like to also note I HAVE to wash every 2 days. I have tried and tried to prolong it with a bonnet, wrap, satin pillowcase, etc and my hair wads up and gets oily. Any tips for that is great too! When I do refresh, I use a tiny bit of oribe oil on the tips to give some hydration back to them. \n\nBack when my hair looked its best, I’d like to note how that looked: \n\n\\- wash every day with tresemme moisture shampoo and conditioner\n\n\\- towel dry, and when damp, use healthy sexy hairs tri wheat soy leave in and then brush out with a wet brush (still use this) \n\n\\- garnier spray gel, sprayed throughout then scrunch with hands \n\n\\- air dry \n\nIf you are wondering why I strayed from this - my hair began feeling dry and curling weird, so I swapped things out until my hair was soft again but at the cost of my curls it seems\n\nI’m here because she has really stopped forming full curls around my face and at my root/crown. All of my ringlets start at collarbone level and go to my ends. They also have started tangling together and wadding up (I hope that makes sense.) I’ve began wearing my hair up in a clip to avoid this and i actually have an appointment to cut it to shoulder length again tomorrow (it’s currently a little longer than mid back.) \n\nSo my question is what do I do? What do you recommend? When I began searching, I found a million answers to what I COULD do, but then determined the best route was to actually show you guys my hair and embarrassingly admit that I don’t do much. I need products, a routine, all the things. Is cutting it going to be good for it? I know it’s heavy and weight can impact how it curls up top. Anyway - sos send help and thanks in advance 😭",

      "content": "During the past couple of months, my hands have gotten very dry and damaged, thanks to me suffering from OCD and washing my hands way too much as a result.\n\nI used to use Nivea hand cream products (the Soft one, the pink one for sensitive skin and also the blue one for, again, sensitive care), but I believe they don’t help anymore, as I need my skin barrier repaired. I switched to Cerave reparative hand cream, and it was really helpful. I used it on back of my hands, where redness was present (eczema).\n\nHowever, I never used it on my palms, because I thought no rednesss = no problem. It was only weeks later when I realised there WAS a problem with my hands too: the many lines!\n\nI really hope it is visible enough in the pictures. My palms now basically look like maps. You can find many paths there, but no path to the end of my pain so far. Even after being in touch with water for a few minutes, they look like as if I’ve taken a long bath. They get so old-looking so fast. And the lines… not only are they ugly, but they also burn.\n\nI searched a lot online to see if other people suffer from the same thing, but I didn’t find one. Most people have eczema, but their hands don’t look like mine. So I don’t know what helps me.\n\nI’ve tried the same cerave product for a couple of days so far. I haven’t seen a change. Is it too early to expect that?\n\nI tried La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Hand cream too, and it made my pain worse. So I stopped using it.\n\nDoes anyone have a recommendation for me? I’d appreciate your help!",

What has worked well for you and what do you not recommend? \n\nI think I’ve really messed up my curl pattern by shampooing (and maybe brushing) way too much, and I would like to fix it but am not sure where to go from here. \n\nMy husband and I own a renovation business and we do literally everything by ourselves, so my hair has been exposed to a lot of icky things but I think the real issues are drywall dust and mortar/grout dust. We don’t do those specific jobs  every day, but when we do do them it takes multiple days. From just minimal exposure, the dust typically causes my hair to matte and is pretty unmanageable, so I was trying to get ahead of the curve and just keep it as clean as possible and I messed it up. \n\nWhen I’m working with stuff that I know messes up my hair, I wear a little slouchy hat/hair covering (sorry I’m not sure the right word for it!) but it feels like a lot of the dust still gets through. \n\nI’d appreciate any guidance or suggestions! \n\nRoutine:\n\nSome of these are very recent additions( bought this week) and I’m already seeing progress! \n\nNew Products: \n\nPattern Bounce Back Pre-Poo (used once do far, didn’t shampoo afterwards bc I’m trying to get my scalp back to its natural oil level)\n\nPattern Leave In Conditioner \n\nPattern Jojoba oil blend \n\nRizzos Curls Brush (literally the first time I’ve been able to brush my hair without so much pain lol) \n\nRegular products: \n\nPattern Hydrating Shampoo\n\nPattern Lightweight Conditioner \n\nI don’t really have a specific schedule or specific routine, I just go with what feel right on whatever day \n\nThank you!!",

My doctor recommend I use Alhydran medical after care for the healing (I live in the Netherlands, I believe this product is only sold here?).\n\nHowever, I really want to avoid my skin hyperpigmenting during the healing,\n\nFor context my skin is pretty dry but I have an oily forehead and nose, however even when its oily i still get skin flakes, I was told this is because my skin is very dry and my body starts overproducing oil? Im pretty new with skincare so Im currently using:\n\n\\- Cerave foaming oil cleanser\n\n\\- Snail mucin 96 Cosrx\n\n\\- Hydrating rice mask Cosrx (that I use as a moisturizer)\n\n\\- Beauty of Joseon sunscreen\n\nCould anyone recommend me any products that might help stopping hyperpigmentation so that I can use together with the Alhydran? Any recommendations on my overall skin care routine are very welcome as well!\n\nThanks a lot in advance and I hope you have a nice day :)",

      "content": "25 (almost 26), I never used to have acne-prone skin until a few months before I turned 25. I am constantly seeing new red spots develop that never progress to pimples but stay on my skin for forever it feels. Anytime I have a pimple, it will just progress to a red spot that never goes away. I don’t pick or pop, I do use patches. I have very sensitive skin, even many gentle products burn my skin. My acne feels itchy. I feel like my skin constantly look red &amp; irritated (and it is).\n\nIn October 2024 I had a yearly physical that was done by a training resident who hoped to specialize in dermatology- he saw I had like 2 pimples that day and prescribed me an Azelic Acid cream of some kind and instructed me to use it every day twice/day. I didn’t know anything about skincare and just went with it. It completely changed my skin and it hasn’t been the same since. \n\nRoutine-\n\nAM:\n\n\\- CeraVe SA cleanser\n\n\\- Vitamin C &amp; Collagen serum\n\n\\- Cetaphil moisturizer for oily skin\n\n\\- Hero rescue balm when needed \n\nPM:\n\n\\- Ponds cold cream makeup remover when I wear makeup (not often)\n\n\\- CeraVe foaming cleanser\n\n\\- Aloe serum from The Ordinary\n\n\\- Equate Resurfacing Serum every few days\n\n\\- Pimple patches when needed\n\nOther:\n\n\\- Changing pillowcases multiple times/week\n\n\\- I drink a lot of water\n\n\\- Taking pre/post/pro biotics\n\n\\- Cleaning makeup brushes &amp; sponges often\n\nI’m desperate to get this under control but I don’t know what do use, I’m scared of making it worse. I can hardly look in the mirror, makeup doesn’t cover it well (I can see dark purple spots through foundation), my face is itchy. Time to see a derm? Diet change? Product suggestions? Any advice is appreciated. ",

I don't feel like my skin or brows are particularly oily so my next thought is perhaps the length of my brow hairs is contributing to the problem?  I've even resorted to rolling my spoolie in hairspray to help hold and still have the issue of them kinda falling within mins.\n\nAnyway, I want to see if trimming them down will help but I'm a lefty so I worry that most brow scissors won't work for me (as with standard scissors I absolutely need lefty designated pairs or I have to make serious efforts using my right hand and I'm not about to lose an eye over poor hand mechanics).\n\nAre there any lefties out there that have had success with any decent quality brand of brow scissors out there?

I've used minoxidil before but stopped because of side effects (heart palpitations), so that's definitely off the table. \n\nI've read testimonies on this forum from people who claim microneedling alone is just as effective as minoxidil alone, but most are from 3 to 4 years ago. I'd greatly appreciate some updated information, if possible.\n\nI still have quite a few baby/vellus hairs on my widow's peak, perhaps remnants of what used to be a lush jungle of hair in my youth. Would microneedling help bring those back into full hairs, or at least thicken my hairline?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

I apply it before going to bed. I don't like the creamy/greasy texture when I apply it  and I wake up with a sort of slightly greasy layer over my skin face.\n\nIs there any light moisturizer that actually feels like it penetrates and blends with your skin?\n\nThanks in advance for your help.",
