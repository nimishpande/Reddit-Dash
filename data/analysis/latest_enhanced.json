      "content": "3 months progress on 1mg Oral Finasteride and 5ml Topical Minoxidil. I micro-needle every 7-10 days or so. I also take cheap vitamin tablets: biotin, vitamin D, iron and zinc (have no idea if they do anything).\n\nBalding slowly since my late 20’s diffusively and never did anything about it until now.\n\n1st pic (wish I’d taken better pics) is the evening after I’d micro needled earlier in the day ready for the first minoxidil application. I went pretty hard, that’s why there’s loads of tiny scabs. I don’t really get scabs like that anymore, my scalp must of gotten used to the abuse.\n\n2nd pic is earlier today in bright sunshine. My hair’s a little greasy from min still but thought it was good light.\n\nAs you can see I was pretty far gone, probably Norwood 6/7. I didn’t really expect any kind of result but had nothing to lose. I was kind of amazed to see loads of tiny hairs pop up within probably the first 12 days. I never expected to get much regrowth due to my age and how long the hair had been gone, let alone as much as this in the first 3 months. I just hope the progress continues, the new hairs are small and fine like a new born baby’s but I have coverage over the entire scalp where it was practically slick bald. Best case scenario is that they continue to mature and I start to have the near appearance \nof a normal head of hair (though reminding myself to be positive yet realistic). Wish me luck and I hope this gives someone as far gone as me a little hope that some progress is possible, like so many other peoples posts have given me. Wish I’d known about these meds when I was younger!\n\nWill probably do an update later down the line.\n",

      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "It has officially been over a year since I've started this journey. At first I started using liquid minoxidil for the first 4 months and the effects the liquid had on me were really rough. I had skin flare ups, bad rashes and I had to stop. After a month break I switched to Foam the generic brand from Walmart. And since then I haven't had any issues with side effects pertaining to rashes or hot spots. I have not had any issues with finasteride what's so ever. Sexual libido is great and have had no issues. Only common thing is with the semen to be watery at times but most of the time it is normal. I've taken to vitamins on and off. At first I did microneedle but due to the fact that I have sensitive skin it would bother me from time to time and then I stopped. I know I still have a long journey ahead but I'm surprised to see these changes. I am considering in doing a HT in the near future just bc I still have less volume on top since it's still thin. I get my haircuts on the side to make it look not as light on top. I've learned alot throughout this community and I'm glad I gave my hair a chance I really wish I would've done this sooner at least 5 years ago when my hair was really thinning out throughout that time I buzzed my head. This is my first year that I've \"grown out\" my hair and I haven't felt this happy in long time. I shall keep you guys posted throughout my journey. Best of luck to all ",

      "content": "Reposting without links. Hope this helps at least one person not get zombified by hyper-consumerism next week.\n\nHi everyone, K. Hoe here.\n\nA few days ago, I made a post about kids being targeted by skincare companies that passed half a million views in 48 hours. I feel like that shows how overwhelmed this environment has become - but also how much people are waking up to stuff like this.\n\nBlack Friday is next week, so I’m making another post for the real targets this time: adults.\n\nI’ve worked on these Black Friday campaigns specifically at a beauty company, and know for a fact that they treat us like zombified spenders during this period, so I hope this short rant can put things in perspective for the times we get that crazy itch to go crazy with our spending.\n\nIf you need a tap on the shoulder and a gentle pull back into reality before buying anything, let this be it.\n\nBlack Friday sales won’t save your skin.\n\nI’ve seen people turn into frantic, impulsive versions of themselves they normally would never want to be.\n\nWe start believing that the product with “40% OFF” will fix things that weren’t even product problems to begin with.\n\nFun fact: the average American earning six figures (which is not even a decent salary anymore in HCOL locations - where most of the beauty demand is) is projected to spend $2,500-4,300 on Black Friday sales this year. That is already so much money on potentially things we will never use, and that number goes up exponentially as the earnings do.\n\nThis week is engineered to press (more like squeeze the living sh\\*t out of) where you’re most vulnerable. Brands **love** stressed, tired and overwhelmed adults because stressed, tired and overwhelmed adults buy more.\n\nThe messaging is always about empowerment and self-care. But the real goal is to get you to load your cart with stuff crap you won’t think about again that will end up sitting on your product graveyard shelf in two weeks\n\nYour skin - and your routine - are *not* falling apart this week.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, we get a dopamine rush even when looking at an ad for a Black Friday sale days before it goes live, never mind when looking at the checkout page with 30 things in your cart.\n\nI keep hammering this bit to people: **Most of the skin concerns you’re trying to solve aren’t product problems.** \n\nThey’re, *for 99% of people that aren’t a medical case*, lifestyle problems. Stress. Sleep. Weather shifts. Hormones. Pollution.\n\nBeing chronically overwhelmed and expecting a topical serum to offset internal exhaustion or a life that’s been running on fumes is *not* how this works.\n\nThis is not me telling you not to buy anything.\n\n* Buy what you actually need.\n* Replace what you’ve run out of. \n* re-up on the staples that already work *for you*.\n\nJust don’t let this week pull you into a version of consumption that will do nothing more than turn into regret later.\n\nPut your skin and lifestyle context above any hype product that doesn’t fit it. And be turbo protective of your peace, attention, and hard earned money.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nK. Hoe\n\n",

In fact, they decided to divorce on an early birthday trip that she planned for herself and her husband (soon to be ex, thank god), she ended the trip early and flew home alone :(\n\nShe deserves and deserved a hell of a lot better of a husband, father, and partner than that piece of garbage, and she has been in a bad place for years due to their marital strife. I’d like to send her a really nice and thoughtful gift for her birthday, as she loves all things beauty (hair, skin, makeup, everything!). I live abroad so I can’t peep in her bathroom to see what brands she likes, and it would be suspicious to start asking if she’s been liking anything new lately! She is blonde and has fair skin, if that makes a difference for suggestions! Alternatively, if you have gone through a divorce, what has been a thoughtful gift you received from a friend? I know this is going to be a hard day for her, and I want to support her and show her how loved and special she is! Grateful for any and all suggestions. Budget is $150 if that helps! ",

      "content": "These bumps appeared on my cheek about three weeks ago the day after I dermaplaned some fuzz for easier makeup application (I will not be doing this again. The dermaplane was new and I sanitized with an alcohol wipe before use). I’ve dermaplaned once before and this happened but went away after about a week. This has been coming and going but this is the most prominent, largest amount I’ve seen so far. I really don’t know what to do I’m generally very fortunate and don’t break out often. \n\nMy routine is pretty minimal. I had a more extensive routine last year but stopped as it was breaking me out. Reducing the products I used helped a lot. And generally things have been smooth sailing until recently. \n\nAm:\n-Rinse face with water \n-Cerave pm moisturizer \n\nPm:\n- Cleanse with B:lab matcha foaming cleanser \n-Alternate between olehenriksen 10% AHA lemonade clothing scrub and Dr. g peeling gel with two rest days a week  \n-Torriden dive in toner \n-Cerave pm moisturizer\n\nIf the occasional breakout happens I have had success with either a tea tree or hydrating face mask kept on until it dries out. Doesn’t seem to be helping now. \n\nI really don’t know what’s going on here. Also, in the picture one bump looks a bit scabbed over that’s because I accidentally popped it I think. That was the only one to come to a “head”\n\nAny advice or suggestions are much appreciated!!",

      "content": "hello, I am in mid 20s, and I have been diagnosed with LPP.  I have suffered from severe clinical depression and was put on heavy doses on anti depressants. Due to this I have faced rapid weight gain and hyperpigmemtation.  The pigmentation started showing and worsening after I finished the course of anti depressants.  Now it has worsened and this has given me extremely low confidence,  to the point I hate my face,  and have stopped looking in the mirror. I have tried medication and ointment prescribed to be by my AIIMS dermat but its too slow to work on. I can live like this. I am planning to go for laser treatment for pigmentation reduction and seek advice on the same. I want to know its efficacy, how many sessions will it take to see visible results, etc as I am completely new to this. \n\nI am planning to get the procedure done in Surat, gujarat,  hence if anyone can suggest me a good dermat with reasonable prices it would be really helpful.

Would be interested in people’s honest opinions!\n\nI’m 33 year old male and my skin type is:\n\nDry, sensitive, kind of rosacea-prone (mainly flushed cheeks from heat/shower). I rarely get pimples. Forehead lines developing. Prone to irritation from acids and essential oils. Can tolerate retinal well (I’ve been using for years).\n\nMy goals:\n\nStrengthen my skin barrier, reduce redness/flushing, get a brighter complexion, and tackle forehead lines. Keep everything simple enough that I’ll actually stick to it.\n\nI am using all of these products besides the Maelove Vitamin C and the Ordinary Retinal which should arrive soon. Is it insane to use a stronger retinoid on forehead? Is TO retinal any good? What do people think of Maelove Glow Maker?\n\nWhat do people think of this routine overall? I’m always open to tweaks.",
