(No conditioner used), use brush for curly hair to detangle the most you can.\n\n2.\t⁠After shower when the hair is still wet, divide the hair in 2 parts, left and right area, and each of those in 3 subparts: front, middle, back. So 6 parts in total.\n\nUse hair clips for this.\n\n3. Start with one of the 6 parts, and grab a smaller amount of hair from it, that is easier to manage and apply Skala curl cream and Etniker curl gel in all that piece of hair, the curl patterns starts to appear automatically\n\n4. Now define every curl from that amount of hair definitively by rolling them on your finger and releasing carefully. One by one. (do not put much tension, not so tight).\n\n5. After finishing with that amount of hair, grab other manageable amount of hair from the 1st part, and repeat.\n\n6. Do the same for the next 5 parts.\n\n7. At the end, dry the hair with diffuser around 15 minutes. Diffuser is so important!\n\n8. When going to sleep or laying in bed for any reason, use a Satin anti frizz Hat (important also)",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I know it can take time for the true pattern to show, but I’m very new to all of this and feeling a bit lost.\n\n**Current routine:**\n• **Wash frequency:** Every other night\n• **Shampoo &amp; conditioner:** R+Co Gemstone\n• **Styling product:** Briogeo Curl Charisma (applied on wash nights)\n• **Styling method:** Scrunching on soaking-wet hair\n• **Drying:** Diffuse to about 80%, then air dry the rest\n• **Brushing:** None (used to brush straight daily, now stopped)\n• **Heat:** No blow-drying with a brush anymore\n• **Sleep:** 100% silk pillowcase\n\nThat’s basically my entire routine right now, and this is what I’m getting so far. It’s honestly wild realizing how much I was damaging my hair for years with heat and brushing.\n\n**Questions:**\nWhere do I go from here? How do I figure out what my hair actually needs as my pattern starts to show? Should I be adding or removing anything from this routine while my hair adjusts? I know it can take weeks or months for things to settle, but I’d love guidance on how to support that process properly.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

      "content": "i've struggled with acne my whole life and the past year or two it got pretty bad on my chin and cheeks. i've seen dermatologists, tried oral medications, prescription topicals, gentle products, harsh products, no products, LRP, cerave, and the acne would always come back.\nthe only thing i haven't tried is isotretinoin but i have kaiser so they are extremely reluctant, and i don't have the money to do an online doctor.\n\nthis might be a controversial routine, but i have finally found something that works and legitimately prevents me from having breakouts.\n\n1. wash with allafia everyday coconut facial cleanser (oil based so it doubles as a makeup remover\n\n2. moisturize with pea size amount of trytallow tallow balm (beef tallow)\n\n3. sometimes i use a reusable cotton round (the round project) to exfoliate with my face wash\n\nthis is it. everyday. i don't use anything else, im kind of traumatized from my face burning and severely breaking out from even baby cleansers. the tallow goes a very long way and it feels like it mimics my faces natural oils, i usually wake up the next day feeling dewy and magical.\n\nbut now that ive stopped the acne, my face is still red (ive kind of always had this issue). my current products didn't fix it. my texture is starting to feel off too (maybe that's a sunscreen thing and i should commit to sunscreen but again that's why i'm here for advice), but it could be because i'm constantly comparing my skin to how it was in high school and now i am in my mid 20's, seeing micro signs of aging.\n\nalso: i still have access to my tretinoin prescription if that would be something to look back into. i've only used it for acne but i don't know how it would do against this redness.\n\ni also have really bad pigmentation scars from my acne. any recommendations for that would also be appreciated.\n\nthank you\n\n****first 2 pictures are from today, january 21st 2026.",

I know I have slightly wavy hair but I feel like the products I'm using aren't doing me any good. It's so ugly when I use products but it just feels messy if I don't. Last 3 pics are with no product. Some days it looks really good without anything in it and then others it’s flat and barely any waves? Do I even have wavy hair? Or should I just stop trying to do a wavy routine lol.\n\nI've been using Nexxus volumizing shampoo, and herbal essences argan oil conditioner, the way to grow not your mother's leave in, Marc Anthony mousse, and the shea moisture curl smoothie every once in a while. I've just been trying out products. I haven't found any that I really like. I brush through my hair and then put in the leave in conditioner. Then I do the curl smoothie and scrunch. I usually do this in sections. And then at the end I make sure it's still wet and I put in the mousse and scrunch again. Then dry off the excess with a t shirt. Then diffuse.\n\nThank you in advance for your replies I really appreciate it. ",

It's not lighting, my face literally looks being pulled down by gravity or some mysterious forces from all angles. And I feel like it's still getting worse. Also my skin condition is way worse than before too. I'm genuinely so concerned because everything happened way too fast(in 2-3months).

      "content": "I’ve got oily/dry skin, and I’ve yet to find a moisturizer that I love after my 28 years on earth.\n\nI think I’m prone to redness and acne after using specific moisturizers, but I haven’t determined which ingredients exactly are the ones that cause issue. Also, I literally only use moisturizer as my skincare besides the occasional as needed acne treatment. I have always used vanicream as a cleanser. I don’t wear makeup that often either, so I’ve kind determined fairly easily that the issue is a moisturizer issue.\n\nThese are the products I’ve tried so far:\n\nCerave daily moisturizing lotion: this was the very first moisturizer that I started using back when I was middle school aged. I used this throughout middle and high school, and it was “fine” for a while. I got frustrated with it though because I felt like my skin always had small bumps everywhere and I would randomly get red splotches on my face, I was worried it was causing it.\n\nNature republic aloe Vera soothing gel: I used this throughout my freshman and sophomore year in college. It’s like 92% just aloe Vera. It didn’t really cause any issues for me if I remember, but I didn’t like that it came in this huge tub that felt unsanitary to use after a while. Also, I think it left a sticky film on my face and I didn’t necessarily feel like it was the most moisturizing.\n\nLa Roche Posay Cicaplast Balm B5: I think I hurt my skin barrier at one point in college after sunburn or something and this was recommended to me. This was a great calming moisturizer that helped repair my skin barrier. Not a great every day moisturizer for me though. It’s way too heavy and it felt like to sat on top of my skin. I still use it occasionally if I have like extra dry skin that needs a lot of help.\n\nAveeno calm and restore oat gel moisturizer: This was the next moisturizer I tried and I used it for years. I think the formulation for this must’ve changed as I was using it (used from about 2018-2024). It was great at first. I loved how it melted into my skin and I felt like it actually moisturized. I did notice after around maybe 2021-2022 that I started to notice splotchiness, redness, and acne that I never got with it before. Decided it was time to move on.\n\nPonds dry skin cream: I used this once. WAY too heavy. Also, it broke me out a ton.\n\nEmbryolisse lait cream concentrate: Tried a sample size of this, and I thought I liked it. Shelled out for the full size and hated it. Definitely clogged pores and caused acne. Although I did like the way it felt.\n\nPurito oat in calming gel cream: what I’ve been  using for the past year. I like how light weight it feels. Biggest con is that it feels like it dries \\\\\\*onto\\\\\\* not \\\\\\*into\\\\\\* my skin. It makes me feel like I’m wearing one of those peel face masks or something. Also, I’m not entirely sure if it’s doing a good job actually moisturizing my skin. It kind of feels like it’s just sitting there. It feels nice when it’s wet on my skin, but I just hate the film it leaves.",
