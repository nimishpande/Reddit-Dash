      "title": "Before &amp; After Cutting Length and Dyeing My Hair",
      "content": "Hi! I’m sharing my current curly hair routine and would love any feedback.\n\nHair &amp; Background:\n\nI have medium-density curly hair. I recently cut my hair from mid-back length to a medium length (just above the trapezius/collarbone area) and also had it professionally dyed. I don’t chemically straighten my hair.\n\nWash Schedule:\n\nI wash my hair every 2–3 days. Between washes, I thoroughly rinse my hair with water only.\n\nCleanse:\n\nOn wash days, I start by rinsing my hair thoroughly with water. I then use VIONA 2% ketoconazole shampoo, applying it mainly to my scalp, letting it sit briefly, and rinsing thoroughly. About once a month, I use AG Care Balance &amp; Boost Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo instead.\n\nCondition &amp; Treatments:\n\nAfter shampooing, I condition with SheaMoisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Shine Conditioner, applying it to mid-lengths and ends and rinsing it out fully. Every 1–2 weeks, I use AG Care Nourish Snow Mushroom Moisture Mask in place of regular conditioner, leaving it on for a few minutes before rinsing. About once a month, I also use AG Care Balance &amp; Boost Apple Cider Vinegar Conditioner.\n\nLeave-In &amp; Styling:\n\nImmediately after turning off the shower, while my hair is still very damp, I apply my leave-in and styling products. First, I use AG Care Fast Food Leave-On Conditioner (about a half baby-carrot sized amount), scrunching it into my hair and up toward the roots. Then I apply AG Care Re:coil Curl Activator, using about 1–2 pea-sized amounts, and scrunch again.\n\nDrying:\n\nI diffuse my hair, spending time diffusing all the way down to the scalp to maximize curl definition and spring.\n\nSleep Routine:\n\nI sleep on a silk pillowcase. I used to sleep with a silk bonnet, but found it compressed my curls too much overnight. Since my hair is shorter now, the pillowcase alone has been working better for preserving curl shape.\n\nNotes:\n\nSince cutting my hair shorter, my curls feel noticeably bouncier, springier, and more alive. My hair is much easier to manage and control at this length, and my curl pattern really shows up better overall. I’m really happy with how light and healthy it feels now.\n\nOpen to any routine feedback or styling suggestions. Thanks!",

It’s ridiculous. I’m so pissed I’m seven months into pouring a mystery fluid on my scalp. And it’s strange because I initially had a shedding without really changing my oral medication.\n\n\\*edit\\* the bleach test apparently isn’t consistent because some people will just dilute the formula so that it will pass. As well as they put that other ingredient in instead of minoxidil. Wow. so much effort to counterfeit $2 bottles. \n\nSo I’ve noticed lately that my hair stopped improving after I got the initial shed. I just opened up my new package from the same seller and it’s the same outdated packaging. The outside is I believe the new packaging, but the bundles are the old packaging that Kirkland doesn’t use as of over a year ago in discontinued all sale of.\n\nFirst, the lid wouldn’t screw on and I’m like what what’s going on OK this is super fishy like Kirkland doesn’t know how to make a bottle that can screw on? When you look at the text on the bottles it’s very different. The colorations are different hues by a small percentage like the yellow text has like a haze around it and a dark quality color on one and the other one it’s like Jimmy counterfeit printed it off their computer printer.\n\nThe bottles are also different sizes. One has two threads and the other has three threads, which is why they won’t screw together. The new bottles are also different size.\n\nFinally, we have the bleach test absolutely nothing it just made it clearer  EBAY purchased with lots of positive reviews. You have to remember that people don’t know anything and they will leave positive reviews, especially in the hair medication world without even confirming if it works or not. Like you know on Amazon, for example where they say, I haven’t even used it yet or it’s been a week, but it’s great and they leave five star reviews. Or like dating apps for example how they don’t work at all but for some reason, people pay for them and leave overwhelmingly positive reviews for something that doesn’t work for what it was made for. Lol. Reviews aren’t the end all.\n\nSee pics included.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I used a cheapy one from 5 below since it works for what I do during the day but I'll be going on a cruise this February and I need help! \n\nI need a good setting spray that will keep my makeup on my face, I wear waterproof mascara and liner of course, but I love to do a smoky eye, and my eyeshadow isn't waterproof proof. Something that will hold up to sweat, walking around in the Mexico sun, potentially getting in the pool (not fully submerging of course lol, but maybe getting a drop or two on my face), and will generally hold up during a day full of a lot of activities! I plan to get the E.L.F. grip primer (the blue one) if that changes anything! My skin type leans a bit more dry Id say! I plan to be wearing foundation, potentially concealer, blush, highlighter, etc! \n\nThere's so many options, it's hard to determine the pros and cons about each and it's all a little daunting as make-up shopping can be! Any advice would be super helpful and appreciated! ",

I last had it done 6mo ago so the base of my roots is my natural color and the blonde has definitely yellowed a bit. \n\nAnyway, I’m torn between coloring to match my roots or just continuing the blonde. I’ve been many colors over the years, but always go back to blonde. \n\nI’d love to try a color closer to my roots, but my hair pulls pretty red and I prefer non red toned browns. As for the blonde, I prefer more neutral to cool as warm leans too yellow for me and I feel like I can always see the subtle green when I go more ashy. I’m pretty familiar with what I like when it comes to blonde, but am lost if I go in the direction of my natural color. \n\nIt’s also about shoulder length, but my ends are quite frazzled after 6mo of no trims so I’ll go back to my long bob. \n\nI usually go every 9-12wks depending on the color. Idk what happened to me the past 6mo!\n\nAny inspo pics or suggestions welcome! \n\nPics: 1st &amp; 2nd in shaded daylight, 3rd direct sun, 4th nighttime indoors with overhead light\n",

Started embracing my natural wavy/ curly hair last year but I’ve struggled with getting a grasp on the dryness and frizziness. 1st picture is day one dry hair. and 2nd is pretty damp after washing. I’ve been washing it every 3-4 days. \n\nCurrent Routine:\n\nDouble shampoo (Goldwell Hydrating shampoo)\n\nDetangle\n\nConditioner (Goldwell Hydrating Conditioner)\n\nBrush through with conditioner in\n\nRinse conditioner out\n\nApply Goldwell Defining Cream to soaking wet hair\n\nApply Leave In Conditioner to soaking wet hair\n\nBrush leave in through\n\nApply and scrunch in  Goldwell Bundling Gel\n\nDry with microfiber towel\n\nDiffuse upside down\n\nI’ve tried other products as well but this is what I’ve been using for about a month since I got my hair cut, these are what the stylist recommended, routine hasn’t changed though and even when I have used other products the results have been pretty much the same. I notice my hair tangles VERY easily and when I’m detangling it looks like I’m losing half my hair. Even when I’m in the shower I have wet frizz. I’ve read it could be a too much protein issue (this shampoo and conditioner have protein), under hydrating issue, or over hydrating issue. I also have a a clarifying shampoo that I use about every 3 washes or so because the water I have is very hard. Currently doing the pineapple method and bonnet for sleeping, and in the morning I damp and scrunch in a little gel (mostly because the front pieces lose any texture they had 😂) \n\nWould appreciate any advice or help, thank you!!",

I have tried curly girl method to see if I can get some wave going but it just looks messy because it’s not wavy enough and too frizzy. I have tried straightening it but it just poofs and frizzes as soon as I go outside. Nothing seems to work for my hair and I don’t want to do a true keratin/Brazilian treatment due to formaldehyde. Is there anything similar to a Cezzane treatment that actually works? I tried it a few times and after the first week, the effect was minimal. ",
