      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Pretty normal, right? I have said that I do not need them, because I already have a figured out routine suitable for my hair type. “But you are not curly! You do not need to spend 2 hrs on styling!” On WASH DAYS. And simply because my hair is dense. And low porosity. My brother has a hair type that naturally curls on its own. But my hair (fine, dense, low-po, 2b-2c) needs more support to achieve its full potential and true pattern and tightness.

      "content": "My skin was totally clear until sixth grade. And ever since then I have had extremely deep and painful cystic acne all over my face. I went to a dermatologist whilst my face was full of deep red acne and the dermat said that in my age (14) it is normal and hormonal. She prescribed me ahaglow facewash and zitmoist as mousturizer. That was all. \n\nMy experience with both was very bad. Bad in the sense that neither of it did absolutely nothing for my acne. The facewash felt too drying for me and the zitmoist gel felt like nothing. It was not at all hydrating or moisturizing. \n\nI switched to a more hydrating moisturizer (Johnson's milk+rice cream) and a different gentler cleanser (Neutrogena extra gentle cleanser). I would say in terms of hydration these were better but my acne was still super bad. \n\nThen I began researching into skincare and nutrition. I cut down on dairy especially milk and sugar. And I decided that I had to use an active to target my acne. I ended up buying the Cosrx BHA serum. I used it for nearly 1.5 years and it did help with my acne to some extent. But it works extremely slow. Took me about 6 months to notice a reduction in my acne. I started using plum gel moisturizer also and Joy 5.5 hydrating gel face wash. \n\nAfter that I used tranexamic acid and alpha arbutin serum from minimalist for all the scars that had formed on my face. I absolutely love alpha arbutin for scars and hyperpigmentation. And for the active acne I started using The Ordinary glycolic acid. I had high hopes for it but it did not do anything for my acne. 😭 It had absolutely zero effect anywhere either on my face or body😢\n\nAnyways this is my current routine now which for me has been working absolutely fabulously. I only get a few acne during my periods, they are like surface level white heads and they just dry out in a day and pop on their own and don't leave scars. So I'm not really bothered by them. I'm very happy with how my skin looks and I'm going to stick to this routine.\n\nMy skin is by no means perfect. I have quite a few icepick scars from the acne plus there is hyperpigmentation as well. But imo those are part of my natural skin and this is just how I look and I'm totally okay with it. Acne is tough to live with, I know. You just have to be patient and find the products that works for you. It took me more than a decade to get here and who knows it might come back later too. But believe you me acne is not going to stop my life, nor has it ever😇\n\nCURRENT ROUTINE\n\nAM \n\n1. Simple barrier care replenishing cream cleanser\n2. Aziderm 10% gel \n3. Cosrx snail mucin. \n4. Cerave moisturizing cream \n5. UV Doux silicone sunscreen gel spf 50\n6. Foxtale lip balm\n\nPM \n\n1. Simple barrier care replenishing cream cleanser\n2. Benzac AC 5%\n3. Cosrx snail mucin\n4. Cerave moisturizing cream \n5. Boroline on lips\n\n",

      "content": "I am someone who grew up, thinking I head straight hair, though always had curls around my neck line. As I got older, I noticed when it was wet. It had some wave/curl to it, but this was during the era that straightening was very popular, so even if I didn’t blow dry I consistently used a flat iron. I got to a point where if I would let it air dry it definitely was not straight hair, but the last several years I have bleached it many times and then dyed it back to dark several times. My hair is very fine and I recently lost a lot presumably due to being postpartum and also on Ozempic with huge weight loss. I am wondering what the best way is to restore the natural texture? Would it be best to never brush it straight while wet and consistently do things that would encourage my curls? \n\nI am new to this sub and know more about managing curlier hair as my daughter’s have much tighter curls than I do. Unsure if I need to share my routine, but I generally wash it about 3 to 4 days a week, due to it being fine and getting oily around the roots easily, but the rest of it is very dry. Lately I have been using method, volumizing shampoo and method smoothing conditioner. It seems that a lot of more expensive shampoos and/or conditioners leave a weird film on my hair and the current combo at least makes it feel clean. I don’t condition up to my roots. I generally don’t use any products, but recently have tried Marc Anthony nourishing, curl cream, miss Jesse’s jelly soft curls, and not your mother’s curl talk frizz control sculpting gel. I have let it just air dry after the products and scrunched it and wrapped it in a soft wrap or a T-shirt for about 30 minutes. Adding these products has made a difference, especially if I make sure it’s fully tangled while still soaking wet, but I can’t seem to notice any significant difference in what product I use or whether I wrap it for a bit while wet or not. Any product recommendations are welcome and also wondering if just being consistent about letting it be natural and not doing any further bleach/die or consistent heat would help? Sorry for the long post.\n\nTL:DR: seeking advice on restoring my curl pattern after years of damaging and straightening. Fine hair, doesn’t do well with super heavy products.",

There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

The problem is, I always knew how to care for my virgin hair, but not for dyed and bleached hair. Last year, I dyed part of my hair red, and I really loved how the color turned out. The problem? It completely ruined my hair's shape. It was like it was too dry, and the curls wouldn't hold the same. I let it grow out, and now I only have a little of that dye left, but I want to try it again. At the time, I used a dye and a color enhancer. My routine is simple: shampoo, a hair mask, and conditioner. Then I use very little (almost none) of the hair mask for styling and gel. After that, I use a moisturizing mask once a week or once every two weeks. I define my curls with scrunches and curl them strand by strand once a week.

It is weighed down easy with gels, it goes stringy with foams. I squish to condish and I get long s waves. If I diffuse it stays lovely and wavy for about 4 hours then it's frizzy and flat again. Most days it looks like the first or second picture. Sometimes it's super wavy and curly in places when I've done nothing at all. \n\nI am mixed race. My mum has very curly thick hair (British) and my dad has thick black straight pakistani hair. My hair is somehow both and I think this is why no routine works. \n\nI've tried doing the cast method but it just looked wet and stringy, leave in conditioners make it greasy. Diffusing works only for a bit. It honestly looks the best when I've been caught in the rain and I've let it dry naturally, it goes kinda curly then. Salt water has nice results but made it sooo tangly. At the moment I'm using head and shoulders shampoo because the dry scalp is crazy, I've tried not using that because I heard it wasn't cg friendly but the itching never improved. \nI use garnier hair foods conditioner and in between washes I use inecto hair serum, my hair doesn't get weighed down by that. \n\nI have no idea if my hair needs more protein, more hydration, more nothing. I'm just wondering if I'm beating a dead horse maybe? Any advice welcome before I give up completely. Thank you for reading. \n\nFirst photo is my hair two days after wash day. Second photo is my hair wash day and the day after. Third photo is when it has been squished. \n\n",

I think I'm not using enough product but then when I do, sometimes my hair feels heavy and still frizzy yet gelled- you know the look? Sorry the pic isn't super clear, it gets curlier than this but on a regular day of just wetting + product it's kinda wavy like this.\n\nSo my main curiosity to anyone reading is- I often feel afraid to put a sufficient amount of product on my hair every single day, so I often resort to just waking up and putting my dry hair in a bun and then of course when i take it out, the curls are all bent and patterns are messed up. (Wetting it and putting oil isn't enough.) I don't know if it's financial reasons, lack mindset reasons, or I'm scared to damage my hair but what would actually make me feel good about myself is having my hair down and moisturized every single day, and put it up with clips if needed so I don't bend and ruin it. **Do you all think it's okay to put a good amount of leave-in or curl cream every day?** (I guess idk what the alternative would be anyway, except just keeping it back some days.) Routine:  In this picture I wet it, put cantu curl cream, cantu argan leave-in, and then some eco gel (probably too heavy but the regular tresseme gel sometimes feels too thin and just frizzes my hair lol). I usually air-dry my hair. Should I just keep trying more quantity of product? Or a different product/routine you recommend? I wash once a week or every-other week. Thank you! ",

      "content": "Hello readers,\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI have been having great trouble with acne for years and the only product I have found that helps is the My.Ingredients Double Cleanser (Comes as a oil+gel cleanser combo). The problem I am having currently is finding it at my local shopper drug mart (a Canadian drug store), so I am wondering if I can get some recommendations to similar products? Below I will list some products that I have tried over the past 9 years that have not worked (I have tried much more then this but I always use the product for 2 months to see if my skin changes). This product was the first time I have found relief from my acne since I started getting it so I would be very grateful for the help :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mdqpt3hpb94g1.jpg?width=201&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9aeb8232023f00693f0d87a73f8af6b1e1a89341\n\n**Gel Cleansers I have tried**\n\n\\- La Roche-Posay Face Wash Gel Cleanser, Effaclar Gentle Purifying Foaming Gel\n\n\\- Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Cleansing Gel\n\n\\- Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash, Facial Cleanser with 2% Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment\n\n\\- YTTP Superfood Gentle Face Cleanser\n\n\\- CeraVe SALICYLIC ACID Cleanser, Renewing SA Smoothing BHA Exfoliant\n\n\\- Cetaphil Oily Skin Cleanser\n\n\\- PanOxyl 4% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Wash\n\n**Oil + Gel Cleanser Combo I tried**\n\n\\- Uriage - Xémose Cleansing Soothing Oil\n\n\\+\n\n\\- La Roche-Posay Face Wash Gel Cleanser, Effaclar Gentle Purifying Foaming Gel\n\nor\n\n\\- Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Cleansing Gel\n\n*\\*To be clear I put the cleansing oil on my dry face, then wipe it off with a fresh clean cloth, then wet my face with water and used the gel cleanser*\n\nAlso, I think it is relevant to say my skincare routine at the time of acne clearing so see that below.\n\n**Best Routine Thus Far**\n\nCleanser -&gt; My.Ingredients Double Cleanser\n\nToner -&gt; My.Ingredient Glycolic Acid Toner\n\nMoisturizer -&gt;Skin Proud Skin Barrier Moisturizer\n\n**More Information**\n\nI have been struggling with acne since I was 14-15 (I was a late bloomer when it came to puberty) and it has been a problem till now and I am 23. I get what I think is inflammatory acne (pustules mainly) + white heads. I have been to the doctors before but the cream that was given was a retinol and it caused my skin to sting so I didn't use it for very long.\n\nAlso I don't know if this helps but I wouldn't call my acne severe. I get quite a few acne spots on my forehead, between my eyebrows, jawline, and temples. I would say it is mild to moderate depending on the flare up.\n\nIf there is anymore information that you might want to help me out let me know :) This was everything I could think of.",
