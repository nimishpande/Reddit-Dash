      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I can’t STAND the back of my hair. It’s stringy and flat and weird, and only curls at the bottom. I have strands that frizz and don’t define no matter what I seem to do. At the same time, my hair can look flat and weighed down, and only curls at the bottom in most places. I’m not sure what I can do. I don’t know if I should be adding more moisture or if I’m adding too much. How can I get my hair to look less weighed down at the top and in the back? Any help would be appreciated.  \nI usually use Herbal Essences honey shampoo and conditioner, but lately I’ve been using garnier fructis conditioner. I wash my hair maybe 2-3 times a week, or more if it gets sweaty. I try to leave in conditioner for as long as I can before washing it out and I always leave in a tiny bit. I only brush my hair wet, and I apply products while it’s pretty damp. Daily, I use OUAI leave in, or Sleep on it overnight curl cream. Neither really do anything, I still have a ton of frizz and weighed down looking hair. I shower before bed, and let my hair air dry 70% before I clip it up. I swear I could put in the whole bottle of product and my hair would still look dry. The second pic is a failed attempt at defusing. In the 3rd picture I included, I had used gel as well to style my hair, and I like the way it looks. It was completely air dried. It was also summer, and my hair always seems to be prettier in the summer. The fourth pic is just air dried hair after my normal routine. Any advice would be really appreciated. I’m not sure what my hair needs. Plz give tips!!",

Since starting hormone treatment (about a year ago) I've started getting acne as I'm going through male puberty and I have absolutely no idea how to combat this. All the basic products I see people recommend like Cerave cleansers are at \\*least\\* £10 and people act like this is cheap, plus the amount of people that have like 5+ products in their skincare routine.... ofc I'm willing to spend that money but I want to know it'll actually work if I'm gonna spend a week's worth of food on making my skin clear up :/\n\nRight now I just wash my face with the Simple cleansing facial wash but just ran out of it. I've started infrequently using St Ives apricot facial scrub too which I know is controversial but it seemed like the best option I could afford. I'm going to ask for some specific items for Christmas, so what should I get and how do I build a cheap, \\*easy\\* routine that should actually work to reduce hormonal/puberty acne? My skin is probably on the mildly oily side if that changes things.\n\nThanks so much in advance for reading and for any help!!!",

Today for some reason I put a fish oil and dutasteride capsule in my mouth and on my way to get some water to swallow them I forgot what I was even trying to do and just bit down on both capsules.\n\nAnd let me tell you: The dutasteride suspension tastes like the concentrated sweat from the wool of an old sheep, a shocking mutton like taste and at the same time it slightly tasted like battery acid. It's stunning to discover tastes you didn't know before after more than 3 decades on this shitty planet. This is like Harry Potters stupid mystery beans.\n\nWhat the fuck are the putting in our pills? Was that the taste of the dut? The (rotten?) suspension? I am enjoying the regrowth though.",

It took a minimum of 45 minutes to do every morning and it still didn't look awesome. It looked okay. Some days just under ok. I always put on a hood because I was just so done. \n\n\nI mentioned wanted to get my hair relaxed and do a pixie cut, and then came the pressuring to relax my hair. I started to actually feel bad so I relaxed my hair. I was happy with it for about 2 weeks. Now I'm just frustrated and angry.  My hair is kinky but relaxed. Meaning the ends are straight but the rest is whooping my ass. I miss my 4c hair. Every time I see 4c posts online or someone with 4c irl I feel sad. I'm back to covering my hair and wearing hoods. I look like a hair and lint covered lollipop. \n\n\nI'm prone to making impulsive decisions when I get stressed out/ sad so I really want to think. What should I do? I like having short hair, but I do have this subconscious belief that it's not as cute or feminine, or some bullshit like that to have short hair. I don't want to impulsively do anything. I'm so sad :(\n\n\nShould I: \n\nA. Cut off all my hair, go bald, and start from the top \n\n\nB. Try to fix the damage and somehow revert my hair. \n\n\nC.

My skin has improved a lot this year, but I’m still almost always breaking out. My issue is that for the longest time I’ve only ever focused on finding acne-reducing skincare products, and because most of them have things that cannot be used with tret, I don’t know where to start when it comes to finding new products to use when I start the tret.\n\nMy current products: Caudalie cleansing oil, Caudalie vinopure cleanser (has salicylic acid), Caudalie vinopure serum (has salicylic acid), niacinamide serum, Hyaluronic acid serum, and Kiehl’s expertly clear moisturizer (has salicylic acid). \n\nThese products have helped my skin A LOT, and a lot of products break my skin out, so I’m really nervous to try all new products along with the tret. I have combo skin (my t-zone is pretty oily but the rest of my face is dryer) and have never been able to use any thick moisturizers.\n\nAnyone have any advice for products I should look into? I really want to prevent peeling/flaking, I can handle a purge if I need to. Any tips or recommendations (even a whole routine recommendation) would be so so appreciated!! \n\nPS: budget is not an issue, if there is one thing that I am okay to splurge on its skincare!\n\nSigned, a nervous nelly who’s scared to mess up her skin \n ",

I started t sal shampoo every other wash &amp; tea tree spray but still nothing seems to fix it :(\n\nI switched my routine this week and would love some expert insight IDing what may be causing this flare up (particularly on my cheek, as I have closed comedones there but never get acne on cheeks otherwise).\n\nPrevious routine: CeraVe SA cleanser (way too harsh), the ordinary glycolic acid sometimes, good molecules brightening serum, cerave night cream / black seed oil if chin breakouts, hero rescue balm\n\nNew: medicube zero foam cleanser, azelaic acid, beauty of joseon dynasty cream… plus my godsend, hero rescue balm\n\nFYI- no changes to diet etc… i’ve genuinely tried everything under the sun (spironolactone, tret, etc… but i feel like nothing works… MEEP) &amp; hence the confusion… any advice is warmly appreciated :)",

I've been taking biotin supplements to try to get some regrowth. My hair is pretty fine. It used to get tangled and matted really easily but that's not been a problem in a year or two. \n\nRoutine: wash with Maui Moisture light weight shampoo. Conditioner is aussie 3 minute miracle curls. I use different styling products but in these pics I used some curl cream and some deva curl strong hold gel (watered down into a spray). Air dry. I also have Aussie mousse that I sometimes use. I have a silk pillow case and don't usually refresh the hair much. I am also interested in protective hairstyles I could do on day 2/3. I know putting my hair in a bun/pony tail is probably not good for it.\n\nI've had so many different routines in the past and they always seem to stop working eventually. I haven't really found anything that works super well. My hair gets a bit greasy after day 2 too. \n\nI'd love any suggestions you might have. Thanks!",
