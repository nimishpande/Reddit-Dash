      "content": "I feel like my whole life, curly hair isn't something that society deems professional or beautiful.\n\nGrowing up, my mum and other older adults in my life were constantly telling me to straighten my hair. Or like\"do you even brush your hair???\" Giving me endless products that stop frizz. Telling me how much nicer I looked when I straightened my hair. This still happens today.\n\nIt feels like looking after my curly hair takes so much effort just to make it even look presentable. A straight-haired goddess just walks out of bed with effortless-looking, shiny, smooth long locks. \n\nIt will take me half an hour to wash using my routine.  Pre-shampoo (Garnier Fructis Curls Method Shampoo), double shampoo. Conditioner (Natural Look curls boost). Leave-in Conditioner (Garnier Fructis, 3-in-1 Hair Mask). Mouse (SHEA MOISTURE Coconut and Hibiscus), then gel, scrunching and praying hands, and then diffusing (plus a few hours to dry since my hair is so thick). By the time it's all done, it's the evening, and it looks nice for a few hours. I use a stain pillow, but the next day it's all crumpled and sad looking, so it's like all the effort for nothing.\n\nI feel so self-conscious going out with my natural curls. I feel like people look at me as if I do not look after myself when my hair is naturally curly. For events, there is always pressure to straighten or heat-curl my hair.\n\nI do get comments from people who really like my natural curls, but I feel like the majority of people aren't impressed.\n\nJust wondering if it gets easier, and if you've found you sort of grown into your curls more. Thank you.",

      "content": "Hey everyone 👋\n\n26M here. I recently saw my dermatologist and they suggested trying Skinoren 20% (Azelaic Acid) for my mild acne and post-inflammatory erythema (PIE).\n\nA bit of background:\n\n\t•\tI’ve never had acne before until recently — everything started after a really stressful time and almost no sleep for a few days.\n\n\t•\tSince then, I’ve been dealing with small whiteheads and pustules, mostly on my cheeks and around my nose.\n\n\t•\tMy skin is also quite sensitive because I probably damaged my barrier when I tried too many actives at once (vitamin C, BHA, niacinamide, etc.).\n\n\t•\tI stopped all that and switched to a very gentle routine: CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser, CeraVe Moisturizer, and sometimes a hydrating toner.\n\nMy dermatologist said Azelaic Acid might help calm inflammation, even out my skin tone, and reduce new breakouts — but to start with once a day right away.\n\n👉 Has anyone here used Skinoren 20% for mild acne and PIE, especially on sensitive skin?\n\n\t•\tHow long did it take before you results?\n\n\t•\tDid you go through a purge or initial irritation?\n\n\t•\tAny tips on how to layer it with moisturizer (before or after)?\n\nI’m a bit nervous to start because my skin finally feels calmer, but I still get small recurring pustules at the same spots.\n\nWould love to hear your experiences or advice 🙏\n",

I’m a 17-year-old guy and I have thin, light brown / blondish hair that’s not fully straight but not really wavy either — something in between.\n\nHere’s my issue: in summer, my hair looks *so much better* — soft, voluminous, and healthy. But every winter, it becomes extremely dry and my scalp gets flaky and tight, especially after showers. It gets even worse whenever I try to **scrub** my scalp; it starts flaking more and just looks awful afterward.\n\nI went to a doctor last year and he said I have mild eczema / dry scalp. He prescribed **Ketoral** shampoo, which I use up to 3 times a week. It helps with the scalp part but my hair still feels super dry and flat compared to summer.\n\nI also tried **sea salt spray** for volume — it worked volume-wise, but made my dryness way worse. What I’m looking for now is something that can help me get:\n\n* Moisturized, non-dry hair\n* Natural volume and maybe some light waves\n* A healthy, “summer” look again\n\nThere’s so much mixed info online about oils, conditioners, masks, and leave-ins, and I don’t want to make it worse.\n\nWhat products or routines would you recommend for someone like me? (thin, semi-wavy, light hair + mild eczema scalp + winter dryness that gets worse when scrubbing)\n\nThanks a lot if you read this far 🙏 any tips are really appreciated!(first 2 pics are winter hair, last 3 summer)",

I know he uses filters and good lighting but still, he looks completely different! It definitely cannot be just lighting or filters. Looks like he went through some kind of treatments like chemical peels, lasers or hydroquinone to remove tanning/hyperpigmentation.\n\nIn the comments, he keeps saying it’s all because of a clean diet and gym routine but come on! that can make your skin glow, sure, but not change your skin tone this much. I’m still shocked by this transformation. What do you think?",

So here is my current routine, the same routine she gave me to get these curls. 1)Wash: I use shea moisture shampoo and conditioner with warm but not hot water. 2) Style: I go section by section with a leave in, (curls smiths), a gel (innersence) and the wet brush. I can’t describe the motion I do with the brush but it s like brushing and twisting it at the same time. 3) Dry: She used a salon grade dryer but recommended I use a diffuser but not touch my hair with it just hover around it until it’s completely dry. 4)Serum: I break the gel cast with innersence serum. She was very specific about using a serum not an oil. I do all of this but my curls never come out like hers. Am I missing a step? Mine come out very frizzy no solid or strong curls. ",

I usually don’t believe in these “tan removal” products because they rarely work, but I thought, okay, it’s just around a thousand bucks, let me give it a shot.\n\nBut today I saw an ad that I had to share. I took screenshots because the group doesn’t allow video posts. In the ad, the girl applies the product on one side of her face and says there’s no filter, that the brightness is all real. But when she moves her head, the filter literally shifts on her forehead &amp; face..\n\nSo yeah, that made me rethink everything. Has anyone actually tried Nikoni Beauty? Did it do anything for you or is it just another Insta gimmick?",

After having kids my hair seems to have gone back to curly mode, but I don’t know how to truly bring out my hair’s natural curls. I did the whole “scrunching with gel” trend in the 2000s because that was the only way to get it curly then. I see the potential, but I have no idea what to do to elevate what my hair already wants to do lol\n\nThis is my hair now when it dries naturally. I showered last night and it air dried over a towel. I lift my hair up over the pillow/towel so it’s not under my head while I sleep. My hair is also layered. \n\nMy normal routine is:\nDove Shampoo with Dove conditioner. \nAn occasional hair mask for dry hair-just the ends (it’s been dyed a lot and the ends are the last of what’s left of my last dye job)\nEvery other evening I do overnight leave in conditioner (just the ends)\nIn the morning when I want it to curl a little more, I spray in leave in conditioner (just the ends) because when it gets wet it curls.\n\nHelp! ❤️\n\n",

I had a history when I was younger of getting hives, but it kinda just started going away from what I’m aware of. Now all of a sudden I started getting them again, but I have no idea why. Nothing in my diet has changed, I’m not overly stressed, and I haven’t been using any specific skincare solutions or products. It happens at random times of the day, on random parts of my body from my legs to lower back to wrists and arms.\n\nAny advice, help, or direction would be greatly appreciated because this is becoming a real annoyance in my day to day and ruining my comfortability when I try to go to sleep. I believe I also have seasonal allergies so maybe that has something to do with it? Or maybe the dryness in the air? It’s just weird because none of this occurred last year. Thank you",

I didn't visit any dermatologist for this; I knew what they would prescribe me and the expensive products. Being a teenager, not only do I not earn much (and that too is sometimes I do, sometimes I don't), but also I didn't want my parents to spend a luxury for my skincare. So I did my research, or whatever you'd like to call it, and started using my savings to purchase all these products one by one from a generic pharmacy. \n\n**Slide 1: Prior to May 17, 2025**  \nAM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra\n\n**Slide 2: Prior to August 26, 2025, till Sept 2, 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: AcMist  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nActive: Adapalene 0.1%\n\n**Slide 3: From Sep 3 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC (Using this as a moisturiser base provides better sun protection.)  \nActive: Azelskin - Azelaic Acid 10%  \nSunscreen: FixDerma Shadow SPF 30 (cheap and gets the job done for me)\n\nIn-between AM/PM (occasionally only if I am at home):  \nCleanser: Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC  \nActive: HQ 4%\n\nElse not at home:  \nSunscreen reapplication\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Minimalist B5 10% Moisturiser  \nActive: Melapik (0.0125% tretinoin, 2% HQ, 1% allantoin) **// Not a steroid cream**\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\nYes, I am aware of the ochronosis risk using HQ. But cycling it, 2 months use (alternative) and then stopping for a few weeks and then starting again will keep the melanocytes sensitive. So I will not encounter any of it, as most side effects happen due to long-term abuse without any protection and carelessness, and I am not at all careless.\n\nAll of the supplements I take are within the safe limits; I will mention the dosage and the frequency in the comments.\n\nI am looking forward to starting microdose isotretinoin. \\~7 mg / day.  \nEven weeks: 20 mg Thrice  \nOdd weeks: 20 mg twice\n\nAvg weekly intake: 50 mg\n\nWill be monitoring my lipid and liver panels every 3-4 months and ensuring they are within the ideal range.\n\nAny review and insights would be helpful.\n\nThank You",
