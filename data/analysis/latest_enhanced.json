      "content": "Now on the presumably \"tail end\" of my logarithmic reaction to my hair routine. Here's my stack and some commonly asked questions from my updates a quarter ago.\n\nRoutine:\n\n- .3% Finasteride, 6% Minoxidil topical combination. Applied originally via four .25ml sprays. Moved to a dropper bottle at month 4. Applied nightly 6x per week right before bed, have only missed 2 nights total.\n- Dermastamp (microneedle) 1mm once weekly before bed. Temples and scalp. I skip the topical on this night. \n- Keta shampoo, normal concentration, 3 mins on scalp once or twice a week.\n\nOther Considerations people asked about (probably didn't have much of a hair-effect):\n\n- I religiously take a multivitamin, fish oil, magnesium glycinate, and 5g of creatine daily.\n- I lift 4x weekly and play team sports once or twice weekly.\n- I sleep 8.5 hrs per night consistently.\n- I drink socially most weekends. In the back half of my 20s.\n- I am not sponsored, so I will not provide the brand name of the topical. It is safe to assume that it is the largest US men's hair regrowth company.\n- Receded lightly through college then thinned consistently for a year before deciding to do something about it.\n\nI have had zero side effects. None whatsoever. I know that is individual to myself but no need to ask in the comments, I promise I don't miss issues with my body when they arise.\n\nHappy to answer any remaining Qs or take any advice for further temple regrowth!\n",

I think I started using it in October. I have a wide tooth comb for wet hair I just bought 2 weeks ago and I normally just wrap my hair up in a towel for a sec, then air dry.\n\nWhat are some good products that you can swear by that don’t damage or weigh down my hair?

Thank you for any suggestions. \n\nThe first photo is my hair after my last recent trim, I style my bangs with a straighter, forgot to mention that above. And the second one is before my trim.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Wondering how well my highlights would translate and if it would look good, and when it begins to fade if it'll look bad or not. I do really like my hair as-is but I think I want to try something new 😭 not sure if there's anything else to consider curl wise but if anyone here has dyed their curly hair before and has some advice or product recommendations, would be much appreciated!\n\nim getting a mean red warning for posting this without including my routine so ill put that here aswell ig.\n\nTRESemme Shampoo / Conditioner, Purple Shampoo once a month. 1st photo no product, 2 photo unsure since it was just whatever my hair dresser used when the photo was taken, but I get similar results with got2b curl spray",

Lately, past couple months, my hair has been real weird. You can see that it some of the other pictures, though I don’t have any pictures of the worst days. Doesn’t want to lay right, it’s flat, and part of it wants to go in like the complete opposite direction than it should. How should I fix this? I really know very little about the hair world. And no, I’m not looking for attention because of the stage pics, the only time I take pictures of myself really is when I’m getting a promo picture for a show. It’s just frustrating, especially when it doesn’t even want to go the way it’s supposed to, it kind of really puts a dampener on my day. I feel like it’s easy to make my hairstyle look really bad. I just need some help, I don’t know what to do. I use a Revlon Brush dryer pro if that helps. Thank you for any and all advice or tips given.",

      "content": "Hi! I’m looking for help with what products I could use for my skin? Lately my pores(or blackheads?) have become really horrible, used to be just on my nose but now it’s also chin, forehead and cheeks. My skin is oily on my T-zone but the rest is pretty dry and flaky, which is lately causing lots of issues if I am wearing makeup.\n\nI am currently using the medicube zero pore 1day serum, b-bomb (niacinamide &amp; B12) from Geek&amp;gorgeous, hyaluronic acid from the ordinary and Neutrogena hydroboost water gel. Occasionally I use retinol from cerave, vitamin C from Geek&amp;gorgeous and Copper peptides from The Ordinary. Three times a week I use red light mask.\n\nI’m not sure if any of the products can be worsening my pores since I feel like this is the worst they have ever been plus I get a lot of what I think is clogged pores or pimples but they are just skin colored and never get red or become whiteheads. Noticed I get some milia under my eyes or on my cheeks as well lately. I do not use the b-bomb every day as I feel like it does have a tendency to cause some dryness so I use it occasionally or just as spot treatment on any pimples. For cleansing I use Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and micellar water. My skin is pretty sensitive.\n\nI have considered trying Curology as one of my friends recommended it, but I don’t really trust that they make it actually custom plus feel like they would try to give me more and more expensive things just to make money. Anyone have experience with that?\n\nThank you for any advice!",

FYI i pick at my acne pretty compulsively, so most of the redness you’re seeing comes from that.\n\nany tips would be so greatly appreciated, ive had clear skin all my life and this has been so stressful trying to figure out. its taken a real hit to my confidence",

      "content": "I look a bit silly in the photos, but the difference is so clear in the before, and after. The first photo is from September, the last two are taken yesterday For context:\n\nI’ve had hormonal acne for about 15 years (I’m 27 now). Last year, I started getting super frustrated with it and extremely insecure because it has lasted so long. I did two rounds of Accutane, I’ve tried antibiotics, different diets and I have a great skin care routine and nothing worked.\n\nBasically everything would break me out and my acne would get super bad the week before my period and then need the next three weeks to recover when the cycle started again. I also had some other hormone related issues like frequent migraines, and severe cramps during my period as well as heavy bleeding. Unfortunately, when I tried the combined pill, my migraines got super severe so I didn’t consider birth control pills and option until now.\n\nI actually learned about this specific brand of pill from ChatGPT and I don’t like ChatGPT, but I’m so grateful that I used it for research. I asked my doctor and I was prescribed it and have been using it for the last three months., since early October.\n\nMy skin has already improved massively, I only have a few small pimples, and if it stays at the level it currently is, I’m happy with it, but I honestly think it’s gonna get even better. I’m used to waking up with like five new pimples every day so this has been so great. I did have some annoying bleeding for the first two months but that’s slowly going away now. When I’ve had a migraine, it has only been one at a time. Usually my migraines recur over the course of 1-2 weeks so this is also an improvement. oh, I take the pill without break so my hormones are completely stable and I don’t have a period anymore which is amazing!!!!\n\nWhat also helped my skin a liiiiiiittle bit is to take omega-3 supplements daily and 2 to 3 times a week I take a zinc supplement. Also, the cicaplast serum from La Roche Posay has been really helpful.\n\nI’m also getting a nose surgery this year, so hopefully all my insecurities quiet down a bit. Hope this is helpful to some of you xoxo.",

The cost for the surgery is $3k, quite cheap, but I wonder how much should I save for after care treatment? I’m thinking of scheduling  the surgery on my birthday so I can have enough time to save at least 7-10k. What medicine should I buy to help with body aches or swelling and does anyone knows an aftercare surgery hotels? I know of one called Beauty HDQs . Anyone that has surgeries please do help me or personally DM if you live in Florida thank you! ",

I was on birth control for about 4 years, got off of it and got horrible acne, assumed it was from vaping so I just went back on birth control to fix my skin (stupid I know) I recently got off of it and though I do not vape anymore I’ve been breaking out really bad. I’ve always had those little dots everywhere though. I’ve never really known much about skincare because when I was on birth control my skin was flawless with no work, but I wanna fix the root issue rather than just taking the pill again. \n\nRight now I use Vanicream gentle facial cleanser usually just at night or whenever I shower, and then I moisturize with laroche posay moisturizer. I am sure there is something I could add or a better product I could use but I am completely at a loss! Any recommendations would be appreciated. :)",

I was hoping it would start going down but it randomly got way more messy and curly. What can I do cause this looks horrible. Maybe I have to give up and go back to the buzz cut. \n\nMy current routine is that I condition in the shower every other day using Cantu cream conditioner, then apply not your mother curl leave in and a few drops of argan oil. I then try to style my hair down and a little curly with my fingers. Once or twice a week I'll use Being curl defining shampoo before the conditioner. Is there any hope for me.",
