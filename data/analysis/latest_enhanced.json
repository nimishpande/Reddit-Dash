      "content": "\nWhen I first became aware of all the ‚Äúdrugstore is bad‚Äù and ‚Äúsulfates and silicones ruin your hair‚Äù stuff, it was around 2016. I was 15, and honestly all the info being thrown around online back then confused me sooo much. From like 15‚Äì19, I was using natural or sulfate/silicone-free hair products because I thought that‚Äôs what I was supposed to do. My hair was always dry, frizzy, tangled, it was a mess. I figured ‚Äúwell, i guess this is just how my hair is.‚Äù Then around 2022, thanks to abbey yung and labmuffinbeautyscience I started actually learning more about hair science, ingredient functions, and how insanely misunderstood sulfates and silicones are. Now I‚Äôm 24, and after a ton of trial and error, I‚Äôve finally found what works best for my hair and it‚Äôs all drugstore stuff with silicones and sulfates. i use products from a few different brands (Garnier, Dove, Pantene,H&amp;S) and all the hair issues I struggled with for years are completely gone!! \n\nAll of this just makes me so mad because there was SO much fear mongering and misinformation floating around for years. Idk it makes me sad and mad thinking about younger me being so lost and confused when it came to my hair and what to use‚Ä¶ meanwhile all the products were right there the whole time but i avoided them like the plague üò≠!!! Tbh the fact that most of it is exaggerated, taken out of context, or totally depends on your hair type and routine‚Ä¶ is crazy to me. Anyone else have this same experience?! ",

Blood tests show no significant testosterone difference between hairy and bald men.\n* **Prolactin and Cortisol Drive Hair Loss**: He points to elevated prolactin (the ‚Äúmolting hormone‚Äù in animals) and cortisol (stress hormone) as key players in hair shedding, affecting both men and women.\n* **Testosterone Helps Hair Growth**: Contrary to popular belief, Peat says testosterone promotes thicker, faster-growing hair.\n* **Thyroid and Metabolism Matter**: Low thyroid function and poor energy production shift the body toward cortisol over hair-friendly hormones like progesterone and DHEA, worsening hair loss.\n* **Stress Links to Other Issues**: Peat connects baldness to heart disease and earlobe creases, suggesting stress hormones like prolactin and cortisol are the common thread.",

I tried posting about this early on in my treatment but the post was rejected. (Hoping this one isn't...I read a lot in this group but don't post much.) A little research showed a few guys have had similar results, so I know it's not a complete fluke.

I have PCOS and grow a palm sized patch of long hair there. The bottle says to not exceed 10 minutes but I knew I had some tough hair so I let it go for the full 10 minutes. Nothing happened. I wiped it off and not a lot of hair came with. I put it on according the the instructions, I left it alone, didn't rub it in, etc. So I started letting it stay for longer and longer. I now leave it on for an entire hour before wiping it away, and even then I still have to do a second coat as there's still some left. I've never gotten a burn or pain, at most it will tingle and then be slightly red after for only a little bit but not hurt. Does anyone else relate or know what is going on here? Is my skin odd? Is my hair tough? Any suggestions or ideas would be appreciated",

I don't have an income so I get what I can. I only air dry, I don't have a diffuser. just a dryer with no attachments. if I gel I will put it up in a cheap bonnet for 10-15 so I'm not dripping water everywhere. I used to cowash but I can't anymore, my hair is way too greasy!\n\nmy hair is very greasy and when I gel, it's a grease bomb the next day. sometimes when I gel, it either looks nice or doesn't do much. I also seem to completely miss the back of my hair when I make extra sure I get gel back there... I wonder if I'm doing it wrong or if my bonnet is absorbing it? \n\nI also have autism and the feel of gel in my hair makes my skin crawl. so I don't usually gel. \n\nis there anything I can try doing different? my budget is insanely tight so I can't spend more than $15-$20 on products. \n\nthanks in advance.",

(Picture for reference when its freshly dried)\nAlso I have to wet and diffuse my lengths in the morning because I can‚Äôt make them stay over night. I don‚Äôt sleep with a bonnet because i try to live vegan and I have yet to find a good vegan bonnet, any recommendations are welcome (but keep in mind that I‚Äôm from Germany)\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for me on how I can resolve the problems?

By the late afternoon it literally feels like there is a layer of oil there and I look like I used an Italian sub as a washcloth. Also, I work in a lab. Its not super demanding physically, and climate controlled, so I'm not sweating much.\n\nAll I'm currently using on my head is a Cetaphil low oil wash. I used to use moisturizers as well that said they either reduced oil buildup or had a matte finish, but I feel like they always made the issue worse so I just stopped using the ones I have and now just use the Cetaphil daily. I'm getting discouraged throwing money at products that don't end up working for me, but if anyone has any success stories with a certain product I'd love to hear about it! Any tips or advice is greatly appreciated! \n\n",
