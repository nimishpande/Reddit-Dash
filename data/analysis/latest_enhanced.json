For conditioner, I used to use Elvive, but about a month ago I switched to Dove’s curly hair conditioner. Since switching, I’ve noticed a small improvement my curls feel a bit more defined and slightly less frizzy.\n\nmy routine: I detangle my hair in the shower, then apply shampoo (not always), followed by conditioner. Most of the time I let my hair air dry, but if there’s a special occasion, I’ll sleep with it wet on my pillow. I discovered this by accident once, and it actually makes my curls look way better, almost like they’ve been diffused. If I just air-dry, my hair usually ends up looking more like in the picture I attached.\n\nThe main problem I have is frizz near the roots, especially since I have to brush my hair often for school. Any tips on how to manage that? Also, I’d like more volume should I get a haircut to help with that? And any recommended products? I know i am asking alot, but any sort of advice is appreciated : D",

Specifically the back of my upper legs get crazy itchy, bumpy and irritated whenever I shave them. I shave with the grain using a DE safety razor and a shave soap + brush. I have no issues anywhere except this exact area. I wash my body with soap before I shave and I always use a fresh clean blade and clean all my shaving stuff after use. The irritation starts within a day, begins to gradually reduce after three days and is mostly gone after a week. Does anybody have similar experiences and/or tips on how to deal with this?

      "content": "I have to admit, I’ve always loved glass skin.\n\nI’m in my early thirties, so even before pre-K beauty trends reached our side of the world, I was the kid slathering Vaseline on my skin because I loved the way it looked.\n\nI’m in a weird limbo where I see many women younger than me, my age, and older indulging in expensive beauty treatments (I.e Botox, filler, lasers, etc.). \n\nI’m hesitant to join this trend and I don’t know if I’d be able to resist going overboard. What if I start and can’t stop? What if I start and regret it?\n\nIn any case, I’m fortunate to have good skin genetically. My goal has been to find a low maintenance skin routine that gives me glowing skin, that can act as a good base for makeup or be sufficient on its own. My goal has been to have glowy hydrated skin in the hopes it will help delay any visible signs of aging. I also used to spend frivolously on higher end skincare, and got tired of the fancy bottles and scents that didn’t really do much for my skin. I’ve found my products for lasting glowy and healthy skin, and it’s all reasonably priced. \n\n1. **Always wash your face**. I use Cetaphil’s hydrating cream to foam wash ($16) and it lasts a long time, removes all makeup, and doesn’t have any harsh scents. \n\nI used to use more expensive face washes from\nOrigins, but found this a year ago and won’t go back to anything else.\n\n2. **Toner / keep face wet** before applying moisturizer. I mean, it makes sense that in order to lock moisture in, there should be some moisture already on the skin (and you should be internally well hydrated). I was using Cetaphil’s radiance toner $24 and loved it. However, I just bought Aestura’s moisturizing cream mist $29 and love that it leaves a creamy dew behind. I alternate between these.\n\n3. **Moisturizer:** I have been using Cetaphil’s optimal hydration lotion ($17) daily. It’s scent free and radiant, and leaves the skin visibly glowy. I recently purchased the Cosrx ceramide skin barrier moisturizer ($27) and alternate between the two. I love them both! Cosrx is a bit more “greasy”, which I’m okay with, but Cetaphil absorbs a bit better. Before this step, I sometimes use the Snail essence from Cosrx ($20) if I really want to shine, but don’t do it daily. \n\n4. **Eye cream:** Cetaphil’s optimal hydration eye serum ($17) leaves a hydrating glow around the eyes without scent or irritation. I’m thinking about trying Aestura or Cosrx next. Either way, I won’t stop using Cetaphil’s as it’s checked all the boxes of providing perfect hydration without being overwhelmingly heavy or scented.\n\nI always spray my skin again at the end, either with a water spray or Aestura from step 2. If I have time, I’ll turn on my face steamer for a few seconds at the end to leave a veil of moisture on top of everything. Without fail, this always keeps my skin glowing for the entirety of the day! \n\n\n\n",

I have no idea what my curl type would be, and I am due for a cut so my hair is really heavy right now. I’ve struggled to find products that hold my curls-they usually fall and are frizzy. I’m here to ask two things, is my hair curly? What suggestions might you have to help whatever is happening with my hair? In these pictures my routine was 1. Nexxus humectress shampoo and conditioner 2. lotta body wrap me foaming mousse 3. time spend up in a drying scrunchie then air drying.  \nThank you so much for taking the time to read 💕",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I am 32. I have a dehydrated skin and when I smile I could see lines on my cheek area near to my nose and my cheek area below my eyes. I also have oily skin, acne prone too. I live in Singapore which is hot and humid all year long, and I use air-conditioning when working and at home sometimes.\n\nRecently my acne started to improve after doctor prescribed me this acne gel which contains Clindamycin. I also started very simple skincare routine with products that contains minimal ingredients because my skin is very sensitive to random stuff like fragrance. Also had fungal acne at one point so I try to stick to fungal acne safe products (I used sezia to check the ingredients). My current routine is like this:\n\nGeek &amp; gorgeous jelly joker cleanser The lab by Blanc doux hyaluronic toner Acne gel Purito oat in gel calming moisturizer Cosrx ultra light invisible sunscreen (morning routine only) Cosrx niacinamide low pH micellar water (evening routine before cleansing).\n\nAt midday I would sometimes mist my face with water, then I would layer the lab by Blanc doux toner just for a midday refresh.\n\nI am liking my routine now as my skin is better. Before this I tried various heavy creams such as the aestura moisturizer, skin 1004 probio essence, oil cleansing, annesa sunscreen, de la Cruz sulphur, all of which made my skin really oily and damaged my barrier.\n\nNow my skin is much better but still very dehydrated. I am thinking to add another watery toner to up my hydration game. Any suggestions on a good one? I am thinking maybe the Isntree Ultra-Low Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Toner but Idk since I already have hyaluronic acid in my routine. Any suggestions are much appreciated! Thank you 😊",

My question is what to do with it now. I’m sure I need to do a root melt or something because my roots turned out much lighter and yellow. But I actually wouldn’t mind embracing the orange and doing cinnamon/copper brown like in the first mock up (3rd pic) attached. It’s very similar to what I already have but more refined! I’m wondering if I could use adore cinnamon and honey brown with either a few drops of blue semi permanent added to the mix OR do a blue mask before putting those on to try to even out the orange and have a less brassy canvas? Or would you guys not even bother touching the mids and ends and leaving them as is? Or would you use a level 8 or 9 ash and just neutralize the hair? Alternatively is the 2nd mockup with the more caramel brown (pic 4) achievable at all from this base? Sorry for the long winded ramble question any help or opinions would be much appreciated😵‍💫🙏🏽thank you!",

      "content": "Hello! Sorry for the long post, I’m wondering if anyone would mind lending some of their advice to help me with my skincare journey. I’ve been using acnecide (benzoyl peroxide) face wash and differin (adapalene) 0.1% gel since the start of the year due to acne - I stripped my skincare down to only gentle cleanser, moisturiser and spf as these can be quite harsh on the skin and I don’t know how effective my skincare was before I started using these products. Now that I’ve gone so long without using other products I feel a bit out of my depth. I still struggle with breakouts, though the acnecide and differin combo is really effective at reducing spots, and I want to address texture and those purple-ish marks from old acne. I have oily skin though the acnecide and differin can still be quite drying in certain areas. Thank you in advance :))",
