      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Asking Reddit for help with my hair.\n\n5'6 112lbs 19y/o female\n\nAll my life I've had fine hair. Around 13 (puberty) my hair started to get noticeably thinner and started breaking off more. (I was not shedding or balding though, my hair just got finer.)\n\nIt should be mentioned that around this time I was heavily stressed and undereating. That probably took a toll on my body, including my hair.\n\nMy mother took me to a lot of expensive stylists ages 13-17, and they all said the same thing: heat damage.\n\nHowever, I barely used heat on my hair. The only time heat was used on it was before school dances. And even then, the hair stylist would use a heat protectant.\n\nWhen I told them I wasn't using heat on my hair, they told me it was from wearing my hair in tight hairstyles. But, I never did that either. It was always down.\n\n(I now realize that with my hair being down 99% of the time, that also could've played a role in the breakage. But at the time I didn't know that.)\n\nOver the years my hair got progressively worse. When I turned 17, I decided to invest all my time and money into my hair.\n\nI got a big chop.\n\nI bought claw clips so my hair wasn't down and snagging on everything. I wore them literally every day.\n\nI changed all my products: I was using volume Redken Shampoo, leave in conditioner, and olaplex hair oil.\n\nI slept with a silk bonnet.\n\n1 year later, I saw barely any results. In fact, I think my hair got finer.\n\nI was devastated and depressed. Why did my hair look so bad? Were these just the cards I was dealt?\n\nMy mother told me I should get extensions, but I know those could make my virgin, fine hair even worse. So I refused.\n\nWhen I turned 18, my friend recommended me to her hairstylist. When I sat down in her chair, she told me the same thing every other hairstylist has been telling me throughout the years: Your hair is heat damaged.\n\nThen she touched my hair, paused, and said, \"Wait. Are you anemic?\"\n\nI told her I was, and she told me she could tell I wasn't taking my iron supplements. She then told me to get more bloodwork done in case I'm deficient in anything else.\n\nShe gave me another big chop (I say \"another\" because my last trim with a different hairstylist was also a chop). She told me I could buy all the products and serums I wanted for my hair, but it wasn't going to fix what was internal.\n\nI got blood work done. Turns out, my ferritin levels were at 3, and I was also deficient in vitamin B (I dont remember if it was B6 or B12, but I take both).\n\nGod bless my new hairstylist.\n\nIt's been one year since. I go back to her often for trims. We haven't done a big chop since because any oils or leave-in conditioners I use smooths the cuticle so I can grow my hair out before another big chop to take care of the breakage.\n\nHere's my routine:\n\nWash day only when my hair is dirty, so usually every other day or every 2 days.\n\nIn shower:\n\n- Redken Extreme Shampoo (double cleanse)\n\n- Amika Soulfood Nourishing Hair Mask (let sit)\n\n- Rinse out, then I apply Redken Extreme Conditioner (rinse out with cold water)\n\n\nOut of shower:\n\n- Pureology leave in conditioner\n\n- Bumble and Bumble Seaweed Nourishing Air Dry Cream (I use the tiniest amount because I notice this weighs my fine hair down easily)\n\n- Olaplex oil (only if my ends are still dry)\n\n\nOther haircare I do:\n\n- 10 minute scalp massage in the morning and evening\n\n- Kerastase Nutritive 8H Magic Night Serum (only at night and when my hair is feeling dry and crisp)\n\n- The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Serum (only at night. I 10 minute massage before and after I apply it)\n\n- Silk bonnet\n\n- I wear a claw clip almost every day\n\n- K18 every 2 weeks, I follow instructions on the bottle\n\n\nIt should be mentioned:\n\n- I have virgin hair\n\n- I've always had fine hair, but never THIS fine\n\n- I now religiously take a multivitamin and my iron supplement (paired with vitamin C of course)\n\n- I drink plenty of water\n\n- I still tend to undereat, but I'm working on it. I'm 5'6 and 112 lbs.\n\nTL;DR: My hair started getting extremely fine and breaking around age 13 despite barely using heat, and no stylist could explain why. At 18, a new stylist asked if I was anemic, and bloodwork showed my ferritin was 3 plus a B-vitamin deficiency. I’ve spent a year on iron, B6/B12, trims, gentle products, and protective hairstyling, and my hair is finally starting to improve. I’m looking for advice on how to strengthen my ends while they grow out and whether my routine is too heavy for fine hair.",

I think in one year it grew a lot and I’m happy with it because it has been like 4 years with short hair and I hate it. \n\nMy question is - can I go on without cutting it or will I ruin it long term? I was never able to get a small trim with curly hair, everyone keeps chopping it all off.\nBut I never know if it’s actually beneficial to cut a bit so it grows healthier or if I don’t cut it it will start to break and be worse on the long run. \nI want to style it eventually but length wise I would love to keep it. \n\nCurrent routine is John Frieda hydrating jelly + eco gell and a basic elvive colour shampoo and conditioner.

I use that face scrub every night after I get off of work and shower, and I use the moisturizer every morning after I shower before going into work.\n\nI shave every few days, I’ve just started using a shaving butter and single use razor blades.\n\nMy diet isn’t ideal, i definitely eat a lot of fast food. I just moved into a new place so it’s been a mess, but I’m hoping to start bettering my diet as soon as today.\n\nMy chin is the most stubborn area, constantly breaking out there and it takes forever to heal for some reason.\n\nJust curious if there is any recommendations for products to use?

      "content": "Back in February, I had a snowboarding injury: one broken rib and a crushed right pectoral. That led to almost 3 months of complete inactivity. After that period, I decided it was time to start training again.\n\nI’m 44 years old, turning 45 soon. I’m a former athlete, and I knew very well that at my age, getting back in shape meant I had to radically change my diet and overall lifestyle. So I started a detox, went back to training, and decided to take age-specific vitamins, collagen, and krill oil.\n\nAfter about 10 days, I started feeling itching all over my scalp. I didn’t panic on the first day, but the sensation continued. On the fourth day, I booked an appointment at a clinic specialized in hair loss and hair transplants.\n\nThere, I found out that what I had been seeing for the past few days wasn’t an illusion: I had hundreds of new hairs coming in. The doctor told me I had triggered natural hair regeneration based on the combination of detox, vitamins, and oil massages (I had started the massages on the same day I noticed the first dark hairs breaking through my vortex area — a spot that had been empty until then — giving me that “new beard” sensation on the scalp).\n\nI continued the diet, detox, and daily scalp massages for 6 months. The results became visible: the vortex and surrounding scalp areas entered a thickening phase, new hairs kept coming in, and the overall density improved.\n\nI didn’t do anything specifically for hair. Everything started from the injury, the recovery, and staying disciplined.\n I dont sell any products..i just want to share, maybe it works on others too.I also post a photo journey and medical documents on my instagram page chiranstef.You can check if you want.If you want to try i can help you with my daily routine, maybe it works on you too",

So I am considering cutting it out from my routine. I was using it daily like the packaging said but it made me even more oily and I think that can contribute to the pimples. Sucks I found out after purchasing a very expensive huge bottle of it.\n\nI use L'Oreal Revitalift Vitamin C twice a week: https://www.loreal-paris.fr/soin/soin-par-ingredients/vitamine-c/revitalift-clinical-serum-12--vitamine-c-pure/OAP7229.html\n\nAfter shaving beard, once a week, I put Nivea Men Sensitive Pro hydrating cream: https://www.nivea.fr/actualites-nivea/sensitive-pro-ultra-apaisant\n\nThere are 2 products that I have and don't want to go to waste and was wondering if I should use them:\n\nPaula's Choice Youth extending daily hydrating fluid: https://www.paulaschoice.fr/en/youth-extending-hydrating-fluid-spf-50/m7800.html\n\nCerave Blemish control gel with AHA and BHA:https://www.cerave.fr/nos-produits/soins-cibles/soin-concentre-anti-imperfections\n\nI had bought them before landing the derm appointment thinking they would make a difference on what I already have. They didn't, but again, the point is to prevent new ones appearing an being kind to my face.\n\nSo what do you think about the products I have?\n\nAny recommendations?\n\nPlease and thank you!",

When it gets to this length, it starts to look really flat and stringy, and I feel like it has no shape at all. I originally planned to just get a trim on Friday, but now I’m wondering if I should go shorter for a healthier, thicker look.\n\nI’m considering bringing it up to my collarbone with a more blunt baseline and some soft face-framing pieces, nothing too layered. I’ve also thought about shifting my middle part slightly for more lift.\n\nMy only hesitation: I’m getting married next Fall and want to have enough length for a messy low updo. I’ve done a big chop in the past (when my hair was much longer) but I’m scared to cut too much and regret it before the wedding. \n\nIf you also have fine, thin, straight hair, what cuts have actually made your hair look fuller? And did anyone cut their hair before a big event and not regret it?\n\nWould love any advice or inspo pics before my appointment!",

I follow my normal routine, then push my hair back and wear a zigzag headband so the hair in the front stays a bit straighter than the back.

I find most of my breakouts start from there, as I see new ones almost every day after work.\n\nI don’t do too much. I use that face scrub every night after I get off of work and shower, and I use the moisturizer every morning after I shower before going into work.\n\nI shave every few days, I’ve just started using a shaving butter and single use razor blades.\n\nMy diet isn’t ideal, i definitely eat a lot of fast food. I just moved into a new place so it’s been a mess, but I’m hoping to start bettering my diet as soon as today.\n\nMy chin is the most stubborn area, constantly breaking out there and it takes forever to heal for some reason.\n\nJust curious if there is any recommendations for products to use? Especially to help with work and what not, thanks. \n\n(Excuse all the little hairs as well, just got a haircut)",
