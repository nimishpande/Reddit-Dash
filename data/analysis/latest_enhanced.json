      "content": "Ms Chetali Chadha is back to her old tricks again\n\nRoasting products because they have fragrance in one reel and in a different reel, sneaking in a paid promotion for a product that has not just fragrance, but also color. \n\nYou may have all seen that series the influence with chetali . It has been running for two months now.\n\nI always had a feeling that Chetali was carefully and smartly, putting in her paid promotions inside the reels while making it seem like a genuine informed information and today I got the proof\n\nProof number one in one of her recent videos, she has spoken about the best moisturizer for oily skin, and the Foxtale suncreen has been shown as a clear winner, however, if you have been following her series, you will know that she is dead against fragrance, and any other additives Foxtale moisturizer has both. \n\nIn her latest reel for dry skin moisturizer, she has failed Himalaya and Nivea because they use a particular ingredient that has been banned in the European Union because they use fragrance, however logic did not matter in case of Foxtale. \n\nLastly, if you see her reels, clearly she has done paid promotion for requil, formula RX and Be body wise without making disclosures by just making a point that she is giving them a higher ranking\n\nIt is very easy to figure out which product has paid in which product has not paid. If you just go and put a timer on the reel and see how many seconds she dedicates talking about a product that is paid versus what is not paid.\n\n Incase you don’t have context she has done it before in 2024 and 2025 always roasting products that have fragrance and then promoting the L’Oreal glycolic serum which also has fragrance but at that time it did not seem to make a difference to her because she was paid for it. Her values keep changing based on who’s paying her and who is not.\n\nI cannot believe she has come down to this. I was really liking her content, and it was seeming genuine and educated but now knowing what I know, it is terrible it really breaks my heart. ",

      "content": "Age 30, caucasian, live in Naarm, Australia.\n\nSkin concerns: rosacea, enlarged pores/sebaceous filaments, dehydration. Not a concern but I do enjoy “anti ageing” things. Even though I’m beginning to disagree with “anti ageing” as a concept and think its a bit of a scam. But I’m still obviously obsessed with my skin. Is the root of this obsession patriarchal? Maybe. Or maybe its as simple as I enjoy rubbing slime on my face. \n\nAM:\n\nBioderma Sensibio H2O Soothing Micellar Water Cleanser with Unicharm Silcot Uru-uru Cotton Sponge Touch Moisturizing Cotton Puff Pads (I thought micellar water was dumb as but my sister is studying dermal science and said she was surprised by how hydrating this is in the morning. Now I agree. Previously I just rinsed my face with water. Considering buying reusable pads but last time my washing machine ate them)\n\nShenzen Light Idea Red/NIR light panel (but honestly I slack so hard with this)\n\nNIOD SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE 3 ENZYME MIST\n\nPaula’s Choice 7% Ectoin + Hyaluronic Acid Milky Hydrating Serum \n\niUNIK Beta-Glucan Power Moisture Serum\n\nAestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream (the formula changed, but I have tried literally everything and this moisturiser is unmatched. Potentially too heavy for the AM) \n\nSPF — I was using naked Sundays mineral, which was unmatched before I found out it had an spf rating of like 2???? Now I am layering 2: \n\n\\- Avène Sun Intense Protect Fluid Fragrance-Free SPF50+ Sunscreen (this is meant to block blue light too)\n\n\\- Bioderma Photoderm Nude Touch Mineral SPF50+ Light Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\nBioderma Sensibio Micellar Cleansing Oil (I also like Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil and it’s usually on sale) \n\nQV Ceramides Cleanser\n\nPaula’s choice 10% Niacinamide Booster \n\niUNIK Beta-Glucan Power Moisture Serum\n\nTO Multi-Peptide + Copper Peptides 1% Serum (Previously was using Medik8 advanced which I loved but its $$. I was considering swapping out both the PC niacinamide booster and TO peptides for Maelove peptide squad)\n\nAestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream\n\nFinacea (azelaic acid)\n\nLanolips 101\n\nPC BHA on my nose sometimes \n\nWeekly I do sheet masks - any of the skin1004, Mediheal madecassoside, beauty of joseon centella are my faves. \n\nI’ve tried to incorporate antioxidants, humectants, lots of barrier repairing ingredients, and peptides for collagen stimulation. My skin won’t tolerate vitamin c, retinoids, and many many things. The niacinamide, peptides and avene sunscreen are almost too much. I also have airyday pretty in zinc but its too dark for my skin and sometimes irritating as well. The sebaceous filaments on my nose will not go away. I am open to all opinions, suggestions and product recommendations. Especially sunscreen and especially something to get rid of sebaceous filaments. Would be happy to cut down on serums. Am unsure if I am missing key things in my routine.\n\nAlso, I am skeptical if peptides do much. Treatments like needling, lasers, etc are way better for collagen stimulation. But **(TMI warning--skip to rating my routine if you just want that)** as I mentioned at the start, I’m currently battling the idea of wanting to look young and choice feminism as a whole. I've already decided I wont be getting botox, threads or plastic surgery. But where is the line? We all get old and die and I don't want to see wrinkles as ugly. I've been shocked hearing people say getting a face lift is ageing gracefully. What could be spent on treatments (not that I can afford them) could be spent on therapy to help me accept ageing. And to add to the weirdness, (TW) after seeing so much from the Epstein files it's opened my eyes to how ingrained *it* is in our culture. Literally makes me sick. But I still want to glow and lather my face with things. Don't we all want to be forever young? Does anyone else feel me on this? I shouldn't feel guilty for wanting to look my best. I shouldn't judge myself for how I look either. And I certainly don't judge others for either, as I participate in the beauty industry too. But I've definitely started to wonder if its healthy and where the want comes from. On the other hand, I also want to feel healthy. Skin is our largest organ, it's good to take care of it on some level. I enjoy the ritual of skincare and nerding out about it. Skincare is a female dominated industry too, which has its pros. Remove the patriarchy and looks must still matter in some human way right? Wtf is \"ageing gracefully\"? Idk. Full disclosure when my sister is qualified I will probs still do all the treatments for cheap lol. So yea please rate my routine (bonus if u have deeper insights too) :-)",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi all, new here and will take all the advice I can get!\n\nBackstory: I have a giant exam on Friday I’m supposed to be studying for, so like any rational person I got side tracked on the internet for HOURS.\n\nI was steaming a shirt in my bathroom to de-wrinkle it, when I noticed the teeny little curl (pic 3, the one that started it all). My hair does that a lot with humidity, but I never thought beyond that. I’ve said for years I have stick straight hair, but alas, here we are 😂 I’ve always wanted \\*not\\* straight, flat hair, so I clung to that hope/urge to procrastinate. \n\nI immediately found this subreddit and started scrolling. Then googling. Then putting strands of hair in a glass of water. \n\nTurns out I have low porosity hair, which makes a lot of sense. I never moisturize my hair (as clearly evidenced in photo 2, pre-experiment) because it gets oily so quickly, but the internet tells me that’s because it’s not absorbing the heavy products I’d try on it every other month or so. I’d get annoyed that it made my hair oily, and go back to no moisture, only to try again with a super heavy product when I decided to combat the follicular dehydration again. And the cycle continued. \n\nI decided to put off my responsibilities further and go to Walmart to find a low porosity friendly leave in conditioner. I don’t know if this one for sure qualifies, but it was grad-school budget friendly, so I rolled with it. I always brush my hair essentially flat to my scalp right after I shower, but this time I used the leave in conditioner and scrunched my hair rather than brushing it out immediately. I used a microfiber towel I usually use when washing my face to scrunch more. It looked wavy (and probably is just wavy) and I figured it was just texture from the scrunching. \n\nI waited it out though! I’m usually a constant play-with-my-hair-er, so it was brutal trying not to touch it while it dried, but when I checked it out after studying a bit, I found a full on curl?! (Is that a curl? A wave? I honestly have no idea what it classifies as, I have no idea what I’m doing. The rest is just wavy for sure, but the first photo is of my golden child chunk of hair 😂)\n\nWhatever it is, it feels like it’s not from scrunching, and I now have so much enthusiasm and so little knowledge on how to keep making progress here. \n\nSorry for the long winded post, I’m just genuinely so jazzed that my hair is doing anything, and I figured maybe someone here would have advice!\n\nRoutine: native strengthening shampoo + conditioner, not your mother’s leave in conditioner ",

      "content": "I have experimented with hair products for the past year or two without much success or satisfaction, so I’m finally reaching out for some help. My hair has been short for almost all of my teenage years, and now in my early 20s, it is the longest it has been since I was a child. I have tried a few things to learn more about my hair type and how to take care of it. For about 1.5 years I did not get it professionally cut and instead lightly trimmed it at home. I also heat styled some parts of my hair daily without hair protection and without much apparent damage happening at the time. From some combination of the poor trims and heat styling, I had a build up of dead ends that left my hair getting tangled and taking forever to dry. If I walked around with clean, brushed hair going about my day, the underside of my head would be tangled into a solid mass within a few hours. \n\nA few months ago I went to a hairstylist and paid $90 for her to help me shape up my hair and cut off the necessary parts of the dead ends (she wanted to cut much more to give me a very fresh start). I noticed quicker drying time in my hair and less tangling. I still have issues with both of these things. It takes my hair about 2-3 hours to fully air dry.\n\nI’m so attached to the confidence the length has given me that I’m hesitant to cut more even if it would ease my tangling and drying issues. However, I think this may also significantly be related to my hair type and improper treatment.\n\nI think my hair is a bit curly. It is very thick, the porosity seems to be low, and it forms S shaped curls in the shower when it’s moisturized, especially when it’s squished to my head. It never lays quite straight when I treat it straight.\n\nMy routine has almost entirely been a straight hair routine: daily use clarifying and hydrating shampoo and conditioners (these were marketed as daily use and lightweight), very occasional deep condition masks, occasional clarifying shampoo. These are my products. My hair with a conditioning mask or some leave in conditioner will definitely form the S shaped curls while wet, and they’re somewhat visible after drying in the first few photos (1-3). Photo 4 is my hair before the cut a few months ago where it is visibly beginning to tangle on the inner (nape) hair sections despite the fact I was only walking around indoors that day. I should probably include a photo of my wet hair and the curl definition there, but I don’t have it currently. \n\nI’m very comfortable with accepting my hair is more straight than wavy/curly, but it has such a texture to it that I find that difficult. I’m not sure if it is defined enough to be wavy/curly though since I’ve used  conditioner masks, creams, and sprays to try to add definition and results never seem to hold. I’ve never used a diffuser or wavy/curly shampoo/conditioner combo, so I wonder if these would make a difference.\n\nI know my self care and approach to my hair seems a mess. It genuinely was, as was a lot of my life at the time. I’m currently trying to find what to do to make my routine and my life a bit easier while adding to my confidence.\n\nAny advice on what to do/try?",

(the azelaic acid i only apply at night if anyone is wondering).\n\ni have sensitive, acne-prone skin and a bad habit of picking, so redness and post-inflammatory marks are a big concern for me. i like that these feel gentle and not heavy, but i don’t see cocokind talked about a ton here compared to brands like la roche-posay, cerave, vanicream, etc.\n\nfor anyone who’s used cocokind long term:\n\n\\-did any of their products cause acne?\n\n\\-did it help restore skin barrier?\n\n\\-do any of the products pill?",

Any tips?\n\nShould I stop all actives for 1-2 week? Or just reduce the frequency of actives? Do I need to replace my cleanser/moisturizer (I use typical drugstore cerave ones)? I'm thinking about using aquaphor more to help bring in moisturization?\n\nWould appreciate any and all advice.

Now that I have a good length, straightening it all the time was not working out and I started my curly journey. I am relatively new to my natural hair but get pretty good hair and wash days every now and then. \n\nThrough it all, frizz is my one problem I’ve not been able to get rid of. I have tried various things but none seem to be working. I’m thinking it’s the products I need to change. The first and second pics are right after finishing my routine one day that I felt was my best yet. The pics after that, while not in the same wash cycle, are how my hair looks like in day 2 or 3. While some definition is there, frizz just makes me disheartened and ruins the hair. Can anybody please help me to get rid of frizz and make my hair look hydrated? I wouldn’t mind trading in a bit of definition for less frizz and more hydration.\n\nI shampoo twice a week with a clarifying shampoo every once. Routine after goes like this:\n\nConditioner and wait for 5 mins and then brush through while waiting. After rinsing, I apply Marc anthony strictly curls leave-in. Then SC curl cream. Then NYM’s curl talk gel after which I brush style and scrunch. Most of the time I use a diffuser to dry my hair. Light oil to SOTC. ",
