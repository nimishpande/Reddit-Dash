      "content": "For starts i’ve been told by POC and by red heads that my hair is curly and that i just don’t take care of it right. Here is my hair routine for some background. \nI wash my every 2-4 days. \nI always wash with Hairitage Shampoo. I will either use Native or Hairitage conditioner. \nWith shampoo i massage it into my scalp with a scalp massager and my nails to hopefully stimulate hair growth. \nWith conditioner i put it all over my hair. I use my fingers to brush the conditioner form scalp to ends to help detangle it and then i let it sit for a few minutes. (i have heard back and fourth in weather or not to use conditioner on your scalp but when i started to use it on my scalp i saw benefits) \nWhen im out of the shower i let it sit in a towel for 5-10 min and then take it down to air dry. \nAt night i sleep with a silk pillowcase. \nI dont use heat on my hair except maybe once every 6 months. I have added a picture of my hair after it’s already been brushed. i forgot to take a picture pre brush. im sorry. \nWhen i do brush my hair it turns into a massive frizzy mess. it truely looks like a rats nest. Before i brush i can see individual curls and curl pattern but its very obvious needs to be brushed so i do brush it. No matter what anti frizz product ive tried or how much i brush it always looks bad. PLEASEE HELP \nSo long story short: Is my hair actually curly? If it is… what can i do for my specific hair? i’m at a loss. ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

Benzoyl peroxide gel – He told me to apply it daily in the morning on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer.\n(He didn’t suggest any moisturizer; I’m using the Minimalist Vitamin B5 moisturizer)\n\n2. Tretinoin gel 0.025% – He told me to apply this in the evening around 6–7 pm on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer.\n\n3. Vitamin C serum – He told me to apply this at night after washing my face (he didn’t mention applying a moisturizer after it)\n\n4. He also gave me tablets, which I have to take once daily for 30 days\n\nToday is my second day of following this routine, and my skin feels itchy, looks reddish and I’m noticing more acne/bumps.\n\nIs this normal?

      "content": "Hi all! I’m curious if anyone has noticed something similar.\n\nI’ve had adult hormonal-pattern acne (chin/jawline and lower cheeks) for seven years. What’s weird is that when I spend extended time in certain places, (usually it's the west coast of the U.S.) my skin clears almost completely; without ever changing my skincare routine, makeup, or medications. When I return home, the acne reliably comes back.\n\nThe biggest difference I can identify is seems to be water quality and climate. Where my acne is worse, the water is very hard and the air is dry. Where my skin clears, the water is softer, humidity is higher, and air quality seems better overall. This has made me wonder whether hard water/mineral content might be exacerbating inflammation and making hormonal acne harder to control. \n\nI use a very gentle routine (Vanicream cleanser, minimal actives, tret only every few days, no over-exfoliation), which is why the environmental difference feels so striking. I don't feel like I'm changing my diet or other factors dramatically enough that they might impact my hormones, but maybe I'm just really unsure. I also have suspected PCOS, so I know my skin may be more reactive to inflammatory triggers even though the acne pattern itself is hormonal.\n\nI’m not looking for a diagnosis just wondering:\n\n* Has anyone else noticed their acne improve or worsen depending on water quality or climate?\n* Has anyone had success trying to emulate water conditions from their travels back at home? (I live in an apartment and this just seems tricky to do effectively)\n* Did shower or faucet filters help at all?\n\nI’d love to hear if others have experienced this or found anything helpful. Thanks in advance!!!",

At first it wasn’t too bad, so I thought it was nothing, but later it became more and more itchy, and that’s when I realised the salicylic acid caused it. After that, the rash spread to my neck.\n\nI’ve honestly broken down over this. Even the medication prescribed by the doctor hasn’t helped. When I touch the itchy areas, I can feel rough bumps, and it’s extremely itchy. I really don’t know what to do anymore. I feel disgusted with myself and deeply distressed.

Ive been trying to find a way to keep it wavy and actually like it, but I just cant figure out what to do.\n\nHere's my routine so far:\n1. I shampoo and condition it every other day with rosemary infused stuff, which I've found really helps with my hairs health and shape.\n2. I comb it out while it's wet.\n3. I scrunch in some John Frieda curling cream, jelly, and mousse.\n4. I comb it a bit with my fingers and slick the top back as tight as I can, since I want that part less wavy and with a little more lift when I push it forward.\n5. I let it air dry.\n\nI dont hate this right now, tho I really need a diffuser for my hair dryer since the waiting is soo painful. What I'm struggling with is the in-between days. Ive tried everything, but no matter what I do it turns out frizzy or greasy. I can't style it without getting it wet and I cant get it wet without it getting greasy. I'm thinking I rinse with conditioner only in my off days and styling again with the John Frieda stuff? ",

      "content": "Thanks in advance to all you beautiful people reading this. Been growing my hair out recently and trying a variety of different things to help establish a curl pattern. I have super tight curls in the back/ very bottom of my hair line so I know it can happen! But I’m getting discouraged as even when trying products and methods my hair rarely looks good.\n\n**I swim 3x a week and use a shampoo that removes chlorine in addition to the pictured products. I know some people don’t wash their hair as often, that is not an option for me since I need to get that chlorine out! I live in the Midwest so it’s cold and dry out right now as well but tbh my hair is always frizzy no matter the weather.\n\nFirst pic is minimal maintiance- I use the chlorine shampoo, pictured shampoo(focus on roots) conditioner (focus on non-roots), barely rinse that out after a few minutes and then spay pictured leave-in and wrap in microfiber towel for 10-15 minutes then hair dry. I usually shower at night (I swim after work then hop in the shower right after) so to preserve my hair I have tried using a silk bonnet. I don’t use it every time right now maybe 1-2/week. \n\nSecond pic is adding in more steps- same shampoo/conditioner routine in the shower and using a wet brush to get the leave in (and adding in hair milk- little black botttle) evenly distributed in my hair. After taking out of the towel I put some mousse (not pictured but it’s Aussie brand) and scrunch that in, then use a dryer with diffuser to form curls (which always seems to result in a MESS) with warm heat low power. I don’t aim to get it fully dry with that, but after it’s like 90% dry I see the frizz is coming back and use some oil (clear bottle) on top\nof my head where the frizz is the worst. Of course that doesn’t really seem to help after 10 minutes the frizz returns.\n\nI know this shampoo/conditioner is not really helping but at this point I think I am needing help with the technique/ putting the steps in the right order. This is the first time I have really tried putting effort into my hair so very new, thanks again to anyone willing to give some advice and help me turn this around! ",

      "content": "Need skincare help!\n\nI’m looking for some help with figuring out what is wrong with my skin and what to do about it. As someone with a facial structure that I don’t love on the best of days, having red skin and breakouts on top of that leads to my self confidence being at an all time low. \n\nMy skin on my face is kind of just red all over, and the worst places for me are the areas around my mouth where if you look closely there seem to be a ton of tiny little bumps. The pores on my cheeks are huge and I occasionally just wake up with one of those deep swollen pimples brewing in a random location that acne patches do nothing for. My forehead is usually the most problem free area but of course today it is broken out as well. \n\nI drink nothing but water and the occasional coffee, my diet isn’t perfect but it’s pretty healthy overall and I’m vegetarian so I eat a lot of whole foods. I don’t touch my face during the day and sleep on silk pillow cases which I wash often. \n\nProducts I have and have used in different combinations:\n\n\\\\- Cerave foaming cleanser for normal to oily skin: I’ve been washing my face with this in the mornings daily for probably 2 years and it only seems to dry out my skin if anything \n\n\\\\- Cerave SA cleanser: I bought this recently and have been using it at night because Chat GPT told me to but haven’t seen any improvement \n\n\\\\- The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%: on days when I don’t use the retinol, I cleanse and then wipe the toner over my face with a cotton pad and then wait for it to dry and then apply the niacinamide. \n\n\\\\- The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner: paired with above\n\n\\\\- Cerave moisturizing cream: this is the only moisturizer I’ve ever used that prevents my skin from being visibly dry and flaky so I use it every night and have been for years\n\n\\\\-Cerave resurfacing retinol serum: I use this a few times a week after cleansing and then apply the moisturizer, on days where I don’t use the ordinary products\n\n\\\\- Hero acne stickers: these work well for pimples that have actually come to a head but never helps with the deep ones \n\n\\\\- Head and Shoulders Dry Scalp Care shampoo: I’ve even tried washing my face with this recently because I’ve seen some people on here saying some stubborn acne can be fungal but haven’t seen any change with that either \n\nI just feel like I’ve tried so many different angles and have been making no progress. Admittedly I haven’t solidified one single routine and stuck with it for months at a time, but it’s also because I feel totally lost and worried I may be doing the wrong things. \n\nI’m 28F and live in Canada, seeing a dermatologist isn’t in the cards for me rn for several reasons, so I’m just hoping anyone who may have similar skin to mine can even point me in the right direction? I’m so green when it comes to skincare and beauty in general but I’m so tired of feeling so down about myself. Literally any and all suggestions welcome. ",

I don’t dry it with a hair drier , I just tap it with a towel until the most of the humidity it’s gone and then just leave it like that. I wash my hair twice a week and sometimes I just put some water to style it , I also saw that it’s so dry sometimes and I feel like it just needs to be hydrated.
