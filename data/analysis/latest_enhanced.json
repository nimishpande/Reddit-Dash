      "content": "May 2025 —&gt; December 2025\nFinally learned how to love and take care of my curls in the past few months and I’m now obsessed with my hair. I had grown up always just brushing my hair out and then I learned how to use a flat iron and never looked back.. Until I started bleaching my hair. So I decided to put down the heat tools and learn how to do my natural hair.\nMy routine: \n1. I wash and condition with Redken Extreme Length (struggling to grow my hair because with it becoming healthier it also shrinks a lot) and usually do a hair mask every other washday. \n2. I use Sun Bum Leave in Conditioner, Sun Bum Curl Cream, Not Your Mother’s Gel, and a Bounce Curl Volume Brush. I also diffuse my hair upside down (I ❤️ volume) \n3. I scrunch and shake out my hair with Mielle Hair Oil\nI don’t do refreshes, I wash my hair around 2x a week, usually oil everyday, and I sleep in a silk bonnet. I also usually only wear my hair down to avoid breakage. Would love any hair growth tips!! \n",

The first photo is how they cut my hair the first time I saw them since I was growing out my pixie and realized I have naturally wavy hair. This was 2 years ago and I’ve since grew my hair out well below my shoulders. Looking back at pictures with my short hair, I really missed that era and went to cut my hair with them again. I showed them the reference and explained exactly how I want it to look but (third picture) this is what my hair looks like right now after trying to somewhat decently style it. The fourth photo is immediately after the haircut. I just don’t know what went wrong or what I should do… I realize my hair probably has to grow out before I do anything else with it but how do I go from this to the voluminous, wavy hair in the first and second photos? Any advice will be greatly appreciated 🙏\n\nMy usual styling routine are the Odele volumizing shampoo and conditioner, then the Twist by Ouidad lightweight styling gel and a styling foam. I usually diffuse my hair but it looked horrible with this haircut so I ended up straightening it. ",

I have dozens of these in my hair. A few times a week I sit down to search for these in my hair, and cut them off. I am worried it will start to make a difference in the length of my hair. I would love to avoid having to cut my hair like this. Does anyone have ANY tips on how to prevent these tiny single-strand knots? Is it OK if I just leave them there, and don't cut them off?? Because I would be down to do that, if there isn't a problem with it. it's SO FRUSTRATING because these knots are most often near the middle of the hair strand instead of the very end. I just cant resist cutting them off!!! Here is my routine:\n\n\\* 2 days a week I wash my hair, this is when I fully detangle by brushing it out with a Wet brush  \n\\* I let my hair air dry which takes several hours  \n\\* on wash day, I use two different leave in conditioners and curl cream  \n\\* every night I finger-detangle my hair (mostly) and put it into two braids  \n\\* every night I oil my hair while it is braided\n\nAs you can see, I try to minimize tangles as much as possible. But since my hair is so long, it's so hard, its practically always tangled. Please give me tips!",

But after spending way too much time reading studies, browsing forums, and listening to dermatologists explain this stuff, I realized something I hadn’t understood before: a lot of follicles don’t actually die, they just go dormant. That completely changed how I looked at the problem. If hair is inactive rather than gone, then things like stimulation and how anything actually reaches the follicle probably matter way more than just throwing random products on the scalp. I’m not claiming miracles or saying this fixes everything, just sharing something I really wish I’d understood earlier instead of assuming it was already too late.",

I never really know what to ask for, and what I end up agreeing on, turns out below expectations (bangs, for example). I can't really tell what my face shape is either. No matter what I do, I always end up going back to just simple medium lenght hair. I've had curtain bangs before too, but my hair is so thin that it usually ends up looking very plain and holds no shape. If it matters, my hair is typically oily, and I assume type 1A, and very fine.

      "content": "Posting in this in case it helps someone else! I have fine curls that when I followed a routine and thought I did everything right most of the time they would not clump, come out stringy, and fall flat and limp and thin. I tried different products in different orders,  on different levels of wetness, etc, and eventually chalked it up to humidity and things out of my control. \n\nI was under the impression that since my curls were fine it was very important to get as much water out of my hair as possible (I almost never diffuse, and airdry instead) as to not weigh them down. After applying my product on wet hair I would use a cotton shirt and scrunch upwards and pulse as much water out as possible. Doing this also removed a lot of product and therefore reduced the hold, and my clumps would get ruined. \n\nAnyone else find this to be the case? What I’m doing now is applying my product to super wet hair out of the shower, use a cotton shirt to scrunch and pulse upwards the same but this time only doing a couple passes, before I would do it continuously until I got it as dry as possible. So my hair now air dries more damp and my routine seems to be working alot better! Not perfect but a good improvement!\n\nHair type: fine, oily\n\nEvery other day: double shampoo roots with garnier curl nourish, (will sub out for Nizoral or ouai detox shampoo as needed based on buildup, usually atleast 1x/week) \n\nAs needed (maybe 1x/month): exfoliate with ouai scalp scrub and scalp brush\n\nOn soaking wet hair in order: Not your mothers leave in spray curl talk conditioner, tresseme extra hold volumizing mousse, and curlsmith in shower style fixer gel\n\nApplication method: with head tilted, rake in and praying hands with tension to form clumps, then gently scrunch upwards only a couple times. Use cotton shirt to scrunch upwards again to absorb some water but not all, and air dry damp, in the morning I scrunched out the cast. I didn’t pineapple or anything over night (it always gave me mixed results)",

      "content": "Hi, I came off birth control to swap for a copper iud about a year-and-a-half ago and have suffered with acne ever since! My GP was treating it up until June &amp; then I started seeing a consultant dermatologist. I’m normally just a scroller on these forums but I would be really grateful for some help now…\n\nIn the photos, my ‘clearer’ (totally conscious it wasn’t perfect) is when I was on my GP’s course of treatment which was Epiduo in June. The latter photos are from my dermatologist’s current treatment (December). I’ve been on spironolactone (terrible side effects and didn’t do anything for my acne), and am now on Winlevi and azelaic acid alongside Aklief (a 4th gen retinol) in the evening.\n\nMy skin has clearly got worse since seeing this dermatologist and now he’s pressuring me to go onto Accutane which I don’t believe is necessary if I can get my skin back to how it was previously. I could have another course of antibiotics too, but it caused severe flushing and I don’t miss how reactive my skin was to the sun! I don’t know if I sack off this dermatologist &amp; try to sort it out myself using Epiduo again?\n\nI should also note that I do have some hormonal issues, and I would not be surprised if these things are all interlinked, but in June my skin was almost clear and that was using a topical cream so i’m determined I can get back to that whilst still trying to deal with the hormonal issues. Also, asked my dermatologist if the copper iud could be an issue but he said no sooo…\n\nI don’t know if I stick to what the dermatologist has prescribed in hopes it’ll fix itself, I couldn’t get another appointment until Feb so I would have to wait another month or so until I see them.\n\nI just don’t know what to do anymore and my acne is making me miserable, I miss who I was prior to it and have lost all self confidence!\n\nCurrent Routine: \n\nAM:\n\n\\- cerave hydrating foaming cleanser \n\n\\- winlevi \n\n\\- skinoren cream \n\n\\- cerave hydrating moisturiser\n\n\\- la roche posay invisible fluid 50+\n\nPM:\n\n\\- cerave hydrating foaming cleaner\n\n\\- winlevi \n\n\\- cerave hydrating moisturiser \n\n\\- Aklief retinol ",

So I would ideally like to use products that aren't toooo oily but also not not hydrating.. Preferably something for combination skin. \n\nAlso I would really like if I could get rid of the redness in my face. As you can see from the pictures my face is significantly red compared to my neck. \n\nAnd I would love if there is a product that helps with smoothing out the overall texture of my face. If there is no such product, is there a treatment I could look into that isn't me just getting a face-lift or something? Lool \n\nAny and all advice is wholeheartedly appreciated and welcomed! \n\nMy current routine is washing face and neck at night with a mild soap (I use a dove bar), follow up with an apricot toner. In the morning I use heartleaf moisturiser and spf 50. Not mentioning brands but I can share if this is useful info! I also used to use Azeliac acid but I found it did nothing for me! ",

After 2 years of failure and random breakouts which I NEVER used to have, I settled on the following:\n\nTirtir ceramic cream as the only moisturizer that makes my skin less dry. It feels really good for my skin but if I overdo it I breakout.\n\nTirtir Milk toner which unfortunately does break me out a bit but I like the feel.\n\nI have a CeraVe daily moisturizer which I stopped using since I liked tirtir more\n\nYesterday bought Geek and Gorgeous 0.05 to start retinal\n\nBeauty of Joseon sunscreen (Sun aqua fresh rice).\n\nAs you can see, I have a tiny very minimal routine and am open to trying more things.
