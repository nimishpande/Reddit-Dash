      "content": "Hi everyone. About six months ago I posted here in a pretty desperate mood and shared a picture of what I thought was my completely unrully hair. Even back then some people were sceptical, because my hair can look good sometimes, but the issue was always that it only lasted for a day. After that the curls disappeared and I had to redo everything every single morning, which was exhausting.\n\nFor context, I straightened my hair from around age 13 for almost ten years. I have only been properly embracing my natural curls for about a year and a half, so I am definitely still figuring things out.\n\nA few months ago I got the full Bali Curls line as a gift, and since then I have actually stuck to one routine. I now wash my hair with the Bali Curls Nourishing Shampoo and Bali Curls Nourishing Conditioner, brush it while it is wet, then comb through a small amount of Bali Curls Curl Cream. After that I apply a generous but not excessive amount of the Bali Curls Curl Defining Gel. I learned the hard way that too much gel just makes my hair feel heavy and lifeless (even though a lot of peole commented on my last post that theres no such a thing as too much gel, thats just not how it works for me)\n\nI scrunch with a cotton T shirt, plop for a few minutes, then diffuse. I start diffusing without touching my hair and only scrunch later. I never fully dry it because that would take forever. After about half an hour I scrunch in a bit of hair oil (honetsly I just use whatever brand is at my hands) and that is usually when things start looking good. I also use the Bali Curls Heat Protection Spray whenever I diffuse.\n\nOn non wash days I refresh with water from a spray bottle and usually diffuse a little in the morning if I am going out. I do not add extra product. The biggest change is that my hair now actually lasts. It still needs refreshing, but it does not completely fall apart anymore, and it finally looks like curls instead of a daily mystery.\n\nThanks again to everyone who commented on my original post. You were more right than I wanted to admit.",

      "content": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/south-korean-president-urges-public-health-cover-hair-loss\n\nSouth Korea’s president, Lee Jae Myung, has urged officials to review whether hereditary hair loss should be eligible for national health insurance, arguing it can affect day to day functioning and mental health rather than being “just cosmetic.”  ￼\n\nThe core mistake in the backlash is treating “not life threatening” as if it means “not debilitating.” Hair loss is a highly visible change, and in appearance intense cultures it can realistically shape confidence, dating, job interviews, and social avoidance, which is exactly the kind of functional impairment public health systems are supposed to reduce.  ￼\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/ijd.12758\n\nThe strongest clinical reason this can become disability level is the overlap with body dysmorphic disorder, an obsessive compulsive related condition defined by intrusive preoccupation and compulsive behaviors like checking, camouflaging, reassurance seeking, and avoidance. In one study, about 29.6% of hair loss patients met criteria for body dysmorphic disorder versus 2.7% in a general dermatology comparison group, and a large European multicentre study found alopecia in the top tier of skin conditions linked to clinically significant body dysmorphic symptoms, with odds more than eleven times higher than healthy controls.  ￼\n\nA serious pro coverage position can still be targeted and fiscally cautious by focusing on evidence based first line care under physician diagnosis and pairing it with screening for depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphic disorder, so the system treats the hair loss without missing the psychiatric emergency underneath.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "For context, I’m a 17F living in Brazil. I have mild acne concentrated in the T-zone, mostly pustules and whiteheads.\nMy current dermatologist prescribed Differin 0.3% for nightly use. Only now do I realize how strong that concentration is.\nPreviously, with another dermatologist, I used adapalene 0.1% combined with La Roche-Posay Effaclar (Concentrated). That combination actually cleared my acne very well, but over time my skin became extremely dry and started peeling. Everything I applied burned intensely and was painful. That dermatologist didn’t prescribe a moisturizer at all. At my second appointment, she told me to switch Effaclar to the High Tolerance version, but that made no difference—my skin looked exactly the same for weeks, until I eventually finished the adapalene 0.1% tube.\nWith my current dermatologist, this is the routine she prescribed:\nAM:\n– Avène Cleanance Cleansing Gel (for oily, sensitive skin)\n– Eucerin serum for oily skin and hyperpigmentation\n– La Roche-Posay Anthelios Airlicium SPF 80\nPM:\n– Avène Cleanance Cleansing Gel\n– Dermage “Secatriz” moisturizer (a Brazilian brand; very lightweight—I’m not sure it’s doing much, though I was already using it before)\n– Differin Gel 0.3%\nI jumped straight into using all of this daily 😭\nNow, one month in, I feel like it’s doing nothing for my acne. I went through my usual menstrual breakout, and my skin handled it worse than it did before I started adapalene. I wake up with my T-zone extremely oily—something that hadn’t happened to me in years—and my skin gets oily much faster throughout the day. It doesn’t feel dry at all, and instead has developed a constant shine.\nI don’t know if this is just the purging phase, but I’m honestly afraid to keep going. Would it make sense to reduce how often I use adapalene during the week? Should I switch moisturizers—or do both? I’m really unsure.\nShe told me to come back in 3–4 months, but I’m already at the end of month one and seriously considering booking another appointment. Should I? If my skin were dry or irritated, I’d understand what’s happening—but increased oiliness and more acne are really discouraging.\nThank you so much for any advice or recommendations.\n",

I have tried new products to see if it helps, but I just never gets better, nor worse. Just stays the same. Some days its much less visible and I feel very relieved, but days later it just comes back. I also am a little unconsistent with using products, I dont know if this could be a cause aswell? Some days its just so red that I skip products thinking they will worsen it, and often after a few days with zero products it actually will clear up, but leaving my skin feeling dry and it comes back again and I use products again. So its just this circle of it getting better and then worse again. I try to limit washing my face (with just water) one time a day, as it may strip the skin barrier. Maybe my skin barrier is just broken, i dont know. Looking for advice.",

If anyone out there, anyone at all has any suggestions on how I can fix this I would be so greatly appreciative.

The reason I bought this is because I want to address my redness and hyperpigmentation, and it indeed removed my hyperpigmentation but it really takes time. Lots of TikTok videos show that the hyperpigmentation would just be gone within a week, and I have to say, it’s not that magical. Aside from that, the texture likes a silky gel, which I like.\n",
