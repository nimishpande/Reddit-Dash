      "content": "So, this might seem seem stupid to some but since it seems to work for me I am willing to bite the bullet and share with you.\n\nBackground:\nI first noticed thinning around my temples about 8 years ago. I immediately got on dutasteride and minoxidil. The side effects from dutasteride started to kick in around week 2 and they forced me to quit. Took a good few months to get my libido back and clear the brainfog. I stuck to topical minoxidil for a few years but it did not yield enough results and unfortunately causes some side effects too (nocturia, sleep apnea type sleep disturbances, issues with blood pressure, heart skipping a beat etc.)\n\nThis summer my temples became pretty much bare. I thought I would give treatment one more chance so I could hold out until something that works and won’t nuke my balls or libido.\n\nTwo months ago I decided to be wild and buy the spiciest red chilis I could buy and began rubbing them on my scalp. I cut the peppers in half lengthwise and rub them until I have a nice red coating on my scalp. At first it felt like it was scaulding me but now, I would call it an intense warmth that I can ignore. It does lead to redness that persists about an hour after washing off.\n\nI keep the liquid on my head for anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer. About halfway through I rub some coconut oil on my temples and massage, this helps exfoliate and I guess drive some more capsaicin into my scalp. Afterwards I wash it off using Alpecin shampoo and am extra careful to make sure it does not run into my eyes.\n\nEvery 2-3 days I apply a very small amount of minoxidil foam as to avoid side effects. \n\nEvery 2 weeks I use a 0,25 mm dermapen and on that day I skip everything besides shampoo.\n\nAfter every wash I use a lightweight beard and hair oil to keep my scalp moisturised.\n\nThe difference has become noticeable in person and somewhat in my close ups. My temples seem to be somewhat closing in now. Try to use the red points as a point of reference. First image has hair length at 2mm, second closer to 3mm. The first was taken a month ago, the second today.  Unfortunately I forgot to take one when starting out. Ill try to keep documenting further down the road with more standardized documentation.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "This is mostly a post for anyone looking up \"does nicotine cause hairloss\" or looking for reasons it might be happening to them because BEEN THERE and I know how much sometime all you want is a single person who can confirm your thinking.\n\nThis experience is definitely anecdotal, though I have seen some scientific support to the correlation between nicotine and hairloss. I also know people who have smoked a pack a day for decades and have full heads of hair, so it won't be true for everyone.\n\nI vaped for 4 years, coinciding with the start of my hair loss. I did NOT make the connection (and basically refused to haha). I tried EVERYTHING from oils to minoxidil, and blamed everything from COVID to weightloss (5 lbs weightloss mind you) and only when I had exhausted all options did I decide to quit vaping. I had gone to my doctor even, who basically shrugged once all my labs came back mostly normal (I have anemia but thats always been true).\n\nWhen I quit, it took a bit of time to notice but my hair eventually went back to normal. Woo! Did I make the connection? Nope, I assumed it was other things (I moved, I used certain supplements, etc.) \n\nI then started nicotine again (this time just Nicorette gum, not inhaling anything). Guess what? Hair loss!!! I then STOPPED the gum (I do 0mg nicotine vape now, not seeing any issues so I truly think it's just the nicotine) because I came to my senses and finally admited that there was a connection, and now have hair sprouting everywhere. \n\nI know this won't be true for everyone, but if you consume nicotine in any form and have tried EVERYTHING maybe try quitting nicotine.

I’m trying to establish a routine that would help with moderate acne, as well as some light orange peelyness, open pores, and texture from my problems with picking at it…. But I never end up consistent cuz I’m always in the sun and I know a lot of actives don’t mix with sun. What should I do? Also feel like waterproof sunscreen may be breaking me out but I have to use it.\n\nI have been using azaelic acid from the ordinary in the mornings which I think is helpful but not enough to keep my acne at bay. Here are some other products I own but haven’t tried consistently:\n\ndifferin\n•\t⁠Paulas choice Salicylic acid exfoliating toner\n•\t⁠Niscinimide\n•\t⁠Neostrata AHA (I think it’s Glycolic acid?)\n•\t⁠Sulfur spot treat 10% de la cruz\n•\t⁠Sulfur with glycolic spot treatment (thayers)\n•\t⁠Gentle basic soap\n•\t⁠Jojoba oil (for oil cleansing sebaceous filaments)\n•\t⁠Cera ve salicylic acid bar soap\n•\t⁠Cicaplast b5 baume\n•\t⁠Triple barrier repair la roche posay lotion\n•\t⁠Cera ve spf 50 face\n•\t⁠clindamycin\n•\t⁠basic sulfur bar soap\n\nI just started differin as I’ve been inside more for the holidays but idk if it’s even worth it to go through the purge if I’ll end up quitting it when I get back to my hours of sun every day days. And yes I do wear a hat!!\n\nShould I try to get a higher strength azaelic and use that only hoping it will clear my acne? Or differin just a couple times a week? Or is retinol strong enough to clear acne without being as sun sensitizing as differin?\n\nLet me know what you guys think about a possible acne routine safe for a sun lover. Also if anyone acne prone has a waterproof sunscreen that doesn’t break them out please drop it. Thanks!",

My washing routine every 3-4 days consist of the following: (please keep in mind every single product I use is from the regular Cantù line of products, specifically the shea butter line)\n\n1- Cleansing shampoo.\n\n2- About half my hand worth of conditioner about brow level and all the way down to my ends. I scrunch and also run my fingers through my hair. \n\n3- I let the conditioner sit on my hair for about 5 mins then I use a wide tooth comb to untangle it and once I have gone through it all, I rinse.\n\n4- I use about the same amount of leave-in conditioner and mix about half a finger’s worth of styling gel and once again go from about brow level all the way to the ends, scrunch and then run my fingers through my hair.\n\n5- I allow my hair to air dry, I have never used a diffuser.\n\nMy refresh routine consist of using a spray bottle, once my hair is almost dripping wet, I scrunch and let it air dry. \n\nTo protect my hair at night, I use a satin bonnet, I’ve tried doing a pineapple knot and putting it inside the bonnet but next morning, I look like Sideshow Bob so I’ve settled into simply putting my hair inside the bonnet. This causes some curls to flatten and hairs to become loose.\n\nMy main question is essentially related to this last part, is there any way to help prevent this? I’ve considered using hair gel in between washes but I don’t want to damage my hair by being ignorant and using way too much product on it (assuming that’s even a concern, I honestly don’t know) just because the loose hairs stress me out.\n\nHere are some pictures for reference of my hair.

The replies to that post were very helpful and I wanted some help on choosing some alternate products or sticking to this routine.\n\n- Moisturizer: should I stick with the ponds or switch to minimalist b12 since I'm using niacinamide and need to protect my skin barrier?\n\n- Sunscreen: this is where I am facing the biggest confusion (so are others when I searched this sub lol), I initially decided to go with the regular minimalist spf 50 but then I found out it has retinol in it (seperate thread on that later, because that makes no sense) which is a big no no with the other actives I'm using so decided to switch to the light fluid one instead. I've also heard korean ones are good as well as reequil ultra dry matte but there's so many choices and not enough budget to go around so please help me choose one :\")\n\nI hope y'all can provide a overall verdict on my routine, I'm scared and excited to be starting this journey for the first time after decades of tanning and negligence of my skin \n\nSee you on the other side 🤎",

No reaction, no breakouts.\n\nBUT I didn’t love the finish (a bit too shiny/gelly for my liking), so I thought I’d try others.\n\n\t•\tDot &amp; Key SPF &amp; Aqualogica SPF – BIG mistake. Both gave me dermatitis. Burning, irritation, texture — the whole nightmare. This really shook my confidence in cosmetic brands.\n\n\t•\tWent to a dermatologist:\n\n\t•\tSuggested Venusia sunscreen → made me extremely oily, felt heavy and uncomfortable and also i felt it didn’t work much i felt my tan increased with the use\n\n\t•\tThen suggested Acne UV.\n\n\t•\tAcne UV (50g) – LOVED it. Blended well, no irritation, skin was happy.\n\nSo I confidently bought the 100g version and… it was HORRIBLE.\n\nThick, doesn’t blend, terrible white cast, stays patchy on the skin. I don’t know if it’s a batch issue or formulation difference, but it was unusable.\n\n\t•\tUV Doux – Tried this too and it felt good on my skin. No immediate reaction.\n\n•\tBoj OG Sunscreen — Too heavy, felt like a moisturizing blanket for dry skin — not for me.\n\nNow I’m thinking: Korean sunscreens?\n\nI’ve seen people rave about them, but they’re costly, and I’m nervous because:\n\nI apply sunscreen properly (2–3 fingers) every day, so cost matters — but if something is truly worth it, I’m open to trying.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n\n\t•\tSafe for very sensitive skin\n\n\t•\tNo dermatitis / irritation\n\n\t•\tPrefer matte or comfortable, slight dew is okay\n\n\t•\tWorth the price for daily use\n\nIf you’ve had similar skin issues and found something that works (especially Korean or pharmacy sunscreens), please share 🙏\n\nI just want sun protection without my skin panicking .",

About 10 days ago, I used a hairspray to set my heatless curls.\nWhat’s confusing is that my hair was completely fine even after using the hairspray. I checked my photos to be sure. The very next day after using it, I showered and my hair still felt normal. The texture issues only started after that, not immediately.\nSince then, my hair has been behaving very differently. It’s clumping together, getting frizzy, tangling easily, and the overall texture feels changed.\nI’m not sure what’s causing this.\nThese are the products I own and rotate between:\nDove Bond Repair Shampoo\nL’Oréal Fall Resist / Follidense Shampoo\nMinimalist Bond Repair Mask\nTsubaki Hair Mask\nDove 10-in-1 Serum\nL’Oréal Elvive Extraordinary Serum\nI asked ChatGPT and at first it suggested product buildup from using too many “bond repair” products, but later it said the hairspray could be the cause. Now I’m honestly confused about what’s more likely.\nI also refuse to believe that a hairspray could stay on hair for that long after washing. Is this permanent damage or something that can be fixed? Should I be worried about hair fall?\nSo far, I’ve tried oiling my hair, switched to L’Oréal Purple Shampoo and Conditioner, used aloe vera gel to style, and even applied yogurt before washing to smooth it out.\nRight now, my hair just feels like a tangled nest and I’m honestly lost.",
