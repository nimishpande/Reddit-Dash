Bali Curls Moisturizing Conditioner\n\n3. Bali Curls Hydrating Curl Cream\n\n4. Bali Curls Curl Defining Gel \n\n5. Bali Curls Bonding Oil for scrunch out the gelcast.\n\nI never had long hair and had to find out just after my early 40s that i have curly hair (i would say 2c-3a). It is very fine but it seems i still have a lot strands. I was going to cut that dry and frizzy mess short again until i learned how to maintain it after watching videos, search the internet and finally got a \"curlsys\" cut from a hair stylist knowing how to handle curly hair and teach me how to maintain and style it. I also learned that some things makes night and day like avoid friction and sleeping only on a silk pillowcase with a loose bun (also silk scrunchie here). It can get really on my nerves to maintain that mane but i just feel so much better now at my age with my longer hair and while in the beginning people said it looks terrible, now it is more the opposite and it is a great conservation starter to women and man.\n\nI am still searching for maybe some better products for my special hair type and try other things. I just bought the \"Lockenbox\" Christmas calendar with 24 tools and products to try for next year ;) My journey just began (even i am already a 47 years old man) and hope to grow the curls much longer and maintain them better. I still have some bad hair days with a frizzball on my head but now i know how to \"repair\" it. One thing for sure, even if some people try to talk me into a shorter hairstyle i am done with shorter hair.....at least until it might get thinner as an aging man. So far i think i still have some years to go. ",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

My hair is thinning fast, including thick terminal hairs, and it’s honestly starting to stress me out a lot.\n\nI wanted to switch to dutasteride, but my doctor refuses to prescribe it because it’s not approved for AGA here (only for prostate issues). Dermatologists in my area also refuse to prescribe it off-label. So I’m stuck.\n\nDoes anyone know a reliable and safe source for dutasteride that ships to Europe / France?\nI’m not looking for anything sketchy, just something legit that people here have used with success.\n\nAny help, advice or personal experience would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks a lot in advance, and good luck to everyone dealing with this.",

I can’t STAND the back of my hair. It’s stringy and flat and weird, and only curls at the bottom. I have strands that frizz and don’t define no matter what I seem to do. At the same time, my hair can look flat and weighed down, and only curls at the bottom in most places. I’m not sure what I can do. I don’t know if I should be adding more moisture or if I’m adding too much. How can I get my hair to look less weighed down at the top and in the back? Any help would be appreciated.  \nI usually use Herbal Essences honey shampoo and conditioner, but lately I’ve been using garnier fructis conditioner. I wash my hair maybe 2-3 times a week, or more if it gets sweaty. I try to leave in conditioner for as long as I can before washing it out and I always leave in a tiny bit. I only brush my hair wet, and I apply products while it’s pretty damp. Daily, I use OUAI leave in, or Sleep on it overnight curl cream. Neither really do anything, I still have a ton of frizz and weighed down looking hair. I shower before bed, and let my hair air dry 70% before I clip it up. I swear I could put in the whole bottle of product and my hair would still look dry. The second pic is a failed attempt at defusing. In the 3rd picture I included, I had used gel as well to style my hair, and I like the way it looks. It was completely air dried. It was also summer, and my hair always seems to be prettier in the summer. The fourth pic is just air dried hair after my normal routine. Any advice would be really appreciated. I’m not sure what my hair needs. Plz give tips!!",

      "content": "The peel cost me £300. My skin type is dry and very sensitive. I’m 30 y.o. My issues are dull skin , fine lines, and some freckling from sun damage. Day 1 . When you start the process the cleanse your face and wipe with alcohol. They then apply the peel which burns , but only while being applied. They will probably give you a fan which really helps. The overall pain is max 5/10. It is applied in layers. They did about 4 or 5 layers on me. Afterward you look like a orangey red color due to the peel being a deep orange tone. But nothing too crazy.\nYou are supposed to leave the peel on for 6 hours . But since I did it in the evening (6pm) I was told to leave the peel on overnight. To be honest it does not matter how long you leave it on. Day 2. The next day my skin was really really tight and dry and red. First thing in morning I wipe with the pad provided in the take home kit which stinks but doesn’t really burn too badly. In the evening I apply the second pad No peeling yet. Day 3. Really really dry red itchy and tight. I notice a little peeling just in the corner of my nose. Day 4. I woke up to a lot of peeling around my mouth and the edge of my forehead. Day 5. Peeling a lot in forehead and now it’s spreading out to cheeks. Evening of day 5 it’s coming off in huge sheets the thickness of paper. Like my entire cheek and half my forehead came off in one massive sheet. Day 6. Peeling is done but skin underneath is sore and red. Although very smooth. It remains red and sensitive for a few days. Day 9. Redness is calming down and my skin is really smooth and I definitely notice a good decrease in my freckles.\n\nOverall this treatment is so worth it. I now do it once or twice a year just for a full refresh and total skin resurfacing.",

The routine on a full wash is as follows:\n\nWet hair &gt; shampoo &gt; hair mask (5-10 min) &gt; conditioner(2-5 min) &gt; pat hair to remove excess moisture &gt; leave in &gt; oil &gt; let it air dry.\n\nWould you guys say this is somewhat ideal or is there any room for improvement/anything i should adjust?\n\nThanks a lot for all the advice in advance and cheers!",

      "content": "I’m curious to get some opinions on my issue. I’ve had these flat unpigmented lesions on my neck (left picture) for probably a decade now (I’m mid 30s) and never really worried about them. I don’t really get them on my face or anywhere else, but my pores on most of my body are very big if that makes any difference. I haven’t remembered to ask a Dermatologist about them and they never commented when doing a skin check. They occasionally itch and every once in a while I can pull one off like a skin tag. I don’t have insulin issues and am if anything often leaning hypoglycemic with low blood pressure and some anemia.\n\nI recently tried putting Differin on it a couple times a week but that seems to have just irritated things (right picture) so I’ve discontinued. It fully looked like hives earlier in the week but I didn’t get a good picture.\n\nNeck routine before the irritation was:\n\nMorning: \n• Rinse with water \n• Apply Cerave Facial Moisturizing Lotion (30-50 SPF)\n\nEvening: \n• Wash with Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser\n• Use clean washcloth to remove soap and rinse\n• Apply thin layer of Cerave Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment \n• Apply medium to thick layer of Cerave Night Cream\n\nI took a break from the exfoliating cream  before starting Differin and used a lot of moisturizer, but it seems it’s too intense for now.\n\nI’ll see when I can get in to see a dermatologist but, in the meantime, any advice on what these are and if they’re treatable at home?\n\nAlso, I’m a little new to posting so please let me know if the picture doesn’t come through or there are other issues with the post.

I do need to be careful with what I use due to the retinol causing sensitivity. \n\nI have always struggled with cystic acne (PCOS-related) which the retinol has completely cleared up and has gone some way to clearing up these tiny dots but not completely. \n\nHaving done some research I thought it could be fungal acne so for the past few weeks I've been using Nizoral ketoconazole 2-3 times a week, leaving on for 3 minutes, but I don't think that's really done anything! \n\nAlso thought they could be closed comedones which I've read salicylic acid and retinol are treatments for, both of which I already use.\n\nGrateful for any advice 🙂",
