I began treatment on September 8th, and as you can see, I’ve already had great results in just 3.5 months\n\nMy concern is the timeline: I’m getting married on September 2026, which is only seven months after the transplant. From what I know, seven months isn’t usually enough time to see the full results of an HT.\n\nRight now, I’m using hair fibers to cover the thinning areas, and it looks really good. So my question is - should I go ahead with the transplant in February, or postpone it and let the medications continue working (which would give me a full year of treatment by the time of the wedding)? Worst case, I could still use hair fibers for the wedding if needed.",

      "content": "My hair has had so much more actual curl everywhere since I decided to start cupping with a diffuser instead of exclusively hovering the whole time. Now it looks like the hair of an angel!\n\nI'm still having issues though, since the mousse I use requires me to only put in a small amount of it, (lest my hair get weighed the hell down) I end up not being able to actually form a gel cast on my hair. Despite a good chunk of my routine being hover diffusing on low heat.\nI feel like I'm missing out on some definition by not having a gel cast.\n\n\n\nAnother problem is that Im not actually sure how to use hair oil? The benefits of protection from dryness and less moisture loss are super enticing though.\nI just put a bit on the ends of my hair after putting leave in conditioner to hopefully preserve some definition. \n\nBut some people say you're supposed to scrunch out the cast with oil? I can't exactly do that in my situation.\nAnd others say doing this actually evaporates the oil when it comes in contact with the heat of the diffuser. So I'm kind of at an impasse.\n\n\n\nRoutine: After soaking in the shower, spray a bit of Camille rose leave in conditioner and scrunch the ends with a tiny amount of hair oil (not sure if I should use it before or after) \nthen apply Pattern mousse only on the ends and mids so the hair isn't weighed down.\n\nFollowing this, begin hover diffusing on low heat to hopefully make a cast. As well as gently cupping the roots to make some lift.\nThen afterwards, begin hanging head upside down and swaying to all different sides while cupping on medium heat.\n\nEither dry completely or leave semi dry to air dry the rest.",

During the pandemic, my hair lost a lot of density, elasticity, and shine. It was no longer bouncy, just dead. Since that time, I have struggled to keep it as beautiful as it once was. I am literally desperate. I have tried it all: mousse, gel, cream, diffusing upside down, airdrying, ploppling, diffusing like Manes by Mel explains, conditioner, no conditioners, vegan/cruelty-free products, commercial products, Biotin, sleeping with a bonet... Sometimes my hair looks better than other times, depending on where I'm living (the water quality) and how humid it is. My hair looked like the first picture when I lived where I currently live now, too, but now it can’t stay that beautiful. No matter what, I can never achieve the level of perfection (in my view) that my hair had back then (first pictures). The worst thing is, I can't even remember my routine! I think I used whatever product I saw, and I didn't care too much about the process. Right now, my hair is unable to grow (not even nicely, just grow) past a certain length, especially in the face area (I don’t have equal hair lenght). It seems dry, but I am always told I overcondition, so I am very confused... I am tired and don't know what to do. My hair used to fall on my shoulders and bounce. Now, it seems to be straight out of the roots, but it does like a plateau, then curly. The curl pattern and texture of the hair are better on the back of my neck than on my scalp and ends, but in general it has no life. I do not have any deficiency, but I do have PCOs, which I treat with birth control (since 2023). I haven't been pregnant.\n\nCurrent routine: wash thrice a week, cold water, John Frieda Frizz Ease Dream Curls Shampoo, Giorgi Mousse (level 4), once a week Milk Goat conditioner. To refresh, John Frieda Refresh Curls. Rosemary oil on my scalp before washing, with a massage. Before, I was using Aussie products (shampoo and cream). I use a bonet to sleep and dry it following Manes by Mel. \n\nPlease, what can I do? Am I ever getting that hair back? I've seen a lot of miracles around here... Help a gal out.",

I had to stop all my actives since I recently began accutane. I noticed this morning that my forehead was getting new texture and I recognized it as fungal acne which was not there before. I’m sad to discontinue these items since they made my skin feel amazing.\n\nFrom left to right it’s their: dermal spray that contains hypochlorous acid (I use it after washing my face and let it completely dry before moisturizer), gleanser that contains 50% glycerin, AM/PM modern face moisturizer, and their half and half ceramides + peptides fluid moisturizer.\n\nCould it be any of these products or possibly the accutane? I just started day 2 today of 40mg. Any advice or tips are welcome. Thanks!!",

I’m 26F, and I would love any advice on how to improve my skincare routine or if everything seems fine as is. \nI have oily / acne prone skin ; my main areas of concern are acne (of course), large pores in my T-zone, overall skin texture, skin firmness, and fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes. \n\nSome of the products I’ve been using for a while and find to be really effective, while others are newer. \n\nMorning : \n\n1. Cleanse : Cerave blemish control (solid cleanser, no complaints)\n2. Tone : Anua Heartleaf soothing toner (LOVE this product and how it makes my skin feel super clean but not dry) \n3. Serum : Skin 1004 Madagascar Centella ampoule (adore this product as well, it has made a huge difference in my skin brightness and plumpness) \n4. Moisturize : Cosrx Snail 92 all in one cream (I used the Cosrx hyaluronic intensive cream before, but it was out of stock when I ran out so I decided to try this one) \n\nNight : \n\n1. Cleanse (same as AM)\n2. Tone : same as AM or Medicube zero pore pads twice a week \n3. Retinol : Some by Mi retinol intense every other day (just got this but have had no issues with it) \n4. Serum : same as AM \n5. Eye cream : Cosrx Advanced Snail Peptide eye cream (definitely helps wjth my dark circles but feels a bit heavy for my skin)\n6. Spot treatment : Uriage Hyseac SOS paste (really like it, dries up my acne overnight)\n7. Moisturize : same as AM \n\nMask once a week : Ordinary AHA BHA peeling solution (very effective for my skin) \n\nAm I missing anything ? Are there any products I should consider changing ? \n\nBefore anyone suggests it, I have tried the “less is more” approach of just cleansing and moisturizing, but it does nothing for my skin. My current routine has resulted in my skin looking better than it ever has, but I still want to make improvements where I can.  \n",

      "content": "Hello all. My skincare journey has been and still is a wild ride.\n\nI had acne for 10+ years before finally going on accutane in 2021 (photo 1). Almost finished the course but I got super depressed and started getting weird skin growths on my shoulders/neck/face and was advised to stop taking it. Acne still cleared though! (Photo 2 and 3)\n\nMy skin regime is relatively simple since that’s all I can really make myself maintain. \n\nMorning:\n\n1. CeraVe Gentle face cleanser\n\n2. 4 drops of my dermatology office’s house made Vitamin C drops\n\n3. Dermatology office’s 30spf sunscreen\n\nEvening:\n\n1. CeraVe Gentle face cleanser\n\n2. Skinbetter AlphaRet retinal cream (also moisturizes)\n\nAfter saving up money, I went to a dermatologist for Co2 laser scar removal for my acne scars in early 2025. We also did a few rounds of subcisions with no fillers before and during the laser. After a couple months, I informed the doctor that I still had pinprick gridlike holes all over my face, and she said it was an unfortunate case that my skin did not react well to the laser. (Photo 4, 5, 6)\n\nAfter healing from that, I’ve been going in every 4-6 weeks for microneedling to help get rid of the pinprick scars and hopefully improve the overall texture of my skin from my acne scars. I’ve had 3 microneedling sessions so far. (Photo 7, 8, 9)\n\nI feel like I have noticed no improvement yet for my skin texture from all of these treatments. If anything, I fear it might actually be worse as I’m starting to see more wrinkles forming on my face. Especially my forehead and around my eyes. I think I’m looking much older than I am (I’m almost 29).\n\nAm I overthinking it? Am I following the right course of actions to try and get rid of acne scars and improve my skin texture? Is this aging my skin?",

      "content": "Hey gang you know the drill - self-esteem, clothing options, social life &amp; dating life being destroyed by this. 🤕💔\n\nExactly a year ago I had my first cyst on my right collarbone. (Dec 2024)\n\nI am Mediterranean &amp; my skin is crazy prone to pigmentation so even though it was tiny (I honestly thought it was a stubborn single ingrown hair) it looked sooo obvious and dark and wasn’t going away for months 😫😫😫\n\nCos I thought it was a hair I had it lasered and then saw a derm and used a $200 cream (Dermaceutic Mela Cream - a potent, clinical-grade skincare treatment designed to reduce dark spots, melasma, and uneven skin tone). This cream + 2 spot treatments of needling on the mark made it disappear in a few months and I was so relieved for the weird single-cyst era to be over.\n\nWELL I got another one last week on my left collarbone 😫😫 (outlined in blue). Yesterday my derm extracted the build up of oil/keratin/skin cells with a needle extraction) and then this morning I woke up with aNOTHER double cyst 5cm lower on my chest. (Outlined in brown square on photo)\n\nThis is the first time it hurts this much. Just did some warm compresses and have to wait until 2026 for clinics to be open but WHYYYY is this happening?!!!???!\n\nI am incredibly hygienic, ALWAYS shower after exercise (bacne ptsd lol), I use a shower filter, I drink heaps of water, eat organic whole foods only (no processed foods or sugar unless it’s a treat like 4 times a year), I’m not on any medication, I moisture my whole body every night with QV ceramides to keep things moisturised and not blocked so it’s just frustrating to be doing so much and getting cysts that I have never seen before 😣\n\nI’m 34F and wondering if it’s hormonal?😭 this year I started lasering my upper lip so nothing crazy but definitely noticed hair growth more than before 😞.\n\nI also get mild bacne but I am very self conscious and can’t show my back so my whole life I have shown my décolletage as a way of feeling sexy/free/attractive/confident . Not cleavage but just strapless tops, singlet tops and princess cuts etc…\n\nNow this has been taken from me and I am so sad about my wardrobe and also it’s summer here in Aus and now I am avoiding sun exposure for my pigmented skin and it’s just so depressing.\n\nI have always had acne-prone skin but now having to hide my face/back AND NOW CHEST is just super upsetting 😔😔😔\n\nI’m also worried about the costs of extraction. I think my dermal clinician did a good job but I read about making sure the “sac” gets removed and that’s more like a minor incision/surgery by a professional gp/plastic surgeon/dermatologist.\n\nAnyone else dealt with this?? They’re not as hectic as the ones on google images but enough to impact my self esteem and clothing choices.\n\nAnyone gone to a clinic in Melbourne for something like this??",

Amyways, today I tried the loreal one and its seems pretty good so far but I've seen so many people saying it caused heaps of hair loss so I'm terrified. Also I use this natural nail polish by kester black and the shampoo completely destroyed it, a problem I've never had with other shampoos. Should I keep using it an see if it causes hair loss or should I just ditch it. If so, any recommendations for thick, oily hair?

I am doing everything I can to keep my skin moisturized but it can be really hard to use thicker products as I am very acne-prone... I'm not really looking for product recommendations, I've scoured this sub over the years and I think I am using the best products my skin can tolerate but it somehow isn't enough. I am incredibly moisture-focused with my products too, the only drying thing I use is tret but I stopped using it for a bit due to the weather and I got super inflamed pores and closed comedones and still had dry skin so I am using it again. For note, my dryness is very prominent along my chin, sides of my nose, and between my eyebrows, though I do notice some stinging around my undereyes if I try to wear makeup or use too much sunscreen. Anyways, I'm not sure what to do for my skin (I am going to get a dehumidifier and yes I drink enough water and I apply my products on damp skin always (besides tret lol)) and would love some help from my fellow dry-skin acne-prone warriors. Also worth noting, I am getting very bad redness on my chin and nose creases and am breaking out there, probably due to the dryness causing excess oil production :(\n\nCurrent routine is:\n\nAM:\n\nAnua 8 Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Gentle Gel Cleanser\n\nAnua Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner\n\nCosrx Snail Mucin Essence (would like to stop using this but any moisture helps rn)\n\nPeach and Lily Glass Skin Refining Serum\n\nAestura Atobarrier365 Hydro Soothing Cream\n\nSqualene oil (3 drops but concentrated on T-zone where I get dry flakes)\n\nSkin1004 Centella SPF\n\nI will also add some Cerave Healing Ointment on my dry spots in the morning before I leave but would love not to do this as it looks crazy lol\n\nPM:\n\nAnua 8 Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Gentle Gel Cleanser\n\nAnua Heartleaf toner\n\nCosrx Snail Mucin Essence\n\nAestura Atobarrier365 Hydro Soothing Cream\n\nSqualene\n\nCerave healing ointment\n\non tret nights (every other night) I leave my moisturizer for 20 minutes and apply the tret then top with squalene oil\n\nIf i am particularly dry I will add another moisturzier (Soon Jung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream) on T-zone but I wouuld prefer not to as I think this isn't the best for acne prone skin..",
