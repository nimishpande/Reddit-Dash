      "content": "I (54F) have 2B-3B 20% virgin grey hair, and I'd like to try something fun with it. I was thinking about trying a semi permanent colour, something fun and vivid, like deep red or royal purple, that would really make the white streaks that frame my face pop. However, when I've tried semi permanents in the past, my curl does NOT like it. My hair gets drier, curls don't clump properly and get looser. I've already lost so much of my curl pattern since menopause (gone from a solid 3B with lots of density and consistent curls that needed minimum help to define or style to much looser overall, with a real mix of mostly 2B-3B, and a couple of small pieces that are closer to 2A. But I am not happy with my hair - I'm 20% grey,  especially around the front (incl. 2 cool white streaks at the temples) and the loss of volume and curl means it's so much flatter and harder to style than it used to be.\nI have dyed my hair before, about 8 years ago, with E-Salon, when my hair had a tighter more consistent curl pattern and full density (I've lost 25-30% of my density since then), and it always took a few weeks minimum to recover. Now, with the current density and curl pattern, as well as being on the drier side of normal, I'm worried that I will just end up losing much of the remaining curl and volume. \nHas anyone had any experience playing with colour on their curls? What effect did it have on condition, curl pattern and styling? \n\nMy routine:\n\nShampoo: Carole's Daughter Goddess Strength (once or twice a month)\nDaily conditioner: Carole's Daughter Goddess Strength (every shower)\nMask: alternating between Carole's Daughter Goddess Strength and Verb Hydrate Mask \nClarifying shampoo: L'Oreal Everpure (as needed - I don't get a lot of product building up as I don't use a lot of product)\nLeave In: LUS All in One for curly hair\nStyling: LUS Sea Moss gel. Have also tried Curlsmith Curl Souffle and FX texturizing paste.\nMethod: squish to condish, then before getting out of shower, apply the LUS All in 1 prayer style, comb through w wide toothed comb, wrap in microfiber towel to soak up excess water, then section and curl brush and either air dry or, if going out, apply LUS Sea Moss gel to hair prayer style, section and curl brush to clump, then combo of scrunch/hover diffuser on low gentle heat until about 80-90% dry (live in a very humid climate). If I'm using texturizing paste, I do it right after taking off the towel, but don't use both that and gel.\n\nAlso, please note that photos show my hair air dried, not diffused and styled (which would be fuller and curlier). And I'm planning on getting a shorter cut to reclaim some of my curls and volume.",

      "content": "Hello! I have recently decided to actually try to take care of my curly hair lol. The issue is, I have no idea what I am doing.\n\nMy curl type is maybe 3a, but that probably doesn't matter.  My hair type is thick, coarse, and absorbs product well, I think? Most likely dry. I just started using curl cream (unscented Not Your Mother's), mouse (also unscented, same brand), and curl gel (Odele). Sometimes I use an Odele volume foam, but not too much. I have the Odele hair oil too, but haven't used it really. I use the Wet Brush Curl Detangler. It kind of looks like a hand? lol.\n\nThe first pic of my hair is after swimming in the ocean, no product or styling. The second doesn't have a product either, I believe.\n\nHere are my troubles:\n\n1. I flip my head upside down and apply products. The bottom half looks really nice! However, the sideburn areas tend to be kinda straight-ish, as do the top half of my hair. The curls lose their magic the longer after wash day. Any curl refresher product recommendations?\n2. I've tried doing a pineapple bun and a bonnet at night (the tie with a ribbon kind). I wake up with it slipped off a bit and feel like my curls look kinda flat/frizzy. It's also not the most comfortable.\n3. I LOVE volume. Especially at the top of my hair! Is it possible to get this and a good curl definition? So far, I'm lacking in both areas.\n\nDoes anyone have routine advice? How often should I wash my hair? My hair doesn't get too greasy. What do I do after washing? What should I do in the morning and at night daily? How do I refresh the curls to last longer?\n\nI don't diffuse because I'm a tad bit nervous about heat damage (silly, I know). But I am open to it!\n\nLet me know any product recommendations! As you can see from what I listed, I prefer unscented or minimal, naturally derived fragrances.\n\nWould love any advice! Thank you.",

      "content": "Hi! \n\nMy daughter is about 16 months old and I'm trying to learn how do her hair after her bath and before bedtime. I'm just some white dude with straight hair so I've barely even brushed my own hair. But my wife is Black and beautiful with wonderfully curly hair. \nOur daughters hair is a mix between our hair. It's curly, but they are big curls, not like my wife's tight curls. \n\nRight now I'm brushing her hair in the bath/shower every night, and shampooing every few days with her baby soap/shampoo. Then I dry her hair, and use a lush product called curl power. My wife used to use this product before she did her big chop many years ago and allowed her hair to go full Afro. So I like using it because she smells like my wife when we met. Then I brush her hair again before trying to curl it. I just take strands of hair and wrap them around my finger while she plays with books. \n\nI'm not even sure if this is the right order of operations, just with testing it's seemed to turn out okay? My wife didn't grow up around any Black people, so she was never taught how to manage her hair and didn't embrace her curls until she was well into her 30s. I'm just trying to decrease the mental load on my wife by figuring out a decent routine at night. Also I do all the baths at night so it just makes logical sense. \n\nBut if there's any resources or advice the curly hair community can give a new Dad I'd be all ears. Thanks so much! ",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

      "content": "So I've been at this for a few months now and I still cannot find my curly people.  My hair does NOT like any of the typical curl advice.  Conditioner is too heavy, heat styling does not hold.  I get my best hold from cool air diffusing/air drying.  Tension styling destroys my pattern.  Dripping wet styling does not work.  also please don’t come at me for my hair color I’m growing out black box dye 😭\n\n  \nMy hair seems to respond best to:\n\nstrong clarifying/chelating shampoo\n\nvery light or no conditioner\n\nprotein gels (especially cheap ones honestly)\n\ncool air diffusing + air drying\n\nletting clumps form while dripping wet, pulling apart where I feel separation in my mid lengths, and then locking them while still damp but no longer dripping\n\nMy absolute best result was when I used crappy shampoo on a small section in my sink and then quite literally the cheapest protein gel I found at WalMart.  Protein gel, even with zero conditioner and strong clarifying + chelating shampoo, makes my hair so shiny and soft, it literally looks like a hair commercial.  I need SOME slip for clump integrity, but even Verb Ghost conditioner is too heavy.  (Trying Odele leave in as a rinse out next wash) \n\nI have used conditioner maybe 3 out of my last 15+ washes and my hair looks and feels thicker and healthier than when I was using it regularly. \n\nI just want to understand my hair better and learn more about routines that will actually work.  But all I can find is the usual heavily moisturize/oil/etc advice. the last photo is from the first day I used no conditioner. The one before that was a wash day when I still used it regularly\n\nthe photo of my wet clumps was my best clump day yet. it never stays like that when it dries, but I’m willing to sacrifice definition to keep my length. I know that’s a huge limiting factor here.   \n\n\nFull routine used today:\n\nKristin Ess chelating shampoo 2x\n\nNot Your Mother's conditioner \n\nScrunch with tshirt/no product until not soaked\n\nAmpro protein styling gel\n\nI threw on some Clear Ice styling gel half way through for funsies.  My hair tolerates a LOT of product and really loves protein gel (but hates protein foam)\n\nDiffuser on high heat/speed set on sink while I hovered around it to dry my roots\n\nLift/hover diffuse on cool followed by air dry\n\nScrunch out with a small bit of Olivia Care Shine Hair Elixer\n\n",

They don’t have the same bounce or clumpiness as the top.\n\nI need help figuring out why this is happening and how I can improve it. Could it be that I’m using too much conditioner? Or maybe I’m not putting enough product on the lengths? Or are my lengths too damaged?

Leave-in / Curl Cream (on soaking wet hair)\n\nI apply a curl cream to soaking wet hair, focusing on the mid-lengths and ends. I smooth it through  and then gently scrunch to encourage wave formation.\n\n2. Gel (to lock it in)\n\nI apply gel on top to seal in moisture and hold the waves. I glaze it over the hair and scrunch again to enhance definition.\n\n3. Diffuse\n\nI diffuse on low heat and low speed until about 80–90% dry, trying not to touch the hair too much to avoid frizz.\n\n4. Scrunch out the crunch\n\nOnce completely dry, I scrunch out the cast to soften the waves and add movement.\n\nPlease heeeelp! Also I would appreciate any beginners advice ",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I just want to clarify what the recent policy shift at the Food and Drug Administration actually means.\n\nThe reform does NOT alter the structure of drug development. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 trials are still required, and the FDA review period still typically lasts six to ten months. What has changed is a long-standing practical expectation: historically, even when a company produced a strong positive Phase 3 trial, the FDA often expected a second independent confirmatory Phase 3 before granting approval. This was not explicitly mandated by statute, but in practice it frequently operated as if it were.\n\nUnder the revised approach, a single, large, well-designed Phase 3 trial demonstrating a clear and clinically meaningful benefit may now be sufficient. The only time potentially saved is the time that would have been required to conduct a second confirmatory trial, which typically amounts to roughly one to two additional years.\n\nLet’s apply this to PP405. The drug is currently in Phase 2 and will still need to complete a full Phase 3 trial. \n\nUnder the old standard, even if Phase 3 results were strongly positive, the company would likely have been expected to conduct a second confirmatory trial before filing for approval. That requirement alone would have shifted approval into the early 2030s.\n\nUnder the new framework, if the initial Phase 3 results are compelling and robust, approval could proceed after that single study. \n\nIn that case, a late 2029 or 2030 approval becomes plausible, with 2028 representing a theoretical best-case scenario under exceptionally efficient execution.\n\nThe same applies to any other Hair loss drugs like VDPHL 01 and Breezula.\n\nIn essence, without the reform, even favorable data would probably have entailed one additional major trial and an attendant delay of roughly two years. With the reform, that extra step is no longer presumed. The ultimate determinant, however, remains the strength, consistency, and clinical significance of the Phase 3 evidence.",

Once a month (about every 3 or 4 weeks, I add the extra step of clarifying shampoo with [Un-Do-Goo® Shampoo](https://malibuc.com/products/un-do-goo-shampoo?variant=32156861988927&amp;bvstate=pg:2/ct:r&amp;tw_source=google&amp;tw_adid=&amp;tw_campaign=17555088841&amp;tw_kwdid=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=20946812139&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACbZbU0VjjCAIBmXTPsJ1x6RoHcZM&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAzOXMBhASEiwAe14SacGl7QuZlzChjm5W1np1bquT4h1ku4PUUBtjJD_Te-lOWvsPpXuvPRoCiq4QAvD_BwE).  \n  \nI do wash my hair every day due to my line of work - I airdry for at least half an hour before I go to bed, head uncovered.\n\nI really like the Ouidad products I use:  \n\\- [Curl Quencher® Products for Tight Curly Hair | Ouidad](https://www.ouidad.com/collections/prep-style/products/curl-quencher-moisturizing-styling-gel)  \n\\- [Advanced Climate Control® Featherlight Volumizing Foam](https://www.ouidad.com/collections/prep-style/products/advanced-climate-control-featherlight-volumizing-foam?variant=43748157260034)\n\nBut for travel, it's not as convenient to take these bottles with me.
