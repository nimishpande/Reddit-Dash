      "content": "hii reddit! i’ve been struggling with my curls for a while, and this subreddit is definitely very helpful, i feel like i need someone irl to look at my hair and tell me wtf i need to do. \n\nive been looking to get a curly cut at a salon for a while, and the one i found (with good reviews) offers a full consultation where they sit me down, go over my hair and goals, what i need to do and they give products and recommendations. they also do a cut that suits my curls and face shape … which comes out to $300. i personally think the price is fair because i would get a lot of wisdom and value out of it, but a lot of my friends have been telling its too much.\n\nif anyone has done anything similar and has some suggestions id love to hear it! thanks!!\n\ntldr: is $300 too much for hair advice, scalp cleanse and curly cut + styling\n\n(routine)",

That said, not much progress has been made. I switched from an electric shaver to a razor recently (not Gillette, this really nice kind that does not make accidental cuts near as often. I can’t remember the name). After that, I noticed my face was breaking out bad. I was getting razor bumps all over my chin and jaw line and had no clue why. I asked my barber and he recommend a few products but I went to the store and the lady in the skin care dept. recommended a shave cream and after shave by House of Atlas, the razor I currently use, and then a rose petal toner by Thayers. I’ve been using that for at least a month (I think more) and my face is marginally better but I still get razor bumps bad under my chin and on my jaw line. Basically what I’m asking is, after all this time and effort, what could I be doing wrong? I should mention I have naturally oily skin. I sweat a lot easier than most people. There’s nothing I can really do about that, it’s just what it is.",

I feel like this will greatly improve my mental health and my confidence in general. It almost sounds too good to be true, and now that's my concern.. what's the catch?\n\nI understand it needs regular maintenance and can cost a bit (\\~400$ for new installation and $30 for maintenance where I live). It's definitely worth it since it solves a major insecurity in my life, while the alternative is min/fin forever or go bald. I'm also an active person (heavy cardio 2-3 times a week, and gym 6 days) so that's a concern.\n\nHas anyone had any regrets getting into hair systems?\n\n  \nEdit: As most say, the psychological effect of wearing a \"wig\" is not my concern now as I hate my current hair / going bald and see this as a solution. Folks who using it over at the hair systems sub have all good things to say about it, and it seems to be the exact opposite here. Is it because folks here haven't tried it ever and have an already existing stigma around it?",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
