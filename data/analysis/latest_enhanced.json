Before this, my skin was mostly clear with only the occasional pimple, but now I’m getting clusters of breakouts, mostly on my forehead, and few on the cheek area.\nI hadn’t really changed anything in my routine, diet, or products when the breakout first started. After the breakout started, I changed my facewash to TheDermaCo Sali-Cinamide anti acne face wash but it did not make any difference. I've also been getting enough sleep.\nI’m not sure if I should be changing something in my skincare/lifestyle. For now, I’m just using the facewash and re quil moisturizer and aj screenshot \nAny advice on what might be causing it or how to manage it would be really appreciated.\nThanks!\"\n",
