      "title": "[Acne] 18F getting desperate about horrible persisting acne",
      "content": "I’ve had acne on and off since puberty started, but it’s never been as bad as this. During my junior year of high school, I basically had clear skin with the occasional pimple here and there until my ex and I broke up (oct 2024). Idk if that’s what caused it, but since then, my skin has been absolutely terrible, maybe from a lot of stress during that time?? Anyway, I’ve tried pretty much everything, and I consider myself to be very hygienic (washing pillowcases often, not touching face, etc), and I make sure to stay active and eat very clean. I literally avoid dairy and added sugars like the plague, and I go to bed at 10 pm. I try my best to manage stress by journaling since I am a college student and therefore always stressed, but I guess that could be a reason?? Ever since I started winter break, my face has been much better (less active pimples, more pie and whatnot) since I’ve been eating warm foods and reducing my protein intake (I ate too much during the semester in chase of gains). However, my neck has been an enigma, since nothing seems to affect it. I’ve left it alone for the most part, which seems to have helped, but I put spf on it yesterday and I got new pimples less than 12 hours later. I have gradually accepted my acne face, but my neck pisses me off because I know I’m supposed to keep my hair off of it, but I can’t put it up and then not put spf on it.\n\nAnyway, any help would be greatly appreciated. I feel really gross whenever I look in the mirror and it sucks even more since everyone at my uni seems to have perfect skin and can roll around in dirt and still not break out. It’s also worth noting that I currently have no insurance so I can’t see a derm and I can’t get rx meds or topicals. I’ve been to the derm multiple times in the past but nothing they told me actually helped much and my skin wasn’t at this level yet. My skin type is oily btw.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that I was using Differin and then I cooked my skin barrier bc I tried gradually building up to 5 days a week which was too much and yes I sandwiched. I then tried using the LRP Cicaplast baume b5 bc everyone said it was hg of barrier repair but it cooked my barrier even more so I just stripped back to the basics and stopped using any actives. I’ve been using this routine for about a month now and my barrier has definitely recovered so I am trying to restart soon. \n\nCurrent skincare routine:\n\nAM\n\n1.\t⁠La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser\n\n2.\t⁠Light layer of Vanicream Daily Moisturizer\n\n3. Haruharu black rice airyfit spf if i go out\n\nPM\n\n1. La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser\n\n2. Vanicream Daily Moisturizer",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

It’s so frustrating as when I was in my 20s I feel like this never happened! I’m really not sure what the issue is, I’ve done silicone primers, matte primers, and I check to make sure my primer is compatible with my foundation. I don’t like to be too matte, however couldn’t try glass skin or dewy as with it being oily it would be too shiny for me. I’ve tried using less foundation also. It just always seem to cake in smile lines, my chin, nose and sides of my mouth. I know the cold weather can be drying, however I spent Christmas on holiday and my makeup did the same in heat. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

What **needle depth** would you recommend for a scar like this, considering the nose area?\n2. What is a **safe and effective interval** between sessions?\n3. Based on your experience, what **percentage of visibility reduction** is realistically possible for an old, small chickenpox scar like this?\n4. Is it possible to make it **almost imperceptible**, or should expectations be more conservative?\n\nIn the photo it may not look very noticeable due to the lighting, but in very bright environments or outdoors under direct sunlight it becomes clearly visible, which really bothers me.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikxxh80fodcg1.png?width=939&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78571ba49453f757a84a43978ac56887d0918568\n\n",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "TLDR: does anyone have any experience or guidance for how best to deal with the type of physical scarring I have? I’ve done a lot of treatments in the past and at this point I just want to find the best route no matter how much it costs. Looks like ice pick, rolling and box scars. The PIH doesn’t bother me as much rn and isn’t as much of a priority.\n\n—————\nI (F29) have had hormonal acne since I was about 21-22. It’s ebbed and flowed in severity and was semi-managed through diet in the last year but has recently flared up again. I have PCOS so I think anything stress or hormone related seems to trigger it… I used to get the perfect derma peel pretty regularly to manage PIH/actives but decided to save money and try to build a skincare routine at home that manages both. It seemed to work for a bit but recently have had some stressors that have caused flare ups. Feels like no matter what I do, my skin is so sensitive that one tiny move in the wrong direction kills all my progress.\n\nIn the second half of this year, I developed a lot of small closed comedones after a chemical peel. Over the months, I was able to get rid of a lot of them through adapalene and some other actives but they seem to return regardless especially around my jawline.  I’ve been reading online about how physical acne scarring = uneven skin surface = more clogged pores = comedones, aka a never ending cycle?\n\nDoes anyone have any experience/expertise with treatments that work for the type of physical scarring I have? I’m not an expert lol but I think I have the big 3 - ice pick, rolling and box car.\n\nI don’t want to do subcision, but I don’t know what my best option is especially given that my skin doesn’t really go through “calm” phases that would lend itself to microneedling. I’ve read about the halo laser - I did it once many years ago but not sure if I saw a huge difference and really don’t wanna waste money and time on things that aren’t going to help",

After putting on my new routine, my face feels tight and dry. My makeup does not sit well on my face. It sits on top of it rather than blending in. I have also noticed a lot of texture and my pores are huge even with primer on under my foundation. \n\nFor reference, my skin is very dry, more so in the winter. When I was researching, most of the products I had seen for daytime routines were gel. Maybe the gel is just not hydrating enough for me? I'm not sure what to replace it with. I had gone with inexpensive products that had really good reviews. I know one size doesn't fit all with makeup, but the fact that I hate all four products says a lot about my choices.  My nighttime routine is much heavier and I don't have any problems when waking up. \n\nThe List I had supplied and received:\n\nSerum- The Ordinary niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%\n\nMoisturizer- Peach and Lily gel moisturizer\n\nUnder eye- Good Molecules Yerba Mate Wake Up Eye Gel\n\nUnder eye brightener- Catrice Under eye brightener\n\nI also had reicved Elf Foundation but they don't have a shade light enough for my face. I'll look into CoverGirl. They have so many different shades that I should be able to find something. Any Advice on products that will make me hydrated and smooth will be greatly appreciated. ",

      "content": "For some reason Reddit won't let me post to r/wavyhair , but it seems like it's a sister sub to this one anyway, so I hope y'all will forgive me if my hair is considered wavy rather than curly (idk, it seems like there's a lot of disagreement about curls similar to mine in curly spaces lately).\n\nThis might be a bit of a novel so apologies in advance, and I'll try to organize it as best I can.\n\nI'm looking for **tips on quick and easy ways to work with short hair** (men's cut short, I generally present more or less as a guy) that's been cut wet as if it were straight -- how can I easily style it so that the curl looks intentional and enhanced instead of like I'm trying and failing to subdue it?\n\nI currently have basically shorn back and sides (scissor taper), and then on top in the front, everything on the long side of my side part was cut as one forelock. The overall effect is sort of 40s/50s/neo-Edwardian, like something you might see on a guy from the 90s Jeeves &amp; Wooster TV show.\n\nI've been to a couple of curl specialists before but never felt like it was really worth paying 3x as much as a barber, especially because when my spouse (not a professional hairstylist) cut my hair I was usually happier with the look. My spouse doesn't currently have time to cut my hair (due to illness in our social circle), so I recently tried a new semi-traditional barber, and it seems... fine, but I think I just need to figure out how to work around the result.\n\nI'm also looking for **recommendations for all-in-one silicone-free styling products** with a matte finish, that could help my hair curl more and clump better with less frizz without weighing it down, ideally can be used on soaking wet hair in the shower, and also will last 3-4 days between washes and still look presentable enough for webcam meetings.\n\nJust to make clear that I'm not breaking rule 2, I am \\*not\\* looking for scalp condition help. I have that handled with my routine as described below.\n\nI have hair I always thought was 3a when properly cared for -- big loose curls the diameter of sidewalk chalk or a bit bigger, but the curl pattern isn't an S, it comes full circle -- but I'm also seeing a lot of curly hair discussion labeling hair that looks like mine, with visible full circles that are just big and loose, as \"actually just 2c at most\" so I'm not really sure what type exactly my hair is. Not looking to be typed, I just figure that info may be useful when determining what products to recommend.\n\nLast I tested, porosity, elasticity, and texture/thickness were all medium, and density seems like it might be medium lately too. It was high density when I was younger but I've been on testosterone about a decade now and I'm nearing my 40s, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's thinner.\n\nMy current routine is as follows:\n\n* The day before wash day, I spritz my scalp with Briogeo Scalp Revival to help remove dandruff buildup. I use this because it's the cheapest non-shampoo salicylic acid scalp product I could find where the application process doesn't bug me.\n* Wash day: 2 sulfate-free shampoos.\n* First I use Grandpa's Soap pine tar shampoo and either immediately rinse out per package directions or maybe let it sit 30 seconds while I wash my face.\n* Second I use Vanicream pyrithione zinc shampoo and let it sit a few minutes while I apply skincare and wash my body, and maybe also while I shave if I don't feel like I need conditioner.\n* In the winter, I apply a little bit of Innersense daily hydrating conditioner and let it sit a few minutes while I shave. In the warmer/less dry parts of the year I feel like this leaves my hair weighed down, but I foolishly bought the big bottle many years ago and I refuse to throw it out until I've used it all up.\n* I rinse everything out and scrunch in styling products. I have used Max Green Alchemy styling gel with a little bit of the matte paste on top, usually with maybe a tsp of added neutral protein filler, and that was fine, but it was too many bottles for my limited shower space. Currently using Uncle Funky's Daughter Curl Stimulator, which has protein in it already, but I don't love the shiny finish and I feel like my flyaways still kind of give middle aged STEM professor who's never heard of the CG method and wouldn't give a fuck if they did.\n* Last, I wrap it up with a floursack towel so it doesn't drip everywhere while I do the rest of my morning routine. If I have enough length to do so, I plop. It stays like that maybe 10 minutes until I'm getting dressed, and then I take it off to let my hair air dry the rest of the way.",

I went to my dermatologist and asked what can I do, she prescribed me sulfur face wash. I use it but I don’t notice a huge difference. I recently went to an acne specialist aesthetician. She recommended me the skincare line MIXI, it is a medical grade skincare brand. Before I was using la Roche posay for the longest time, I didn’t have much issues besides extra oil/greasy look. Anyway, so far I’ve been using mixi skincare since 11/14. She recommended that I stop tretinon since my skin barrier was damaged and it doesn’t have good long term effects. So I stopped for 2 weeks completely before adding any of the actives in the picture below. I honestly feel like this is the worst my skin has ever looked!! She claims it is just purging and I need to wait the long process. Help me!! Do I continue with this new skincare and trust the process or go back on tretinon or try accutane?!",

I recently started doing a ‘curly hair routine’ but im still dealing with a lot of frizz and inconsistency in my curls\n\nI use mizani shampoo+conditioner, it’s a 10 miracle leave in plus keratin, curl talk mousse + gel or cream. I usually comb through after using the mousse and leave in, then I let it air dry half way, add in the gel and continue to let it air dry. When I use a diffuser I use it til my hair is half dry then let it air dry. I put on sun bum coconut argan oil to ‘break the gel cast’. When I sleep I try to wear a bonnet but it’s always off when I wake up! \n\nThanks for any tips! ",

I rarely ever check my crown but looking at some photos in 2025 It was apparent the thinning was more recent and happening fast. \n\nEither way, I got back on topical min and it didn’t do much so I dropped it entirely out of my routine once again, and started to look into possibly using oral Min/Fin \n\nI dint have the money at the time to get a hims subscription so I figured I try cheaper alternatives in the mean time before I started oral min/fin \n\nSO I began to use Cecred Edge drops and that’s when I started to notice a difference, so much so that I paused going back in oral min/fin to test results \n\nPicture 1 (taken September) to picture 2 (taken late October) was from Cecred drops alone, by the time of picture 3 (late December) I was using Cecred and oral Min/Fin. \n\nThroughout the listed months I protected my hair as much as I could with a bonnet or durag during sleep, stopped using any hard bristle brushes, also didn’t allow my headset to rest on my head without some sort of covering as I believed that may have attributed to some thinning due to prolonged use and gaming for extended hours. \n\nI currently use Cecred and Oral Min/fin to maintain my current state of hair health and growth.
