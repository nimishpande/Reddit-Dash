      "content": "hii reddit! i’ve been struggling with my curls for a while, and this subreddit is definitely very helpful, i feel like i need someone irl to look at my hair and tell me wtf i need to do. \n\nive been looking to get a curly cut at a salon for a while, and the one i found (with good reviews) offers a full consultation where they sit me down, go over my hair and goals, what i need to do and they give products and recommendations. they also do a cut that suits my curls and face shape … which comes out to $300. i personally think the price is fair because i would get a lot of wisdom and value out of it, but a lot of my friends have been telling its too much.\n\nif anyone has done anything similar and has some suggestions id love to hear it! thanks!!\n\ntldr: is $300 too much for hair advice, scalp cleanse and curly cut + styling\n\n(routine)",

That said, not much progress has been made. I switched from an electric shaver to a razor recently (not Gillette, this really nice kind that does not make accidental cuts near as often. I can’t remember the name). After that, I noticed my face was breaking out bad. I was getting razor bumps all over my chin and jaw line and had no clue why. I asked my barber and he recommend a few products but I went to the store and the lady in the skin care dept. recommended a shave cream and after shave by House of Atlas, the razor I currently use, and then a rose petal toner by Thayers. I’ve been using that for at least a month (I think more) and my face is marginally better but I still get razor bumps bad under my chin and on my jaw line. Basically what I’m asking is, after all this time and effort, what could I be doing wrong? I should mention I have naturally oily skin. I sweat a lot easier than most people. There’s nothing I can really do about that, it’s just what it is.",

My scalp keeps breaking out, especially if I use a gel or any sort of styling product, or if I don’t wash my hair for several days (exacerbated by the use of product). And any heavy conditioners do the same thing. But all the good cleaning shampoos make my hair feel awful. I asked a dermatologist about the breakouts and they recommended a shampoo that cleans great but now my hair feels like straw. This happened with ketoconazole shampoo a different derm recommended as well. It seems like anything that is good for my hair irritates my scalp and anything that calms my scalp ruins my hair. I’ve been trying a million and a half combinations of shampoo and conditioner and styling products and no dice so far. Anyone experience anything like this and have any advice? What worked for you?\n\nThings I have tried: Shea moisture castor oil/Apple cider vinegar shampoo and conditioner (this was working great for me for a long time until I added styling products, and then I started breaking out again) Not your mothers naturals shampoo and conditioner (the pink one) Straight up head and shoulders shampoo+conditioner 2in1 Nizoral ketoconazole shampoo L’Oréal clarifying shampoo L’Oréal moisturizing shampoo The ordinary shampoo and conditioner Vanicream shampoo\n\nThe latest thing I’ve been using is the vanicream based on the derm rec and trying it with the ordinary conditioner or the shea moisture conditioner. Neither have really helped a ton, and now I have both acne and maid hair feels like straw, so it’s lose lose 😂\n\nPlease help 😅😅😅",
