I can no longer keep up with a normal hair routine,  Brushing my hair, applying product and diffusing all causes me too much pain now.  i had to find a better way that was easy, accessible, affordable,  and maximized the beauty i wanted.\n\ni decided to experiment and this is the routine  that created  the hair above, the hair i have wanted for literal years:\n\n dry brush and detangle (my dad helps me with this)\n\n Shampoo really well\n\n Conditioner in mid section and ends, not roots\n\n Squeeze out excess water and blot with the towel\n\n Take a curl brush with slightly damp, NOT REALLY WET, hair, brush upward against the grain of your hair from the underneath brushing up, this is done to create curl sections\n\nflip your head upside down, gently loosen your roots with your fingers so your roots are not stuck your  head, and then scrunch all the way to the root\n\nflip all your hair forward infront of your face. air dry like that, you basically have to look slightly down till its dry.\n\nonce fully dry flip upside down, fluff the roots, then spread your fingers wide, slip your fingers in the mid section of your hair, and shake. do not brush out  the curls with your hands, just shake.\n\nflip right side up, fiddle with it for i minute, fluff where you need to, and your done.\n\ni know this wont work for everyone, for some this will dry out your hair too much, but i did everything the beauty industry tells you not to do with curly hair and my hair has literally never looked better. i don't  care if this is somehow unhealthy for my hair, im simply too disabled to do more effort than this. maybe if it gets dry I'll do a night with coconut  oil to rehydrate, but this is my routine  forever  now.\n\n I wasted so many years thinking there was something wrong with me or my hair or that the way I wanted my hair wanted to look was not possible,and it was just lies. the thing that was making my hair look bad was product. my hair has always been hypersensitive  to product, even a half dollar size of mouse weighs down my hair. with nothing my hair is so soft, light, and fluffy. i have the volume i want, the definition, everything.  And I do not care if I was possibly using the wrong product and different product would help my hair more,  Like I've said I'm too disabled for a 5 step product routine these days. this routine  is what I've  needed. its perfect.\n\n Maybe you don't need 5 different $30 hair products, maybe  the issue isn't  the wrong product, its product at all. maybe with no product  but the right styling  method, you can have what you want ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯. maybe try going no product and air drying, then slowly incorporate each product to better understand your hair, idk. \n\ngood luck to all others on your curl journey. im very happy i finally  figured  this out. oh also please do not give me any advice, im content with what im doing! &lt;3 i just wanted to share this success in hopes it can help others.",

      "content": "People react negatively whenever i tell them. I'm an active person, I workout 4-5 times per week. My hair always smells nice, it's never an issue. Yet people think thats it's because I don't want to, not because it's harmful to my hair. I used to have dry and frizzy hair full of tangles until i switched my routine.\nNow once per week, usually on Sunday, i wash my hair. I use Cantu hair products, conditioner, shampoo, detangling cream, and curl activator.First I wash it with shampoo thoroughly, then apply conditioner and mascara deeply and let it rest for around 15 minutes. I rinse and then brush in the shower and detangle it thoroughly. Then I apply the curl detangling cream which is leave in, and afterwards I apply the curl activator and use the diffuser.\n\nLike I said, my hair is always smelling great, never had hygiene issues. Yet explaining this to people gets me strange reactions, which is why I dont bother much. However, all my little brothers have curly hair. My mom also has curly hair, but its very lightly curly, while my brothers have 3b hair. She washes their hair every day and it looks terrible, dry, and frizzy. I explained why it is harmful but she says i am being infected by the European mind and how its disgusting. She refuses to understand why it is not healthy for the hair, even after i explained thoroughly. Should I just take the L? Do you guys have any advice? How do you guys explain this to people? Or do you not even bother?",

Do I apply Minoxidil before or after styling?\nAny styling techniques that help wavy hair look fuller on top\nI just wanna make sure they look clean , healthy and not this bad at least .\nPlease drop any suggestion you have as it would only help me know more about my hair and styling.",

I tend to have oily scalp even when I only wash every few days, especially now that I workout regularly. \n\nWhat has worked best for definition so far has been bleaching my hair. Not sure why, but maybe damaging it helped with the texture? \n\nRoutine:\n\nRight now I use Garnier Fructis leave in conditioner and Curl Smith Hydrostyle Flexi Jelly. I either then air dry or diffuse on warm with my hair upside down, and I add a bit of oil for frizz and heat to my shaft and ends. Shampoo and conditioner is Redken Color Extend Magnetics. \n\nCurrent method for sleeping I am trying out is using a silk/satin scarf for a makeshift bonnet.

      "content": "I (24F) recently moved to Ireland from the US for grad school and this move involved a lot of changes in environment/routine that I think are negatively impacting my looks. \n\nSince I came here, my skin is worse (acne/paler/drier/less glowy) and my eyes always look tired and sunken in. This generally makes me look much older and more worn than I actually am. I’m wondering if people have any general tips to bring the light back to my eyes and face that I had before?\n\nAdditional info about what changed:\n- way less sunlight exposure (UV is always 0 here)\n- diet changes – I honestly eat higher quality food here but way less variety\n- I’m drinking less than I used to and sleeping more, but definitely could use more sleep in general\n- I changed my facial products. I use the most basic sensitive cleanser and moisturizer and home and I’m doing the same here. Have been experimenting with different products to try to reduce the acne but it hasn’t helped much\n\nI’m looking for general tips, nos super interested in expensive facial products and whatever because I’ve never used them. Are there vitamins/foods/strategies or more basic products I can use to look less tired and withering? TIA!!",

They are now mostly more thin skinned pustules that *weep* and when covered overnight or day time with patches, when lifted off, the weepy pus is right there on top. More closed comedones and blackheads. \n\nRecently got my skin barrier well established a little over a month ago after stopping tretnoin because it just did not help. Decided to go back to sunscreen, used the Nivea UV water super gel, have been battling the results ever since. yes I use an oil cleanser and then cleanse normally. Does not help. I did go and excavate the black heads and closed comedones that have also appeared on my skin post accutane that I didn’t really have before. I stopped using my daytime moisturizer which was full of dimethicone, and what would you know, the blackheads and comedones never came back even weeks later. Goodbye silicones!!! During this time I kept layering on the Vanicream daily face moisturizer to no help. Got my Black Friday Osea shipment with the water seabiotic gel, and wow even after a few days my skin was filling up even more! Full of Squalane. Goodbye Squalane I never trusted you anyways even back when I imported you from Deciem, who is now the ordinary. \nI am also sensitive to zinc oxide and niacinamide. \n\nI have the skin aqua super moisture uv gel and soon jung directors moisture sun cream on deck to risk my skin when it’s healed again on some sunscreen. Hopeful for the soon jung product. \nYou know what helps my skin? UV rays. Hate on me all you want but it drastically boosts my self esteem not to be covered in weeping acne and painful cysts. Once a week for five minutes in a bed does wonders. Yeah, I’ve had all the vitamins and had my blood work done too. Thinking about seriously giving melanatan 1 a try when my acne heals from this round. Hopefully it will prevent me from being lasered by the sun in the summer swim time if I miss putting sunscreen somewhere. \n\nProducts that meet my specs: \n\n\n- Osea Malibu advanced protection cream \nYes, the price tag is scary. I use 2-3 of these a year because of that reason and do thin layers supported by other moisturizers. The star of the show is Triheptanoin which is actually a prescription molecule when injected. The shea butter also is altered I believe to absorb better and not clog pores. \n- Osea ocean cleanser\nJust started using this, it definitely doesn’t strip the skin but I question its ability to clean. \n- Osea hylauranic body serum \nIt’s for the body, but I use it on the face. Just started. Pills badly for me regardless of what’s underneath. Stopped using it for the two below. \n- BePlain chamomile ph balanced lotion \nNew to me, really like it so far! \n- Purito sea buckthorn vital cream\nUsed this years ago, shocked it isn’t a more popular purito item. Love it, yes it is a little oily but it’s more dew like in my opinion. \n- BeautyStat Universal Microbiome Barrier Repair Purifying Cleanser\nLove this!! Cannot recommend enough \n- Anua Azelaic Acid 10 Hyaluron Redness Soothing Serum\nShockingly does not burn me or pill with other products. \n- Meadowfoam seed oil \nJust not moisturizing enough, feel like it takes hours to absorb. \n- Cucumber seed oil\nSame as above\n\n\nOn my radar: \n- RMS beauty kakadu lux cream \n- Eminence organic skin care strawberry rhubarb hylauranic hydrator \n- Embryolisse lait cream sensitive \n- Skinmedica HA5 hydra collagen water burst moisturizer \n- Herbivore phoenix oil ",

      "content": "hello! i am 22 years old, AFAB, and heres my journey in writing!\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: just because my routine worked for me, doesn’t mean itll work for everyone, please see a dermatologist if possible!\n\n\nso you might be wondering what i mean by “problematic skin”, but to put it short, i have terrible genes that are not in my favor, i have struggled with rosacea, sensitive skin, plaque psoriasis, PCOS, dry skin, hormonal acne, blackheads, medical issues, profound stress, and more.\n\n\nmy first step: CUT THE STRESS. some people say that their beauty secret was leaving their toxic environment, and i believe them. growing up i went through severe abuse, neglect, homelessness, etc. i managed to move out of my environment by a stroke of luck and have made a recovery, i have noticed my skin improve exponentially now that i have the strength to take care of myself, live in a hygienic place, and access to things i didn’t have before. this step in particular really helped with my acne and psoriasis!\n\n\nmy second step: GOING TO A DERM. while he didn’t really help me with my face (i have bodily skin issues the most), he did prescribe me spironolactone for my PCOS and hormonal acne, and it did make a difference! one i wasnt prepared for though was the change from oily/combination skin to dry skin. luckily the dermatologist i went to has little skin product mini samples in their office, i took some to take home and experiment with, being a complete amateur and unknowledgeable about skincare at the time. i tried each one, some of them burned and in my confusion i researched it and realized i had sensitive skin.\n\n\nmy third step: BEING GENTLE. so, now that i realize my skin is sensitive, what do i do? well, i need to cut the harsh products out of my routine, including makeup wipes and scented products. welp… that narrowed my variety down quite a bit. i felt kind of hopeless at this point, realizing i have to tip toe around each product i buy, i decided to ONLY buy things specifically made with sensitive skin in mind just to save time and money. also, important note to self, dont drag towels across your face, dont try and buff out the bumps and texture, dont pick your acne, or treat removing makeup like ripping your face off. be kind to your skin, dont treat it like youre trying to remove a stain, treat it like glass. just trust the process. like girl seriously its fine lol.\n\n\nmy fourth step: FINDING A CLEANSER. so, i started doing makeup around the same time i tried to figure out skincare, they kind of went hand in hand, i started out with vanicream for a long time but realized its just okay, it made my skin dry out and was difficult to remove makeup with. after some trial and errors and about a year later into experimenting with different cleansers i finally stumbled into my first cleansing balm, the instant makeup melting cleansing balm by good molecules! and now i refuse to use anything else. it’s gentle, milky, hydrating, non irritating, absolutely 0 scent, and it takes my makeup off with ease. it was an absolute score.\n\n\nmy fifth step: TREATING THE REDNESS. so this one had me stumped for the longest time because, how the hell am i supposed to treat this one on my own? well i started doing some research and ingredients to look out for and started looking for products with said ingredients and just trying them out. i also avoided anything that might flare up my rosacea, like no sun protection, dryness, irritation, etc. well, let me just be honest, most the products i got for rosacea or to reduce redness didnt do shit for me lol. except- for these two! the chlorophyll discoloration serum by cocokind and dr. jarts cicapair soothing color correcting treatment with spf 30. i swear up and down these were so worth the money. they changed my skin the MOST, so lets break it down! i apply the cocokind (cold) after cleansing, it soothes my skin and makes it smooth, poreless, and silky. then dr jart comes in afterwards, it ACTUALLY reduces my redness, soothes my skin, protects my skin with spf, moisturizes, makes my skin glowy, and even can prime my skin for makeup! after that i like to take any which one of my lip balms to make sure my lips are nice and smooth and im done!\n\n\nmy routine simplified: gently cleanse with the instant makeup melting cleansing balm by good molecules, wash off with cold water, gently pat my face dry with a clean towel, gently apply the chlorophyll discoloration serum by cocokind (while its cold), then gently apply dr. jarts cicapair soothing color correcting treatment, then apply any kind of hydrating lip product i can reach for and boom! im done :)\n\n\nthank you all so much for taking the time to read! i have never been happier with my skin than i am now!",

As shown in the second pic, my skin was CLEAR in Feb 2025. I never had acne issues growing up and only ever had breakouts if I was really stressed, but it was never a monthslong issue.\n\nI believe what really helped me was 15% Azelaic Acid and Aklief (a retinoid), which I was prescribed both at the end of July. It was August/September that I really saw progress and healing. Up to that point, I was on antibiotics for months (doxycycline and minocycline - neither helped) and my face was dry, irritated, felt like it was always burning and just uncomfortable. Literally no idea why my skin broke out like that and was a problem majority of the year, but I am very thankful the topicals helped.\n\nJust wanted to share since I was on here nonstop looking for someone who had similar issues for advice and similar stories for hope and whatnot.\n\nMy routine now focuses on dealing with the hyperpigmentation and scarring left behind from the months of breakouts and inflammation, but very happy with the results!!",

I went to see a dermatologist and he told me to use aquaphor, and if that doesn’t work, he prescribed me elidel(it burned so badly for two days afterwards so I stopped using it. It’s also very drying). I tried the cerave eye cream but it wasn’t doing anything to help, and the aquaphor seems to only help my eye area if I have it on, but it’s also so greasy!\n\nSecond and third pictures: under my nose area, smile lines,  chin area,  it gets very itchy, patchy and scaly. The dermatologist recommended hydrocortisone but I’ve been using it and it hasn’t been helping either.\n\nI feel like I destroyed my skin barrier being too greedy with the retinol. My skin was really nice before but I was obsessed with getting rid of fine lines and wrinkles 😭.\n\nPlease help! I don’t know what I can do. I’ve been slathering aquaphor on my face like a crazy person but it’s been about two months and nothing has changed 😭😭😭",
