I work in an office and it’s so humiliating to see myself around 2pm and realize that the bottom half of my face has been flaking off for who knows how long. My routine in the AM is la roche posay gentle foaming cleansing oil, skin1004 Centella ampoule, Dr. Jart Hydro Plump Water Cream, and Mixsoon Bean Sunscreen. In the PM it is the same cleanser, skin 1004 centella ampoule, skin 1004 pro bio cica intensive ampoule, and the dr. Jart ceramidin cream.

      "content": "I’m new to Reddit so apologies in advance \n\nBasically what the title says. I have curly hair and every time I blow it out straight (I use the revlon brush) it reverts to curly pretty soon after. The same thing happens when I get it done at a hair salon. Doesn’t matter about humidity/rain etc, it will curl back up when I’m just in my room.\n\nI’ve tried the WOW Dreamcoat, different hair mousses and other humidity protectants but none have helped. My hair doesn’t get frizzy, it just curls. This doesn’t happen as quickly when I use a straightener but using an iron always makes my hair look stiff and dry. I’ve tried using the iron after the revlon brush but unless I straighten my whole head the same thing happens.\n\nHas anyone had this problem before and have any advice on how I could keep my blowouts straight??",

Stress also caused it to thin, and when I tried to rehabilitate it by getting faux locs, my braider did them so tightly that a bunch of hair was ripped out.\n\nI used to straighten my hair weekly because I preferred it straight rather than curly—hence the heat damage. Some parts of my hair are now straighter than others. I’ve never been good at taking care of curly hair because I was so used to wearing it straight, but now I’m trying to learn how to wear it natural. It’s been really overwhelming because there are so many sources saying to use this or that, and to do this or that, and I feel like whatever I’m doing clearly isn’t working because my hair looks like shit, lol.\n\nIt’s one of my biggest insecurities. These are pictures of my hair after I got a big chop; I went to a hairdresser to cut off any heat-damaged parts. Does anyone have advice for products I could use, protective hairstyles, or whether I should cut more of my hair? Anything would help—thank you.\n\nMy routine..\n\nAs I am Bond Shampoo and condition. I shampoo and condition my hair every Sunday. My hair dresser told me that shampooing and conditioning is not a daily thing, if this is wrong please feel free to let me know.\n\nAfter my shower, I detangle my hair and put in a leave in conditioner from Mielle, I then twist my hair and put it in a bonnet. My routine is lack luster and shouts “I don’t know what I’m doing”.",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
