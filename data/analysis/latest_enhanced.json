We have great conversations, she sometimes gives me free trims, and I’ve recommended her to a lot of people (I’ve brought her multiple new clients). I was also one of her first regulars after she graduated cosmetology school, so we’ve kind of grown together.\n\nHere’s where I’m struggling.\n\nIn my area, there aren’t many hairstylists, especially blonding specialists. Recently, I’ve been low-key stalking the Instagram of another stylist. the girl who works at the chair behind hers. I LOVE her work. She focuses heavily on hair health and does the exact style I’m looking for.\n\nSome of the issues I’ve had with my current stylist:\n\t•\tShe bleaches over already bleached hair\n\t•\tMy balayage isn’t blended the way I like\n\t•\tMy inspo photos never really turn out how I want\n\t•\tI’m worried about long-term hair health\n\nI’ve tried to trust the process, but after two years, I still don’t feel like I’m getting the blonde I want.\n\nThe hard part is the emotional side. She calls me one of her favorite clients, we genuinely get along, and I feel bad because she’s been generous with me and I’ve supported her business from the start.\n\nBut at the same time… I’m spending a lot of money on my hair and I don’t love the results. The other stylist’s work aligns perfectly with what I want, especially her focus on keeping hair healthy.\n\nSo now I’m stuck between loyalty/guilt and doing what’s best for my hair.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Either way I plan on asking for a revision. \n\n  \nI have previously gotten a partial balayage from this person before and they did great. I have never gotten a full balayage or highlights, just partials, on my current hair. I decided I wanted to have a more dramatic hair lightening experience so I opted for a full this time. I didn’t show them a photo but I previously had pretty bright highlights so it seemed obvious to me that that’s what I am into. The hair dresser suggested I do some low lights with the balayage to add back in some more definition, which I happily agreed to. Then he asked me if I wanted him to “bring it all the way to the ends or not“ which he suggested not to do because it would be “too streaky.” I was hesitant but agreed, and I thought we were still talking about the low lights only. Then he got to work. \n\n  \nPhoto 1-3 is my hair after, 4 is before, and 5 is what I expected. What should I say? Is this my fault somehow? ",

Honestly, I've always been clueless about my curly/wavy hair and no one to ever ask tbh.\n\nMost conditioners usually weigh down my hair a lot and I struggle with finding hair products that I'm not allergic to.\n\nFor a year my hair routine worked great until my hair started shedding like a dog, I was mortified because it came out of no where! I have kept the same gel and mousse but my new shampoo/conditioner is super drying. I tried to soak my ends in coconut oil but it was like it just vanished in my frizz.\n\nI was using volumizing shampoo and conditioner from Native (yikes, I know, but I swear it was working) Now I'm using Maui Moisture lightweight shampoo/conditioner. (Waaaay to drying.)\n\nThen I finger comb and squeeze curl mousse and gel from Herbal Essences and air dry.\nI wash my hair twice a week and use Eva Nye freshen up dry shampoo maybe once a week when my roots get a little greasy.\nI also only use satin pillow cases. A little note to make, I have two lock of hair I usually keep braided like rat tails, but they're usually two big ringlets. Rn they're so dry and frizzy though.\n\nNow, here's my problem. I have A LOT of allergies. I cant have any sort of proteins like soy or nuts, nor gluten or eggs. I know that's definitely hard when looking for good curly products.\n\nSince I have my two little \"padawan\" braids, my hair is at two different lengths unstyled. I knowwwww it looks pathetic right now trust me, taking a picture of the back of my head felt like a JUMPSCARE 😆🤡 The first picture was my curls at their peak even while using Native at the time. Legit any advice helps thank youuuu!",

I’m newer to being in LA while caring for my curls and I don’t trust a lot of “curl specialists” because wavy hair is kinda fragile and I’ve been burned in the past. Im overdue for a cut, and a fitting hair style is harder to find when there isn’t an existing one. Not looking for that same shag style cut everyone’s pushing for with coils hair because that doesn’t feel like me and I want to be able to do different styles. \n\nWash Routine: detox with Christophe Robin sea salt exfoliating scrub, shampoo with Curlsmith moisture cleanser, and then condition with Authentic Beauty Concept hydrating conditioner (gel like consistency, ran out of Curlsmith). I did squish to condish (scrunch with conditioner) and then tied it up in a bun to finish washing and shaving and then rinse. \n\nStyle/Dry Routine: After showering I brushed and then used Curlsmith hold me softly hair cream and then Curlsmith frizz rescue curl retainer gel and let air dry with some clips in. This is just scrunching in after brushing and no brush styling (trying to only brush style for holidays/special occasions). Still has a cast because I will use oil and scrunch out tomorrow using pineapple and a bonnet. \n\nWhat are you wavy ladies doing to find your wavy/textured stylist and haircut? Do you have any recommendations for someone who can find a style to accentuate your face structure / style? ",

      "content": "Hello, my name is Suzi and i have curly hair. I've been trying to grow my hair long for 3 years, and i was successful at first. My hair was healthy, thick and had beautiful bouncy curls. It was going well... but then 1 year ago it started to get really thin. The ends were a disaster and i was losing so much hair. I was also trying to lose weight and plus i was a vegeterian(still am). I was eating less than i was supposed to but i wasn't aware of it. So i think this was the number one reason why my hair got weak. I went to the doctor and she gave me hair lotions but i wasn't able to use them regularly... i also have iron deficieny anemia so she also said to take my pills regularly. At first i did but i haven't been using them for the last 4 months. I know i am irresponsible but i want to fix this. Last month i cut my hair below my shoulders. I did a terrible haircut btw. Now it feels even lesser than i already had and my curl pattern is not like how it used to be. I really want to have long hair but with the way my hair is right now, i don't think it will look good. Everyday i look at my hair and i swear it looks so bad. The haircut, the length, my curls... everything. I am thinking of getting a haircut above my shoulders maybe? But i know that it will effect me terribly. For that reason i am very scared. I'm hoping maybe it will look better but i really don't know. Please help me, what should i do?😓\n\nMy current routine is; curl cream, styling, mousse, gel. I stopped diffusing my hair i let it air dry.",

My hair is cut evenly so it’s not a haircut issue either and I have even tried compensating by cutting the sides shorter than the middle but it always ends up like this when it grows a little and i don’t wanna keep cutting my hair short forever because of this.

      "content": "26M | Oily Skin | Routine Review + Barrier Safety, Retinol &amp; Product Suggestions\n\nHi everyone,  \n  \nI’m a 26-year-old male with oily skin and wanted some help reviewing my current skincare and hair care routine. I feel I might be overdoing certain actives, and I’m also noticing slight darkening on my forehead, possibly due to regular hair oiling. I’d really appreciate feedback and suggestions.\n\n# Current Skincare Routine\n\nFace Wash:\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid + LHA Cleanser – 2 times a day\n\nSerum:\n\n* The Derma Co 2% Kojic Acid Serum – morning &amp; night after cleansing\n\nMoisturizer:\n\n* Minimalist Vitamin B5 10% Moisturizer\n* Re’equil Ceramide &amp; Hyaluronic Acid (alternate) (Currently not using)\n\nSunscreen:\n\n* Aqualogica Glow+ Dewy Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ – morning and when stepping out\n\nWeekly Exfoliation:\n\n* The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution – 2x a week (Monday &amp; Friday)\n\nLips:\n\n* Vaseline Lip Balm\n\nBody Care:\n\n* 1% Salicylic Acid Body Wash – daily\n\n# Hair Care Routine\n\n* Shampoo: Arata Super Shampoo – 2x a week\n* Hair Oil: Rosemary + Lavender Hair Oil – used regularly after hair wash\n\nI don’t have hair fall issues, but I feel frequent oiling may be causing product buildup and contributing to forehead darkening or clogged pores near the hairline.\n\n# What I Need Help With\n\n1. Barrier-safe routine: I often see the term barrier-safe here.\n   * What does it actually mean?\n   * Am I overusing actives like salicylic acid, kojic acid, or chemical exfoliation?\n   * What are early signs of a damaged skin barrier in oily skin?\n2. Retinol guidance: I’ve never used retinol before.\n   * Should I add retinol at my age and skin type?\n   * What beginner strength should I start with?\n   * How many times a week is safe initially?\n   * Do I need to stop or reduce other actives if I introduce retinol?\n3. Sunscreen recommendations: I’ve seen many sunscreen suggestions in this sub.\n   * Is my current sunscreen okay for oily skin or should I switch to something more matte/oil-control?\n   * What should I look for in a good sunscreen (PA rating, filters, texture)?\n   * Is sunscreen necessary indoors?\n4. Snail mucin &amp; hydration products: I keep seeing snail mucin and barrier-repair products mentioned.\n   * What does snail mucin actually help with?\n   * Is it suitable for oily skin?\n   * Can it be used alongside actives like retinol or exfoliants?\n5. Hair oil &amp; forehead pigmentation:\n   * Should I reduce oiling frequency or change the oil type?\n   * Any tips to prevent oil-related pigmentation or breakouts near the hairline?\n\nMy goal is to build a simple, long-term, barrier-safe routine rather than using too many actives.  \n  \nThanks in advance, would really appreciate your guidance.",

I have what I think is 3b/3c hair (pls feel free to kindly correct me) It’s cold in Canada and my curls are suffering as a result, to give you an idea my curls are “flash drying” as in by the time I step out of the shower after washing my hair it’s like 70% dry already. Curls are losing shine and definition very quickly and I feel that my current shampoo and conditioner AG boost and balance is not hydrating enough. I do suffer from anemia which I am treating and my hair is also color treated but it’s so much worse than usual idk what to do. Im struggling to find a good duo as so many curl products have coconut oil which irritates my scalp. I’m looking for any shampoo/conditioner duo for hydration that is coconut oil free. Any price point and it doesn’t need to be a strictly curly hair shampoo. Also if you see anything in my routine that looks off let me know as I’m always wanting to hear feedback. Maybe it’s not even the shampoo and something else? Thank you! \n\nROUTINE\n\nDouble Shampoo 2x week with AG balance and condition with AG boost for one of these washes, deep condition with AG moisture mask the other. \n\nUse light amount of lush super milk for moisture on soaking wet hair then follow with either Amika curl leave in cream or fenty leave in cream. Scrunch a small amount of amika curl gel into ends. Let air dry or lightly diffuse if no time. **OCCASIONALLY** use fable and mane hair and scalp oil to break cast ",

      "content": "I just tried a bath bomb for the first time, and honestly, I didn’t realize baths could feel this indulgent. I chose a bath bomb with an amazing floral scent and a hint of vanilla. It fizzed beautifully in the water. I poured the water, let the bath bomb drop in, and settled down with a cozy towel nearby. The water changed color in a fun way, and I started feeling relaxed almost immediately.\n\nIt was the first time I noticed how little I’d been taking care of myself. My muscles relaxed, my mind slowed, and I actually had a few quiet minutes to just breathe. I ended up drifting in and out of dozing, realizing I’d been more tired than I thought.\n\nLooking online, I saw some fun designs on Alibaba and other marketplaces, mostly to see what kind of ingredients or colors were popular. Local shops also had small artisanal options that looked so cute I almost didn’t want to use them.\n\nI can’t believe I missed this for so long. I’ll definitely be adding bath bombs to my self-care routine. It feels simple, but the impact on your mood is huge, and it’s such a fun way to treat yourself.\n\n",
