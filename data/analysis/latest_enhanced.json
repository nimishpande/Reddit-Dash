      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Help! Hi guys! This is going to be a long post but I need some help. So about a few years ago, whenever I got out of the shower and let my hair air dry, my hair would always get wavy and poofy and frizzy instead of staying straight. But I ignored that for years and kept treating my hair like it was straight, even straightening it regularly because I liked the sleek look.\n\nAbout two years ago, I discovered curly hair and wavy hair routines, so I tried some products and they worked really well. But the routine felt like too much of a hassle, so I went back to straightening.I also got keratin done in 2022. My hair was so damaged before thankfully I have recovered from that.\n\nRecently, I decided I want to wear my hair natural again, so I've been experimenting with different products. I also have high porosity hair now because I bleached it a few months ago, but I still don't feel like l've found the right routine.\n\nRight now, my curl routine is I use the Ouai Detox Shampoo and then the purple Pureology shampoo. I don't use a regular conditioner just deep conditioning masks. I rotate between the Fino mask, the Gisou mask, and the Amika Intense Bond Repair mask. After the shower, I dry my hair with a microfiber towel. For styling, curl creams weigh my hair down, so I stick to a lightweight leave in (the Pureology one works well for me).\n\nThen I use a mousse (either Umberto Giannini Curl Foam or Curlsmith Invincible Mousse) and a strong hold gel (Aveda Curl Enhancer Gel gives me a good cast). Sometimes I also use Curlsmith In-Shower Style Fixer. I either plop with a T-shirt or scrunch out excess water and diffuse on low speed/ medium heat. Hover and then cup diffuse.\n\nAt first, I get a great cast with really pretty waves and some spirals, but once I scrunch out the crunch, I end up with straight pieces and lose a lot of definition. The next day is even worse, even though I pineapple and sleep with a bonnet. It's honestly getting really demotivating.\n\nI also feel like I get all the volume at the bottom and my roots are flat I wanna get rid of the triangle. What type of haircut should I get to get rid of the triangle? Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong or what I should change? I get actual ringlets underneath my hair, so l'm not sure where I fall on the curl spectrum. And is curl training even a real thing? If so, how do you actually do it? Any advice would really help. Also all these pictures are recent except the last one its from 2023 when I first tried a curly routine! :)",

I am a black girl with I'd say 3c hair.\n\n  \nI know the obvious answer is to seek out a professional, but I can't do that just yet because of money. and in order to get money, I need to get back to work. in order to get back to work, I need my hair done... never ending loop\n\n  \nthe restaurant I work at is *very* strict on attire, we wear black, collared button-ups, dress pants, and absolutely no accessories are permitted. *including* the usual black bandana I wear to keep frizz down.\n\n  \nI guess my question is, what are some ideas I could do in the meantime to show up appropriately for work? I need a head wrapping or scarf to cover my damage, and the only covering I could think of that would be *acceptable* is a religious head covering, such as a hijab or Christian head scarf. but I'm not Muslim, nor Christian anymore, so I'm kind of at a loss here.\n\n  \nany and all help/suggestions are beyond appreciated, I just don't know what to do anymore and I need to get back to work. thank you all in advance &lt;3",

After looking into this, I realized what I have looks a lot more like breakage and split ends instead of just frizz, even though i’m concerned i have breakage and both frizz together. I also struggle with yellow dandruff, which is dandruff but oily and clumpy, usually sticking to the skin (i believe, correct me if i’m wrong please). Does anyone know how to fix these issues? And how often should I wash my hair? I’m thinking of dying my hair and getting my front strands blonde and getting raccoon stripes in one section too, so if anyone has any hair dye care tips for this it’d be greatly appreciated. I’ve had my hair dyed black before but that was all of my hair and not a section, not to mention this will be my first time bleaching.

Plus it looks better with long hair in braids than short hair. \n\nI’ve been in and out of hospital recently and been on bed rest for almost a month. Which means my hair has been getting more matted than usual. I can’t shower at the moment due to my surgical site and fatigue. I’ve had my sister wash it for me this past weekend but it caused a lot of pain from the way I had to sit. I have my hair in Dutch/french braids all the time to keep it less matted and out of my face. It has still been getting super matted. \n\nI have thick long 2a to 3a. It doesn’t soak with water without having product through it first. My normal routine in general is shampoo, conditioner, olaplaex bonding oil, argan oil, leave in conditioner, curl definer. Then gets brushed and braid while wet. Sometimes had gel and hairspray to keep the braids intact for longer. \n\nWhen I can’t wash my hair, I use a detangler that’s a cheap kids (which doesn’t work as well as it should), water and sometimes more argan oil to loosen the knots. But lately nothing is helping and my hair breaks and the knots come out in clumps. It needs to not be too thick of a mixture and can be in my hair for 5 plus days after. I’ve been going about two weeks between washes at the moment. (Please don’t judge, plus my scalp is dealing with it a lot better than expected.) \n",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Hi, I bought some new skincare products because I ran out of my old ones, which weren't very effective, but I think I've (finally) figured out my skin type.\n\nI have **combination skin** that's **dehydrated** and either **sensitive or reactive** (are they the same thing?). For example, sometimes the way I apply my products, too aggressively, or simply certain products can cause me to develop small red patches that fade fairly quickly. Also, when I exfoliate my skin (chemical exfoliation), it stings a lot, but I think that's pretty normal.\n\nI wanted to know if my skincare routine was suitable (I hope so, since I just bought most of these products, LOL), but *I also wanted to know what (might) be missing from my skincare routine.*\n\nFor example, I wanted to know if **Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water is a toner or simply a hydration booster**? If not, what toner would you recommend?\n\nSecondly, **does the SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule act as a serum, or is it just a simple hydration booster?** If not, what serum would you recommend? I sometimes get a few pimples and used to take niacinamide in the past.\n\nHere is my skincare routine at the moment:\n\n**Cleansing Oil :** Erborian Centella Cleansing Oil *(only in the evening?)*\n\n**Cleanser :** Beauty of Joseon Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser (AM and PM)\n\n**Hydratation booster (also Toner?) :** Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water\n\n**Toner :** None\n\n**Hydratation booster (also Serum?) :** SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n\n**Serum :** None\n\n**Moisturizer :** La Roche-Posay EFFACLAR K(+)\n\n**SPF :** Glossier Invisible Shield 50 *or* Eucerin Sun Face Oil Control 50\n\nThank you very much for your feedback!",

For example, sometimes the way I apply my products, too aggressively, or simply certain products can cause me to develop small red patches that fade fairly quickly. Also, when I exfoliate my skin (chemical exfoliation), it stings a lot, but I think that's pretty normal.\n\nI wanted to know if my skincare routine was suitable (I hope so, since I just bought most of these products, LOL), but *I also wanted to know what (might) be missing from my skincare routine.*\n\nFor example, I wanted to know if **Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water is a toner or simply a hydration booster**? If not, what toner would you recommend?\n\nSecondly, **does the SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule act as a serum, or is it just a simple hydration booster?** If not, what serum would you recommend? I sometimes get a few pimples and used to take niacinamide in the past.\n\nHere is my skincare routine at the moment:\n\n**Cleansing Oil :** Erborian Centella Cleansing Oil *(only in the evening?)*\n\n**Cleanser :** Beauty of Joseon Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser (AM and PM)\n\n**Hydratation booster (also Toner?) :** Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water\n\n**Toner :** None\n\n**Hydratation booster (also Serum?) :** SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n\n**Serum :** None\n\n**Moisturizer :** La Roche-Posay EFFACLAR K(+)\n\n**SPF :** Glossier Invisible Shield 50 *or* Eucerin Sun Face Oil Control 50\n\nThank you very much for your feedback!",
