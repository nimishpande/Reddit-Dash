Then after I rinse it I out I put about a dime worth of the conditioner in my hand and wash my ends. Then after rinsing it out and wringing out excess moisture with my devacurl towel I take a palm full of Garnier Fructis  voluminizing mousse and scrunch it through out my hair . Then take a small amount of my Marc Anthony strictly curls curl defining lotion and apply it through out my hair. I do my best to not touch my hair so I put it in a head band. When its 80 percent dry I use my Revlon hair dryer with diffuser and dry my hair. ",

      "content": "Has anyone else noticed that homeless men are almost always rocking dense hair with immaculate hairlines? I'm talking NW0, dense temples, zero diffuse thinning. There's clearly something we've been missing. Are they NW0 because they're homeless or are they homeless because they're NW0?\n\nSo here is the new hypothesis:   \nNo mirrors, no grooming routines, no showers, no job. only eating what you'd usually throw away\n\nThe theory is simple: hair follicles thrive when you completely abandon self-awareness and aesthetic concern. Stress, mirrors, and microneedling are the opponent. Let your scalp believe it’s safe, and your temples may just follow suit.\n\nAnother benefit is that since you grow out your hair, no one will think you're balding.\n\nI’ve always dressed business casual, shaved regularly, emphasized looking clean and put together. But for the past month or so, I had mental health struggles because of seasonal deprecion so I decided to let go. I stopped shaving, started wearing old looser street wear clothes, and stopped pretending. I look homeless. Still no regrowth, thickening or improved temples. Probably because I didn't fully commit. I still had a job, took showers and ate healthy. I didn't embrace homelessness. However, in a development I can’t scientifically explain, two alt girls hit on me during this period, which is statistically significant given my historical baseline of 0 alt girls hitting on me. Further study is needed.\n\nThis is purely theoretical but the evidence from observations is… compelling.\n\nThoughts? Has any one of you ever been homeless and if so, did you notice any regrowth?",

I also got advice to get a specific hair brush to try and clump my hair into bigger chunks so as not to leave it stringy, but it still turned out like this.\n\nI use not your mother’s curl tall shampoo, conditioner, and curling cream, and Garnier Fructis gel just to build up a cast. I partially diffused it on a cool setting then let it air dry. I then scrunched it again with a light hair oil to brake out the cast.\n\nAny advice on how to get those bigger clumps?

My hair is currently longer and well-defined, but the length makes it heavy and it tends to fall into my face, which I don’t like.\n\nI’m thinking of going shorter (around jaw-length) with a rounded, voluminous shape more of a curly halo / cloud silhouette rather than layers that hang down.\n\nWhat I’m aiming for:\n\n\t•\tNo bangs or fringe\n\n\t•\tMinimal hair on my forehead or eyes\n\n\t•\tAs much volume as possible all around (especially at the crown)\n\n\t•\tA bold, intentional shape rather than a shag or wolf cut\n\n\t•\tI’m okay with big hair I actually prefer volume\n\nFor context, I’ve had short curly hair in the past, but that was before I followed any curly routine (no conditioner, no styling products), so it fell forward a lot and looked messy. Now my curls are much more defined and controlled, so I’m wondering if the same length would behave very differently.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\t•\tDoes a short, rounded, high-volume cut work well for 2C-3A curls?\n\n\t•\tWhat length range keeps the shape full without hair falling into the face?\n\n\t•\tAny red flags or specific instructions I should give my stylist?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone with similar curl types or experience with shorter curly cuts. Thanks!\n\nRoutine : Cantu cleansing shampoo, cantu shea butter conditioner, cantu curl activator cream, brushing with bounce curl volume define brush, scrunch and then diffuse ",

Now that I'm using multiple products I’m confused about one thing.\n\nI’ve seen from multiple places that serums should be patted in until mostly absorbed by the skin. Moisturiser is the one of the final steps so my question is how to do I “lock in moisture” when I have to wait until my skin absorbs serum and by that point my face is dried out? Is it fine to spray with water after the serum is absorbed and then apply my moisturiser? Or would that ruin the serum’s effects. For reference I use the Eucerin DERMOPURE CLINICAL Correcting Cleanser, Eucerin DERMOPURE CLINICAL Purifying Toner, The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% along with Cetaphil Moisturising Lotion in that order.",

The truth is, the person I was two years ago would've sold a kidney just to know what clear skin felt like.\n\nWhile we all have our own victories, this one is mine. My skin may not be the clearest or the most poreless, but it is more than I ever dreamed of having.\n\nAnyway, here are some things that cleared my skin. Please do have your skin checked by a dermatologist. \n\n• Tretinoin (0.025%)\n• Hydroquinone (2%)\n• Clindamycin (1%)\n\nI did start on lower doses a couple months ago, but these are my doses now. I apply all of these every night and layer on a thick layer of moisturizer especially around my nose and on my chin. Hope this helps, and I'll answer any other questions too! ",

Your skin needs its good bacteria and barrier intact to actually behave.
