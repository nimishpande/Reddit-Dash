He has brought a few things to add to the pile too.\n\nBut he has zero knowledge on what he is using. I keep explaining it to him. Pointing out precautions and what doesnt mix as he applies. I have sat him down and tried to give him his own routine. \n\nBut I dont think he quite understands that its actually doing something to his face. He has been using acids and peels and zero spf (he isnt white so he thinks he doesnt need it). I have a strong peeling treatment that I have hidden away as I know he will put it on his face morning and evening if he gets his hands on it.\n\nAnd it has finally happened. His relatively clear skin has almost overnight developed severe acne. My pristine white pillows. They are covered in dots of blood. \n\nHe is absolutely distraught.

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I also use EltaMD UV Clear Sunscreen in the daytime after I put on my Vanicream.\n\nI would deeply appreciate any tips or recommendations if I should change my routine or try something else.",

Our current routine is using the marc anthony aragan oil  shampoo and conditioner, but that's it. We don't use anything after, and we usually airdry our hair. Our hair turns out frizzy and not that nice, mostly my sister though. My sister has higher porosity hair and i have a lower porosity. My sister has also undergone keratine before. This is our first time trying out hair products and we really want it to  go well. Also a bonnet isn't in our current budget and also no store close to us has one so if this brand is good, does anyone know how to preserve the curls overnigth? Also i have like 2b/c hair and my sister has like 3a hair. We both have thick hair, my sister's is thicker and both our hair is dry. Any review is good and apriciayex!\n\nEdit: My sister has low porosity hair.

Years of shaving and tweezing have left my legs uneven, rough, and unsightly(specifically my knees and back of legs). I am in the process of saving up for laser hair removal, however, until then I'd greatly appreciate any advice I can get. This is about a week after shaving, but even without shaving my skin looks this messed up. I've been dry brushing every other day and using Amlactin lotion(in the green bottle), but inconsistently because I don't like the smell. Do you have any recommendations to help my legs look better. I bought ingrown hair pads recently from first aid beauty and was hoping to use them to help, but I'm not sure where they would go in my routine or what my routine should be? Honestly, any advice will be better than what I have going on right now. Thank you so much in advance.\n\n\n",

      "title": "My hair keeps getting knotted and tangled!",
      "content": "(also posted on r/longhair but I thought id seek help from my people too)  \n  \nHai everybody, I've been having these struggles with knots/tangles and really need help, let me explain my situation and routine.\n\nI've had issues with my hair being too dry for a while, something which I only realized 2 months ago wen I posted. My hair was dry, and would get tangled/knotted, but not as much as it does now. But the dryness was bad, so I followed advice and got some good hair products and changed my routine. But now I am having this issue, my hair is getting knotted and tangled more often and more severely than ever before. Some days or weeks its pretty manageable, and other times I have days where I have so much HEALTHY hair just DYING because of these tangles and its killing me.\n\nMy hair is still susceptible to dryness, but when I use my products, I never deal with it, but then my hair gets tangled more. And so like yesterday, its a no win situation, either my hair is really dry but not super tangled, or I use products and my hair isnt dry but gets super tangled, sometimes knots at the ends, sometimes lots of tangles at the root, if its bad then usually alot of both.\n\nI heard that using more hair products can make the hairs stick together from the proteins? But Im also not sure what to do because if I use less, then my hair is dry, and I don't even use that much. Here is my average routine:\n\nShampoo: About every 7 days when my hair gets a bit oily (this time culminating in this was 10 days because my hair was dryer than usual). On shampoo days, I use my deep conditioner, argan oil, and leave-in conditioners.\n\nCon Wash: On other hair wash days (usually every other day, sometimes multiple days in a row, or 2 days between), I wash just with my normal conditioner (no shampoo, no deep conditioner), and apply my leave-in conditioners.\n\nDrying: I use a towel to pat at my ha rand 'engulf' it? No aggressive rubbing or anything like that, mostly just patting and whatnot to get it damp or semi-damp so I can use my products, and then airdry from there. \n\nMorning: When I do my morning routine, a good bit after I wake up, I comb through my hair with my fingers (I find it better on my scalp and gentler in defeating knots then using combs). I used to do this dry, but learned it was better to do this wet, so I would use some water to dampen my hair and some leave-in conditioner (not very much) and go through, and usually this would be fine.\n\nLater in the day/night I may randomly comb my hair with my fingers (nervous/nothing to do with my hands) and get rid of any knots that would form, but usually not that many.\n\nHowever sometimes, on some weeks and days, I'm dealing with a hair apocalypse. Constant tangles like yesterday. I tried combing with ONLY water to dampen my hair and coat my fingers, no products so I didnt overuse and cause the protein thing. Hair got dried out and tangled within hours. Okay, so I use a little bit of products so my hair isnt dried and tangled. Still dried out and tangled, so I use more. Okay, now my hair has moisture, but within a few hours, it gets even worsely tangled and knotted, producing absolute units like the big one in image 2/3.\n\nUsually, I deal with knots at the ends of my hair. But during these times (the past few days), its all over, ends, roots, middles, and I'm not sure what to do.\n\nProducts (images provided of all):  \nShampoo &amp; Conditioner: Garnier Fructis Curl Nourish  \nLeave-in Conditioners: Cantu Conditioning Cream (for curls), Marc Antony Strictly Curls  \nDeep Conditioner: Eva NYC Deep Conditioning Hair Mask  \nOil: 100% Argan oil (from Handcraft Blends but it doesnt really matter what brand since its the exact same)\n\nSomething else is that whenever I use my deep conditioner + everything else, my hair gets super knotted/tangled that day or especially the next day. Is that because im using deep conditioner and leave-in conditioner? Should I shampoo my hair and then use deep conditioner like I have been, so the shampooing doesnt kill my hair and leave it dry? Or shampoo the day after when my hair inevitably tangled, or is the shampoo/deep conditioner a good combo and I just shouldnt use much/any leave in conditioner?\n\nThe other day, I even broke my normal routine of deep conditioning after my shampoo, in fear it would just make things with the knots worse, and in hope that it would end the horrific cycle of maybe the cause being the proteins sticking my hair together? But it did not help, and only made my hair dryer (10 days since the last shampoo btw), prolly cuz I needed to deep condition after shampooing instead of normal conditioner, but it did not help with armageddon at all.\n\nOf course, the main question, is wtf do I do to stop these tangles and knots, both the normal mild but annoying amounts from everyday, and whatever apocalyptic event has been causing these?\n\nThank you for your help!",

      "content": "Hello curly-headed people! I’m new to the curly-hair scene and I’m looking for advice. A couple years ago I discovered that I had 2B/2C waves. When i discovered this my hair was significantly shorter, just past my chin, and so I started using products to help manage my hair and promote my waves. My routine has pretty much stayed the same, but i’ll go into more depth below. I’m looking for advice to help promote my wavy hair. As it has grown out i’ve noticed that the longer it gets the harder it is for my curls to form/stay in place without being stretched out, and I find a lot of products either don’t provide enough hold for my hair and it ends up frizzy, or my hair is weighed down and my roots look super flat. Below is my routine:\n\nFor wash day (3x a week bc my scalp gets greasy) I use Pantene smooth and sleek shampoo &amp; conditioner, then rinse and brush in the shower. Then I use NotYourMothers curl cream (rake and scrunch in while still dripping) followed up by the Herbal Essences Mousse (the one in the purple can, raked and scrunched in), and then follow it up with the L.A. looks extreme sport gel (raked and then scrunched in, used liberally). I tend to put one of those root volumizing clips at my roots for more volume, and then I either diffuse or air dry, letting the cast dry and then scrunching out with 100% jojoba oil. The problem I’ve run into is that my hair looks less and less defined as it’s gotten longer, and I’m not sure if it is the products weighing it down or just the weight of my hair itself. Also, diffusing tends to make my hair look very curly, but after 10 minutes all the curls tend to stretch out before give even broken the gel cast. Any tips?\n\nEdit: I don’t tend to plop my hair or move it around much while it’s drying, as it tends to make my hair frizzy and I lose my part really easy. I have to break up the cast in order to get my part back.",

Thank you in advance for all your help!!\n\nMy skincare journey started with moderate but stubborn acne which reacted to dust, dairy, nightshade plants— you name it!!!\nI tried switching up products, but what really helped was isotretin prescribed by my dermatologist.\n\nComing to my moisturizer issues, I have tried multiple moisturizers, but just about everything breaks me out.\n\nThe ones I have tried:\n1) Mary and May Idebenone Moisturizer \n2) Soon Jung Etude House 10 Free Emulsion\n3) Sebamed Clear Gel (possibly the citric acid in it)\n4) Isntree Tea Tree \n5) Beplain Cicaful Calming Gel\n6) Sidmool 100 Honey Moisture\n7) Neutrogena 72 Hours Moisturizer \n8) Clinique moisture surge\n9) Purito oat in calming gel cream\n\nOther things which broke me out-\n1) TO alpha arbutin but Cos de Baha arbutin didn’t— just to cross out ingredients\n2) Numbuzin number 5+\n\n\nThings that don’t break me out- \n1) Iunik beta glucan serum \n2) Cosrx full fit propolis ampoule\n3) plain old glycerine \n4) Purito Daily soft touch sunscreen\n5) Cosrx snail mucin (not sure about this one)\n6) skin1004 Centella ampoule\n\nI was hoping to find a decent moisturizer to help my skin restore its barrier given I have to use tretinoin and azelaic acid every day. \nI have been using tretinoin for about 3 years now. I started off with 0.5 but recently realized that my skin doesn’t handle it especially when I am using azelaic acid along with it, so I moved to 0.025%. While this has helped keep those skin flakes at bay, my skin still feels dry and I have mild acne/texture all over my face. \nI’m open to recommendations for moisturizers, ampoules, or in-office treatment.\n\n\nThank you!!\n",
