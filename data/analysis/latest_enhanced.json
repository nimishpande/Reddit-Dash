      "content": "I just got my first curly hair cut experience. I’ve worn my hair curly for years but haven’t actually gotten a cut specifically for curls.  It was a salon that specifically does curly hair and I was sent home feeling like my hair wasn’t actually finished or done well. \n\nFirst she cut off like 5” instead of 2-3” like we had agreed upon. Then told me I needed to switch to a side part when I specifically said I’d like to keep my center part. It still had the gel cast when I left and wasn’t shook out so I couldn’t actually tell at the salon if I liked the cut or not. The stylist told me not to touch it till I got home so the style could set. In all of this I was skeptical, but thought, “Hey, she is the professional so maybe she knows something I don’t. Let’s see what happens.” Not even my bangs were curly when I left, everything was so flat. (Pic 1)\n\nI bring more waves/curls out of my hair at home than this lady did in the salon. I have 2c/3a fine hair but a lot of it. Their routine used Ouidad Advance Climate Control shampoo and conditioner and gel, scrunched it after, then diffused it dry downward the entire time. When I got home and oiled the gel cast out, I decided to also dampen everything down and sprayed curl refresher in, then scrunched more and that brought out curls that my stylist seemed to not be able to mange. (Pic 2)\n\nWhen I called to say I wasn’t satisfied with the cut (I wanted a butterfly cut with shorter layers but the stylist said she didn’t like doing short layers because the ends thin out too much), they said I could come back but they will only dry cut my hair and they won’t be shampooing/blow drying/styling it afterward. Is this standard? I have to come in with clean, brushed out hair. But when I leave it won’t be styled either so I’m trying to figure out how I’ll know I’m happy with the cut if I’m leaving the salon right after they just combed through my hair even more to cut the layers. It’ll be a different, younger stylist thank god. \n\nPlease point me in the right direction. I feel so sad about my first “curly hair experience”. I was really hoping to learn more about styling and caring for my hair and I’m disappointed I did. What should I be expecting or asking from the salon when I go back this week for the correction?\n\nPic 1 - Cashing out at the salon with gel cast\nPic 2 - At home after dampening and refreshing curls\nPic 3-6 references for what my hair has been",

      "title": "I went to a hairdresser my mom recommended and he did THIS to my hair",
      "content": "I just moved back to my home state after three years living in the South of Brazil. My wife and I didn't want to have to find a place here from a distance and my mom has a spare room in her house, so we're staying with her while we look for our own place. My last haircut had been in October and my hair had lost its shape. It's summer, the days are very warm, so I wanted something with short sides. \n\nI intended to go to my usual hairdresser, but my mom said I should go to this guy. I initially declined, saying I need someone who knows how to cut curly hair. \"Well, he has curly hair!\", she says, and shows me a picture. This guy clearly straightens his hair using a blow dryer. I told her I don't trust a curly guy who straightens his hair, but she swears by him, insists I go and says she'll even pay for it. So I think \"what the hell, let's give him a shot\". Big mistake, my friends, you should always trust your gut feelings.\n\nI went there this Friday and showed him the haircut I wanted. The guy in the video didn't have curly hair, so I said to him I knew it wouldn't look the same, but that was the point: I thought it would work even better on curly hair. If it didn't work, well, that would be on me for not picking an appropriate cut, right? You'd think so, and you'd be wrong.\n\nHe started cutting. It starts out well enough, but after a while, I start thinking \"wait a minute... this doesn't look like the haircut I asked for, does it?\", by the time I'm sure it sure isn't my hair's already too short for it.\n\nHe cuts my hair, asks if the length is good. I say it is. He  cuts a little more. And then, Reddit, this son of a wonderful woman takes out a hair blower. I think he's going to dry my hair, but no, he gets a brush and straightens the front. I scream inside.\n\n\"It's okay\", I tell myself. \"You just need to wet your hair and this all goes away. You'll go straight home from here and get in the shower\". And, besides, now I wanted to know what the hell he was trying to do. He straightens my entire hair, I look in the mirror and I finally understand: he gave me the same haircut he has.  He asks to take a picture, I let him, this train wreck needs proper documentation.\n\nI got home, took a shower and only then I realized the full horror of what had happened. The cut is way shorter than I asked for, like, three fingers shorter. Without straightening, it's awfully shaped. I look in the mirror and contemplate my choices: buzzing this nightmare off or living with it for the next 3 to 4 months so I can get the haircut I actually want. After careful consideration, I decided I'll buy a bunch of hats to wear until this thing's long enough for a new cut.\n\nAfter my wife saw it, she did what I should've done in the first place: looked through his Instagram. There was only one male cut. And, guess what: it's the same haircut. Like, exactly the same one. So yeah, lesson learned: trust your instincts, do your research before committing and don't cut your hair with a guy who straightens his own.\n\nRoutine: wash with Dove Cachos Ativos shampoo while crying in the shower. Condition with Dove Cachos Ativos conditioner. Rinse. Dry with a towel or with blow dryer if I'm in a hurry. Put a hat on before I leave the house.",

I know isotretinoin (Accutane) is often recommended for severe cases, but I really don't want to go that route because of the side effects.\nHas anyone been in a similar situation and found something that actually worked?

Hv approached many dermats as a kid n nothing helped. So I basically gave up on skincare n stuff. Only time has healed my skin. I still get acne. Like 5-10 a month including period acne) I randomly landed up on reddit skincare pages n was basically scrolling through it. Heard from some how micellar has helped them with comedones and stuff. Decided to give it a try. And ngl, with 2 days I could see drastic changes in my skin. The comedones have drastically reduced on my forehead. Micellar also helped me with acne. If there's any acne flaring up, I just use micellar on it and the next day the acne is gone pretty much.\n\nI used Garnier pink cap.\n\nHow do I use it:\nNight: I clean my face with micellar water using cotton pads or any clean smooth cotton cloth. Then I wash my face with a cleanser. Then proceed with my night routine. (Which is basically just applying moisturizer. I use ponds super light moisturizer as I hv oily acne prone skin)\n\nMorning: I clean my face with micellar water (my face gets all super oily in the morning) and then I wash with a cleanser. Apply moisturizer and sunscreen (I use solasafe sunscreen)\n\nPs: I still hv some comedones on my skin. But micellar has made a huge difference. Also it's been a week + since I started using it.\n\nI now hv to work on my skin texture too.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

It may be time to go to a dermatologist as well, which I’m open to doing. My main questions are: \n\n1. Tips or suggestions to get rid of excess oil (no matter what I do, my skin gets extremely oily about halfway through the day and I do not like it).\n\n2. Redness on my chin that is sometimes very noticeable, especially if I have nothing on my skin expect skincare. I feel like my skin tone is quite uneven, but especially around my chin. \n\n—&gt; It is not redness from being sunburned, I am very consistent about applying and the-applying sunscreen and the redness is visible throughout the year. It does not come and go. \n\n3. Blush recommendations for my skin? I currently use Benetint rose liquid cheek blush stain (the classic one) or Merit blush in I BELIEVE the color stockholm. But I love blush and want to experiment with more colors/ maybe try a powder one? \n\nBelow is my skincare routine and I will attach a somewhat recent image of me from the beach. \n\n**Morning Routine:** \n\n1. Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing oil (rub on dry skin and then massage in with cold water)\n\n2. Bowl with water and ice cubes, dunk face five times\n\n3. SOS daily rescue facial spray, let dry completely \n\n4. Farmacy daily greens oil-free gel moisturizer \n\n5. Supergoop unseen sunscreen \n\n6. Korres greek yogurt wide awake eye gel\n\n7.  Blush/ setting powder/ lip gloss/ eyebrows/ curl lashes/ mascara (in that order, most days)\n\n**Nighttime Routine:**\n\n1. Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing oil (rub on dry skin and then massage in with cold water)\n\n2. Origins checks and balances frothy face wash (massaging it in on wet skin)\n\n3. Bowl with water and ice cubes, dunk face five times \n\n3. SOS daily rescue facial spray, let dry completely \n\n4. CeraVe PM facial moisturizing lotion \n\n5. Beauty of Joeson revive eye serum: ginseng and retinal \n\nIs there anything I should be doing differently or any skincare/ makeup products I should incorporate into my routine? I have been doing this every day, morning and night, for years now and it’s been mostly effective. But maybe time for something different. Thanks in advance for the help! ",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’d love some routine/product advice based on the photos.\n\nSkin type: •\tOily forehead + sometimes oily nose (T-zone) •\tNormal cheeks •\tNot usually sensitive, but I’m not sure anymore\n\nBackground: I had very clear skin as a teenager and basically never used skincare. For the last year or so (worse recently), I constantly have at least a few pimples — I don’t remember the last time my skin was fully clear. It’s mostly small inflamed bumps on the forehead and some breakouts on the face (see photos). Not itchy.\n\nCurrent routine: \nRight now I’m not consistent / I’m trying to figure out what to do. \nI’m considering a simple routine like: \n\nAM: water rinse → vitamine c -&gt; moisturizer → sunscreen \n\nPM: gentle cleanser → xxx-&gt; moisturizer And adding an acne active (BHA or azelaic acid), but I’m not sure what fits best.\n\nGoals: •\tGet my forehead breakouts under control •\tPrevent new pimples, get „glowy/glass skin“\n\nQuestions: \n\n1.\tDoes this look more like clogged pores/comedonal acne vs inflammatory acne? \n\n2.\tFor oily forehead, would you recommend salicylic acid (BHA) or azelaic acid first? \n\n3.\tAny specific cleanser/moisturizer/sunscreen types (gel vs cream, non-comedogenic, etc.) that tend to work well for a combo/oily T-zone? \n\n4.\tHow often should I introduce actives to avoid irritation?\n\nThanks a lot in advance!",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm 19 years old, and I have shoulder blade length wavy/curly thick hair (I think 2B-2C ish?). Just about two years ago my hair basically took a turn for the worse and I started having to wash it every day / every other day. Before this I could go about a week without washing it. Now whenever I wash it it doesn't really feel totally clean, almost like it's still coated in something. It also gets oily incredibly fast at the roots. I usually wash with two different shampoos, just so it will feel clean enough. I also rinse for like 10 minutes very thoroughly, so I don't think buildup is the issue. It feels like I've tried everything: hair mask, hair oil, clarifying shampoos, washing in distilled water, using only one shampoo, conditioner only on the ends, no conditioner, scalp scrub, hard water shampoo, sulfate-free shampoo, shampoo with sulfates, etc.\n\nMy current hair wash routine is:\n\n**Wash first with Redken Color Extend Magnetics Shampoo (my hair has never been colored, just using this bc my hairdresser recommended it)**\n\n**2nd wash with Head and Shoulders Bare Shampoo**\n\n**Rinse for a looooong time**\n\n**Condition with NYM Conditioner (only on ends)**\n\n**Airdry (using microfiber towel)**\n\nCould it just be the water where I live? I live in a metropolitan area that's known for having hard water, but it doesn't affect anyone else in my family. I've heard of this issue a few times from people with wavy or textured hair, so it might have something to do with that?\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions AT ALL please let me know. This is something that's driving me bananas and has been a little upsetting, since my hair really feels too unclean to do any sort of fun hairstyle with. Thanks!",

      "title": "2 years on Dutasteride/Minox, so much hair loss, not sure where to go from here",
      "content": "10 years ago I started Finasteride and topical minox (rogaine) once a day. At the time I think I was a norwood 4 and now I believe a weird 5. Back then I had a huge bald spot on the crown with a couple hairs left, temples were receding, hair all over was thinning. But I still kind of had hair. I've been shaving my head for 20 years, but not everyday if I am lazy about it. Even with the receding temples I still didn't mind my head that much back then because I shaved it often and I could see that 5 o clock shadow covering a decent part of my bald head at least looking at me straight on. I guess that is what I mean by I kind of had hair. I wasn't happy, I was balding, but I had something. I thought I was doing something great for myself by starting these meds. I had high hopes for Finasteride and Rogaine. But it didn't work. I was very slowly losing hair. Not aggressively, but I could see it happening. I hung in there for years hoping something would change for the better or I would at least stop losing hair. Heard about Dutasteride 2 years ago and jumped on it. Slowly made the transition to Duta from Fin with advice from Reddit people. I really thought this would work. Still doing my topical minox. But in the past 2 years things have gotten worse. The crown's bald spot is getting bigger, my temples are really receding big time, and my hair is thinning out really bad especially in the front to mid scalp. The biggest change I have noticed on Duta is the receding hairline. And the thinning of the front/top. I should note I also tried microneedling when I first switched to Duta. Hoping between the switch to Duta and Minox and microneedling, I'd have a good chance. I'm honestly not sure if microneedling worked. It might have just a little bit. A little bit wasn't worth it to keep going because I didn't enjoy that at all. I did what I read on here. 1.5 dermaroller, once a week. I just can't see myself doing that forever. Lack of visual results is discouraging as well. I wasn't seeing anything new happening. So I stopped after about 2 months. \n\nSo nothing has worked and I'm depressed about it. Yes I shave my head. But I am not happy being bald. I'm just content with it if I have somewhat of a 5 o clock shadow there. But there is no question my hair has gotten much worse since starting Duta. I can tell when I am bald and when I grow my hair out a little. I can't say \"Duta cause this\". I just know hair loss accelerated once making the switch. That's all I know. I'm not sure if I should hang in there. I feel like I will be completely bald in a year from now at this pace. I am thinking of switching back to Fin because at least I was very slowly losing hair. But then I am switching back to something that wasn't actually really working. Fin wasn't stopping my hair loss. Just stopped it better than Dut. After 10 years of this I am just very annoyed. I can't give up though. I'm not okay being bald. I've looked into other stuff. The SMP I've thought about a lot but 99 percent of the ones I see do not look natural and I can't imagine it looking any better up close in real life. But, I still consider it because might be my only option. It's just, when I shave my head, there are no dots on my head, not even small ones. I'd want SMP to match my shaved head and I don't think anyone can pull that off. I don't want dots. I've never seen it in real life though so I have no idea. And then I could do Hair transplant - well what is the point if I can't even make these medications work right? I really don't want to spend the money on a transplant anyways. But I would to get hair. But all those doctors say you have to stay on Fin or Dut to make it work so what's the point. I believe oral minox would give me results. But, I just can't. I do not want more body hair or face hair. I have enough problems. I hate body hair and extra face hair. It's so crazy how to get hair back on my head I have to get hairy all over. I've read enough people saying they get really hairy everywhere. I guess that doesn't bother them but it bothers me. If I was guaranteed a full head of hair on oral minox, sure make me hairy all over. But with my luck. I'll just lose more hair on my head and gain more hair on my body. I saw one of those red light therapy baseball caps on Amazon tonight for under $100. Could that work? lol. I mean right next to it is the helmet for $800. So I guess that would mean the $100 is junk? I can't spend more than $100 to test one of these things because I have no idea if they will work. I do Keto, and take no vitamins. Maybe that would help? But I don't see that turning things around much at this point. I see the pills for saw palmetto but not sure. Biotin but not sure. I'm reading about topical fin and topical dut. But I don't know. How would I decide between the 2? Flip a coin. If the pills and minox don't work why would they though? Could taking 2 pills of Dut a day make a difference? Or one of those full 5's of Fin a day? I asked my derm and she said she won't prescribe that. When i first started this HIM's was not a thing. Now I see it everywhere. Should i be going through them for the same stuff? Maybe there is something magical in there? \n\nSome of you have great dermatologists. The derms I have gone to promote that they do hair help, yet seem to know nothing. It's as if they read an article or two. And I bring up what I read on Reddit and they say \"stop reading Reddit\" lol. The people on here know much much more than the derm's I have met.  I had an appointment yesterday and asked her what I should do and she just said it's up to me and rushed me out. Is there somewhere else I can go to talk about these medications? Bosley or something? I called them and they just wanted to talk about hair transplants though. I can sit on here and read every posting and in the end it's not really helping. This works for some people, and doesn't for others. I'm just unlucky. And jealous of those I see this working for. I want to fight for the hair I have left on my head but not sure what to do from here. ",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

      "title": "Best haircut for my curly hair?",
      "content": "I've always struggled to find a good haircut because, although it may look \"good\" from the front, I've never liked how it looks from the side. Even though it looks good from the front in the second photo, from the side it looks messy and shapeless, especially at the front (although I'm not combing my hair in the first photos). I kind of like the cuts in the last photos, but I don't know exactly how to ask for them or if they would suit me, because they never turn out 100% the same or I don't know how to style them properly.\n\nAs for my routine, I wash my hair once or twice a week with Dove Oil Nutrition shampoo, then I use Garnier Fructis Goodbye Damage conditioner. after that there's a bit of a problem, my hair is fine and highly porous, I use Rolda leave-in conditioner (a Venezuelan brand) and Aloe Strak mousse, the problem is that even though they retain moisture, they don't leave me with the same volume as usual (like in the photos), But at the same time, if I don't use any of them, my hair lacks shine and definition and frizzes easily. It's a mess, haha.\n\nHonestly, I really like the \"book\" shape, if you could call it that, at the front, but I never like the sides, haha. Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated :)",

      "content": "I've never understood my hair and neither has anyone in my family. My mother isn't the kind to be interested in self care so I've oiled my hair and put it in braids for most of my life. It is so embarrassing to admit but I kept my hair oiled for as long as a week till 3rd year of college. By then, I understandably had pretty bad dandruff, very predictable result for a foolish decision. To add insult to injury, I used Biotique up until last year. I wish I cared enough to do a simple google search for better alternatives.\n I'd also lost a lot of hair owing to that and competitive exam stress, I now have 1/3rd of the hair I had in high school. The speed with which I was losing hair in high school had me being convinced that I'd eventually be bald someday, so I completely stopped seeking solutions for a fixable problem. I contemplated shaving it all off but settled on getting a pixie in lockdown and keeping it shoulder length over the years. \nAs my mental health and self worth has improved, so has my will to take care of myself. I've been growing my hair for quite sometime and it's become even more confusing than it was. My hair is now suddenly on the curly spectrum, 2b low porosity I suppose. It looks very frizzy and unkempt in photos, even if it looks pretty at home sometimes. Earlier, my hair used to look flat and sparse, now the length and waves give it volume but it never looks well groomed. \nI use the selsun shampoo once a week, sometimes I still oil my hair out of habit but only for a day before shampooing. Other than this, I don't do anything, have never had any hair treatments or a proper haircut, I have a pretty large face and already thin hair so cutting it in a layers or bangs didn't make sense.\nI've tried wishcare, pilgrim, minimalist hair serums and while they did show some effect, I understand only minoxidil will give real results. The photos don't do justice to how thin my hair actually looks and is so I'm not exaggerating for sympathy! \nPlease suggest products and solutions for taking care of it! Help a girl out, I legitimately don't have anyone else to go to other than the internet \\*puppy face\\*",
