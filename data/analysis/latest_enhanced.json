      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "First photo is immediately after coming home from the salon. Second photo is 4 months ago. Third photo is last week. \n\nTo start, I walked into the salon yesterday with my hair curly. Typically I’ve walked in with my hair up, curls not visible. The stylist who I’ve seen for 10 years, who typically just gives me a blunt cut that allows me to wear my hair both curly and blown out, takes a look at my curls and says “oh! I love your natural hair. Are you wearing it like this now?” I say yes, that I haven’t blown it out in over a year. \n\nShe says she wants to cut my hair dry and give me layers. I tell her very strongly that I don’t think this will look good because my hair is very very fine and I don’t have a ton of density. I tell her that if she does layers it will look straggly and thin at the bottom. She says “trust me!” I say ok. \n\nAfter she cuts it dry, she washes it. She then tells me that I can either diffuse my own hair in the chair myself (she asks me if I typically diffuse at home. I say no, I let my hair air dry almost always) or she can diffuse it for me. I kind of look at her horrified and stunned because she has been towel drying my hair (😭🤯) and is attempting to put styling products in my towel dried hair. I tell her, ummmm well I always put styling products on dripping wet hair. She doesn’t do or say anything, almost like she hasn’t heard me. She then takes the diffuser and starts tossling my hair with one hand and diffusing it with another (wtf!!!). \n\nI sit there silently horrified. It looks so incredibly awful, like a drowned rat that has lost most of its fur. She then turns to me and keeps saying how great it is. I know she’s lying. She then charges me $150 (not with tip). I cannot believe she let me walk through the salon, telling me how great it looked, charged me as if everything was normal and ok. I’m so mad I don’t even know what to do. Also, she cut it in a way that won’t look good blown out, so I can’t even wear it that way now. ",

But I’m having a hard time believing that, and it seems like a regular metal one could do the job with some heat protectant?\n\nThanks!",

I did a little research, and this is the routine I have started with. I am going to start with the salicylic acid every other day and the AHA exfoliator once a week to get my skin used to it since it’s sensitive. Overall, my skin feels dry and flaky, and sometimes around my forehead and chin, it gets oily. Again i’m super new to skincare so i haven’t tried products in the past besides face wash I really only tried the peeling nose strips and i found those to make them more irritated. Are there any other products to recommend or add to my skincare? Any advice is helpful!! Thank you!!",

I wash 2 to 3 times a week, but I wet my hair every morning in the shower and style with curl cream + gel. When I'm done styling I shake my head and pat dry with a t-shirt, then I enjoy the following half hour of dripping wet hair and three more hours to air dry haha.\n\nIf you have any advice for my hair type and length, I greatly appreciate it!",

I try to stick with cooler water when dealing with my hair but sometimes I have to do hot water for the rest of me.\n\nDrying is air drying by either twirling my hair into a hair clip or braiding. I don’t do heat or towels.\n\nI have a shea moisture leave in conditioner that I’ll do about every other day or so as it makes my hair stick to itself.\n\nAny recommendations or advice would be wonderful to have, thank you!",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",
