I don't really have a set routine because I genuinely don't know what works for me at the moment. As my break outs are getting worse everyday I don't know which products are helping or making me worse.\n\nI've been debating whether to try red/blue light therapy, there is also a skin clinic near where I live that does this as well as other kinds of treatments. However I dont know if this will just be another waste of money.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas on what I can do, I'd really appreciate it as this is just getting me really down. \n\nThank you ❤️",

      "content": "Last year, I COMPLETELY effed up and destroyed my skin barrier. I was dealing with a few small acne bumps, the first time I had ever dealt with acne in my life (as a 22 y/o), and with minimal research I started using oxy benzoyl peroxide face wash, cera ve salicylic acid spot treatment and cleanser, faded topicals azelaic acid spot treatment.. my face absolutely was destroyed, and I spent almost 8 months with the WORST acne I had ever had in my entire life.\n\nI had such horrible, painful acne that I went to my local clinic, and the doctor prescribed me minocycline for 3 months, and suggested I start accutane. I chose not to do accutane because I didn’t want to go on so many forms of birth control (doing multiple hormonal changes at once essentially).\n\nI ended up just going bare-bones and using cera ve hydrating oil to foam cleanser, and cera ve moisturizing cream.\n\nA year later, my skin now has lots of acne scars on my cheeks, but the actual acne bumps I get are far fewer in between and much more manageable. I am now mostly looking to clear the closed comedones I deal with on my forehead, and do it in a way that’s actually beneficial.\n\nHere’s my current routine, I would love advice:\n\nAM\n\n1.) LRP Toleraine Cleanser\n\n2.) The Ordinary Soothing &amp; Barrier Support Serum (I do not experience pilling or irritation so far)\n\n3.) Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream + SPF\n\n4.) Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun SPF\n\nPM\n\n1.) Rotation of either The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser / Cera Ve Hydrating Oil to Foam Cleanser (I don’t super love either, but want to finish them up)\n\n2.) Cera Ve Moisturizing Cream (I also just want to finish this up, but I find it heavy on me)\n\nI am considering adding The Ordinary Aloe 2% + NAG 2% serum in the AM, after the barrier support serum, as well as adding ONE active, The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension in the PM after my cleanser. After testing LRP Anthelios Ultrafluide SPF on my hand in the store, I like the texture and I’m thinking to make the switch when I finish up my current BOJ spf.\n\nThoughts? Suggestions? I am still new to this, but trying to do right by my skin! I am also drinking lots of water and attempting changes to my diet as well.\n\nAll help and recommendations appreciated!",

      "content": "My son is 5 and got a haircut in March 2025. I called everywhere and verified they were a curl specialist and knew how to cut curly hair before making the appointment. The first 3 pics are of my son’s hair before the cut, next 2 are after the cut and the last two are now how it always looks now and the school pic is “styled”. I’ve given it so much time and they are just ruined 😭  when his hair is wet or he sweats it still curls up and he has ringlets, so I know the curls are still there. But now his hair is super thick and poofy and the curls are not defined and won’t hold. His dad has 3b hair. All the men in the family do. I can try to style it but it’s never like before and the curls won’t stay. Is there any way to fix this? Please tell me what to do. Curly hair is new to me and my husband always just shaved his off. I actually had him grow it out so I could see what it looks like. (It’s GORGEOUS)\n\nRoutine is wash once a week, we use as I am coconut cowash, comb through while wet, microfiber towel dry, sometimes use curlychic leave in (I’ve been playing with that to see if not using makes a difference, maybe it’s too heavy?) I also have tried purad’or organic argan oil and Jamaican black castor oil but that one is too greasy/heavy.  I’ve also tried the Cantù curly kids line (shampoo, styling custard, leave in, curling cream) with no difference. I am open to any and all advice please and will buy whatever needed.",

Thick individual strands but not a ton of density.\n\nroutine: \n\nshampoo: TGIN rose water shampoo for regular wash days, OUAI detox for deep cleaning\n\nconditioner: I almost never use this because it weighs my hair down but I do deep condition occasionally with Rizo’s deep conditioning or do a hair mask with Pattern transition mask \n\n  \ntreatments done to hair: occasional hair dye, no lifting used. maybe 1-2x/year. recently accidentally used permanent dye at home with ion hair color :( \n\nstyling products:\n\nTGIN rose water leave in condish (my holy grail fav product)\n\nTGIN hydrating curl cream \n\nmiss Jessie’s pillow soft curl gel for harder hold, or ouidad for lighter and humid days\n\napplication: typically apply all products while hair is soaking wet and add more water while applying. I dont separate the layers of my hair and do the rake and shake method. too lazy and it’s hard. I just comb leave in through my ends, part my hair how I prefer, then use praying hands to apply and rake through all other styling products. then I flip my head over upside down, shake left/right and up/down to get my natural curl clumps, and scrunch to the heavens. I’ll flip back up and scrunch a few times again before I throw my hair into a microfiber hair towel to plop for \\~20-30 mins. After, I take my hair out, rescrunch again, and I usually just let my hair air dry.\n\nwill hover diffuse my hair dry with warm/high settings on my cheap conair hair dryer until \\~75% dry and let hair dry if I’m feeling extra, but I almost always get frizz and don’t like my curls as much. \n\nsleep: I pineapple my hair and sleep on regular cotton pillow cases.

      "content": "Hi everyone! I have just started exploring using products on my hair and wanted to get some tips. Before a week ago I never wore my hair down, having it in a low bun at all times of the day for YEARS, so I never really learned what to do with it. I only washed my hair every few days which is good, but I didn't even really use conditioner so I'm not sure what state my hair is in. I haven't changed my shampoo or conditioner, but have started using them properly and now added more products. \n\nI'm pretty sure I have fine hair, probably also dry, and a mix of 2c-3b. It dries extremely quickly, so I think it's low porosity? My issue is I don't think I'm getting a real gel cast. It depends on how literal the phrase \"scrunch out the crunch\" is, but I'm not getting anything really crunchy, maybe a bit stiff but nothing like hairspray crispy. This is my third wash day, previously I tried just scrunching in the gel but I think brushing it in worked better, that's the only change between the 3 days. It looks nice enough all pulled forward like the first picture, but the second picture taken 30 minutes later shows how it actually is very stringy and frizzy. It's like the pretty ringlets are hiding under a layer of thin frizz and only show themselves when I pull it all forward. \n\nI noticed the front section of my crown looked better than the rest of it and Im 90% sure I accidentally put gel in that section twice cuz I got distracted. So maybe I need more gel? But it feels like I'm using a lot and that section still didn't get actually crunchy. Maybe I add a curl cream? It also only lasts 2-3 days despite the bonnet and idk if that's the norm or not. Im gonna try to be as specific as possible with this routine so PLEASE critique literally anything you think I could do differently.\n\nNotes: I clarified with a shampoo that has sulfates a few days ago, and I know I need more layers to get volume at the roots, and I know that having longer hair just makes the curls more likely to be flat. So maybe don't comment that unless there's something more specific I'm missing! I also know that air drying isn't going to be as good as a diffuser but I am not ready for it and want to perfect what I can right now. Ty :)\n\nMy current routine: \n\nIn shower- shampoo twice with Aveda Rosemary Mint Purifying Shampoo, condition with Aveda Rosemary Mint Weightless Conditioner, brush it in with detangling brush, scrunch, rinse, scrunch out some excess water so it's not dripping wet.\n\nOut of shower- I use a spray bottle to keep my hair moist, separate crown from rest of hair, then further separate the crown into 3 sections coronally. Separate the non crown section into two layers. \n\nStarting at the bottom layer I brush in Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream with my detangling brush, scrunch, further separate into smaller sections, brush in Curlsmith Curl Defining Styling Souffle, scrunch, use the Bounce Curl Define EdgeLift Brush and brush from under the hair pulling up and away from my scalp, scrunch. Repeat on the upper layer. Flip my head over and do this for my crown sections working back to front. Spot correct some curls that dried super scraggly and frizzy by spraying them with water and finger curling.\n\nAir dry. I have a fan that I sometimes sit in front of but never very strong wind cuz I'm scared of making the curls frizz. Once fully dry flip my head over and put a satin scrunchie around the hair (not tying it up tight, just surrounding the hair as a single loop) gather it into a satin bonnet and go to bed.\n\nIn the morning rub a few drops of Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Oil Mist on my hands (Not the one with cocoa butter. It says it's a body oil but had all the same ingredients as the hair oils I saw and was cheaper??) scrunch out hair for a few minutes, shake the roots out and fluff as best I can, spot correct curls that look like they're made of pure frizz.\n\nThanks for reading, ik it was a long post and I appreciate any advice!

It wasn’t much before, but it has slowly increased and now even if I just open my hair, there are hairs all over the floor.\n\nI told my parents about this and they suggested applying oil daily. I’ve been doing that for a year now. I asked them to let me see a dermatologist, but they say it’s a waste of money and they’re not allowing me to go.\n\nThey also don’t want me to cut my hair (it’s almost back-length). My mom says I don’t comb daily, and when I comb after one day, that much hair fall is normal. But I usually keep my hair in a braid and comb only 2–3 times a week because I’m scared of losing more hair.\n\nWhat should I do? Is there any oil or home remedy? I’ve been using homemade oil but it’s not working.",

      "content": "I have naturally curly hair, or at least I did as a child (photos attached as proof). I had ringlets when I was itty bitty, and it got less and less so as I got older. I was never taught how to care for my curls and it was treated as straight hair which made taking care of it as an overwhelmed autistic child absolutely awful 😭 I've spent my teenage and young adult years denying my curls and trying to hide them completely, but I don't want to anymore! I can't find things that pertain to short hair like mine and I'm struggling to live up to my fullest curl potential. The first photo is about 12 hours after a shower.\n\nMy current routine:\nI don't use curly specific shampoo or conditioner, I use refillable bottles that I refill at our local eco grocery store.\n\nDry with an old shirt by scrunching\n\nComb with a wide toothed comb\n\nA small amount of Marc Anthony curl cream\n\nSome Marc Anthony beach spray\n\nScrunch and hope for the best\n\nSometimes I use a blow dryer with a diffuser, but that is dependant on my energy level\n\nMy curls seem to look better the day after a shower, but never as good as they look when leaving from a haircut. I've been trying to figure this out for the last year now and I have made some good strides, but I feel like I could be doing more/better but I don't know where to start or what to change or do different.\n\nHonestly I could use any general tips or advice, but specifically...\n\n1. Are there any specific after-shower products that I should be looking into?\n\n2. Is Marc Anthony a decent brand? I honestly gravitated to it because the packaging was my favourite colour and I didn't know where else to start.\n\n3. Does curl shampoo/conditioner actually make a difference? I didn't notice anything significant when I was using it. \n\n4. Is there anything that I should be doing different or adding to my routine? \n\nThank you 🥰",
