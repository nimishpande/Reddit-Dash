      "title": "Is anyone else beyond fed up with hairdressers never ever listening?",
      "content": "Or does anybody have a secret tip that gets them to listen without just being a rude and scary customer? I've tried so many hairdressers in my city, price points anywhere between 20 and 120€ per cut, and none of them seem to listen to a single word I say.\n\n\"Would it be possible to cut my hair while it's dry? It really is a lot easier to get an even cut this way.\" \"That's not how it's done, cutting wet hair is always easier!\" Okay then. I stopped trying to convince them because not a single one ever listened, not even the ones who have cut my hair before and know how long it takes to fix the unevenness they create with a wet cut.\n\n\"I want a slightly longer pixie like in this photo, so my hair should cover my ears. My curls pull up a lot when drying, so since you're cutting them wet, they need to go slightly past my chin - right where I am pointing now.\" \"Got it! \\^\\_\\^\" and the very next second I feel how they cut my hair directly at earlobe level. I will clasp my wet hair between two fingers to pull it as straight as they do with the comb, and then use my other hand to point at the exact place where the scissors or the blade would need to go, but they still always manage to miss it by at least 3 cm. Do they forget? Or do they just ignore me because they think they know better? Even though simple geometry says that to connect points A and B, a curved line needs to be longer than a straight line? Telling them that I want a bob when I actually want a pixie doesn't work because while it fixes the length problem, the general shapes of these cuts are too different.\n\n\"Do you see those two spots where my hair is a lot more curly than anywhere else? These need to be left a bit longer. If everything is cut to the same length when wet, I will basically have two large missing chunks in my lengths when dry.\" \"Okay, if you say so!\" And a few minutes afterwards, when I notice that they get close to one of the spots, I repeat \"that's one of the really curly strands I pointed out earlier, so that one should be left longer.\" And they say \"yup I remember \\^\\_\\^\" and still cut it to the exact same wet-length as everything else.\n\nI already gave up on \"could you hold the hair dryer in one place when diffusing? It breaks up the strands and gives me frizz when you kind of comb my hair with the diffuser nozzles like you're doing right now\" (\"okay!\" \\*keeps combing\\*), or \"can we use a spray bottle to get the hair a bit wet again after cutting? It helps with getting the combed hair back into structured strands\" (\"no, they will tangle if they get wet after combing!\"). I just ask them if I could diffuse them myself and I carry my own spray bottle. So that's an easy communication issue to avoid. But the other stuff is a lot harder.\n\nHow do I get them to listen? Does anyone have tips? Do I just need to be, like, really really assertive? Or interrupt them at every single strand to ask \"can you show me where you're planning to cut? No, a bit lower, please\"? I hate being a Stressful Customer :( so if anybody has tips that don't involve me becoming rude and annoying as fuck, please let me know?\n\n(The sub wants my routine to let me post, I just cowash and style with the Balea Oil Repair line from a drugstore chain in my country, really happy with how that turns out, the hairdressers are the only challenge I have left in my hair journey lmao)",

There was definitely a LOT of awkward stages as my hair turned curly one section at a time 😭 it also happened so slowly at first I wasn’t sure if I was imagining it. I ended up shaving it all off in 2021 and honestly that helped a lot, but it still continues to get curlier and curlier. I don’t see a lot of people with my hair type though, as I do have tight ish curls but they spiral instead of giving me volume. My mom has even curlier hair than mine and was sad when she birthed a straight haired baby, but her wish came true! I know this isn’t uncommon (I think) but it’s still interesting to me.",

I had major acne problems on forehead and face and the marks stay, also bumps on face especially forehead are quite frequent. Also pigmentation on lips( I don't smoke) . I just want to work on the uneven skin tone and texture and the bumps on skin and tanning. Also I have combination skin type and I try to drink Coconut water a lot for skin issues but doesn't seem to help a lot.\n\nProducts: i went on the internet searching and got to know about a few creames , like \n1. Glycolic acid\n2. Tretinoin\n3. Azelaic acid\n4. Salicylic acid\n5. Kojic acid\n\nQuestions:\n1. Now I wanna know which of these should I use, how and if combining them in what way ?\n\n2. I also plan to use sunscreen, I use lakme rn, not very regular with it though, please suggest any for my skin type?\n\n3. Any other remedies to get rid of tanning and bumps and acne scar please? \n\nThanks in advance !\n",

      "content": "For at least the past six months I have had painful acne on my scalp. The amount and location varies but often on the back of my head and in my hairline. I don't know the cause or how I can get rid of it. I haven't made any significant changes to my routine or diet. My diet is decent aside from my sweet tooth. I do touch my hair often but not more or less than before, and I clean my hairbrush quite often.\n\nI'm 24F and I've had fairly consistent hormonal acne on my face/chest which I can regulate with CeraVe salicylic acid cleanser and bathing regularly. I've tried using the same cleanser on my scalp after shampooing, and a couple times I tried my partner's Neutrogena T-Sal (it smells weird though); neither of these made a difference but I haven't been consistent. I have used a variety of shampoos and conditioners since before the scalp acne started but none seem to have caused it. None of those products were fancy or specialized for anything either. I do use camellia oil on the ends of my hair but never my scalp.\n\nI definitely get more acne when I go longer without washing my hair. Lately I wash it every other day but when I would get to the third day I start to get itchy and new acne would show up and my scalp would hurt in those spots. Every couple months I go back and forth between living with my partner (in a different county) and at my house but I didn't notice a difference from the water or anything. I'll be away from my partner for a while now so I will see if there's any difference in not sharing pillows/bedding. Just a few weeks apart hasn't made any difference.\n\nSome of the pimples are quite small and can be easily popped by just scraping them with the back of my nail, to which only clear liquid comes out. Some are larger (almost always on the back of my head) and require proper squeezing, and some can't be popped at all. I also often get tiny (sand grain sized) scabs under my nails from itching. I know popping them isn't recommended but the relief of pressure makes my head feel so much better.",

I was scratching my scalp to get that result, so it is never actually that bad. I never have white stuff on my shoulders, but if I take a really close look in the mirror, there are little speckles of that white stuff.\n\nThe other concerning thing is that I have these red marks or scars as you can see in the second picture. I would say these are all over my head, not in centrally located clusters, but dispersed throughout. I’ve had these for years now. Even if I go months without picking at them they are there. They often form a yellow orange color like crystal that I pick off after a long time.\n\nMy scalp never particularly itches or gets irritated, but I don’t want to be gross. Not sure if anyone can tell me for sure what this is. My hair is fine and thin I think, you can see my scalp pretty easily if you manipulate my hair. Should I be following some kind of protocol for washing my hair? Thanks",
