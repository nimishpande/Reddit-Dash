My roommate always threads her face and eyebrows.  Dyes her eyebrows and waxes and shaves regularly. I grew up in a house where my elder had no hair growth on her body or face and my mom is toooo pretty for these things. Same with her as well no hair growth. But me. I'm complete opposite. I have v uneven eye brows. Alot of face hair and body hair.  The problem is because my mom and my sister never did any sort of such things.  I never learned. But now that I'm living among other girls I finally see that wow I have been living like a man.  \nBut Idk where to start. I have alot of acne scars.  I'm scared that if I wax my face and eye brows it will idk come back worst.  I got the Braun trimmer something for my facial hair but idk I feel extremely weird using it.  Idk if I should dye my eyebrows or wax my hands too. I feel idk.  Out of place.  Idk how to adapt to these things. And when I ask my mom about it she makes it a big deal honestly.\nSo I turned to the random mom's of the internet. What do you think I should do. Or start with. I want honest replies please. I'm in a new country with new environment can't look like a dracula here. Need to look my best. So please help. ",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "In the Midwestern US right now there have been lots of humidity fluctuations- like one day it’s 30% humidity outside and then the next it’s raining and 90% humidity. It’s been messing up my hair because of that. For reference, I have medium textured, medium density, 2C-3A, low porosity curls. \n\nIn the summer it’s almost always humid and I’ve found that I can use lighter conditioners, non-conditioning or even drying hold products, and my hair holds and feels soft enough for multiple days. If it’s high enough humidity I can even spray on hairspray and it will help with hold but my hair won’t feel dry or mat up with it. \n\nAs there’s been more days with low humidity, I’ve noticed my hair feeling dryer so Ive been wanting to use heavier conditioners and more moisturizing products that typically would soften my hair up too much and decrease its hold in the humid weather. But then a day or two after washing, it’ll be raining with 85% humidity and my hair will be grow so frizzy and poofy. If I style with lighter weight products in anticipation of a humid day, I notice my hair feels dry and brittle until that humid day and I get worried about hair breakage. Not to even mention using hairspray on a dry day- my hair just mats up and feels horrible. \n\nI typically wash every other day to every four days just depending on how my scalp feels (it gets pretty oily or dry depending on what I’m doing) and I would love to be able to style my hair to last for multiple days regardless of changes in the weather. Do yall have any suggestions or advice on what I could use to help my hair last this season?\n\n————————————————————————\nRoutine (summer routine as I haven’t quite found a fall/winter one that works well enough yet.)\n- Shampoo with Dove Clarifying Scalp Shampoo 2 times\n- Condition with Garnier Hair Filler Strength \n- Skip any leave ins or cream as my hair is typically conditioned enough\n- On wet hair, rake through either NYM Curl Sculpting Gel or Herbal Essences Totally Twisted mousse (both work really well for me)\n- hover diffuse dry\n- scrunch out the scrunch with the Verb Ghost Oil\n- when I want extra hold, I use some L’Oréal Elnett Hairspray",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

The internet seems to say salicylic acid may help, but I am currently on tret (roughly \\~1 year, this acne showed up 3 or so months ago and the tret hasn't helped keep it at bay) and I'm not sure my skin could handle that. Any tips?\n\nWhy I suspect acne mechanica:\n\n\\- the timing of the acne lines up with when I started riding my bike/using my helmet more frequently\n\n\\- I don't think it's bacterial, because disinfecting my helmet has made no difference\n\n\\- I don't think it's based on anything in my routine, because paring down to bare bones has made no difference\n\n\\- I have struggled with hormonal acne in the past, but this feels different because (1) my past hormonal acne has been basically all on my chin, I've never had jaw issues and (2) my hormonal acne typically involves fewer, larger pimples that eventually come to a head - this is a greater quantity of smaller pimples that feel very much under the skin and never come to a head.\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated !\n\n  \n",

      "content": "I'm (22f) a huge fan of the rhode makeup products like the blush, lipliner, lip peptides.\nI tried the glazing milk before but found it similar enough to the beauty of joseon glow replenishing milk that I decided not to rebuy and keep using the latter.\n\nI was gifted the glazing fluid last week and have used it daily since. I added it to my normal routine that consists of cleansing, toner, and moisturiser (spf in the AM). My skin, that is already sensitive and acne prone, is the worse it's been in years, since I was a teenager in fact. All over my lower cheeks I am breaking out. I wonder if it is purging as I am not breaking out anywhere else on my face where I use the product.\n\nDespite the breakouts, my makeup has also never looked better to the point I have been complimented on the street, and my friends have asked me what I'm doing differently. The fluid leaves a beautiful dewy base for makeup.\nSo I wanted to ask if it is worth it to stick it out and see if it's a period of purging, or to stop using it immediately? Also, if anyone could recommend products that give a similar glowy dewy base for makeup l'd love to hear your recommendations!\nThank you",

My hair needed hydration, and a little extra weight. I used a wide toothed comb, did a little finger twirling, and re-parted my hair. Then my usual routine of a little KCKT leave in, Treluxe Serum, and NYM Curl Talk Mousse. My hair was only 90% dry when I left the house, so I kept it untouched and unfluffed until I got home and apparently got out the scissors lol 😆 ",

      "content": "Hey guys - just sharing what's worked for me!\n\nI've been dealing with PERSISTENT hormonal acne for years now (age 38) I should be clear, it wasn't the deep, cystic acne that some others get, but it was fugging relentless, the type that just when you think it's under control, you wake up with 10 pimples the next day type thing (always around the chin and jawline - and always 5 or 6 in the same spot! WHY!?!) On top of that, I started getting peeling and flaking every month this past year. Fun! Skin was somehow oily (wouldn't absorb any products so I looked like a slippery MESS) and dehydrated at the same time - so I just felt like an absolute sack of assholes for about 2-3 weeks every month. \n\nI was also suffering from some stress induced premature aging (honestly, I'm fine with aging, but don't really wanna look 20 years older than I am or just generally tired and miserable, which was my main issue)  Cortisol levels were through the roof (won't go into all the details of that situation) but with regards to this - on top of actually having a good skincare routine, all the boring stuff everyone recommends is obvious crucial (consistently eating well, exercising, drinking water, better sleep and most difficult but important, lowering stress levels as much as possible) In my experience, with proper care and consistency, it is possible to reverse some of this damage.\n\nAnyway, I tried every topical option available for the hormonal acne (was even prescribed tretinoin which I can comfortably use every night, thankfully I don't have sensitive skin) I've found the tret helps with overall texture and healing but never actually got the hormonal breakouts under control. \n\nSo at my wits end, I finally decided to try Skin Rescue supplements from BePure (I promise I don't work for them lol) and am three months in with no breakouts. Can't believe I didn't try a supplement earlier, would have saved myself a shitload of hassle and money. If you haven't tried something like this I would highly recommend. The one I take can be purchased online and in my humble opinion, is well worth a shot at about $35 a bottle. \n\nSkin routine is now as follows (these are the products I've stuck with as I've seen tangible results from each of them for acne, skin healing and premature aging)\n\nNight\n\nX 2 Skin Rescue supplements\n \nGentle cleanser\n\nLa Roche Posey Redermic Retinol eye cream\n\nTretinoin 5 - 6 x per week\n\nThe Ordinary Peeling Solution (1- 2 times per week - usually once a week but sometimes twice on pre-period weeks if skin feels like it needs it - don't use tretinoin or retinol on the same night as peels/exfoliants)\n\nCicaplast Baume b5 after both tretinoin and exfoliating (great for skin barrier)\n\nMorning\n\nX 2 Fish Oil tablets \n\nGentle cleanser\n\nAvène Hyaluron Activ b3 Serum\n\nBoost Lab Collagen Plump eye cream\n\nCicaplast Baume b5\n \nBoost Lab Sunscreen (Goody Goody Sundrops - lightweight and a little goes a LONG way)\n\nI also started using Skin Republic Gold Hydrogel masks during luteal phase to give my skin a bit of extra hydration and have found them to be awesome on those particular crusty days. \n\nSome of the above (mostly the serums and eye creams) are a bit expensive, but the rest, including the Skin Rescue supplements are all relatively affordable, and with the exception of the tretinoin, can all be purchased over the counter. \n\nAnyway, the thing that actually got the hormonal breakouts under control in the end was the Skin Rescue supplement, so if you're just struggling with that part, I'd highly recommend giving one a try for a couple of months with a really simple routine (gentle cleanser and skin barrier moisturizer of some sort). It also seems to have helped with my excessively oily hair (I'm one of those ones that has to wash my hair at LEAST every two days usually, can spread this out a bit now it seems - hoorah!) \n\nBest of luck!\n",

I’m a former cosmetologist who specialized in curl and wave styling, it’s genuinely some of my favorite things to do. recently, my partner had me cut their hair up to her shoulders for the first time in years, and the waves we’ve suspected were there are starting to show through. her hair is INSANELY thick, like she could keep her phone under it while showering and it would be fine. we figured their previous length weighed down the waves too much to have much of a shape, but her new short hair has let them peak through a bit more especially when wet. they’ve been experimenting with scrunching and styling in the shower, but any waves they create are gone by about noon because of the density and weight of her hair.\n\nI know she is generally very low maintenance when it come to hair, and doenst really know where to start, so next weekend I’m planning on styling their hair wavy for the first time so she can see what’s possible (and I can figure out what works if they want it again). Does any one have product recommendations for 2b/2c hair that will hold without weighing down her already heavy hair?\n\nTL;DR, my partners hair is too heavy to hold waves, product recommendations? (specifically gel/serums/curl creams and maybe some leave in conditioners)\n\nObviously I don’t have a routine laid out quite yet, but it’s required to post so here’s what I have so far: I’m not sure what shampoo/conditioner they normally use but I’ll be bringing one thats curl friendly (sulfate and silicone free!) as well as an argan oil hair mask that has always left my hair extremely moisturized. I might also attempt to add some Not your mothers sea salt spray if anyone thinks that might help, and I already own Eco gel for my own hair if you guys dont think that will weigh things down. I will be diffusing instead of air drying at they HATE the feeling of wet hair, especially on their neck.",
