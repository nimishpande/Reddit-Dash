      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I’ve tried Milku, human nature deodorant, Glycolic acid, usually my routine is after the shower I put glycolic then top it off with secret deodorant. I’ve even tried my boyfriends dove men 48 hours and I still start to smell terrible after just a couple hours. Not even sweating. Even showering thrice a day it smells. I’ve tried deodorant sprays and after 2-5 hours my Bo mixes with the deodorant. Even just lifting my armpit up my boyfriend will tell me wow you smell terrible. I am already so insecure about it. What can I do ladies ? I can’t live like this forever. And I always choose not to wear t shirts or sleeved shirts because the smell mixing with a shirt is absolutely horrendous as well. I don’t know what to do. I feel lost and embarrassed always. So so so embarrassed. No mater how much perfume or glycolic I put everyday it doesn’t go away!!! Please share what worked for any of you.  I start college in a couple of months and I’m going to have to wear shirts, I fear I wont ever get rid of this. ",

I’m now left with this gaping hole that I’m worried will leave a scar, and I would like some advice on how I can treat it early to avoid that. Or is it best to just leave it?\n\nA recent trial of 4% benzoyl peroxide left my skin with lots of peeling and irritation, so I added a small amount of Aquaphor to the area last night since moisturizer hasn’t been helping. I believe it’s non-comedogenic, but could this have contributed to the buildup that came out of this pore?\n\nI’d also like to add that hydrocolloid patches have NEVER worked for me.

The website doesn’t look professional, neither does the product or packaging, and some of the reviews on Trust Pilot are concerning\n\nI know microneedling at home will never be the same as a salon treatment and some may discourage people from doing it but is anyone able to recommend a decent and trustworthy brand that does a good kit? Preferably one that comes in a 1 or 3 month bundle so she can test it out - if she likes it then I can repurchase!\n\nBecause I looked at Glov my instagram keeps suggesting all sorts of alternatives now but I’ve never heard of any of them except for Qure which seems to have endorsements for two dermatologists who are well known on TikTok but I’m still skeptical. Does anyone have any reviews of this they could share?\n\nIf it was for myself I’d probably just buy it and give it a try but because it’s for someone else I don’t want to chose something and it turns out to be awful \n\nAny suggestions, reviews or advice would be greatly appreciated ♥️",

I have extremely coarse hair that doesn’t grow much past chin length. It’s not really curly and not straight either. I’ve felt ugly because of my hair ever since I was a little girl. I transferred $6k from my savings account and was ready to spend it on one premium wig and one mid-quality wig (shown in pics), but for some reason I just couldn’t do it. Instead I’ve been drying my hair with a diffuser and making it maximally puffy, which costs close to $0 (I did at one time have to buy the blow dryer, and I use a curl cream). So far I have no regrets. It feels like I’m giving the middle finger to society and its dumb beauty standards.",

I have just started to notice, despite having quite long and somewhat healthy looking hair near my crown, that my parting is becoming a lot more exposed and it’s starting to look concerning. Like a bald patch.\n\nI already have some ED problems so Finasteride just doesn’t seem like a viable option to me. Plus I put disproportionate value on the working of my sexual organs and its effects on my happiness. Can’t help it. And I guess I’m here because I do the same with my hair.\n\nThe only permanent(?) option left is a hair transplant as Minoxidil can regrow hair but can’t stop progression. I’m fine with a hair transplant, comfortable with the idea. But I can’t find any reliable information on what to do when you still have most of your hair for now. Do you predict what you’ll lose later and pre-emptively replace those follicles? Do you just have to wait years until you look bad enough?\n\nAnyone else in my situation and fixed it? Do tell of your story.\n",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I’m constantly dealing with colors going brassy which is normal with this level. Demi-permanent washes out the second or third shampoo, especially using ash tones, so guess my hair is resistant. Last product I used was Schwarzkopf Igora Vibrance with 13 volume developer. Stained my Aunts white towel over Thanksgiving because it washed out and that was only the second shampoo. \n\nI’m trying to stay away from permanent because of breakage. Perhaps you know of one that doesn’t? Before the Igora I was using SO Pure by Keune with 20 volume developer. That’s the product that caused so much breakage which surprised me. If you have recommendations on how to blend my 30-40% white and slowly make it the platinum color please let me know! I’m not ready to go white but want something different. I also am NOT willing to bleach my hair as I know from experience that it will cause too much damage. \n\nThank you!! 😊 ",

Idk what the cause is ? At first I thought it's due to my periods maybe , but I got it a day ago , let's hope it goes away. But does these breakouts actually last for these many days? \n\nWhat even is this ? It keeps coming back , and the previous one disappears. It doesn't leave that big of a mark till now. Help me identify what this is and how do I resolve it . My skin type is oily normally but now during winters it's dry. I use ponds facewash  , ponds light gel moisturizer and aqualogica pink sunscreen. \n\nI think I need spot treatment though I'm unsure what actually to use ? I'm afraid of purging as some people said it happened to them after starting actives . PLEASE HELP 😭😭😭\n\n\n(1st image is today , and the next are from the previous 25 days )",

I recently moved to a town in Canada with MUCH harder water than my hometown (5-7 ppm vs. 100-130 ppm, according to Google), and my 3a hair is definitely feeling the effects. I was wondering if anyone could recommend any good clarifying shampoos available in Canada, or any other products/routine changes they find effective dealing with hard water buildup. Affordability is appreciated if possible, as I'm a uni student on a budget. Thank you so much!! ☺️\n\nRoutine:\n\nMixed Chicks Shampoo (the normal, non-clarifying one with borage seed and avocado oil, as well as sulfates) 2x a week - I shampoo my hair 1x and rinse\n\nMixed Chicks Deep Conditioner 2-3x a week - apply generously to hair, comb through, leave in for 3-4 minutes and rinse out \nNOTE: I am running out of this conditioner and am going to replace it with the Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus conditioner, same routine. I have used this conditioner before and know it works for me!\n\nI rinse my hair and comb with a wide tooth comb while wet every single day regardless of whether I'm washing it or not, and I towel dry with a scrunching motion after every shower. Daily, I use scrunching to apply: \n\nMixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner, small-medium amount \n\nAnd depending on the day, either the Mixed Chicks Curl Sculptor or the Mixed Chicks Styling Gel, small-medium amounts.\n\nI use the Olaplex Hair Oil to break up my gel cast after my hair is dry, and I shower during the morning and do not sleep with any bonnet or protective device. \n\nAll my mixed chicks products were purchased before I went to university and began my new budget - I do not have Mixed Chicks money now 😅.\n\n\n\n",

And does the shampoo x conditioner make a difference (ex., high end products. Would switching make a difference in my hair?) \n- What’s your preferred method of drying for frizz? \n- Do you use multiple products, or just one?\n- Is there anything else I should know starting this hair-care journey? I’m so open to advice and tips.

My density is medium.\n\nFor the past year, my routine has been: \nLUS shampoo\nLUS conditioner\nLUS 3-in-1 styler.\n\nLately, I've been playing with Jessicurl (very different from LUS.)\n\nJessicurl Gentle Lather shampoo\nJessicurl Aloeba conditioner \nJessicurl Gelibration curl activator\nJessicurl Confident Coils solution\n\nNo silicones or sulfates in either brand. (They make my hair look nasty and greasy.) I apply to dripping wet hair and diffuse until mostly dry.\n\nI wear a scarf or bonnet to bed. My hair is chin length, so I dont put it up.\n\nMy issue is that it looks great on wash day, but it is - and always has been - a disaster when I wake up on Day 2. The curls are flat, or straight, or knotted, or sticking out. Frizz is often high, and sometimes the hair looks dull.\n\nThe only way I've found to deal with this is to use a spray bottle to get it back to dripping wet and start over with setting it. I dont necessarily need to apply more product. I can reactivate it with water. But the hair has to be thoroughly wet.\n\nCurl refresher doesn't have any impact on resetting my curl, nor does getting it mildly damp.\n\nI am just so tired of starting at square one every day. Maybe that's just how it goes, but I thought I'd ask whether anyone has any advice about how to refresh without starting over. ",

I know I can just wash or wet my hair on day 3, but I would love to extend another day in light of the winter and how cold and shivery it is in the mornings. \n\nFWIW, I wash every three or four days. My wash day routine is Chagrin Valley olive oil and babassu shampoo bar. I work from scalp and let rest flow down to ends. I start to detangle / gently separate strands as I wash. Then I follow up with Curlsmith frizz free conditioner. I detangle with my fingers in the shower and add in the same Curlsmith as a leave in, then Curlsmith in style shower gel that I rake and shake through as well. \n\nI love the curl definition and moisturizing of the in shower styling gel and how it accentuates my curl pattern. I alternate my shampoo bar every other wash with the prescribed shampoo from my dermatologist to combat dry flakes. It does not tangle my hair. \n\nI have also tried finishing with the Marc Anthony strictly curls foam mousse.\n\nTLDR —&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How do you wear your hair wrap/ bonnet at night, when you have short, tangle prone hair; presently the length is around my ears?&lt;——-\n\nThanks so much for your advice.\n\n",

      "content": "Hello! I am pretty new to skincare but would really love to have moisturized looking glass skin in time for my wedding in June 2026. \n\nI am 27F, Asian, and live in a tropical climate. I have I think combination skin which is mostly dry but very oily with big pores on the sides of my nose and some redness around my nose too. I used to do skincare in my teens / early 20s due to having a lot of acne but stopped for a long time because it just went away as I got older. Now, I want to have glass skin and shrink my pores, but I feel like I noticed that doing skincare now (I did for a few months earlier this year) makes me get more acne than usual. \n\nHere are the products I currently have, I don't necessarily use them all but alternate and just wanted to know what people think of these:\n\nCleanser: IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cleanser (I've had this one for a while and I feel like I like it? But again I haven't been consistent with skin care in a long time so I'm not sure about the results tbh), and I also have the Arencia Green Artisan's Cleanser I got from a friend. \n\nToner: Cell Fusion C Pore Tox Pads and The Ordinary Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner\n\nMoisturizer: Laneige Cica Sleeping Mask \n\nSo I've used the Confidence in a Cleanser most in the past and feel like I like how gentle and mild it feels - the result of these products are newer to me and I do sort of feel like they're causing minor breakouts, if I had to guess I feel the moisturizer seems too heavy? \n\nAnyway please give me all your best recs as I really want to meet this goal by then! One other thing is that since my wedding is outdoors in the summer by the beach it's possible I will be hot and sweaty so also how can I maintain glass skin without looking oily or sweaty per se? Thank you so much! ",

My skin feels really tacky when applying it, then gets dry and to the end it gets oily like I haven't applied anything at all...\n\nDoes someone have any idea on what should I try? I really don't know what to look for\n\n*Disclaimer: I have a sort of french crop haircut, so my hair covers my forehead, but when I'm at home I usually tie it or keep my forehead uncovered, I don't think that is a big deal but YMMV and you guys surely have a lot more experience than me, so I'll happily listen to anyone!*",

I went on Accutane last year and before that I used the LRP double repair matte moisturizer. It was extremely light and did not leave any residue. Now after Accutane, I tried using it again and it left a sticky residue. I thought maybe they just updated the formula and I need to find a new moisturizer. IVE TRIED SO MANY ultra lightweight moisturizers recently and EVERY one leaves a sticky residue.\n\nI tried the CeraVe Ultra Light moisturizing gel. It states specifically that it is extremely lightweight, fast absorbing, and WILL NOT leave any sort of sticky residue. Guess what.. my face was still sticky after application. Im just wondering if all these products are shit or if theres actually something up with my skin not wanting to absorb anything and just letting everything sit on the surface. Please give me advice!\n\nPS - I do exfoliate about twice a week also\n\n[](/submit/?source_id=t3_1paq4cg)\n\n",
