The most I’ve ever done is wash my face in the shower with the orange neutrogena oil free acne face wash. I’ve never established a daily and nightly routine but I’d like to but I have no idea where to start.\n\nI have PCOS and have struggled with hirustism for as long as I can remember. 13 years old maybe? I’m 23 now and I don’t think my skin has ever been so bad before. I’ve considered laser and other treatments, but unfortunately it’s too much out of my budget at the moment and I want to give a good skin care routine a try first to hopefully work a miracle over time. I’ve been plucking my neck but everytime I pluck it, my neck gets so irritated and bumpy :(\n\nI don’t really wear any makeup because I’ve never dived deep into learning how to do it. I grew up with hardly any females in my family and without a mom. I’ve always felt way too insecure to talk to the friends I do have about this, and when I have asked I really only get advice to use alcohol on my face, and from what I’ve read, that’s not really good for it?\n\nI’ve been drinking two cups of spearmint tea everyday for a little over two weeks now, and I’m looking for recommendations on your alls favorite skin care and what has helped you. I know everyone’s skin is different, and I’m not really sure what mine is to be honest. My forehead is bumpy and dry feeling, but most of my acne is around my jawline, cheeks, chin, lips. I think I’m in between oily and dry, but the most dryness is on my forehead.\n\nI’ve been on TikTok watching the skincare girlies and a lot of them seem to have multiple steps in their routine. Like cleanser, moisturizer, serum, etc and it’s really confused me because I’m not really sure what I need or what any of it does. can anyone please explain to me kinda everything? I figured this would be the best place to ask!! I’m struggling SO bad with this 😩\n\nThank you everyone ❤️",

During that time I was also using minoxidil. My shedding was pretty manageable and honestly the meds worked really well. I noticed my hair getting darker, thicker, and longer pretty quickly.\n\nAfter those first six months, I stopped minoxidil because I didn’t like how greasy it made my hair. I decided to stick with just the pill and switched to taking it every other day. That routine has been much easier for me to stay consistent with.\n\nIn December 2025, I chopped all my hair off and basically restarted from scratch because I wanted to grow it out evenly instead of keeping the mullet style I had before. Since then, it’s been growing really nicely and I’m happy with the progress.\n\nRight now I take 0.5 mg every other day and honestly I plan to stay on it long term. I’m happy with my hairline and don’t feel like I’ll ever need a transplant. Dutasteride is definitely one of those things I always budget for. It’s a permanent staple for me.\n\nOverall it’s been a great experience. If anyone has questions about my routine or results, feel free to ask me anything\n\nPhotos 1 to 3 → Aug–Sep 2024\n\n• Photos 4 to 5 → November 2024\n\n• Photo 6 → February 2025\n\n• Photo 7 → July 2025\n\n• Photo 8 → December 2025\n\n• Photo 9 → January 2026",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

It spreads easier and absorbs way better. I'll stand there for like 60 seconds to really let it soak in before stepping out of the shower and pat-drying with a towel. The towel soaks up some of the lotion, obviously, but enough is absorbed by my skin by the time I towel off.\n\nI guess I'm asking if this is the wrong way to do it?? I was talking about this with a friend and she said that was the wrong way to moisturize and all the lotion is wiped off by the towel because of how wet I am and I'm wasting lotion.

      "content": "Hi! I am very new to my natural hair, but have high hopes😊 I have been endlessly researching what routine to use for my hair, but there’s so much information online it’s a little overwhelming, and I would love tips if from seeing my hair and hearing my routine, you see even a couple initial glaring issues.\n\nI have course, middle-eastern, 2C hair, but it’s thinned a lot. My scalp gets oily fast though my hair itself is always super dry. My hair takes a minute to get fully wet, and a good amount of time to dry fully (maybe medium porosity?)\n\nI just cut like 11” off my hair as a refresh. In the pictures I show for context what my curls looks like now, what they looked like long, and what they looked like long with no product at all.\n\nMy current routine is using the Odele ultra sensitive shampoo and conditioner, squeezing out excess water with my hands, adding a generous amount of Trader Joe’s leave-in conditioner, a smaller amount of their hair oil, a good amount of “Miss Jessie’s Multi Cultural Curls” cream, another quarter size amount of her “Jelly Soft Curls” gel, spray my whole head with Pantene non-aerosol hairspray (level 4), cover my hair in Tresemme heat protectant spray, and then scrunch my hair upside down like crazy. The only combing I do is when I run my fingers through my hair to evenly distribute the products.\n\nI let it air dry and continue to scrunch, then when it’s almost dry I will diffuse for a second, then take off the diffuser attachment and scrunch my hair as I lightly dry it. I’ll scrunch in a little more oil to help frizz. I go to bed with a satin bonnet. Second day curls require me to re-wet and diffuse again for a second.\n\nI’ve never used a curling brush and I’ve never used a deep conditioner - from reading it sounds like something to maybe look into. I would so appreciate any advice, product suggestions, or tough love😅 you might have from seeing my hair and hearing my routine. Even haircut tweaks would be appreciated! Thank you so much in advance!",

Too much energy. \n\nJust a paddle brush to tame it, put it in a ponytail or claw clip if I'm too wiped out to brush it. \n\nI use a squishmallow for a pillow that I wash once a week and I don't protect my hair except for twist braiding it once every blue moon when I have the energy. \n\nI don't know how to French/Dutch braid and I've never been able to learn because it makes me so tired to have my hands above my head for long. \n\nI know this routine will likely be physically painful to some of you out there but if there's anything I can do that's low low maintenance to help my poor hair I'd appreciate it.

However I haven’t done so in the last 12 months because of how expensive it is at the salon. I’m currently ball parking the idea of doing it at home. I’m still in the very early stages of researching but I’ve been looking at the welloxon perfect developer (4% 13 vol) and the wella koleston perfect hair dye. I’m also looking at tips and techniques to make sure the dye is even. Do anyone have any advice for me?\n\nAdvice I’m looking for directed towards application of dye, I’ve read that the reason it’s so even in salons is because they change the formula based on the section (roots, mids and ends) to match the differing porosity of different hair sections\n\nPS: I’ve been told if I can’t afford it don’t do it, so I haven’t been but I’ve actually just started to find some grey hairs on my head and also feel like it really accentuates my eyes and skin tone",
