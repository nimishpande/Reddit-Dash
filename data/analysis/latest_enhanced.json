      "content": "I was asked in another sub to post my hair routine, so here it is! It‚Äôs a little wacky, so I‚Äôll try to make it make sense. Also there is probably a better way to achieve what I‚Äôm doing, so if you have any tips please share! \n\n1) Cleanse with either Maria Nila Coils &amp; Curls Co-Wash or DevaCurl No-Poo Original. \n2) Gently towel-press dry with DevaCurl towel\n3) Spray some kind of sea salt spray‚Ä¶Maria Nila Ocean Spray is probably my favorite, but I‚Äôve tried lots that work similarly. Sometimes I use a gel instead during this step, but usually it‚Äôs the spray. \n4) Usually on my wash days (I typically do it in the evening), that‚Äôs it for my routine. I let it air dry, and then go to bed, and when I wake up in the morning it usually looks crazy/terrible üòÜ. I‚Äôve tried a silk bonnet, but so far I haven‚Äôt found one that is comfortable! \n5) In the morning, if it‚Äôs just been freshly washed the night before, I‚Äôll sprinkle Sexy Hair Powder Play around and then spray all around with hairspray. (Yes, I put the products on dry, crazy morning hair, before the next step). If not freshly washed, skip this step. \n6) With my curly hair towel handy, I tip my head into my bathroom sink, turn on the water, and soak all of my hair by cupping water in my hand and pressing it to my head, if that makes sense‚Ä¶this helps re-form the curls. \n7) Gently towel-press hair dry. \n8) I let it air dry while making breakfast for the kids and getting them ready for the day. \n9) Diffuse on hot low (my diffuser is from DevaCurl and I love it) until it‚Äôs dry. \n10) Sprinkle Powder Play, spray again with hairspray. Sometimes I‚Äôll diffuse again after hairspray. \n11) Gently rub a flat palm on the crunchy areas to break up the cast. Extra Powder Play and/or hairspray in areas if needed, to give extra hold/height/interest for that ‚Äúmessy‚Äù look. \n\nI hope that all makes sense! My hair probably looks best on days 3-5 post-wash. It gets easier to style as a bit more product builds up from previous days. \n\nIt‚Äôs been a fun year with my curls‚Ä¶I wore my hair long, bleach blonde, and straight for decades, and last November I shaved it all off. I‚Äôll include photos of now and before. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíõ",

I just kept using it without any real reason.Recently, I read about using glycerin on the skin and decided to give it a try and my skin loved it!\n\nBought the atomiser from Blinkit and got glycerin and distilled water from a local pharmacy. Glycerin needs to be diluted, otherwise it can make your skin feel even drier. I diluted it in about 1:8 ratio (glycerin : distilled water)\n\nThe glycerin bottle cost me around 50, and the distilled water packets were rs.3 each. I spray it on my face when it‚Äôs slightly damp after cleansing, then follow up with a moisturizer. I‚Äôve been loving it lately, it‚Äôs super hydrating and very budget friendly!",

I got a glycolipid cream cleanser, Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%, salicylic acid 2% anhydrous solution (still not sure what it means?) and a moisturizer that just says \"natural moisturizing factors + HA\". I did their little skin test and just went with the products it recommended to give them a try. I was just wondering if there were any ways to flesh it out and make sure I don't do more harm than good. For example, I read that you need to wear sunscreen with salicylic acid because it makes your skin more sensitive? Here for advice any is appreciated!!

My mom cared of my hair of my childhood, and she did an amazing job! no iron, no dryer, always with low ponytails‚Ä¶ fr, the best job.\n\nWhen I was 12, i did a big chop, and I hated it. I growed my hair without going to the stylist til my 17‚Äôs (1rst photo). That was my best curly era, long, healthy‚Ä¶ i loved it and i felt so proud of my hair.\n\nThen, I went to uni and I did a mini-balayage, still having amazing hair! but felt it a bit shorter (?) idk why! then I started to use dryers, maximum heat and air (yeah, i know, curly terrorism.) (2nd photo)\n\nThen, i realised that all that heat was not good for my hair, and i decided to be more responsable of it and take care. AND NOW I‚ÄôVE THE WORST HAIR EVER! dry, feels so dead, always puffy when i go out‚Ä¶ HORRIBLE. I don‚Äôt feel secure with it, and i start to feel so ugly and insecure.\n\nMy routine has been always the same:\n\n- Shampoo and conditioner = (i‚Äôve been using fructis all my life, now i‚Äôm with pantene curly.)\n\n-Gel and mousse (I‚Äôm using the mercadona‚Äôs ones, my mom and I have used them since i can remember.)\n\n- Dry it with dyson (I bought it bc it‚Äôs supposed to be less harmful), medium heat medium air\n\nI remember that I always used to air dry my hair, but it took hours... I don't use oil after my routine because my hair gets really frizzy as soon as I step outside.\n\nI feel completely hopeless. I've tried sleeping with olive oil, making flaxseed gel and letting it sit, increasing the amount of water I drink...  Please, if someone knows how to help me, i‚Äôll be so grateful!!!\n\nPd. Sorry for my english, i know that is not the best! hope someone can help me :(",

If I try reapplying a bit of mousse on misted hair, it gets really stringy and unkempt looking. If I apply gel mixed with water on misted hair (as in the second picture), the result is the best so far, but still quite frizzy and chaotic looking especially on the top of my head. \n\nFiguring out porosity is difficult for me, I guess high porosity at least on the top, maybe medium for the rest? \n\nCurrent routine: \nWashing every second/third day with Balea Med Shampoo (german brand, nothing special just for sensitive scalp), conditioning with Being bye bye frizz, wet hair in T-shirt because I hate dripping, then Umberto Giannini Curl Foam, sometimes the Umberto Giannini Curl Jelly gel, too. Mainly hover diffuse until 80% dry. I don‚Äôt get a cast from these products. \nEvery second wash I also use the Being mega no-frizz mask before conditioning.\n\nAll tips are welcome, thank you üôè ",
