      "content": "almost a month out of my haircut that i hated lol and while its still not quite curling/waving how i like, it IS sitting a lot better and i am learning how to style it. i felt really pretty and cool the other day with it; i do like having short hair, i honestly do think it adds a unique sort of character to my appearance, and once it gets just a touchhhh longer and starts curling/waving the way i really like, i think ill be super happy :)\n\nincluded photos are when i styled it the other day, and then a couple short ponytail/pigtail styles ive been able to do :) also ignore that i was wearing the same shirt LMAOO I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE. also included just to be silly was my hair dried with no product.. unfortunately still just a puffy triangular orb.\n\nroutine: wash and condition with herbal essences grapefruit volumizing shampoo and chamomile conditioner. rake through a tiny tiny pea sized amount of kinky curly knot today in the shower (still debating if i need it at this length, i did when my hair was longer bc it’d get super dry). once out of shower, i lightly part and place my hair, but its still very wet. i then scrunch in pea sized amounts of aussie instant freeze gel, scrunch out excess water with a microfiber towel and air dry OR, as in these photos, very lightly hover diffused for a few minutes. \n\nwhen my hair was longer, i always diffused and hated air drying as it flattened out my waves and just took longer. but with the shorter hair, it dries so much quicker and looks decent enough. ive tried pixie diffusing it like i used to but it camd out sort of wonky at this length, like my hair wants to bend instead of form curl clumps. but today, though i dont have a photo, i DID diffuse side to side up to my scalp for a bit and it came out pretty voluminous and a bit more curly/wavy, so maybe i just needed to give my hair time to recover before diffusing like usual lol :)",

I started taz in late October.\n\nand listen… this stuff is MAGICAL.  \ndespite being the *strongest retinoid* i’ve ever used, it has never irritated my skin. no burning, no peeling, nothing. within 1.5 months, i had the smoothest skin of my life. i still can’t believe how gentle yet effective it is for me.\n\ncurrent routine:\n\nam:\n\n* Minimalist SA cleanser\n* isntree green tea fresh toner\n* cosrx snail mucin\n* aquasoft ac moisturiser\n* Picspot gel\n* sundrink sunscreen\n\npm:\n\n* garnier micellar water\n* joy pH 5.5 face wash\n\ntaz days (mon/tue/wed/fri/sun):\n\n* aestura lotion *or* minimalist b12 cream\n* taz\n\nthursday (barrier day):\n\n* aestura lotion\n* b4 nappi cream\n\nsaturday:\n\n* formularx lactic acid\n* aquasoft ac\n\ntaz literally did what tret never could for me. if you’re struggling with closed comedones, texture, or tret intolerance, this might be worth looking into.",

After that I section my hair and brush style with the bounce curl brush. When I’m done with that I use not your mother’s gel and finally marc Anthony strictly curls mousse. I usually air dry my hair but I did diffuse it in the routine for these pics !!\n\nIs there anything I can do at all??🤧",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Nothing fancy. I've been doing this routine for over a decade. When I was a teenager, I made a mistake of getting my hair cut short and have been growing it out since, with trims in-between. Nothing against people with shorter hair, it just wasn't for me and I missed my long hair I had as a kid so I decided to regrow it.\n\nLong story short, I had to get hospital tests and was monitored for several days, basically bedridden. They also had to use medical glue on my scalp to connect cords and monitor brain activity. After everything, I was left with a HUGE matt in my hair. Two local salons turned me down. Then I went to a local beauty school which helped reduce the size of my matted hair ball but they couldn't get it out completely. The professor told me her students did their best, and I appreciated it so much. So the question is, what now? The picture on the right is after they reduced the size of the matted ball. Left side is what my hair usually looks like. It's at the end of my hair but all balled up which is why my hair looks a lot shorter than it actually is.",

It just turns into more of an afro (afro might be the wrong word, that’s just what my family calls it idk) and it goes on and it’s starting to become a big insecurity. I really need a haircut but every time it gets cut it just turns into a weird bubble until it grows out enough to have more weight, and then it turns back into this poofy mess with the flat spot at the top of my head when it’s dry. Can someone please help me keep it looking the way it does when its wet and not poof so much? Also does anyone else have any advice for haircuts? My hair just turned curly in the last year or so and I hate it, nobody in my life will give me any advice but “cut it short”, I feel really lost and have no sense of direction. Any advice helps, thank you!\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. Crew Daily Shampoo/Conditioner \n\n2. Nothing \n\n3. Towel dried\n\n4. I don’t do anything specific, just my normal pillowcase",

      "content": "My skin has been suffering for almost 6 months now where I literally cannot tolerate anything anymore on my cheeks and lower face. It started back in mid-August where I used a moisturizer on top of tretinoin which caused an intense burning, redness, and tight sensation. To the point where I could feel it in the nerves in my cheeks. Instead of washing it off, which I should have, I slept through it because it was getting late and I didn’t think much of it. The next day, m I woke up with continued red, burning cheeks and nerve sensitivity.\n\nSince this incident, I have not been able to tolerate anything. Even simple bland moisturizers and oils like Vanicream, zeroid soothing cream, and pure squalane oil have given me trouble. Same goes for Vaseline. I will get the same red, burning, tight sensation with hypersensitized nerves. And the more I use it each day by trying to push through, it will eventually lead to sandpaper texture with numbness in the cheeks until I stop. This predominantly happens to my cheeks and a little bit around the nasiolabal area. Forehead and neck are completely fine.\n\nI have had patch testing and I am only allergic to formaldehyde which is in none of my skincare products that I own, confirmed by dermatologist. I even used steroids for a very short period, and tacrolimus for 6 weeks( both of them prescribed by a dermatologist) Neither of them have helped. If anythib no tacrolimus just made my skin burn more. \n\nI have seen two dermatologists already, and have a follow up with the second one next week. Both of them have confirmed that I am suffering from irritant contact dermatitis. Unfortunately neither of their approaches have helped. The one I am seeing again has suggested cerave healing ointment and zinc oxide. As soon as I used it, it leads to the same incident as before: burning, tightness, nerve sensitivity, etc…\n\nI fear that I may be out of options and the only thing left for me might be zero therapy for awhile to let my skin calm down. In fact, I have already started it yesterday and my skin does feel better and calmer by not using anything. The only drawback is dryness and tightness. And I am still worried if it’s even sustainable long-term. And how would I know when it’s time for me to reintroduce something back into my skin? I’m really scared at this point and it’s affecting me mentally. I really want to cry. Please what do I even do? I can no longer distinguish right from wrong anymore :(",

I had high hopes and was expecting something similar to the Bioderma Atoderm Baume, but it absolutely failed to deliver. It has the texture of a waxy lip balm that is really unpleasant to apply; it feels like I’ve put a film of beeswax on my face. Its claims of hydrating and replenishing the skin are overshadowed by the waxy texture and the difficulty of application. If you have damp skin, the product won’t even budge; you can actually scrape it off with your nails. \n\nI didn't find it moisturizing enough for winters, nor will I use it during humid summers (I can only imagine what a nightmare that would be). \n\n🔮Final verdict: The only \"pro\" is that it works as a tone-up cream for a quick brunch look. That’s it. I won’t be repurchasing this anytime soon.  ",

      "content": "Okay so let me preface this by saying I’m not good at doing my hair. I’ve never been good at it. Over the last 2-3 years growing it out it has been in a braid or a bun. I decided to try the overnight blowout rods because it looked easy and the outcome on the videos was what I wanted from my hair.\n\nI tried it for the first time last night and the first issue I had was I could not get them into my hair without my hair tangling. I brushed out my hair before and in between each step but it was not enough so even though there is some curl it’s mostly just tangled and I’ll have to brush it out anyway which will make it poof.  I did wet down my hair during the process. \n\nSecond issue I have is the bangs. I have a really bad cowlick in my bangs on the right side so I was hoping this would help but ….  I feel like I look like a crazy person and I would’ve been better off not doing anything. I’m trying to take better care of myself and present myself better but the hair step is inevitably where I always fail.\n\nIdk… any tips or advice are appreciated ",

Scrunth and diffuse upside down \nI usually put it in a bun when sleeping or just chill \nShe suggested I not use any curl creams or gels or leave in conditioners, as well as moisturizing products because I have moisturizer hair enough.\nI'm wondering what products I should use then. Just a foam? \nDoes anyone have suggestions for light weight foams.\nAdditionally I have quit sensitive skin particularly to coconut products so preferable not really strong fruity ones! Also potentially budget friendly unless it's something that will last you a long time for a big price \n\nThanks xx",
