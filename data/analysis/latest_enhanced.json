      "title": "What is the science behind 'less damaging' hair dryers such as the Dyson?",
      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Hello there!! I’m hoping to get maybe some tips or advice for the top of my hair because I’m kinda stuck. \n\nMy hair routine so in the shower includes: \n- Eufora urgent repair (a clarifying shampoo- product buildup loves me) \n-Eufora aloe therapy shampoo after that for moisture (I’m considering dropping these bc they’re expensive so if you have any store bought recommendations lmk)\n- if I wash my hair more than once a week, I use the L’Oréal Elvive Hyaluron+Pump - I bought this specifically bc I think I have low porosity hair? I get confused bc in the shower my hair gets wet right away but when I’m starting w dry hair &amp; spraying it with my continuous misting sprayer, I really have to spray a lot and do praying hands over my hair or else it just sits in beads on top of my hair.\n- Mielle Babassu &amp; Min Deep Conditioner OR \n- Not your mother’s Tahitian gardenia flower &amp; mango butter conditioner \nProducts out of the shower include: \n- Not your mother’s nourishing curl talk leave in (my hair loooooves this) \n- For gel, I’ll use either Miss Jessie’s Jelly Soft Curls or just straight 100% natural aloe Vera gel (my hair likes the aloe better) \n- if I use a mousse, it’s going to be the Herbal Essences Curl Boosting Mousse in the purple bottle \n\nI get my hair trimmed every 8 weeks &amp; i get my roots touched up w/ a brown-copper every 16 weeks. I do sleep with a silk bonnet and if im wearing my hair up, it’s always with a banana clip or a claw clip. \n\nNow, my main problem is the top of my hair, from basically the tops of my ears and up. It’s super flat and just doesn’t want to curl. I used to get my hair bleached (highlights) so normally I’d say that was the issue but it’s been so long that I don’t have any left in my hair. The bottom of my hair is super curly. Everything above that, I basically have to force to somewhat curl with a comb (I’ll brush it and twist it around the tail end of a rat tail comb like one would with a denman brush). A few months ago, I cut my hair up to my shoulders and got a lot of layers to see if that would help the top of my hair curl but alas, it did not. \n\nI’ve attached photos just to show exactly what I’m talking about. The non-collage one best represents what my hair looks like after my full routine and you can see the top is just meh and ive sorta forced it to curl (btw im a natural sandy-blonde and when im outside a lot, the top of my hair gets a lot lighter - that’s why i stopped bleaching my hair). I understand that I could just have different curl types and it can truly be that drastic of a difference between the curl types on one person’s head, but the top front of my hair near my face just started to curl up right at the root (it’s never done this before- image of this also included) so I think there’s potential and I’m not sure what else I can do to bring those out. \n\nAny help or recommendations is greatly appreciated 🫶🏼",

Then I decided to just use a gentle cleanser and moisturizer that I am sure is not clogging my pores because it hasn't in last 3 months-i am still getting new pimples like this every day.They aren't painful they aren't itchy they are just red and persistent.\n\nI have a BHA exfoliator but I only used it once and was scared to continue as I felt it might irritate it more and cause more breakouts? I don't know what should I do and dermatologist never helped me,I went two times and both times she told me to use benzoyl peroxide 5% two times a day AS A CREAM ON MY WHOLE FACE. I didn't think much and did it and it burned me so bad i had to stop after a few days because my skin was horrible. I then picked some asian beauty products and my skin finally healed until september started.... \n\nIf anyone has any tips please reply!",

      "content": "# Dry/flaky/itchy/hot… HELP\n\nHi all!\n\nI had pretty good skin since I got through puberty. Some breakouts due to PCOS, but generally well balanced, well behaved skin.\n\nThe day I turned 30 it all went sideways. That week I tried the Aztec clay mask my SIL loved, it was almost like my skin was burnt and has been dry and temperamental ever since. I’m now 36.\n\nI’ve had eczema around my eyes over the last number of years; it flares up from time to time, I’ve used RX steroids to keep it in check (a very tiny amount on occasion, not used in over a year now).\n\nWell, now my face is like a pendulum, it swings to dry, hot, flaky, itchy all over my face, viable red “patches” that are worse. And then it sort of settles out and is just clear, mostly fine skin. It could be smoother, it could be less red, but generally it’s fine in those periods.\n\nWhen the hot, itchy phase passes, it’s very very dry, very flaky. On the occasions I’ve “exfoliated” with a soft wash cloth to get the flakes off, the skin under is tender but very smooth and seems to absorb lotion better.\n\nWhether it’s angry or happy I tend to the same (boring, plain) products that doesn’t seem to make anything worse.\n\nLRP toleriane dermo cleanse \n\nTower 28 SOS lotion \n\nPaula’s Choice ceramide “booster”, on occasion \n\nAtobarrier 365 moisturizing cream mist, on occasion\n\nRarely I'll use Dermalogical Milkfoliant to get the flakes off when I just can't stand it anymore, it doesn't seem to cause a flare up of anything and does take the flakes down which is helpful\n\nIf I wear makeup (rare now that my skin is so temperamental) I use the Naturium balm cleanser to take it off and then go to the LRP.\n\nI’m lost. My skin is making me so uncomfortable and I feel like an ogre with these red angry patches day to day.\n\nI haven’t been able to track a food, environment, or product that seems to set the dryness off.\n\nI’ve tried Clinique moisturesurge, I found it didn’t have enough oomph to make me feel hydrated.\n\nI’ve tried cerave lotion and cream, it tended to sit on top of my skin and sort of feel greasy without sinking in.\n\nSnail mucin makes my skin itchy.\n\nLRP hylau b5 serum I found very fragranced so I cut that out a few years ago when I found my skin getting more sensitive.\n\nAnything with vitamin C seems to almost burn my skin.\n\nAll that to say, please help me.\n\nAny thoughts, suggestions, product recommendations are welcome and encouraged.",

I wash my face, blink, and I’m shiny again. On top of that, my skin is **porous** (i.e., large-looking pores, textured, things seem to hold onto oil/sweat etc).\n\nSo I’m on the hunt for a **cleanser** that:\n\n* Helps control/seb-regulate the oil production (or at least reduce the slick-factor)\n* Doesn’t strip my skin so much that it freaks out or over-compensates by making even more oil\n* Works for porous skin / helps somehow with texture or visible pores\n* Preferably available in India (but if international, worth the buy)\n\nAlso: I know I’m “late” to actively caring for my skin — but is it *too late*? Can oily &amp; porous skin still be improved significantly even if I start now?\n\nWould love recommendations + your routine tweaks that you swear by. Thanks in advance! 🙏",

Then I use Not Your Mother's curl talk curl cream after the shower. I just let my hair air dry, but I do have a diffuser. \n\nIt's not much right now because I got a severe flare up of sebderm a while back and didn't know what was going on, it took months to figure out how to treat it, and now it's gone but my hair texture is weird. My ends specifically are getting matted easily, and look weird. \n\nThe first three images are how my hair, ends specifically, look now, but the fourth one is how I looked earlier after my shower (10 ish hours ago). I want to keep my curls alive all day, and have both definition and volume in them. Again, I have sebderm, and also I have low porosity hair if that matters (?). Please help me!!!

Also I was overweight and drinking alcohol almost daily plus smoking couple of packs of cigarettes every day.\n\nSince 4 months back, I started eating clean food, doing workout, no alcohol at all, and I lost 12 kgs weight. Now 90% of the darkness on my neck has gone away, which is very good.\n\nBut on the side and back of neck, there is this thick line like thing which is not going. My fitness coach said that since most things improved with diet, the remaining needs some skin care like vitamin C serum to remove it. I never did any skin care in my whole life, so I don't know what to do.\n\nAnyone else had this problem? What vitamin C serum should I use for neck dark lines? Or any simple tips for beginner like me? Please help to get rid of this. Thanks!\n\n",
