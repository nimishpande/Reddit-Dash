      "title": "Before &amp; After Cutting Length and Dyeing My Hair",
      "content": "Hi! I’m sharing my current curly hair routine and would love any feedback.\n\nHair &amp; Background:\n\nI have medium-density curly hair. I recently cut my hair from mid-back length to a medium length (just above the trapezius/collarbone area) and also had it professionally dyed. I don’t chemically straighten my hair.\n\nWash Schedule:\n\nI wash my hair every 2–3 days. Between washes, I thoroughly rinse my hair with water only.\n\nCleanse:\n\nOn wash days, I start by rinsing my hair thoroughly with water. I then use VIONA 2% ketoconazole shampoo, applying it mainly to my scalp, letting it sit briefly, and rinsing thoroughly. About once a month, I use AG Care Balance &amp; Boost Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo instead.\n\nCondition &amp; Treatments:\n\nAfter shampooing, I condition with SheaMoisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Shine Conditioner, applying it to mid-lengths and ends and rinsing it out fully. Every 1–2 weeks, I use AG Care Nourish Snow Mushroom Moisture Mask in place of regular conditioner, leaving it on for a few minutes before rinsing. About once a month, I also use AG Care Balance &amp; Boost Apple Cider Vinegar Conditioner.\n\nLeave-In &amp; Styling:\n\nImmediately after turning off the shower, while my hair is still very damp, I apply my leave-in and styling products. First, I use AG Care Fast Food Leave-On Conditioner (about a half baby-carrot sized amount), scrunching it into my hair and up toward the roots. Then I apply AG Care Re:coil Curl Activator, using about 1–2 pea-sized amounts, and scrunch again.\n\nDrying:\n\nI diffuse my hair, spending time diffusing all the way down to the scalp to maximize curl definition and spring.\n\nSleep Routine:\n\nI sleep on a silk pillowcase. I used to sleep with a silk bonnet, but found it compressed my curls too much overnight. Since my hair is shorter now, the pillowcase alone has been working better for preserving curl shape.\n\nNotes:\n\nSince cutting my hair shorter, my curls feel noticeably bouncier, springier, and more alive. My hair is much easier to manage and control at this length, and my curl pattern really shows up better overall. I’m really happy with how light and healthy it feels now.\n\nOpen to any routine feedback or styling suggestions. Thanks!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "title": "[Routine Help] Recurring Tretinoin burning/barrier irritation",
      "content": "Some background, I had been basically dealing with adult acne for the past like 2 years. The first year was moderately controlled with some actives, mostly clindamycin/bp, and .01% tretinoin sparingly. I think its worth noting I started having problems in the winter. Acne was mostly under control, but I wasn't using the tretinoin. \n\nFast forward to about October of the following year, I started to develop some pretty bad cystic acne. This prompted like 6 months of antibiotics, and switching to dapsone instead of the clindamycin. During this time , I started using more tretinoin, and got used to it. I was generally able to tolerate that strongest tret using it like 4-5 nights a week. After the antibiotics, I rarely saw an acne, and it wasn't cystic and they stopped appearing above my beard line. my skin was great. \n\nFast forward to about october again, when it started to get a little dryer and colder, ( and coincidentally when i started to mess with Salicylic acid) I noticed little irritation patches appear around my cheek/nose area, which might have been the trigger I abruptly stopped everything, and waited for these things to resolve. Granted my tret use definitely dwindled prior to this, but I just need some advice on how to heal these. I've seen them \"go away\" which i would use tret again, and try and avoid putting it directly on these areas, but it got to the point where i just had to stop for a few weeks at at ime. But during this, my skin clearly needs some sort of prevention because the texture of my skin got worse, and i get these little closed comedomes, and mild forms of acne that I typically wouldn't while not using any tret. I've had a few days throughout the a few weeks where my skin looks great, but then these irritation patches just come up quickly again, and i'm stuck in this loop. Not sure what to do, because when i went to the derm last time, it was healed pretty well, and they didn't see anything, even though it popped up a day later. \n\nAnyways, ranting aside, willing to answer more questions about timeline. I just need some advice on how to fix this. It's strange because I used to be tolerant to tret , but now its just annoying. I've tried to throw some products into the fray, but my main products are , cetaphil gentle cleanser, vanicream facial moisturizer, elta md sunscreen. I'm pretty sure I got away with just these in the warmer months. Since being irritated, ive tried lrp cicaplast balm, and aveeno calm and restore serum. I've also been trying Aestura cream at nights to give a little more barrier friendly support. What more/less should I do? and how do stop this cycle of tret irritation. I also cleanse probably 2-3 times a day, maybe thats a lot. Once in the morning, another after the gym even if i sweat a lot or not, and once at night. \n\nOh also worth noting i've always sandwiched it",

I’m just so unsure what to do and I’d love for your advice and suggestions please. \n\nFor context, I have naturally curly hair (the colour is natural too), but I tend to use heatless curls a lot to make my hair look more “uniform” because I don’t like using product in my hair. \n\nI obviously straighten my bangs, mainly because they typically don’t have a lot of curl in them anymore. \n\nLike I said I’m totally open to any suggestions, even if it’s a whole new cut.

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’d really appreciate some advice on what products to get to achieve clear/glass skin!! I’ve been dealing with constant acne and a rough, basketball-like texture on my forehead for years. I also have what looks like pores/dots all over my nose and around the sides of my nose, and small bumps under my lip on my chin. My face is also generally a bit red, especially around my forehead and the edges of my nose. \n\nI’m looking for 1-3 products max that would fix these problems. So far thinking azelaic acid? And maybe La Roche-Posay Cicaplast balm B5+ bc I got it gifted. Below is some info about my skin:\n\n\\-Skin type: combination (oily forehead+nose area and normal/dry cheeks), acne-prone, slightly sensitive \n\n\\-My climate: humid subtropical to humid temperate. Water is hard. \n\n\\-My routine:\n\n* Dokdo Cleanser. Gently rub around for \\~1 min\n* Pat Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner on damp skin\n* Naturie Hatomugi skin conditioning gel (moisturizer) + layer with Clinique moisturizer\n* Skin Aqua Super Moisture Gel sunscreen\n\nFor mornings I skip the cleanser (water only) and for nights skip the sunscreen.  ",

      "content": "I’ve been diffusing my hair upside down for a long time now and I’m starting to worry about the toll it’s taking on my back.\n\nRoutine:\n\nAfter showering in the morning, I apply all my products and diffuse upside down by standing and bending forward or to the side, holding that position for several minutes at a time. I can really only do this in the bathroom right after my shower.\n\nThis has started to cause noticeable back pain while I’m doing it and occasionally throughout the day, and I’m concerned it’ll worsen over time if I keep diffusing this way.\n\nIs there a better or more ergonomic way to diffuse upside down? Should I be keeping a chair in my bathroom or something and leaning my head back over it while sitting down instead? How are you guys diffusing upside down without developing back or neck issues?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated!",
