Hydrating, silky, zero white cast, and somehow makes your skin feel like it just got back from a facial.\n\nVerdict: 10/10\n\n\n\n2. Minimalist Sunscreen SPF 50\n\nThe “everyday reliable coworker” of sunscreens  never misses a deadline but lacks personality.\n\nLightweight and budget-friendly, but that alcohol smell lingers longer than your ex’s texts.\n\nVerdict: Solid performer, no spark.\n\n\n\n3. Fixderma Shadow SPF 50\n\nMore like Thickderma. Great protection, but the texture could double as cake batter.\n\nIf you’re oily-skinned, this will have you looking like you moisturized with candle wax.\n\nVerdict: Best for dry skin winters only.\n\n\n\n4. Re’equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch\n\nMatte? Yes. Dry touch? Sure. Comfortable? That’s a no.\n\nIt’s like applying successively smaller layers of chalk.\n\nBut hey, it’s one of the few that actually controls sweat.\n\nVerdict: Good for Athletes. Functional, not romantic.\n\n\n\n5. Dot &amp; Key Watermelon Cooling Sunscreen\n\nSmells great, feels cute, and then proceeds to melt faster than your patience in Delhi summer.\n\nGood for “I’m-just-running-to-the-café” days, not for actual sun exposure.\n\nVerdict: Influencer energy, not athlete energy.",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

My main issue was thinning corners, no loss anywhere else. Chat GPT said I’m a good responder and thicker hair should come in the corners also if i grow it out in month 9-12.\n\nI’ve been on finasteride since 25.02, combined with minoxidil, dermastamping, vitamin D, zinc, and ketoconazole shampoo. Open to other supplements as well. When you combine like this, it feels almost impossible to lose hair😂\n\nNice if you give me a comment✌️ New to this",

It used to be much worse, but it's gotten a bit better lately. I also have a lot of acne near my chin and under my neck. I haven't really been able to eliminate it. When I shave, I notice all these symptoms tend to get worse. It's like my skin just gets really irritated.\n\nFor my routine:\n\nTo start my day I usually use DearKlairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream on my face after a shower. I feel it does provide somewhat of a cooling effect, which I feel is helping with my rosacea. My cheeks do not seem as red either.\n\nBefore bed, I like to use Neutrogena Rapid Clear Maximum Strength Acne Face Pads with 2% Salicylic Acid all over my face to hopefully help with the acne. I then apply Aveeno Calm + Restore Oat Gel Facial Moisturizer for Sensitive Skin to sort of counteract any dryness from the acne pads.\n\nSometimes, like before I go out anywhere in public, I do use Neutrogena SkinClearing Blemish Concealer Face Makeup with Salicylic Acid Acne Medicine. It's like a makeup stick. It really helps cover up a lot of my acne, especially near my chin and neck! Should I be using this everyday? Usually I use it like once a week.\n\nI really want to take care of my skin and get rid of the acne, so any advice or thoughts are much appreciated!",

      "content": "I’m getting married on 10/31 and went to get my bangs trimmed yesterday after letting them grow out for a few months. I wanted to give them some time to grow before the wedding and my hair dresser, who I’ve been seeing for 5ish years at this point, said she was going to cut them a little shorter than usual so they’d be at my eyebrows by the wedding. I was totally okay with this as it made sense. However, I’ve never had my bangs come out this uneven before. First two pictures are after just brushing and the second two are after using some heat to even them out. The uneven-ness is definitely better than before but they still look weird. My fiancé said the longer he looks at them the more bowl cut-ish they look — I asked for him to be honest with me and it was exactly what I had been thinking\n\nDoes this look that bad to others? How do I make these decent for my wedding? I never would have thought my hair stylist would have cut them like this since she’s never given me a bad haircut before, let alone just a bang trim. I’m going to talk to my hair stylist for the wedding and let her know.\n\nI’m trying to not freak out over them since I know there’s still a little time but I really hate how they look and have no idea how to deal with them. Any advice is appreciated!\n",

It helps a bit with style, but the selection is usually limited to their own products.\n\n2️⃣ **Manual Photo Editing**  \nI screenshot wigs I like and use free apps to overlay them on my photo. It works, but it’s pretty time-consuming and not super accurate.\n\n3️⃣ **AI-Powered Try-On Sites**  \nLately I’ve been using AI tools that let you upload a selfie and realistically try on wigs from different brands.
