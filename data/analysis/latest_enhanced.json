I don‚Äôt even remember purposely touching hair other than mine lol \n\nhis hair seems to be the complete opposite of my hair. he has low porosity hair that tangles like crazy. I read about tangly hair but omg I repeatedly combed it for what felt like hours. in the next second it looks like a family of meerkats live in there. he also has a lot of breakage from brushing it too harsh.\n\nI essentially used my styling products but to wash and condition we used his stuff.\n\nroutine: head&amp;shoulders shampoo and conditioner, bali curls moisture mask in between, balea curling creme, bali curls volume foam, taft 14 gel, microplop with tshirt, diffuse on high heat low fan and vice versa and then scrunch out the crumch with balea plex care oil\n\nside note: some comments on my last post said they would like their hair washed by me and coincidentally this happend lol ",

The first photo is my products. The 2-6th photos are ones i took today after I woke up. My hair is half dry in weird spots, and just so frizzy and puffy and feels oily. I usually just end up putting it in a bun when it‚Äôs like this so it typically dries straight ish and puffy. The 7th photo is after a haircut I got two weeks ago, and she made it look great! But then the 8th photo is same day as haircut and it still just looks dry and puffy on my roots while the ends are more moisturized and defined.  Is there anything I can do to get mine like the last two? \n\nMy routine is:\n- Was hair every two days\n- Once a week clarifying shampoo (Suave)\n- Shea moisture conditioner every wash \n- After shower smooth in hair cream (pillow soft curls) \n- Then curlsmith curl conditioner\n- Lastly scrunch up with gel \n- I mostly shower at night, so I air dry and it dries overnight (barely)\n\nI know there are probably soo many things wrong with my routine, please please help.

      "content": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30064598/\n\n‚ÄúResults were represented as 5Œ±-R2 / GAPDH fold change. Minoxidil treatment resulted in a 0.22 fold change for 5Œ±-R2 (p &lt; 0.0001). This antiandrogenic effect of minoxidil, shown by significant downregulation of 5Œ±-R2 gene expression in HaCaT cells, may be one of its mechanisms of action in alopecia.‚Äù\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4039155/\n\n‚ÄúAll of the above data were obtained in prostate cancer cell lines or in in vitro studies. To extend these findings to skin cells, we tested whether minoxidil has similar effects in HHDPCs (human hair dermal papilla cells) using an AR reporter assay. AR expression in HHDPCs was confirmed at mRNA (Fig. 4A) and protein (Fig. 4B) levels. As shown in Fig. 4C, minoxidil suppressed AR transcriptional activity in a concentration-dependent manner (compare lanes 4 and 5 to lane 2). We further tested minoxidil effects on AR protein stability in HHDPCs. As shown in Fig. 4D, minoxidil induced a concentration-dependent reduction in AR protein stability. These data provide further evidence that the efficacy of minoxidil in treating AGA may involve suppression of AR-related functions.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.dovepress.com/new-target-for-minoxidil-in-the-treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-DDDT\n\n‚ÄúResults: The combined analysis revealed that minoxidil treatment of AGA not only acts on androgenic receptors (AR) but also on 2 new targets, steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase (CYP17A1) and aromatase (CYP19A1). The biological processes linked to these targets were concentrated on several pathways, including enzymes and hormones. Further experiments have revealed that minoxidil suppresses the expression of AR and CYP17A1, boosts the activity of CYP19A1, decreases the formation and binding of dihydrotestosterone, and enhances the production of estradiol. Through these changes, minoxidil acts as a treatment for AGA.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúConclusion: Minoxidil may act by altering hormonal and enzymatic pathways. Our study finds two new targets (CYP17A1, CYP19A1) of minoxidil and demonstrates that minoxidil inhibits AR. These targets may provide new ideas for drug research.‚Äù\n",

      "title": "[Routine Help] A (Hopefully) Comprehensive Patch Testing Guide for Facial Skincare",
      "content": "I've done a major overhaul of my skincare this year which required a ton of research and experimentation - patch testing techniques were a big challenge in this process, as it was difficult to find detailed guidance. So this is a combination of what I've found through research and learned through experimentation (on myself, so, disclaimer - YMMV); hopefully it offers something more than what's already out there! Additions welcome - if others have found other and/or better methods, please share! I'd love to expand on this to make it as useful as possible.\n\n  \n**Key principle to keep in mind:**\n\nWhen testing products, it's important to remember that positive and negative reactions are related to both ingredients and concentrations, so you will learn much more from testing products with only a single or a few ingredients than you will from testing products with more complex formulas. This guide is just for how to test, not for how to decide what to try.\n\nIf you are trying to build a better understanding of how to manage your skincare needs overall and improve how you select products to try (and avoid endless testing of products that don't work for you), you will need to combine research and experimentation to understand what works for you at the ingredient level. (Can do a separate post on this if there's interest).\n\n\n\n**How to use this guide:**\n\nDepending on your skin type and needs, you may not need to follow every step in this method (I don't) - I've written it as a single process with every possible step that I could find/identify, but the best way to use it is to select the steps that you feel would be beneficial for your needs, and follow them in the same sequence as laid out here. Testing new products requires a tradeoff between risk (consequences of a negative reaction to the product) and discovery/explanatory power (how much you can learn about how/whether the product will work for you as part of a skincare routine), so each step is a test in and of itself, and they've been ordered from lowest to highest risk &amp; explanatory power. More steps = more cautious, fewer steps = faster. \n\nIf you do not experience any negative reactions from one test, move on to the next one you have selected, until you have either determined that you should stop using the product, or tested it sufficiently to feel comfortable including it as a regular product in your routine.\n\n  \n**General notes for all tests:**\n\n* Do not continue any step/test for the recommended duration unless no negative reaction occurs. If you develop a negative reaction to the product you're testing at any point during a specific test, remove the product and discontinue use immediately. If you have an allergic or severe irritation reaction, treat according to medical advice.\n* Re-apply if the product has come off during a test period. If you shower, are sweating, the product could have been wiped off during activity or by clothing, etc, re-apply it. \n* For patch tests on parts of the body where the product is more likely to be rubbed off, e.g. the forearm, you can apply a non-absorbent bandage or patch over the test area once you have applied it and it has dried to prevent it being rubbed off without you realizing. Band-aids are not non-absorbent, but you can apply some extra product to the absorbent pad on the band-aid before putting it over the test area to help balance this out.\n* Allergies vs irritation/breakouts: allergic reactions are more likely to occur in shorter periods (within 48h of application, plus another 72-96h for delayed reactions), whereas irritation reactions can take time to build up. I have outlined tests for allergic reactions and irritation as separate tests to be as thorough as possible, but they can be combined. You may opt to do allergy tests before doing irritation tests (ie apply for 48 then wait 72-96h to rule out delayed reactions before applying again) if your goal is to minimize the symptoms if you do develop an allergic reaction. If you want to reduce testing time more than to limit potential symptoms, you can just apply the product to your selected area 1-2 times a day for the entirety of the testing period, or until a negative reaction develops.\n* The exact right length to test for negative reactions other than allergic reactions varies from person to person, which is why I say 2-8 weeks, and it's up to you to decide exactly how long is right for you. If you have used products before that did not cause irritation, breakouts etc immediately, but did with continued use (up to 6-8 weeks), then however many weeks it took to see that delayed reaction is likely the right time frame for you to use as a testing window. If you have never experienced a delayed reaction or don't remember how long it took, then you may want to default to the most cautious 8 weeks (the length of a full skin turnover cycle is 6-8 weeks) per testing period until you do have a sense of whether or not a shorter period will work for you. You may want to limit tests that are on areas other than your face to a few days each to balance impatience with precaution, just keep in mind that for your face, the longer timelines are necessary to determine how the product really impacts you. This also varies by product type - if you're testing to see if products like moisturizers irritate or benefit your skin, 2-3 weeks may be sufficient, whereas products with actives that can cause purging (see below) or acclimation periods (see below) could require more than 8 weeks. \n* Purging vs breakouts: if you're testing a product with an active that can cause purging, then breakouts may not actually be negative reactions, so if during testing you do break out, you would still want to continue using it for the full 6-8 weeks to see if the breakouts are related purging (in which case they should clear up after 6-8 weeks) or irritation (still persistent after a full skin turnover cycle). It is important to check if the product you are testing contains any ingredients that could cause purging before you start testing, as this will help you select which steps are worthwhile for you in testing, and to make sense of what you observe as you are using the product. \n* Non-daily treatments: many products contain actives that are too strong to be applied daily or require an acclimation period. I have used 1-2 times daily as the standard application method, but the more important instruction to follow is to mimic the frequency that the product would be applied in your skincare routine. For example, I only apply acids every 3rd day in my normal routine, so if I am testing a new acid product, I will only apply it every 3rd day during the testing period. If you are using a product that requires acclimation, but your current routine for that step includes a product that you have already acclimated to using daily (e.g. if you are using a retinol product that you have already acclimated to using daily, but want to test a higher-potency retinol product), apply your current product at the frequency you have already acclimated to, but apply the new product less frequently if the instructions say to apply less frequently while acclimating - this may mean that the testing period will need to be longer to account for the acclimation period, but is the best way to maintain control conditions for the test.\n* When testing, it is important to always have a control as a basis for comparison - without a control, you won't be able to tell if a negative reaction is due to the product you are testing or to other factors. Irritation can be caused by weather, exposure to external stressors, etc. Breakouts can be hormonal, diet-related, etc. If you jump right to applying a product to your whole face, you won't be able to isolate the effect of the product from the effect of other variables, so you are more likely to make attribution errors when interpreting the effect of a new product. \n\n  \n**Patch Testing Method - Successive Process:**\n\n1. To test for allergic reactions that are the easiest to cover up while healing if they do occur, patch test the product on your forearm. Apply the product to a spot on your forearm, and keep it applied for a minimum of 48h. A single application per day may be enough, but to best mimic your facial skincare routine, re-apply morning and evening. At the end of the 48h, you can wash it off and do not need to apply it again; check it daily for 3-4 more days to make sure that there's no delayed reaction.\n2. The skin on your chest (decolletage) is more like the skin on your face than the skin on your forearm is, so it is possible to catch a negative reaction to a product by patch testing on your chest that might not occur when testing on your forearm, and if you do have a negative reaction, you can keep it covered with clothing while it heals. To do a chest patch test, apply the product you are testing to the same small area on your chest 1-2 times per day (mimic the frequency that it would be applied in your skincare routine) for 2-8 weeks. \n3. The skin behind your ear is more sensitive, and similar to the skin on your face, than the skin on your forearm, so it is possible to catch an allergic reaction to a product by patch testing on behind your ear that might not occur in the forearm allergy test. Apply the product to a spot behind one ear, and keep it applied for a minimum of 48h. A single application per day may be enough, but to best mimic your facial skincare routine, re-apply morning and evening. At the end of the 48h, you can wash it off and do not need to apply it again; check it daily for 3 more days to make sure that there's no delayed reaction.\n4. The skin on your neck is more sensitive than the skin on your chest, so it is possible to catch a negative reaction to a product by patch testing on your neck that might not occur when testing on your chest, and if you do have a negative reaction, it will be less noticeable than a reaction on your face. To do a neck patch test, apply the product you are testing to the same small area on your neck 1-2 times per day (mimic the frequency that it would be applied in your skincare routine) for 2-8 weeks.\n5. If you are specifically concerned about irritation or breakouts, you will need to do some testing on the sensitive/breakout-prone areas of your face to be certain of the impact that it will have. If you think that parts of your face may react differently to products than others, try the strip test. Keep the rest of your skincare routine constant, except for a variation in the step of the product that you are testing. To do the strip test, you apply the product in a straight line down one side of your face using your finger, so that it runs down your forehead, along your cheek and edge of your nose, and down your chin (vary where you place the strip if your sensitive/breakout-prone areas are elsewhere). You can either apply your current product for that step over your whole face and then apply the strip on top, or leave the strip bare when applying your current product and then apply the strip. (Avoid applying the strip before your current product, as it could then be spread to areas outside of the strip). Apply the product you are testing to the same strip 1-2 times per day ((mimic the frequency that it would be applied in your skincare routine) for 2-8 weeks. The strip test will let you see how the different sensitive and/or breakout-prone areas on your face react to the new product, and if a negative reaction does develop, it would be limited to a smaller area. \n6. If you are specifically concerned about irritation or breakouts, you will need to do some testing on the sensitive/breakout-prone areas of your face to be certain of the impact that it will have. If you have a specific area on your face that you are concerned about, you can test the product only on that area on one side of your face - if it does cause a negative reaction, it will be visible, but at least it will be limited to one part of your face. Keep the rest of your skincare routine constant, except for a variation in the step of the product that you are testing. To do a sensitive area test, apply the product you are testing to either a strip down the middle of, or the entirety of, the sensitive area of concern on one side of your face only (apply your current product as usual to the same area on the other side), 1-2 times per day (mimic the frequency that it would be applied in your skincare routine) for 2-8 weeks. \n7. If you want to see how the skin on your face reacts overall to a product, while being able to determine the impact of the new product vs other factors, test the product on one side of your face only. Keep the rest of your skincare routine constant, except for a variation in the step of the product that you are testing. To do the half-face test, apply the product you are testing to one half of your face, and apply the current product to the other side, 1-2 times per day (mimic the frequency that it would be applied in your skincare routine) for 2-8 weeks.

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI grew up in a small country town in Australia and I‚Äôm half Nigerian. My family was one of the only ethnically diverse ones in town, and while my mum is a hairdresser (she learned to cut my hair when I was young, thank goodness), I never had anyone around to teach me how to actually style my curls.\n\nBecause of that, I spent years frustrated and embarrassed by my hair, and straightened the hell out of it. Now I want to embrace it properly and give curls a real shot.\n\nI honestly have no idea what the possibilities with my hair are . Some pieces are straightish, maybe from pulling it back, some form loose ringlets, and others are tighter curls. My hair doesn‚Äôt really bunch into larger curls either, if that makes sense. I also have a lot of hair and it‚Äôs thick, comes halfway down my back, and is relatively healthy.\n\nMy biggest issues are the frizz around my face and hairline, puffy roots with little definition, and the inconsistent curl pattern.\n\nThrough my mum I have access to most salon-quality products at wholesale prices, but I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs best to start with. I‚Äôm based in Australia, so recommendations that are actually available here would be amazing.\n\nWhat I‚Äôm hoping for is some guidance (wash day and styling), product recommendations I can find in Australia, and tips for dealing with frizz, root puffiness, and mixed curl patterns.\n\nPlease help - I‚Äôd love to finally learn how to look after my curls properly.\n\nThanks in advance üíú\n\nMy routine: I currently use a NAK purifying shampoo , macadamia natural oil mask as my conditioner and wet brush in a de Lorenzo barrel curl defining lotion. I then slick it back into a bun because it‚Äôs going to look awful\nAnyway and I want to hide it. Sad I know. It usually dries that way and is still a little damp at rhe end of the day \n",
