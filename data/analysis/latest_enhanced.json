I began going to the gym and improved my diet. Skincare wasn’t even on my list, but as I focused on nutrition and fitness, my skin started improving automatically. Later, I wondered how much more I could improve it if I paid attention.\nPhysical activity helped a lot. I go to the gym, but you can do anything  running, sports, or any exercise that makes you sweat and pushes you a little. It contributes more to your skin than people think.\nI don’t go outside much, but for those who do, use sunscreen. Sun damage is real  I’ve seen it on my own skin. Prevention is always easier than fixing it later.\nI had blackheads near my nose and occasional pimples. During my research, I learned that excess oil can cause many skin problems. At that time, I was drinking over 500 ml of milk daily, so I reduced my fat intake. My thinking was simple  if I consume less excess fat, my body may produce less oil. It actually worked. Now I take about 300 ml of milk (mostly in tea) and roughly 35–40 grams of fat in total. Don’t reduce fat completely ,it’s essential just avoid excess.\nI also noticed that whenever I ate outside food frequently, I got pimples. So now I mostly eat clean home food and keep outside meals limited. Balance is important  you don’t have to eliminate it completely.\nI sleep around 7–8 hours, follow a high-protein diet with normal meals, and since I don’t eat many leafy vegetables or salads, I take a multivitamin to cover any gaps.\nMy theory was that the body can heal itself if you provide the right things and in my case, that turned out to be true.\nSo instead of spending too much money on skincare products to fix problems, try fixing the root cause first. Reduce excess fat, stay physically active, eat mostly clean food, sleep properly, and use sunscreen\n\n\n",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine?

With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

I've tried barrier creams which didn't really help, oil cleansing made the pores worse/fill with puss (even with using a water based cleanser after). My skin type is generally dry and sensitive but I have clear skin everywhere apart from my nose and slight redness/bumps on my chin. The only thing I really do regularly for my nose is moisturise once or twice a day because I'm worried anything else will worsen it, but I've realised I don't think thats the way to go if I want to treat this.\n\nMy (very basic) routine:\n\nAM:Dr Althea 147 Barrier Cream on my whole face\n\nPM: Glow Recipe Avocado Cleanser around my eyes to remove makeup (I don't really stick to a cleanser, I just use whatever I currently have)\n\nDr Althea 147 Barrier Cream on dry areas including nose.\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "I had a sudden eczema outbreak around my eyes about two years ago and was given a topical steroid to use “as needed“ after using it for a couple months (which I regret now but was uninformed on its potency after long term use) I decided to stop it after finding out how damaging it truly is at the rate I was using it. My derm was able to prescribe me a non-steroid cream which healed any eczema I had on my face. Fast forward to a couple months later and I started having these stubborn milia appear on my upper cheeks. I believe it’s from the irritation from the prolonged topical steroid and am now using a Tretanoin gel a couple days a week to try and combat the milia. I’ve had a few come to the surface but am nervous to pop them. Should I get them extracted or try glycolic acid once a night on them? I’ve heard people buy small sterile needles to extract them themselves. I’m not sure what to do to get rid of them completely. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

I’m planning to start this routine soon and I’m confused about what sunscreen and moisturizer to use with it.\nThis is what I’m thinking of doing:\nMorning: \n1. Derma Co 2.5% BPO facewash \n2. Minimalist 5% niacinamide \n3. sunscreen\n\nNight: \n1. CeraVe foaming wash \n2. Adapalene (Adaferin) \n3. moisturizer\n\nSince it’s pretty heavy on actives (BPO + adapalene + niacinamide), I really want a good barrier-repairing moisturizer.\nThese are the products I’m looking at right now:\nSunscreens:\n1. UV Doux Gold SPF50\n2. Re’equil Ultra Matte\n3. Derma Co Hyaluronic Aqua Gel\n\nMoisturizers:\n1. Formularx Barrier Relief\n2. Re’equil Ceramide + HA\n3. Derma Co 4% Ceramide\nIf you’ve used any of these, your reviews would be appreciated.\nAlso open to recommendations not on this list if something works better.\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks 🙏",
