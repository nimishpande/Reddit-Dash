I don‚Äôt even remember purposely touching hair other than mine lol \n\nhis hair seems to be the complete opposite of my hair. he has low porosity hair that tangles like crazy. I read about tangly hair but omg I repeatedly combed it for what felt like hours. in the next second it looks like a family of meerkats live in there. he also has a lot of breakage from brushing it too harsh.\n\nI essentially used my styling products but to wash and condition we used his stuff.\n\nroutine: head&amp;shoulders shampoo and conditioner, bali curls moisture mask in between, balea curling creme, bali curls volume foam, taft 14 gel, microplop with tshirt, diffuse on high heat low fan and vice versa and then scrunch out the crumch with balea plex care oil\n\nside note: some comments on my last post said they would like their hair washed by me and coincidentally this happend lol ",

The first photo is my products. The 2-6th photos are ones i took today after I woke up. My hair is half dry in weird spots, and just so frizzy and puffy and feels oily. I usually just end up putting it in a bun when it‚Äôs like this so it typically dries straight ish and puffy. The 7th photo is after a haircut I got two weeks ago, and she made it look great! But then the 8th photo is same day as haircut and it still just looks dry and puffy on my roots while the ends are more moisturized and defined.  Is there anything I can do to get mine like the last two? \n\nMy routine is:\n- Was hair every two days\n- Once a week clarifying shampoo (Suave)\n- Shea moisture conditioner every wash \n- After shower smooth in hair cream (pillow soft curls) \n- Then curlsmith curl conditioner\n- Lastly scrunch up with gel \n- I mostly shower at night, so I air dry and it dries overnight (barely)\n\nI know there are probably soo many things wrong with my routine, please please help.

The next morning is when i start my routine, and i wet it like crazy and then section off the crown of my head. Then i work in 4in sections on either side of my ear (leaving a section in the back to avoid a part) and run the cream through my hair with fingers followed by the tangle tweezer detangling brush(9 bucks at target). I get the gel and run my hands flat along the sections (normally 3 per section of hair). Then i use the deranged brush to brush style the sections. When i finish the back doing the same method, i part 5 horizontal sections in the crown of my head and do the same thing. I like a side part so after i've styled my curls i work a side part. Then i go over with mousse with flat hands and scrunch. I get a cotton t shirt and scrunch the water out and then i blow dry my hair. I ride a bike to work and now work at an office job. When i ride my bike i claw clip my hair and wear a bandana to protect it from the wind and my hair lasts 5 days, albeit very frizzy on the last day. When i worked retail my hair only lasted a day lol.\n\nANYWAYS LOL \n\nthe first picture was a week ago and the second was two years ago. i'm so proud of myself. I was never taught how to style my hair as a kid and only learned when i moved out over the last few years. I was dying my hair very heavily at one point, split dye black and pink, until i realized how damaged my hair was; it could barely form a curl. I had finger curled my hair on the second picture but it looked so mangly but i was so proud in the moment. So i went all black but then the black faded on the side that was formerly pink, leaving that super light brown you see there. The light brown is only on the old pink side, so half of my head! The other half is the normal dark brown. But once i stopped dying my hair it became so healthy. I am a little overdue for a trim (i trim my own hair) but otherwise i think im doing great!!",

      "content": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30064598/\n\n‚ÄúResults were represented as 5Œ±-R2 / GAPDH fold change. Minoxidil treatment resulted in a 0.22 fold change for 5Œ±-R2 (p &lt; 0.0001). This antiandrogenic effect of minoxidil, shown by significant downregulation of 5Œ±-R2 gene expression in HaCaT cells, may be one of its mechanisms of action in alopecia.‚Äù\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4039155/\n\n‚ÄúAll of the above data were obtained in prostate cancer cell lines or in in vitro studies. To extend these findings to skin cells, we tested whether minoxidil has similar effects in HHDPCs (human hair dermal papilla cells) using an AR reporter assay. AR expression in HHDPCs was confirmed at mRNA (Fig. 4A) and protein (Fig. 4B) levels. As shown in Fig. 4C, minoxidil suppressed AR transcriptional activity in a concentration-dependent manner (compare lanes 4 and 5 to lane 2). We further tested minoxidil effects on AR protein stability in HHDPCs. As shown in Fig. 4D, minoxidil induced a concentration-dependent reduction in AR protein stability. These data provide further evidence that the efficacy of minoxidil in treating AGA may involve suppression of AR-related functions.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.dovepress.com/new-target-for-minoxidil-in-the-treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-DDDT\n\n‚ÄúResults: The combined analysis revealed that minoxidil treatment of AGA not only acts on androgenic receptors (AR) but also on 2 new targets, steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase (CYP17A1) and aromatase (CYP19A1). The biological processes linked to these targets were concentrated on several pathways, including enzymes and hormones. Further experiments have revealed that minoxidil suppresses the expression of AR and CYP17A1, boosts the activity of CYP19A1, decreases the formation and binding of dihydrotestosterone, and enhances the production of estradiol. Through these changes, minoxidil acts as a treatment for AGA.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúConclusion: Minoxidil may act by altering hormonal and enzymatic pathways. Our study finds two new targets (CYP17A1, CYP19A1) of minoxidil and demonstrates that minoxidil inhibits AR. These targets may provide new ideas for drug research.‚Äù\n",

So, it‚Äôs not nearly as full as it used to be and I worry about when the hair/makeup stylist tries to style it for our upcoming big day. \n\nI went to Sally‚Äôs today to get some clip-in extensions for some temporary fullness (tape-in would cause future damage and my hair is too fine for sew-in) and the only color match they had was a weft, so I got some thread, some clips, and the weft (it‚Äôs 100% natural human hair). I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs good to do double layers of the weft on a clip, but I also need to cut it for what size pieces I need. \n\nI saw online about sealing the weft, so do I need to do that regardless of me trimming it into separate pieces? I saw stuff about a hot glue gun to I guess seal the sides? \n\nI just want to make sure I don‚Äôt mess this up and ruin the hair because it wasn‚Äôt cheap, and I feel like I‚Äôm flying blind. \n\nAny and all advice/help is immensely appreciated!

Sometimes in the morning if it‚Äôs crazy I redamp it a little to spring up the curls. But it does look a little wild by the time she gets home. Are there any tips I can use to make it better.

So i cut out everything and used only a ceramide (the iunk one) moisturizer for a whole month. no improvement to the plastic film thing. my skin is also constantly red, and becomes extremely flushed when there is heat. sometimes my cheeks tingle/pulse, and i tend to get big fat nodules on my cheeks as well as papules. the redness is where i get acne, and on top of the redness are these patchy shiny bits that are also kind of discoloured (darker) than my normal skin tone. i've been told by people that its seb derm/rosacea, but currently i am using antifungal and antibacterial products and see no difference ESPECIALLY with the shiny tight bits. my current routine is:\n\nAM:\n\n\\- lactoferrin\n\n\\- IUNK ceramide cream\n\n\\- mineral spf\n\nPM:\n\n\\- sandwich either sulfur ointment or azelaic acid 20% (haven't noticed irritation from either)\n\n\\- IUNK ceramide cream\n\nplease help! any suggestions would be appreciated :) thank u and good luck to everyone w their skin! hope everyone's skin clears up!",

No vellus body hair. No new hair growth on the scalp, not even vellus. I think it did show a bit of growth in the first month or two, but then it completely plateaued or maybe those bits of hairs fell out because they‚Äôre nowhere to be found. \n\nBoth oral and topical are 5%. Oral once a day topical twice a day as directed. Brand used for oral is called Hirsutin, purchased from a reputable pharmacy.\n\nShould I go back to topical?

My family was one of the only ethnically diverse ones in town, and while my mum is a hairdresser (she learned to cut my hair when I was young, thank goodness), I never had anyone around to teach me how to actually style my curls.\n\nBecause of that, I spent years frustrated and embarrassed by my hair, and straightened the hell out of it. Now I want to embrace it properly and give curls a real shot.\n\nI honestly have no idea what the possibilities with my hair are . Some pieces are straightish, maybe from pulling it back, some form loose ringlets, and others are tighter curls. My hair doesn‚Äôt really bunch into larger curls either, if that makes sense. I also have a lot of hair and it‚Äôs thick, comes halfway down my back, and is relatively healthy.\n\nMy biggest issues are the frizz around my face and hairline, puffy roots with little definition, and the inconsistent curl pattern.\n\nThrough my mum I have access to most salon-quality products at wholesale prices, but I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs best to start with. I‚Äôm based in Australia, so recommendations that are actually available here would be amazing.\n\nWhat I‚Äôm hoping for is some guidance (wash day and styling), product recommendations I can find in Australia, and tips for dealing with frizz, root puffiness, and mixed curl patterns.\n\nPlease help - I‚Äôd love to finally learn how to look after my curls properly.\n\nThanks in advance üíú\n\nMy routine: I currently use a NAK purifying shampoo , macadamia natural oil mask as my conditioner and wet brush in a de Lorenzo barrel curl defining lotion. I then slick it back into a bun because it‚Äôs going to look awful\nAnyway and I want to hide it. Sad I know. It usually dries that way and is still a little damp at rhe end of the day \n",
