Since then, it has grown quite a bit, although it’s noticeably **finer than it used to be**. I’m very grateful for it and now trying to fully **embrace my natural curls** as it continues to grow.\n\nI’ve always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with my hair. It was wavy when I was younger and became curly in my 20s, but I struggled with frizz and lack of definition. In the past, I often kept it short, but this time I’d like to let it grow and learn how to take care of it properly without relying on heat.\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n1) Cleanse\n   * *Cantu Sulfate-Free Cleansing Cream Shampoo*\n   * Alternated with a hard water shampoo (used occasionally for buildup)\n2) Condition\n   * *Acure Smooth &amp; Shine Conditioner\n   * Applied mainly to mid-lengths and ends, then rinsed out\n3) Styling (on soaking-wet or very damp hair):\n   * *Cantu Curl Activator Cream* **or**\n   * *SheaMoisture Curl Mousse* (lighter option)\n   * *Aveda smoothing cream used in the past, not very effective.*\n4) Application technique:\n   * Products applied with hands using light raking, followed by scrunching\n   * No brushes used for styling\n5) Drying:**\n   * Air-dry in summer\n   * In colder months, partial dry mixed with diffusing\n\n The photo I’m referencing is a day post-wash and my curls still look messy and undefined to me.\n\n**Hair &amp; Lifestyle Info**\n\n* Fine, curly hair (post-chemo regrowth)\n* Side sleeper\n* Full-time job + kids\n* Prefer a **simple routine under 20 minutes**\n\n**What I’m Looking For**\n\nI’d love recommendations for:\n\n* Products that give **better curl definition** for fine hair\n* Lightweight gels, mousses, or creams that help reduce frizz\n* Tips for improving **day-1 and next-day curls**\n* Low-effort nighttime protection options\n\nThank you so much in advance — any advice is truly appreciated 💛",

I’m F24 and looking for any insight into how my skin might have deteriorated so quickly in such a short amount of time.\n\nI went from oily acne prone but smooth skin to complete cystic, on entire face in 2-3 months. I’ve also had an outbreak of perioral dermstitis. I’m currently on accutane, but want to maybe understand what happened and how to prevent it in the future. I'm so sad I might have ruined my skin and might not be able to continue with the accutane due to other side effects.\n\n**Retracing my steps:**\n\nApologies for the Novel lol.\n\nI have always had oily, acne prone skin, and bad picking tendencies.\n\nI first went to a derm a year ago regarding a few too many pesky pimples that scared me. Looking back it was literally nothing but I hated having any bumps and knew I was best at not picking my skin when it was clear. The derm diagnosed me with rosacea, and prescribed me clindamyacin+benzoyl peroxide cream. It burned my face day 2 so I stopped using it and kind of considered her a dud.\n\nI continued using a gentle routine and occasionally BP or SA on spots with varying success.\n\nMy biggest focus was finding an SPF that worked for me: Any kind of chemical sunscreen would make my face flush and burn and break out. Zinc worked best, but it was heavy and often formulated with oils that caused CCs. I also struggled with removal- I had been double cleansing, once with oil, then again with regular face wash. I avoided washing my face in mornings to avoid stripping. I started a few vitamins and diet improvements hoping they would help my skin.\n\nEventually I just gave up on actives and just started using zinc cream on everything, and just washing at night and moisturizing. An spf I used over the summer was a suspect in causing a bunch of closed comedones, so I stopped using any spf once the UV hit 2 in my area.\n\nSeptember was also when I started feeling extremely stressed out due to a few different events in life, but they were silly and I didn’t expect them to change my life much. I also began a prescribed VitD supplement once a week.\n\nIn October of 2025, I experienced a break out of tiny red bumps all over my cheekbones. I thought it was rosacea type 2, panicked, immediatley went back to the derm (same one, she was just closest and covered by insurance)\n\nShe prescribed me Soolantra and metrogel. I was consistent with the Soolantra for 8 weeks but gave up when my skin barrier started feeling worse and I saw zero improvement, and an increase in cystic pimples.\n\nMy skin went down hill from there. My entire face erupted, despite keeping my routine extremely gentle, and the breakouts suddenly started leaving dark spot and red spots. This had never happened to me before.\n\nI went back to the derm, who suggested either spirolactone or accutane. I chose to start the iPledge process with accutane because the idea of having to take spirolactone indefinitely seemed unappealing to me. However, I was also PETRIFIED of accutane. I spent the entire month long waiting period crying and stressed about my skin, and starting the drug. Obviously my skin did not improve lol.\n\nI was given Clindamyacin for the POD, which has helped a lot. Did nothing for the acne though.\n\nI’m now on 20mg a day and constantly second guessing my choice. I was so sick of my skin freaking out at everything and just wanted to nuke it, but now I’m torturing my entire body with this drug.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\nMy rosacea makes my skin not tolerate so many things. I cannot use retinols or exfoliants because it just freaks my skin out. I can’t use chemical sunscreens. Anything vaguely comedogenic gives me closed comedones. It seems like accutane is my only option.\n\nI have tried cutting all kinds of things from my diet as well, but realized I was losing weight I could not afford to lose. So restricting is not really a viable option. I thought accutane could be a workaround so I don’t have to cut out eggs or cheese or bread.\n\n**Potential causes:**\n\nStress\n\nDiet\n\nDestroyed my barrier\n\nB12? (I stopped the b12 when my skin got worse, but it did not improve after 2 months, so probably not)\n\nHigh vitamin D dose? Or the deficiency?\n\nBad reaction to gentle products (S.Nature Rice Fomaing cleanser and Geek and Gorgeous Hydration Station)\n\n**More background:**\n\nI do not drink. I do not smoke. I don’t eat out more than 2x a month. I don't even drink coffee. I change my pillowcase daily. I use clean towels to dry my face. Clean hands for product application. Billions of pimple patches have been used. 6-9 hours of sleep a night, working on improving that. Zero drug use. I work out daily. Lots of yoga.\n\nI got my hormones tested right before starting accutane as well, came back healthy and clean and whatnot. My thyroid is fine, all my blood work is fine other than Ferretin and Vit D which I take supplements for.\n\n***Thank you*** to anyone who took the time to read or even skim this. Any relatable stories are also greatly appreciated. I can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel right now and appreciate any answer or comments",

I’ve included pictures of what I currently use.\n\nI use the Clean and Clear foaming scrub once in the morning after waking up, then again before going to bed at night. I always use Gold Bond after washing my face to rehydrate my skin since the foaming scrub dries everything out, (Aquaphor if my skin is especially dry that day) but I feel like I could be doing more. My skin is pretty normal, not too oily, not too dry.\n\nI want my skin to really glow and clear up. I don’t get blackheads, whiteheads or really any acne, just want to look smooth and youthful. I’m trying to drink more water, so that helps, but what else can I do? Should I change what I’m using? I don’t have an issues with budgeting for potentially a more expensive regime.\n\nIf it helps, I currently take biotin and Beta carotene supplements and eat a pretty balanced diet.",

I have low porosity, thin, dense hair and I don’t know what products I should use to style it. Since my hair is low porosity, my hair is typically straight when very wet and it takes a while to dry. All of the photos above are of my hair styled with Pattern Curl Mousse and a diffuser except for the last photo. The last photo is a picture of my hair when damp with absolutely no product. I don’t know what the best wavy routine and products there are, and I just started taking care of my wavy hair, so if anyone has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated! P.S- I know products like Curl Smith Weightless Air Dry Cream are too heavy for my hair- using it ends up making my hair a lot straighter ",

I have generally avoided mousse as I have never thought it to be satisfactory for frizz control and hold (both of which I struggle with; my hair is falling apart by day two unless I refresh it with a good bit of gel and water), but if you might be able to recommend a product which is good on both of those whilst helping promote more lightweight and airy curls, I would certainly appreciate it.

      "content": "Product and Technique Advice?\n\nI currently use SheaMoisture manuka honey and yogurt shampoo and conditioner, but I’m pretty sure it’s way too heavy for me since I have fine and I \\\\\\*think\\\\\\* 2B ish hair. I’m a guy and wouldn’t really be all that concerned about my hair, but most drugstore shampoos (dove, pantene, head and shoulders, etc.) obliterated my hair and scalp, so I’m trying to dial in my shampoo and conditioner picks, frequency, and products if any since I don’t use any styling products, I just comb my hair while wet and move on. I currently use a Kent saw cut comb but not wide toothed, and on days I don’t shampoo I still wash my hair thoroughly with cold water. I do have super light flakes, but it doesn’t bother me at all as long as I shampoo my hair every 2-3 days, so I haven’t bothered with actives like pyrithione zinc or Nizoral since those \\\\\\*also\\\\\\* obliterated my hair in the past. The only product I’ve tried in the past was Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk leave in conditioner which just got super dry and crusty in my hair, I’ve never done gels or clays or pomades or sea salt sprays or anything like that before, so I’m more or less going into this totally blind.\n\nOr, tl;dr\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. Shampoo: SheaMoisture Manuka Honey and Yogurt, thoroughly scrubbed into scalp and washed\n\n2. Conditioner: SheaMoisture Manuka Honey and Yogurt, small amount spread on hands, which are then ran over my hair, then washed less than a minute later\n\n3. Other Products: as of right now? None\n\n4. Drying: excess water dried with towel, hair then combed, then hair wrapped in towel again for a few minutes, towel then removed for the rest to be done air dried, then hair lightly scrunched with fingers\n\n5. Misc. Info: pillowcases 400 gsm sateen cotton, comb is Kent saw cut but not wide toothed ",
