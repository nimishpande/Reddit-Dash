This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

Anyway I went a little too short so my hairdresser did a wavy cut initially and said we'd have to wait for it to grow before doing a proper curly cut at the roots as well.\n\nANYWAY, she put this product in my hair and said it would be enough (a curl activator she said which I have attached) and that products like clever curl would be too heavy for my hair. However, this product didn't really hold and dropped easily. I also didn't think it defined very well. I have had an issue with my curls holding especially while it's long. I had stopped my routine on my log hair purely because it just was not holding anymore but not that I've cut it I am looking for a good one.\n\nOn to my question I suppose, are there any recommendations as I am positively overwhelmed by all these options and terms even after reading the guides. I was thinking of trying a combo of the bounce curl light creme gel and kinky curly curl custard gel or jessicurl rocking ringlets and the kinky curly custard (I keep hearing lots of good things about it). Am I even mixing these products correctly? Any advice is much appreciated. I'm not too sure on my hair type as I have heard 2C and and 3A (sounds unlikely) but I am inclined to believe my hair is low porosity?\n\nShampoo: John Frieda Frizz ease dream curls\nConditioner: \"                                                          \"\nStyling: John Frieda curl definining cream and reviving moose\nI diffuse my hair on occasion and let the rest air dry\nI use a silk pillowcase",

      "content": "Hello! I’m pretty new to all of this, so bear with me. Over the past two weeks, I’ve been trying to figure out my hair as part of a general  effort to improve myself. I’m about 70% sure I have curly hair. If that’s wrong, feel free to tell me straight up.\n\nRight now, I’ve been using Not Your Mother’s shampoo and conditioner. I also picked up VO5 shampoo for the co-wash, though I’m still not entirely sure how to use that properly. I’ve only used it once. I bought Eco hair gel and tried it yesterday by using two finger dabs and working it through my hair. I’ve been reading the beginner guides and trying basics like scrunching, but after showering I usually just let my hair air dry.Also, I was told to get curly mousse, can anyone explain how exactly this is different from a hair gel,(I'm an idiot cut me some slack). The order I apply is that typically I do conditioner  wash shampoo wash conditioner again wash then I dry my hair with a towel by patting my head then on non wash days I only apply conditioner.\n\nI’ve heard a lot about leave-in conditioner, and I’m wondering if I’m messing up by rinsing all the conditioner out instead of leaving some in. If I was to leave some in how much should I leave in or is leave in conditioner another different type of conditioner you are meant to apply only after the shower.\n\nMy main concern is that I’m planning to get a haircut in the next two weeks, and I’d really appreciate advice from people who know more about hair than I do. I don’t know much about it. Throughout high school I mostly got buzz cuts because my hair grew fast and my dad wanted to keep it simple.\n\nI’m in college now and want to try something that actually suits me. I don’t want it super long because I do not want frequently get a haircut, but I also really dislike extremely short hair. Buzz cuts especially. I always felt like I looked like an egg. In the past, I usually preferred my hair a bit longer than shorter for that reason because I didn't really feel insecure about it.\n\nOne friend suggested a fade, but he also said he is not really an authority on what to do here since he has wavy hair himself.If it helps after talking to same friend I've determined that my hair is 3A/3B in quality(correct me if I am wrong as always) and I have a rounded face type.\n\nAny suggestions for haircuts, routine changes, or things I’m doing wrong would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nTLDR Newbie to hair care, looked at curly girl, not sure about difference between stuff like curl mousse and hair gel. Plan on getting a haircut that is not a buzz cut for once and wanted some advice on what to do,how to cut it, what kid of looks/cuts to pursue, and look for.",

And I have no idea what a refresh routine is, I got curlier hair as I got older. \nI have a few questions since I don’t really know who to ask:\nMy first one is that I saw a TikTok where the size of the bonnet matters due to hair length, and that a small bonnet would suite shorter hair.

So since tomorrow is a very important day I figured id reach out for help today. For context I am a puerto rican male with short, 3c-4a i think, hair and according to the water cup test I have EXTREMELY low porosity hair. i do not have anyone at all to talk to about my hair so im kinda in this on my own. My dad is the only one who has kinda my hair type but he don’t know what he doing any more then me lol! (he literally uses relaxers as hair cream every day). I am also gonna try to put images below to give whoever is reading this a visual. So basically right now im tryna use the SKALA mais crespinhos (i think thats what its called) hair cream for leave in. the thing is i want my hair to be kinda defined and i honestly have no idea how to use it. I tried to search for so many videos of people using it but all of them either 1.dont have my hair type or 2. have long hair that they can section easily to get good curls. I also noticed though that when i kinda add regular conditioner when washing my hair and pick at it like a afro pick but with my hands, instead of like raking it, it looks not too bad. anyways latley I’ve been trying to follow this video i found with the SKALA.https://www.youtube.com/shorts/\\_6QTIT1jYsk ,But his hair is longer so he can section it and also whenever i try to finger curl my hair like that i can never seem to find my curls that easily since my hair is SUPER thick. anyways im sorry for rambling so much hopefully someone can understand this message, but what I mean to ask is if anyone has a routine i can do for tomorrow using the products I have which are the SKALA cream. echo styler gel and water ig. I don’t mind anyone recommending other products but again since I have to have my hair ready tomorrow I would appreciate a routine i can use with the stuff i have. \n\n\n\nOk so I just realized while reading this over that I didn’t really explain clearly what I need but im to lazy to edit all that so basically i just need someone to explain how I can use the products I have to actually make good defined nice curls (not wet curls). If anyone can reach out to me here i would appreciate it so much. Sorry for the long message too lol.",

      "content": "hi y'all! I'm new to this sub, so I apologize if this question is asked a million times a day, but I would really appreciate some advice.\n\nI've always figured my hair is somewhat wavy because my dad and aunts have very curly hair, and because when my hair is wet, my hair definitely curls a little (photo 1). but once it dries, its way more straight (photo 2). I'm worried that I'm just overestimating my hair's ability to wave and that even if I do a curly routine, nothing will change. so I'd love perspective from this community: could my hair look (when dry) closer to how it is when wet?? I would love that to be true, but am worried I've just deluded myself haha.\n\nmy current routine is just a small amount of \"shea moisture curl &amp; style milk\" post-shower, and I recently started borrowing my friend's diffuser. I use a microfiber towel, too, and plop my hair for a little while before I diffuse on low heat.\n\nso, before I spend money and time on products: I need a reality check! could I have wavier hair?? or is it really just a slight wave and I'm being over-optimistic?? be as blunt as needed... but not too harsh please 😅 any advice on products or routines is also welcomed!",

It gets to the point where the oil literally irritates my eyes and makes them feel uncomfortable.\n\nThe thing is, In the morning after cleansing, it feels very dry. It has that tight/itchy feeling like it’s dehydrated or stripped. But then it becomes super oily by the end of the day. I’ve tried following a gentle routine of using gentle cleansers and moisturizers but it doesn’t seem to be helping. If anything it’s worse when I have moisturizer on because then not only is the oil migrating into my eyes but the moisturizer is as well making them sting even more badly.\n\nI don’t think my skin is truly oily… it feels more like dry/dehydrated skin that’s overproducing oil to make up for the dryness. I hope this makes sense.\n\nAny advice?",

      "content": "Pics 1-3: Dry, Taken after waken up in the morning. 4 and 5 are a few minutes after showering + applying a Shea Moisture Coconut + Hibiscus styling gel.\n\n\n\nDesperately need some help figuring out a hair care routine. I've tried the Curly Girl routine and this is the result. I've used Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus products for both the shampoo, conditioner, and the gel. I'm kind of clueless about what to try at this point. My goal is really to just wear my hair down to show off the curls like in 99% of the posts on this sub, but my hair doesn't seem to want to do that at all, it'll always rise in a weird way after brushing it down and it'll look very awkward and unnatural. I also think my hair has a lot of trouble retaining moisture; only an hour or so after the last two photos, my hair was looking dry and similar to the first 3 photos again.\n\n\n\nI would really appreciate help to figure out a better routine I could use for healthier hair, as well as even recommendations for what a more flattering hairstyle would be for this kind of hair. I'm too scared to do some irreversible change and mess it all up, so I just play it safe and get a tiny bit off the sides every couple of weeks (although I've missed that since November..).\n\n \n\nI've really struggled to find people with my kind of hair (thin, somewhere between coily/curly, and very prone to damage) so hopefully this post could also help someone down the line. Any advice on my exact hair type would also be very helpful.",

Is this a curl cut???? I opted for a regular cut today and they did the exact same thing and it was 35$ cheaper. They insisted i do the curl bc thats whats in my history. Is my hair not curly enough for a curl cut? I never like them style it bc they always brush my hair straight and then defuse it like that and it give NO volume at the top and id go home and do my usual routine anyways. ",

      "content": "Hi,\n\nI grew up in a very dry climate, so I never had major issues with my hair. It’s naturally very thick and gets extremely frizzy and puffy, especially after showering. For years, I managed it by cutting it very short and using a flat iron after every shower, even though I know heat isn’t great for my hair, still better than looking like a scarecrow (it's that horrible).\n\nI once tried a straightening treatment that was supposed to last 8 months, but it only lasted 3, was expensive, left a bad smell on my scalp and hair, and caused a lot of hair fall, so I didn’t want to try that again.\n\nNow I’m living in a very humid country by the ocean for my studies, and my hair has become impossible to manage. Even after straightening, it gets frizzy as soon as I go outside. I’ve tried sulfate-free shampoo, deep conditioning, leave-in products, and anti-frizz serums, but nothing works.\n\nMy classes are starting soon and I don’t want to cut my hair, but I really don’t know what to do. Even tying it up doesn’t help much.\n\nAre there any products or solutions you recommend, or is a straightening treatment my only option?\n\n  \nThese products that I've been using for the past few months by the way:  \nShampoo: Herbal essences potent aloe=bamboo (0% sulfate\\\\silicone)\n\nConditioner: Herbal essences coconut milk conditioner\n\nMask: Garnier ultra doux smoothening hair food 3 in 1\n\nLeave-in conditioner: Cantu shea butter - Condition\n\nSerum: Geovanni Frizz be gone\n\n",
