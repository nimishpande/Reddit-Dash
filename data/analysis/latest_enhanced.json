I just want my skin to feel calm, bouncy, healthy, not sticky and definitely not matte like I'm hiding under makeup. Especially here in Indian humidity, the struggle is real. \n\nBut here's the weird thing: \n\nThis layering approach feels like it's working. the lightweight gel in the morning? No midday meltdown so far. The night cream? My skin woke up calmer than usual. Could be a fluke, could be magic. I'm leaning toward the latter. \n\nSo, fellow skin-warriors battling humidity, sweat and pollution, what's your holy grail for staying hydrated without looking glazed? \n\nDrop your faves, texture tips, application hacks, let's nerd out together.   \n",

It’s been years of trying literally everything including cleansers, toners, antibiotics, topicals, supplements, peels, facials, different diets, cutting dairy, cutting sugar… you name it. My derm has had me on spironolactone, tret, azelaic acid, and even antibiotics at one point. I’m allergic to benzoyl peroxide so that’s off the table too.\n\nThe worst part is I do everything “right.” I double cleanse, change my pillowcases, never sleep in makeup, sanitize my phone, avoid touching my face… and still wake up with 3 new cysts every week. My doctor told me recently that for some people, acne just never fully goes away because it’s “genetically hardwired.” Hearing that honestly crushed me.\n\nIt’s not even vanity at this point - the constant inflammation and pain that wears me down. My cheeks and jawline always hurt, I avoid eye contact with people because I feel like they’re staring at my skin. I don’t take selfies anymore. I can’t remember the last time I looked in the mirror and didn’t feel angry or hopeless.\n\nIt’s exhausting. I feel ugly and broken and resentful of my skin and my genes. I hate that something as dumb as acne can affect my self-esteem this much, but it really does. Just needed to vent because I feel like I’m running out of both options and emotional energy only due to this endless dumb loop.",

However, one day when my mom was looking at my head, she told me I had a bald spot. I'd like to ask for help as to how to treat this issue. I don't know where the little bump is from and how to get rid of it, but my main concern as of the moment is how to regrow my hair in that spot. Can hair follicles still grow there? I really don't want to have a permanent bald spot this early into my first year of college. I'm really sorry for rambling but I'm just so scared and panicking right now since I don't know what to do—I'm massaging coconut oil on my scalp while writing this post. If anybody has some tips or advice please do share, I'd really appreciate the help thank you 🥹",

These are suppose to be the best years of my life and I am so miserable. I have slept away all of this time. I can't live with myself looking like this.\n\n  \nI have been on dutasteride and oral min for about 2 years now. I was thinking I might be okay with many hair transplants and using these meds but a few weeks ago I learned that my biological dad isn't who I thought it was. After seeing a picture of who my bio dad actually is, I now know he is fully bald. I am so depressed and am so panicked.\n\n  \nIn this time I have been scrolling tressless endlessing. Googling answers hoping to find some miracle cure. I have researched hair transplants endlessly but honestly they don't look good at all. Even from top doctors, they are all clearly the product of surgery.\n\n  \nI just want my old hair back. I have been going to therapy twice a week and tried like 20 different antidepressants in this time and none of it will convince me that I am fine the way I am, i just hate it. I go to the gym 3 times a week but I don't feel better during or after. I just stare at all those mirrors on the wall just hating myself.\n\n  \nI have always been a very weak man. I know that I have some pretty severe depression, anxiety, ocd, and body dysmorphia, but I have been seeing a therapy since I was 11 and I don't feel like I have gotten any better since. I just feel like I wasn't meant to be here.\n\n  \nMen go bald all the time, yet this very small thing has completely ruined me. One of my closest friends is balder than me and I don't think he has thought about it for more than 10 combined minutes. I would probably guess that balding has consuming about 8-12 hours of my day for the entire past 4 years. But I guess that is just the OCD loop that won't stop.\n\n  \nI should be happy with my life. I think I am conventially attractive and have a nice body otherwise, I have a girlfriend, many good friends, I have a very good paying engineering job. But I can't get over this one thing and don't think I ever will.",

I'm guessing I'm over washing it, but I like how it makes my hair smell like flowers and the fact that my hair really looks good about and hour after, curls everywhere, the bottom half is super wavy and curly and looks exactly how I want, and the top is an amazing shag that shapes my face and I just love it, but after about 5 hours it turns pretty flat and while the curls are still there, their not as prominent, don't get me wrong it's not straight, but it looks boring.

My skin concerns are dryness, acne, and enlarged pores/sebaceous filaments. I’ve always had issues with complexion products like foundation because my skin looks terrible with makeup on top. I tried to post pictures of my face with no concealer, I don’t have any closeup photos of my skin. My current routine is barely one, but it’s this:\n\n-Try to wash my face every night with neutrogena hydro boost face wash but in reality it’s like once a week. When I shower I just wash with water if I don’t use the neutrogena.\n-moisturize with neutrogena hydro boost water gel either after washing my face or when I take my makeup off with micellar water. \n-I was trying to do a bha chemical peel from the Ordinary once a week but I fell off and don’t do it anymore.\n\nThat’s it. Is there a serum I should be using? Also, are there any other ways to exfoliate besides chemical peels? I find my skin too sensitive to handle it for even a minute.

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "Hey all! In the past couple of years or so, I’ve realized that my hair might actually be curly, rather than the frizzy mess I grew up with. For context, my hair is super thick, super long (down to my hips), gets oily quick, and has always been unruly. Growing up, I’d brush as soon as I was out of the shower and would throw it in a pony tail or a braid, or leave it down to straighten the hell out of it in the morning. \n\nCurrently, I either throw it in a low bun or braid it at night to be more manageable. I’d like to get away with that and wear my hair down more often, but as a mom to a very busy 14 month old, I feel like I don’t have that time. I am also a teacher in the Midwest of the US, so I obviously don’t make a ton of money. \n\nCurrently, I use shampoo and conditioner from either Function of Beauty (with “wavy/curly” hair as one of the customization) or Happy Hair People, which I recently started using. A few years ago when I had the lightbulb moment, I did buy some Shea Moisture curling mousse and some Herbal Essence curling gel. The pictures I have attached are results of me using the Happy Hair People, brushing my hair in the shower with the Wet brush, scrunching in mousse, gel, and then plopping in a shirt for a bit before letting it air dry. I can see some curls, but they’re all so fizzy, and I feel like my hair just looks like a mess. \n\nI’m willing to try gradual changes to try to figure out my hair. I’ve been teetering on the edge of just chopping it off, but I’ve always had very long hair, and it’s part of my identity. I just don’t want to fight with it anymore. If you guys have a simple routine that I could follow with affordable products, I’d greatly appreciate it!",
