      "content": "Hi! I generally love my curly hair, but I don't often wear it down because there's one section of my head that grows almost straight and incredibly fluffy (and has for all 25 years of my life). It's unfortunately really noticeable when I wear my hair naturally, standing out from the curl pattern on the rest of my head, and it bothers me a lot. Styling doesn't help, as this section won't hold a curl no matter how much product I add or how much scrunching I do.\n\nDoes anyone have ideas for what I could do to make this section curly? Maybe per.m this piece? Have you experienced this and found a solution that you like? Thanks in advance :)\n\nThe first image is my normal curl pattern on most of my head and the other two images show the straighter section in different lighting. Sorry they're bad! Trying to avoid doxxing myself\n\n\\[Irrelevant but as required, my routine: I use the Herbal Essences Jojoba Oil &amp; Lavender Curls Shampoo (infrequently) and Aussie Miracle Curls with Coconut Oil Conditioner in the shower, then the Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine Leave In Conditioner and Odele Air Dry Styler (wouldn't recommend) right out of the shower before air drying.\\]",

I haven't been happy with a wash day in a long time. The pictures I've included are in reverse chronological order.  Lately my curls have been feeling stretched out, misshapen, suuuper frizzy. My gel/mousse situation is leaving my hair feeling like straw after it's dry, and also way, way too dry. I'm just kind of at my wit's end. I've tried a good handful of products, am super for real in need of some new recommendations. I started using gel and mousse earlier this year, love the definition and hold, would really love for my hair to still feel soft afterwards though. I feel like my shine is gone too. I have low porosity, medium dense hair, completely virgin, no heat at all since shaving it.\n\nI tried prose a few years back and was really happy with it, couldn't afford to keep getting it. Since looking at the mega document on here and other people's experiences, it seems like it might not be worth a rebuy? \n\nI'm currently using innersense shampoo, conditioner and mousse, loma maximizing volume gel.  \nWash day's just include normal shampoo cleanse, conditioner sits while I do body stuff, scrunch in mousse/gel combo, let it dry, scrunch out. I've tried and failed with some refreshes in between, it usually just ends up in clips or braids before the next wash\n\nwould love product or routine recommendations, drug store or \"designer\", anything in between.

Sometimes I’ll use my Dyson air wrap but only the paddle brush and round brush attachments if I want a little more volume and bounce. \n\nI have moderately thick hair, lower porosity, medium strands. I’m also super oily and a daily washer. I don’t dye my hair and I use heat 1-2x/month. Historically, my hair doesn’t tend to hold styles very well, but I also can’t say I’ve ever tried THAT hard. \n\nRight now, my go-to product when styling is the It’s a 10 miracle leave-in light, followed by a random hairspray. I primarily want to learn how to curl my hair and have it be able to last all day - I ordered a 1.25inch metal long barrel curler and I’ve been watching videos on how to use it. \n\nWhat are some holy grail products that I should try? Goals are volume at the root, lasting style, and a touchable look (not crunchy/crusty). I also don’t want products that will weigh my hair down and make it look flat, which I seem to be pretty prone to. \n\nI’ve got lots of events coming up that I need to be able to style my own hair for (I’m engaged) so I’m ready to do lots of practice on my own time.

It sometimes itches, feels like it’s burning, and I constantly want to smooth it over with my fingers.\n\nIt seemed to get a lot worse after spending several months in a hot, sunny climate earlier this year. I used SPF 50 daily but probably didn’t reapply enough.\n\nAbout 3 months ago after returning, I started using tretinoin 0.025% 2-3x a week and avoided the sun, but it seems to have made things worse. I've since cut out tretinoin about a month ago as it honeslty just felt like it was making the forehead lines even more pronounced.\n\nMy current routine: (for the last 3 months):\n\n* **AM:** CeraVe SPF 50, Simple face cleanser occasionally\n* **PM:** Simple cleanser (cutting back lately), rotating moisturisers (The INKEY List Bio-Active Ceramide, Aveeno Calm+Restore Oat Gel, or CeraVe PM)\n\nI stay well hydrated (2.5-3 L water daily), eat healthy, and train 3–5x per week.  \nDespite all this, the texture and tightness haven’t improved at all.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar or found something that helps repair this kind of damage?",

      "title": "When “50 Hairs a Day” Doesn’t Apply: Understanding Slow-Progressing AGA",
      "content": "In androgenetic alopecia, we usually see a rapid type of hair loss, people who lose a lot of hair within just a few years, often describing how many hairs they find in their hands every day, how much shedding they see, and so on. This post, however, is not about them.\n\nI’m speaking to those who don’t experience that kind of shedding, the slow progressors. Those whose hair loss develops gradually over many years, who know the common saying that “up to 50-100 hairs a day is normal,” and therefore don’t use daily shedding as a measure of their condition. That was me for a long time. I always thought: I’m not losing much hair every day, so I can’t really use that as an indicator.\n\nBut after being on medication for 4.5 months now, I’ve noticed that even my “small” daily loss - around 30 hairs a day before - has dropped to maybe 5–10. In the shower, I barely see any hairs anymore. What I’ve learned is this: just because that general benchmark of “50 hairs per day” didn’t apply to me, doesn’t mean my hair loss was normal. It wasn’t - not for me.\n\nThese general guidelines need to be interpreted individually. If you’re also someone whose loss is slow and subtle rather than fast and diffuse, it might help to realize that even losing “just” 30 hairs per day, if consistent over years, can indicate active miniaturization - and that this process can be stabilized with the right treatment.",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
