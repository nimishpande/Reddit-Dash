      "content": "Actually, I often see people struggling with skincare and asking for help, so I thought why not share what worked for me based on my own experience and experiments? It might help someone.\n\nI attached a picture for reference as the final result, which is as accurate as possible. \n\nA few months ago, I started taking my health seriously. I began going to the gym and improved my diet. Skincare wasn’t even on my list, but as I focused on nutrition and fitness, my skin started improving automatically. Later, I wondered how much more I could improve it if I paid attention.\nPhysical activity helped a lot. I go to the gym, but you can do anything  running, sports, or any exercise that makes you sweat and pushes you a little. It contributes more to your skin than people think.\nI don’t go outside much, but for those who do, use sunscreen. Sun damage is real  I’ve seen it on my own skin. Prevention is always easier than fixing it later.\nI had blackheads near my nose and occasional pimples. During my research, I learned that excess oil can cause many skin problems. At that time, I was drinking over 500 ml of milk daily, so I reduced my fat intake. My thinking was simple  if I consume less excess fat, my body may produce less oil. It actually worked. Now I take about 300 ml of milk (mostly in tea) and roughly 35–40 grams of fat in total. Don’t reduce fat completely ,it’s essential just avoid excess.\nI also noticed that whenever I ate outside food frequently, I got pimples. So now I mostly eat clean home food and keep outside meals limited. Balance is important  you don’t have to eliminate it completely.\nI sleep around 7–8 hours, follow a high-protein diet with normal meals, and since I don’t eat many leafy vegetables or salads, I take a multivitamin to cover any gaps.\nMy theory was that the body can heal itself if you provide the right things and in my case, that turned out to be true.\nSo instead of spending too much money on skincare products to fix problems, try fixing the root cause first. Reduce excess fat, stay physically active, eat mostly clean food, sleep properly, and use sunscreen\n\n\n",

At that time, I was drinking over 500 ml of milk daily, so I reduced my fat intake. My thinking was simple  if I consume less excess fat, my body may produce less oil. It actually worked. Now I take about 300 ml of milk (mostly in tea) and roughly 35–40 grams of fat in total. Don’t reduce fat completely ,it’s essential just avoid excess.\nI also noticed that whenever I ate outside food frequently, I got pimples. So now I mostly eat clean home food and keep outside meals limited. Balance is important  you don’t have to eliminate it completely.\nI sleep around 7–8 hours, follow a high-protein diet with normal meals, and since I don’t eat many leafy vegetables or salads, I take a multivitamin to cover any gaps.\nMy theory was that the body can heal itself if you provide the right things and in my case, that turned out to be true.\nSo instead of spending too much money on skincare products to fix problems, try fixing the root cause first. Reduce excess fat, stay physically active, eat mostly clean food, sleep properly, and use sunscreen\n\nI hope from this info someone would get benefitted ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I've tried barrier creams which didn't really help, oil cleansing made the pores worse/fill with puss (even with using a water based cleanser after). My skin type is generally dry and sensitive but I have clear skin everywhere apart from my nose and slight redness/bumps on my chin. The only thing I really do regularly for my nose is moisturise once or twice a day because I'm worried anything else will worsen it, but I've realised I don't think thats the way to go if I want to treat this.\n\nMy (very basic) routine:\n\nAM:Dr Althea 147 Barrier Cream on my whole face\n\nPM: Glow Recipe Avocado Cleanser around my eyes to remove makeup (I don't really stick to a cleanser, I just use whatever I currently have)\n\nDr Althea 147 Barrier Cream on dry areas including nose.\n\nThank you!",

I feel like I look like a poodle every time it’s down, and don’t really know how to straighten it. I’d love to wear it naturally down but it frizzes no matter what I try. It’s done this my whole life, but I’m sure dying it has not helped. What can I do to make my hair more manageable?\n\nAlso, what’s the cheapest way to get blue out of my hair? I got it done at a salon, no clue what dye was used. I’m walking down the aisle in April and dyed my hair in November (not the smartest choice, I know). At this point, I’m debating just buying a wig and walking down the aisle in that 😔",
