Im back again with my reviews. + I USED AZIDERM 15\n\nDifference: Well ignore the huge brown one in the centre that scar is quite recent so i dont expect it to be gone anytime soon. THE SCARS AROUND IT HOWEVER. I have had them for around 2 and 1/2 years after picking on  my folliculities. MY DERMAT DIDNT HELP BTW. And just after 30 days THEY ARE FINALLY FADING OMG IM GONNA CRY. EVEN MY MOM (BIGGEST HATER BTW) SAID THEY BE FADING 😭🙏🙏🙏🤙🤙🤙🤙💌💌💌💌. I wear makeup everyday to hide em marks but well except for hiding that big centre one i got recently others require minimal to no makeup AT ALL. BLESSING OH GOSH 🙏🙏🙏🙏🥀🥀🥀  ANYWAY ONTO THE REVIEW\n\nFIRST OF ALL ID LIKE TO THANK \n\nAZIDERM 15 \n\nI used to use azeliac acid 10% The ordinary. Never really worked much. BUT THIS STUFF CHANGED EVERYTHING. Its very grainy and if you dont pat ur face fully dry before applying IT ITCHES AND STINGS but worth everything. I use it every next night, pea sized amount WHOLE FACE. Dot forget ur Sunscreen!! 8/10 \n\nMOVING ON TO SUNSCREEN\n\nUV DOUX D TAN \n\nWell sorry but it works but does have its own disadvantages. You need to blend it in superhard until all the white stuff disappears and trust me 2 fingers worth of it dont blend in that easily. Its quite moody AND PILLS OCCASIONALLY. Enough blending prevents pilling but if ya dont blend it for 15 full mins 🥰🥰💔💔💔💔 u are cooked. But I do feel like it provides awesome protection. 6/10\n\nMOISTURIZER\n\nHOLY GRAIL. ATODERM IS PEAK IN THESE HARSH WINTERS OH GOD. LOVE LOVE LOVE 10/10 💌💌💌🙏🙏🙏🙏\n\nSERUMS\n\nMINIMALIST NIACINAMIDE,ALPHA ARBUTIN AND RETINOL I think play a pretty huge role too \n Niacidnamide 9/10\nArbutin 8/10 (too foamy)\nRetinol 7/10 (I dont like the base oil)\n\nEYE CREAM\n\nMinimalist Retinal eyecream. Does literally nothing btw. Waste of money 3/10 just for the cooling effect. \n\n\nTHATS IT YALL BYE BYE 🔥🔥🔥🤙🤙🤙🐎🐎💦💦💦💦",

      "content": "26M | Oily Skin | Routine Review + Barrier Safety, Retinol &amp; Product Suggestions\n\nHi everyone,  \n  \nI’m a 26-year-old male with oily skin and wanted some help reviewing my current skincare and hair care routine. I feel I might be overdoing certain actives, and I’m also noticing slight darkening on my forehead, possibly due to regular hair oiling. I’d really appreciate feedback and suggestions.\n\n# Current Skincare Routine\n\nFace Wash:\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid + LHA Cleanser – 2 times a day\n\nSerum:\n\n* The Derma Co 2% Kojic Acid Serum – morning &amp; night after cleansing\n\nMoisturizer:\n\n* Minimalist Vitamin B5 10% Moisturizer\n* Re’equil Ceramide &amp; Hyaluronic Acid (alternate) (Currently not using)\n\nSunscreen:\n\n* Aqualogica Glow+ Dewy Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ – morning and when stepping out\n\nWeekly Exfoliation:\n\n* The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution – 2x a week (Monday &amp; Friday)\n\nLips:\n\n* Vaseline Lip Balm\n\nBody Care:\n\n* 1% Salicylic Acid Body Wash – daily\n\n# Hair Care Routine\n\n* Shampoo: Arata Super Shampoo – 2x a week\n* Hair Oil: Rosemary + Lavender Hair Oil – used regularly after hair wash\n\nI don’t have hair fall issues, but I feel frequent oiling may be causing product buildup and contributing to forehead darkening or clogged pores near the hairline.\n\n# What I Need Help With\n\n1. Barrier-safe routine: I often see the term barrier-safe here.\n   * What does it actually mean?\n   * Am I overusing actives like salicylic acid, kojic acid, or chemical exfoliation?\n   * What are early signs of a damaged skin barrier in oily skin?\n2. Retinol guidance: I’ve never used retinol before.\n   * Should I add retinol at my age and skin type?\n   * What beginner strength should I start with?\n   * How many times a week is safe initially?\n   * Do I need to stop or reduce other actives if I introduce retinol?\n3. Sunscreen recommendations: I’ve seen many sunscreen suggestions in this sub.\n   * Is my current sunscreen okay for oily skin or should I switch to something more matte/oil-control?\n   * What should I look for in a good sunscreen (PA rating, filters, texture)?\n   * Is sunscreen necessary indoors?\n4. Snail mucin &amp; hydration products: I keep seeing snail mucin and barrier-repair products mentioned.\n   * What does snail mucin actually help with?\n   * Is it suitable for oily skin?\n   * Can it be used alongside actives like retinol or exfoliants?\n5. Hair oil &amp; forehead pigmentation:\n   * Should I reduce oiling frequency or change the oil type?\n   * Any tips to prevent oil-related pigmentation or breakouts near the hairline?\n\nMy goal is to build a simple, long-term, barrier-safe routine rather than using too many actives.  \n  \nThanks in advance, would really appreciate your guidance.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

He even said something like “let’s see how long your hair lasts”, which is exactly what I’m trying to avoid.\n\nMy goal has always been to preserve what I have, not let it thin out and then rely on a transplant later. I’ve already tried PRP and even dutasteride mesotherapy in the past.\n\nThis sudden switch feels like a downgrade from proven treatments to something much weaker.\n\nI’ve booked a second opinion, but wanted to ask here:\n\n\\-Does reducing finasteride to twice a week make sense?\n\n\\-Do “natural DHT blockers” in foams actually do anything?\n\n\\-Has anyone had a doctor suddenly pull them off fin/min after long term use?\n\nAny insight would really help.",

For context, I wash my hair almost every day, usually giving it one day off between washes. However, after washing it, my hair already looks a bit greasy the next day and turns into a complete mess by the day after that. I try putting it into a bun to make the greasiness less noticeable, which helps only a bit, but it’s still hella annoying to wake up and see my hair looking awful. On top of that, I’ve been getting pimples around my hairline, probably because of how oily my hair gets. I use an anti-dandruff shampoo since I’m unfortunately prone to dandruff. How do I fix this greasiness and the pimple issue? I’ve tried spacing out my washes, but it doesn’t really help... That, and I can't be walking out looking like a greasy mess at work.\nCould this be because of my thin hair? Should I get a cleansing shampoo? Anything will be greatly appreciated.",

      "content": "My friend(21F) has a lot of pimple scars. She always breaks them coz... idk why. I try my best to stop her from breaking the new pimples, and it's been going ok. Is there a way to get rid of old pimple scars that are reddish or have a hilly texture? She has agreed to reduce or give up different makeup products for a while, as they just seem to increase the probability of pimples/acne appearing. Her marks look kinda similar to the image I have here. But probably worse, especially during periods which are more red. She mentioned that her mom has a lot of acne scars, just like her.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. If natural, then better.\n\nAlso, if there are other posts regarding this, I apologise in advance, as on searching, I only found how to not let a fresh pimple break or turn into a scar.",

I currently only use the CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser and the Amazon Basics Oil-Free Facial Lotion, and occasionally The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + Hyaluronic Acid serum for dark spots. It's pretty sensitive too, I tried CeraVe's Ultra-Light Moisturizing Gel once and it wrecked my skin (burning sensation, acne, dried it out, the works). I also do makeup maybe like a couple times a month, and it's mostly eye/undereye makeup.\n\nI have no clue where to even start with sunscreen, but I feel like the magic sunscreen I'm looking for may not even be out there. Here's what I'm looking for (and willing to compromise on one or two):\n\n* No scent (really not able to compromise on this one, I have sensory issues and this would drive me crazy)\n* Matte/Mattifying (willing to settle for semi-matte, I'm oily enough)\n* Won't clog my pores\n* Under/around 30 USD\n* Portable container\n* No/very little white cast (I'm pale but not ghostly)\n\nI'll be using this mainly on my face, but having it be good for my hands/neck would be great as well. I'd appreciate any and all help!! Thank you in advance &lt;3",

Sebomoist – moisturizer \n\n2. Benzoyl peroxide gel – He told me to apply it daily in the morning on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer \n\n3. Clindamycin + Nicotinamide gel – To apply in the afternoon for 1 hour and then wash my face \n\n4. Tretinoin gel 0.025% – He told me to apply it in the evening for ½ hour on the affected areas on alternate days, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer \n\n5. He also prescribed some tablets \n\nI asked him which moisturizer I should use, so he wrote one himself. I also asked him about sunscreen, and he said there was no need since there would already be a lot going on on my face, and suggested that I just cover my face if I go out. I told him I have to attend a wedding, and he then said it was fine to use sunscreen, but he didn’t suggest any specific one.\n\nI currently use Neutrogena sunscreen. Should I continue with that?\nAlso, which face wash should I use with this routine?",

Sebomoist – moisturizer \n\n2. Benzoyl peroxide gel – He told me to apply it daily in the morning on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer \n\n3. Clindamycin + Nicotinamide gel – To apply in the afternoon for 1 hour and then wash my face \n\n4. Tretinoin gel 0.025% – He told me to apply it in the evening for ½ hour on the affected areas on alternate days, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer \n\n5. He also prescribed some tablets \n\nI asked him which moisturizer I should use, so he wrote one himself. I also asked him about sunscreen, and he said there was no need since there would already be a lot going on on my face, and suggested that I just cover my face if I go out. I told him I have to attend a wedding, and he then said it was fine to use sunscreen, but he didn’t suggest any specific one.\n\nI currently use Neutrogena sunscreen. Should I continue with that?\nAlso, which face wash should I use with this routine?",
