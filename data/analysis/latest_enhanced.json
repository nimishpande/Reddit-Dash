I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "I recently was gifted a Sephora gift card and decided to make the most of it by getting sample sizes of some items I’ve been wanting to try/hearing a lot of positive buzz about. Mainly, the L’Occitane Shower Almond Oil, which I was most excited about. I love almond, oud, gourmand scents, and I love to layer scents throughout my getting ready process, so I was very hyped to try this and see how it layered into my routine. \n\nOh man was it horrific. The bottle was sealed and packaged well; it was not physically damaged or bulging/bloated suggesting a spoiled product. Upon first removing the inner plastic lining, the smell was mild but pleasant. I went to use it and with a small dollop in my palm, the fragrance was suddenly overwhelming and… metallic. Specifically, it smelled like pennies. Copper. Dirty change. I was really bewildered and thought maybe it was the water from the shower head suddenly bringing up some minerals (I live in an area with hard water and heavy chlorine treatment). Maybe it was one of my products mixing with this shower oil smell and causing a weird chemical reaction. Maybe it was my nose. It definitely couldn’t be this very hyped, quite expensive shower oil. \n\nBut lo’ and behold, upon lathering this oil up, I smelled distinctly like pennies and once I connected the scent to that imagery, it was over for me. I’ve since returned the product and definitely won’t be returning for a second chance. \n\nHas anyone else found this product to smell weird? I’ve had plenty of almond scented products and none have ever been so malodorous. ",

Possibly because I wasn’t using it correctly or so.. \n\nMy hair feels coarse and VERY dry, and frizzes up very fast. And it’s also quite voluminous.. childhood photos show that my hair grew out very big, like a lion’s mane from what my uncle would like to call it.\n\nI figured out I have medium-high porosity hair with around 2C-3A curls, but I’m not completely sure about it yet. \n\nI’ve tried brushing my hair after shower but it just makes it flat and products barely hold on, so I might try brushing before shower but I often just hop in the shower so I have to remember ",

My hair is 4a and chin length when dry. I’m 27 and all the men in my family are super bald.  I'd say my hair was thickest when I was about 18-20, so I may have taken too long to address the hair loss.\n\nPreviously I was on minox for 4 months, then I took a break for 1 month because I had surgery and a long recovery. I stopped my routine during this time, and had lost hair to post-surgical anesthesia shock so I had some fallout. Before surgery I hadn't taken finasteride yet but I had my RX. Pic 1 was taken before restarting minox and adding fin. \n\nMy hair routine:  \n\\- nizoral 2x weekly (full scalp)  \n\\- dermastamp 1x weekly (on hairline and temples) and massage 1x weekly with a plastic massager (full scalp)  \n\\- fin 1.25mg daily oral  \n\\- minox 5% daily topical (on hairline and temples)  \n\\- Trentinoin 2x weekly (on hairline and temples)  \n\\- rosemary oil with biotin after I shower and I leave it in until next shower (every other day I guess)  \n\\- the ordinary hair peptide after I shower and I leave it in until next shower (every other day I guess)  \n\\- biotin and collagen supplements (daily)  \n\\- sleeping with a silk bonnet/durag\n\nQuestions:  \n\\- what is my NW? Is my thinning noticeable, I’ve gotten a few comments on it.  \n\\- I want to transplant hair to my temples and hairline, but I’m not sure if it’s a bad idea so early? Mostly I’d love to square off my hairline and bring it down a bit.  \n\\- Should I be putting minox to my crown and rest of hair even if i'm not noticeably thinning there?  \n\\- if I stop minox, will areas I didn’t use minox on also fall out?  \n\\- my dose of TRT is being adjusted, can I expect more loss on a higher dose, regardless of finasteride?\n\nBasically, what could I improve here in my routine?\n\nThanks all!",

Have these red dots appearing on and off mostly on thighs and calves. No itch, no pain. Feels rough where the bumps are. Have seen doctor (GP only). They have no idea, no diagnosis… except suggested I change body wash. Hoping someone has / seen something similar and know what is this condition I have. I can then figure out what’s the cause and treatment. Condition has spread and over a year long. Thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions.",

I’ve been using this one for a little over a month now but I’m not an expert and am not sure if I should be doing something different. The medical grade stuff (benzoyl peroxide wash, topical solution, and 0.05% tretinoin) were all prescribed to me by my doctor a while ago but I just recently started using the tretinoin consistently, using it every other night. I do the sandwich method with my tret and top it off with the cicaplast gel, which has seemed to improve my flakiness, but I still use an exfoliating mask about twice a week. My skin type is mainly dry and I deal with mostly hormonal acne (I’m 20F) on my cheeks and chin. Any advice is greatly appreciated!! Thanks guys.",

I'm very pale and my hair is very dark so you can see about 2-3mm of the root hair inside my skin after shaving as close as I can. I don't think I have dark armpits, my skin tone is still quite even, its just that the hair shows through so much. I'm not really interested in waxing, plucking, or threading it all out whenever I'm wearing a tank top. I shave my armpits really only whenever I'm going outside in a tank top or something with very short or no sleeves which isn't too often. I know I shouldn't care what people think about it but I'm not looking for that advice. I don't really care what other people think of it, I am the one who wants it less visible. I'm not sure if this is really fixable without eliminating the hair but I'm willing to try things that aren't too expensive. The only thing I've tried besides shaving is nair and at home laser removal which neither worked to lighten or get rid of the hair.",

They sent me a new one as a replacement and it came solid just like the first one.  \n\nNow I'm thinking - does lash glue solidify in the nail since it's winter?
