      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m looking for some advice or help.\n\nI have some scarring on my face, around my nose and chin and a tiny bit on my cheeks.\n\n10 days ago I got co2 fractional laser on my whole face to address it. The clinic said since it was my first treatment they would start at a low level and healing would be quicker and only take 3 days.\n\nThe first few days healing felt normal I had the feeling of sunburn and scabbing but nothing concerning. Now I’m on day 10, I feel like I’ve healed and have no pain or scabs, but I’ve still got the bumps from the laser all over my cheeks and forehead.\n\nToday is the first day after treatment that I’ve worn makeup and the bumps are even more noticeable.\n\nIs this normal? I’ve emailed the clinic but they haven’t replied yet and I’m worried that this is going to be permanent.\n\nIf anyone has any experience with this happening before I would love to hear from you, and also if you have any recommendations for what I should do.\n\nWeirdly, despite getting the laser on my whole face it’s only really on my cheeks and forehead that there are these bumps.\n\nThanks so much in advance",

For a few months. My barrier was certainly never perfect but moving to a different climate this year and starting university had some effect on my skin, and it's not happy anymore. I don't use any actives right now, I'm focusing on gently healing my skin barrier, although I'm not entirely sure how. \n\nI currently do use makeup wipes and rinse with water at night and would like to stop doing that in favor of a cleansing balm and water cleanser combo. I don't know. I use a mild cerave pm moisturizer morning and night. \n\nTL;DR my skin barrier is damaged and I'd like some recommendations if you have any.",

Now I love my hair and I'm trying my best to take care of it but I can't tell what type it is or if there's something wrong with my technique or products. I have to restyle it every morning and I'm not sure how to style it so it's soft instead of in a rigid middle part. \n\nSo my routine is this so far. I start by shampooing my hair thrice, once with a gentle wash, then with a curly hair shampoo then with a two in one shampoo and conditioner. I then use coconut conditioner, brush, ten minutes and wash. After that I apply Aunt Jackie's Leave in, brush and separate into the top part of my hair and the bottom. Apply mark anthony curl cream and Aunt Jackies mousse to the bottom and curl with a curl brush. Do the same to the top. I'm not sure how to use gel without it creating wet frizz so I don't use it anymore. Scrunch with a silk cloth and let it air dry. That's it! I'd love any advice!",

      "content": "I’m looking for some practical advice for mixed-texture hair. My hair is a combination of 3B at the crown, 2C in the front, and closer to 2A on the lower half, and my hair is ALWAYS super frizzy. \n\nI’m trying to find a routine that’s simple and affordable, but still helps everything look somewhat consistent. I have tried the finger coiling method several times, but it’s never worked or maybe I’m just doing it wrong. I’ve used these brands: mielle, treseme, not your mothers, skala, and none of them have been able to fight to frizz nor keep a curl. \n\nI’m also a Latina college student working at a fast-food restaurant, which is part of the problem. By the end of my shift I smell like grease and food, so I have to shower when I get home. That always includes throughly washing my hair, because the smell sticks to it, and it smells so bad. I think the constant washing is starting to dry out my hair even more.\n\nI’m hoping someone else has been in a similar situation — mixed textures + frequent showers because of work — and has some suggestions. What budget-friendly products help keep hair healthy with more frequent washing? Any tips for quick “on the go” styling or products that work well across different curl patterns would also be really helpful.",

Everyone said “give it a few weeks and you’ll like it” but nope-i still feel pretty down about it.\n\nI feel like growing out a bad haircut when it’s curly is hard because my hair is so thick and can be so fluffy in some spots and seem so undefined in others. And now it feels like there’s no way ti hide the unruliness!!!! I want it to grow out healthy and I don’t want to damage the curls trying to beat it into submission after this cut. \n\nWith how much I don’t like it while it’s down, I want to just have it pinned back or in a bun since like I said, probs no blow outs since I want it to grow back asap/be healthy. Yet, to try to get it to behave with what’s been going on, I’ve been hover defusing on low heat but it just fluffs up in these unpredictable ways compared to before when it was longer. I don’t think it’s “curl shock” because it’s been about 3 weeks now. I think it’s just a ROUGH cut for my texture.\n\nAny heat safe or curl styles that someone could suggest to help me not want to just hide for the next 6 months? 🫶\n\nRoutine: alternating with Camille Rose, Shea Moisture, and Curlsmith products. Hand raking the products in. I somehow have pretty defined 3A hair from like my ears forward towards my face but the back is like 2B-2C. \n\n",

When I was younger, I used to “scrunch” my hair with a sea salt spray, but I typically wear my hair straight by towel drying it well, brushing it, and letting it air dry or blow drying with a round brush. My hair is fine and on the thinner side, dries quickly (high porosity?), and I wash every 2-3 days with neuma’s volume shampoo and conditioner. I have been very unhappy with my hair as it started thinning within the last 6 months, so I decided to explore my hair’s natural texture to increase volume.\n\nI’ve been doing some reading about wavy hair, and have been following recommendations to not brush my hair outside of the shower, or to use a wide tooth comb when my head is upside down and the hair is still sopping wet. I have been applying my living proof leave-in conditioner and any other products (usually Aveda curl enhancer cream, and Aveda volumizing tonic to my roots) when my hair is really wet and then plopping and scrunching with a microfiber towel. When I let my hair air dry after doing this, my hair is still wavy at the end of the day. Tonight, I also used frizz ease heat protectant and made a feeble attempt at using the diffuser, and this is how it looks. I’m looking for advice on what type of hair I have (2a/b?) and recommendations on products and routines that might help me get the most out of my hair’s texture. Also, what’s a good refresh routine for the next day so my hair can look halfway decent after sleeping on it 😅\n\nThank you in advance, my curly-haired people!",

Minimalist Alpha Arbutin 2% serum\n3. Minimalist Niacinamide 10% serum\n4. Massage in Minimalist 3% Tranexamic Acid  serum\n5. Minimalist Multi-Peptides\n6. CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum\n\nI used all thses actives based on its recommendations for AM and PM, and alternating Ratinol and Multi peptides for better effect. Of course, it was also suggested by AI.\n\nI have also used Dermco and Dermatouch face was for face cleansing and Dot &amp; Key moisturizer to seal everything in.\n\nNOTHING HAS WORKED SO FAR. Please helpme identify what it is? Is it what AI has suggested me or something else? Also how to remove it completely, if possible.",
