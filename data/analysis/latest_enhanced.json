I only shampoo my scalp and let the foam run down, then condition the mid to ends and detangle while it’s wet. Once a week I use a hair mask instead of conditioner and that helped a lot. After the shower I don’t towel dry, I put my curl cream on while it’s still soaking wet and scrunch, then add a bit of gel. I squeeze the water out with a T-shirt, let it dry without touching it, and once it’s fully dry I scrunch with a little serum. Way less frizz and way more definition so far 😌\n\nProducts I use:\n\nJoviality Curl Wonder Shampoo\n\nBless Conditioner\n\nRaw African Maya Hair Mask\n\nThe Hair Addict Frizz-Off Curl Activator\n\nBio Soft Flaxseed Gel\n\nLocken Glossy Hair Serum",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I've always felt that I have \"bad hair\" compared to all the other girls that I see with pretty hair. And because of that, I used a flat iron to straighten my hair every day throughout all 4 years of high school. Very recently I have given up on fighting my natural hair and now just wish to embrace my natural waves/curls. I'm new to this and I have no idea what my hair needs and what I've been doing wrong but my new year's resolution for this year is to finally figure out my hair and feel confident with it.\n\nMy hair type is around 2c or 3a I think. My hair is also pretty dry no matter what conditioner I seem to use as well (and it also takes a very long time to dry after a wash) which is very frustrating so I assume I have high-porosity hair if I'm understanding that correctly.\n\nEvery time I get out of the shower after I wash my hair (I always air-dry my hair because I don't know how to properly use a diffuser), my hair always looks so frizzy and the hair on the very top of my head is rarely the volume that I desire-- it always turns out FLAT!\n\nAnyway, I recently got a haircut for the first time in years (and kept as much length as possible) because I want to try and have a fresh start with my new attempt at my hair lol. I'll post some photos here. If anyone has any advice at all on how I can deal with my hair, I am very eager to learn about all of this! :)",

They’re so warm and orange toned and are giving 2010 zebra block highlights. I don’t know what to do. Is there anything she could possibly to do to fix it?
