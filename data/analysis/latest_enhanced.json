      "title": "[acne] [routine help] I’m in so much pain",
      "content": "Pics 1 and 2 are from yesterday.\nPics 3 and 4 are from October 2024 during my first major breakout (I had never experienced something like this prior)\nPics 5 and 6 are from January 2025, when my skin had shown the most improvement since the last breakout. \nAfter that point I only had some residual redness and bumps that were likely small keloids (I have many more on my shoulders and back), which I was getting addressed as well. My face was pretty much the same until this past December when the new breakout started. It’s currently the worst it’s ever been.\n\n27F. Before anyone suggests it, I have already seen a dermatologist. I go to a derm every 6 weeks to get corticosteroid injections for keloid scarring and asked for help with this insane breakout during my visit earlier this month.\nThey prescribed doxycycline which I’ve been taking for about 7 days. They also suggested I stop using tretinoin 0.05% until there’s improvement as it could be further irritating my skin. I also stopped using my benozyl peroxide 5%/clindamycin 1% solution gel because I felt like that was irritating my skin as well.\nI also take 50mg spironolactone daily, which I’ve been taking since September 2024 when I had a similar but far less severe breakout in the same area.\nI know doxy will take some time to work but I am looking for suggestions on pain relief or soothing products in the meantime.\n\nI am in pain constantly. It is affecting my sleep, and sometimes my ability to eat. I’m seeking advice for any amount of relief; maybe there’s a magic product out there that will soothe my skin so it hurts less. I don’t know. I’m desperate.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nAM\n- “rinse” with Avene Eau Thermale thermal spring water (this is the only thing that gives temporary pain relief)\n- Medicube hypochlorous acid spray\n- Round Lab Pine Calming Cica Toner pads\n- BoJ Dynasty Cream\n- RL Birch Mild Up SPF 50+\n\nPM\n- Heimish All Clean Balm to remove makeup \n- BoJ Green Plum Cleanser (used to use their pH rice cleansing bar, which I loved, but it is no longer available on their US site and I fear buying products outside the manufacturer site.)\n- Rinse with thermale spray again\n- Another round of hypochlorous acid\n- Dynasty cream\n- Sometimes LRP Cicaplast B5 balm but I’ve been worried that the thick lotion may be congesting my skin further. I worry about pretty much anything that touches my face now\n\nMy dermatologist took a culture of my face because she didn’t think this looked anything like normal acne, but the preliminary came back negative. They said it’s showing my normal skin flora.\n\nMy suspicion based on the placement and timing is that I accidentally re used a dermaplane blade or didn’t properly care for my face afterwards.\n\nI know you’re not doctors but any suggestions would be helpful, I’m desperate for any amount of relief. Ty all in advance.",

      "content": "Hello dear curly heads!\n\nI have grown my hair long for about 4 years now and I think it suits me way better than the very short hair I had all the years before. I didn't use conditioner back than, so they were very dry.\n\nBUT: Sometimes it really gets on my nerves. If they are open, they tend to hang in my face. I cannot see anything left and right of me and it is annoying in my opinion. It also is not good in my job (videographer, I have to often change my head position, put on headphones etc.). That's why I have them to a half bun like seen in the pictures most of the time. This was also my main goal a while ago: The Jon Snow style. And I think I wear it pretty well. They are just way too long in the back, right? I also think the top might be too long, because the bun is very big (but that could be because of the curls?). \n\nMy problem is, that I tend to look too female with longer hair. I am thin and also big. With long hair, I often get the feeling of not beeing looked at as a man and that's making me feel uncomfortable (especially with open hair).\n\nMy routine:\n\n\\- Wash 2x per week\n\n\\- I use shampoo 2x (Alverde, a cheap one from DM in Germany without any bad things in it)\n\n\\- Conditioner (also the same company) and brush my hair with it in\n\n\\- Dry it a bit with a t-shirt or microfibre\n\n\\- Put in Aloe Vera leave in conditioner (Herbal Essences)\n\n\\- Put in gel and scrunch (I now have one of Rossmann, Isana)\n\n\\- Dry with a diffusor and I try to keep my hair not in the face but back. I sometimes put in a hair band)\n\n\\- I don't dry it completely because I tend to get frizz that way. So I let it air dry the rest.\n\n\\- I sleep with not fully dry hai and I do not use a satin pillow, but I don't think that makes any big problems here.\n\n\\- Sometimes I make them wet and use a product like leave in in the morning.\n\nSo here comes my question:\n\nDo these long hair suit me better than the short ones? Are they TOO long? Should I just cut those in the back a bit more? \n\nOr should I shorten them even more? \n\nThank you everyone!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

The domestic treatment market is already worth roughly **₩188 billion**, which means people are paying anyway; just privately, unevenly, and often late.\n\nFor me what’s interesting is not whether hair loss *should* be covered but what this debate reveals about how we still frame hair loss.\n\nMost healthcare systems treat hair loss as “cosmetic,” even though:\n\n* stress-induced shedding is linked to systemic illness and inflammation  \n* [autoimmune hair loss is, by definition, a medical condition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430848/)\n* [androgenetic alopecia correlates with mental health burden](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10084176/), especially in younger men  \n\nWhen hair loss is ignored, people don’t stop suffering. They just self-medicate, delay diagnosis, or seek care only after damage is harder to reverse.\n\nOf course, South Korea isn’t saying hair loss is fatal but at the same tinme it’s acknowledging that in real life, **biology and social pressure interact**, and pretending otherwise doesn’t make the problem disappear.\n\nWhether public coverage is the right solution is debatable. But the fact that a head of state is even framing [hair loss as a quality-of-life and mental health issue](https://www.washingtontimes.com/sponsored/bullying-acceptance-hair-transplant-changed-life/) is a signal worth paying attention to.\n\nCurious how people here feel:  \n*Is hair loss still “cosmetic,” or are we overdue for a more honest medical classification?*\n\n***References:*** \n\n* *Telogen Effluvium – StatPearls (NIH) — reactive hair shedding after physical or metabolic stress.* \n* *Aukerman EL &amp; Jafferany M.

My mom says my thick hair is because I shaved my face with my father's razor when I was a kid. But I guess it's mostly genetic, anyway.\n\nI go to this local parlour in my mohalla. All the while she is threading my eyebrows she always complain about how thick my hair is. I mean girl that is why I'm here! \n\nThen she'll suggest I just thread my upper lips also. But I tell her to wax it only. Guess what she did today. She was melting the wax for half an hour. Without waiting for the wax to cool down or anything she applied the hot boiling wax on my face. Oh my god it hurt and stung like crazy. And because the wax was too liquid-y, it slipped and fell on my chest. I'm so annoyed rn. I was not crying but tears kept falling out of my eyes. \n\nMY SKIN PEELED OFF BECAUSE OF HOW HOT THE WAX WAS!! \n\nI'm never going back again. I'm going to learn how to take care of my face myself. I hate her. I hate her. I hate her.\n\nAnd just for the context I'm not insecure about my facial hair but because I've thick and dense hair on my face. My face becomes really itchy and i hate it. \n\nI can't wait to earn and get everything lasered. ",

Please let me know what you know!\n\n\nImage 1:Darkcircles\n\nIve had them even before but it has increased now. I’m not sure what type of darkscircles they are. Dehydrated? Pigmented? Can it be improved? My dermat suggested a serum but it didn’t work much too.\n\nImage 2:Blackheads, Pores and the dot dot stuff\n\nAll these occurred only in the past year!! I never had them before. The pores and blackheads are very visible irl. The dot dot stuff? I mentioned it and my dermat said it’s milia and it needs to be surgically removed as they are for cosmetic purposes only but other than milia, I have another dot dot that simply lies below my skin and can easily be pricked, I know that’s not the case with milia.\n\nHow can I improve all this? I barely have food from outside so I don’t understand these changes, ive even started getting boils and pimples which are painful ):\n\nMy face overall looks really really dull and there’s no glow to it.\n\nMy dermat had given me a facewash, a moisturizer, a sunscreen, a serum, a cream for pimples and ive been using them in the mornings and at night too. But I don’t think either of them worked for my face tho, I see no improvements.",

      "content": "So I’ve always been a bright platinum/ bleached blonde girly but obviously it’s taken a toll on my hair all these years. I recently went to the salon to have something done to help and they suggested a root smudge cos I hate my dark roots coming thru when my hair was sooo bright so I had a good cut to cut away all the dead/ split ends and a fringe added in for something different but also went with the root smudge and they also ended up toning my hair and going an ash blonde colour. I do like it as does everyone else in my family but after being so blonde all these years it’s difficult to get used to having darker hair and as it was cut shorter it’s blended further down. It looks brighter in pics than what I actually think it is or is that just cos I’m so used to having bright hair or maybe I’m overreacting lol I dno. I’m going back in 8 wks time for another appt and was wanting to ask for maybe full head foils or something to brighten it all back up but keep the root smudge just more highlights up top near it. would this work on my root smudge, toned ash colour hair now? Thanks for any help (the 1st pic is how I’ve always had my hair, 2nd is before pic at salon they took when my roots had grown out loads and the others are after I’ve had my hair done). ",

      "content": "Hi reddit!\n\nLaura Bailey from Critical Role is my goal in all things. I'm finally starting to leave the house again after years of COVID-induced remote work and social isolation, and I'm trying to level myself up. My hair is a similar length and colored similarly to hers, though I'm not sure how close we are in terms of texture and thickness. \n\nI'm obsessed with the wavy hairstyle in these screenshots (in the light blue/purple sweater). How would I get my hair to look like this? I bought one of those three-barrel wavers, and while it gets close, it's not exactly right, but that might be user error. From wet hair--how do I get her look?\n\nI also like the look in the third picture (flannel shirt). Similarly, how do I get this look? I can curl my hair...but I'm not sure I'm placing the curls right or have the right size curler to get this look. What do you recommend?\n\nAlso, if you're feeling generous--how do I maintain throughout the week? Even if I style one day, I don't know how to keep it up the next day. I often end up straightening (because it's fast and easy) or putting it back in a claw clip. \n\nThank you for helping this clueless Redditor with any hair help!\n\n",

My skin did get kind of dry in spots and i stopped using for maybe 4 days? Then reapplied yesterday morning and i think i forgot sunscreen.. but it was grey outside and i didnt go out much.\n\nToday i woke up with this on face and neck (where i apply)… is this normal? Allergy? Too high a dose? After searching reddit it seems like maybe allergy ?\n\nAny help/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!",

Thank you so much in advance! i think i have fine/medium hair, and it absorbs water very quickly. i've been doing this routine to bring my waves back:\n\nShampoo by alama, curl line\n\nconditioner by alama curl line\n\ni used to comb in the shower after the conditioner, but lately i've been brushing it before showering and i've noticed i've been losing a lot less hair compared to when i brushed it in the shower.\n\nAfter the shower i put curl amplifier always by alama, mousse and gel and then scrunch with a cotton shirt, and then plop, i used to plop for a little and then diffuse but lately i've been plopping overnight and it works wonderfully for me. but before i plop overnight I diffuse the roots a lot and do some normal diffusing. then i'll plop and use the hair drier on top without the diffuser until it's dry. i usually do this before dinner so it makes sense to just sleep on the cotton shirt instead of removing the hair and putting it in the bonnet.  \n\nALSO there's one side of my head that does not curl the same and it's a lot more flat, do you think maybe cutting that side more will make them grow more wavy?
