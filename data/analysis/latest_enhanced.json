I’m in Australia so preferably products that are sold in Australia or products that I could easily ship here. I have a mixture of different types on waves throughout my hair, I also have straight hair on the underside which is very annoying. My hair was bleached for around 6 years, I think this is why I’m struggling with straight ends even on the wavy strands from damage. Sidebar: does anyone have any tips on how to remedy this or do I simply need to wait until the damaged hair grows out and chop it off? One side of my hair is significantly more wavy than the other, I presume this is also stress and damage from me sleeping on one side. Pics 1&amp;2 are the same day but shows the difference between both sides of my hair. I do try to wear a silk bonnet to bed but I find it uncomfortable and usually will take it off in my sleep.\n\nMy current routine is: I wash my hair 2-3 times per week.\n\n•\t⁠Shampoo and condition with redken extreme anti snap.\n•\t⁠Once a week I will use k18 bind repair treatment in place of conditioner.\n•\t⁠After my shower I use kerastase nutritive lotion Thermique sublimatrice heat protectant.\n•\t⁠Then I use Kristen ess leave in curl crème, I apply this in sections through my hair, then use a curl creating crush to brush it through and separate strands, then I scrunch my hair. I do this all round my hair.\n•\t⁠Then I use the not your mother curl talk sculpting gel and follow the same process as above.\n•\t⁠I then plop my hair using a microfiber towel to absorb excess moisture and product for 15 mins or so. Then I let it air dry.\n\nI really struggle with frizz, my hair is sometimes even frizzy while it’s wet, so I struggle to find a balance between the right amount of products and my hair either being crispy, or not-defined and frizzy. I’m not entirely sure I’m using the correct products for my hair type either. All hair care and styling recommendations and tips will be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",

The top is constantly frizzy on top but the bottom is gorgeous perfect curls, like picture curls lol. I don’t even know what type of hair I have. So far I’ve just been using a curly shampoo and conditioner set, occasionally a clarifying shampoo and deep conditioner. Here’s my issues! \n\n1) my hair gets greasy and my scalp gets itchy af after 2 days and from what I know with curly hair it shouldn’t need washed as often. I have to wash every 2 days to avoid discomfort, is that normal? \n\n2) what kind of curls do I have?! I legit can’t find anything that matches it! I’ve met one other person (my coworker) who has the same curl type as me. \n\n3) how to I maintain my curls?! My products: Cantù shampoo and conditioner, Cantù curl cream/activator and a mouse I can’t remember the brand of. I’m on an extremely tight budget so drugstore is all I can really do. \n\nIt’s important to reference that my hair is a bit damaged from it being improperly taken care of for 23 years and box bleach and dye (I know dumb I learned my lesson).

My skin often looks dull and tired, and it feels like it’s lost its glow, plumpness, and elasticity. I’m just starting out with skincare and honestly don’t want to overwhelm myself with too many products or spend a fortune.\n\nRight now, I’m thinking of getting a gentle cleanser (something that won’t irritate my dermatitis), a serum (not sure whether I should go with niacinamide for calming inflammation and oil control or vitamin C for brightening and elasticity), a lightweight moisturizer, and a good sunscreen that won’t make my skin greasy or irritated.\n\nMy budget is about ₹1200 max for the essentials. I’ve been looking at some Minimalist products (seen my good minimalist reviews here)  but still confused about what to prioritize, especially the serums.\n\nIf anyone has similar skin issues or has suggestions for effective, beginner-friendly products that won’t break the bank, I’d really appreciate your input. Also, any tips on how to introduce these products without messing up my skin would be awesome.\n\nThanks so much!",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",

I’m really looking to decide whether or not to try curly bangs, and if so what kind of bangs.\n\nAlso looking for product recommendations for my hair type. If anyone with similar curls has products they vouch for I’d love to hear it. \n\nCurrent routine is very minimal. I just comb with my fingers and a wide tooth comb, then use Cantù leave in conditioner, and a very small amount of shea moisture gel. Then let it air dry.\n\nAny advice/opinions are appreciated! ",

Her lenghts specially the tips are dry because she got very thin hair. She also said they are frizzy, humidity is destroying everything and they are kinda dull. Do you know any good brands/products?

Now my hair looks quite orange/coppery, and I honestly feel a bit like a clown 😅.\n\nMy natural roots are growing in (medium ash blonde/brown), and my hair feels a bit dry after the Efassor treatment. I’d like to fix the color tomorrow so I can look somewhat decent for work on Tuesday — but I don’t want to damage my hair further.\n\nHere’s what I currently have at home:\n\t•\tL’Oréal Majirel 8.13\n\t•\tL’Oréal Dia Light 9.13, 10.12, 6.28, and 6.3\n\nMy question is:\n👉 Which of these would be best to use to tone down the orange/red and make it look more natural or neutral?\n👉 Should I also color my roots now, or wait until my hair feels less dry?\n\nI was thinking about mixing Dia Light 9.13 + 10.12 to neutralize warmth, but I’m not sure if that’s strong enough or if I should go for something darker like 6.3 or 6.28 to even everything out. Or should I buy a box dye tomorrow? I live in Germany. End result should be a nice dark blonde or light brown. What looks best honestly.\n\nAny professional advice or personal experience would be really appreciated!\nThank you in advance ❤️\n",

      "content": "I promise we don’t wake up thinking “let’s cut too much.” It happens when the picture in your head and the words in my chair don’t match. Wet hair shrinks, curls spring up, “just clean it up” means ten different things, and an inch in your mind is not an inch on my comb.\n\nWhat helps most is swapping vague vibes for clear landmarks. “Ends at collarbone,” “bangs just touch cheekbone,” “keep weight at the crown,” “airy layers, not choppy.” If you say “I like my ears mostly covered” or “I need a ponytail,” that tells me more than a guard number ever will.\n\nBring how your hair actually lives. Show me a quick selfie from a regular day, not a wedding blowout. Tell me how you style: air-dry, five minutes with a brush, diffuser, whatever. If you hate product, say it. If you love big hair, say it.\n\nIf you’re a visual person, a try-on or side-by-side mockup helps us agree on placement before scissors move. I’ve had clients use [hairwow.org](http://hairwow.org) to test fringe width and length, then hand me a one-liner like: “cheekbone curtain fringe, long layers, ends at collarbone; keep crown weight; air-dry friendly.” Notes app screenshots or a split-screen Pinterest pic work too—use whatever gets us on the same page.\n\nMid-cut check-ins are welcome. I’m happy to pause at “a touch longer,” skim the bang line dry, and decide together if we keep going. If you’re growing out, say “this is a two-appointment goal” so I can keep the shape while we inch there.\n\nIf you ever left a salon thinking “too short,” try this script next time:  \n“Keep most of my length. Ends at collarbone. Cheekbone-grazing curtain fringe. Airy layers, not choppy. I air-dry and want it to fall right without fuss.”  \nThat’s music to our ears—and way harder to mess up.",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
