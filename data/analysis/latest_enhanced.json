It took me 3 years from picture 3 to 1. \n\nRoutine and tips:\n1. I used Davines and Kérastase products and they rehydrated my scalp and hair. \n2. Hair oil is a must. Heat protector also. \n3. I dry and style my hair using a difusor and finalize it with Davines oil usually \n4. Using a 100% cotton towel to dry my hair changed everything. Also, I put my hair in a high knot before sleeping- but still haven’t found a way to keep it defined for more than 2 days. ",

First 2 pics are wash day, 2nd two are next day. I don't break the cast. We'll see how the rest of the week goes.

I did add a tiny bit extra all over and the top right before diffusing.\n\nOh yeah and the cast sets quicker than the curlsmith souffle gel I was using. I wanted a cheaper price point and this new one is not cheaper but if it works better/longer then I will use less often and hopefully save money. It's concentrated so it says use less but I feel like I still used kind of a lot. Only comes in 100 or 250ml I think. Hopefully the place selling it restocks soon because it's like 30% off right now ;-;",

A lot of things point to something different from DHT.\n\nI personally think we continue to get excited about new cures and treatments we stumble upon by accident like PP405, but for as long as we don’t start with basics will none of them work. \n\n",

Last september I added 1x 0.5mg dut to my 7x 1mg fin regimen. I even improved my hair thickness for 6 months. BUT I started to shed after the end of this 6 month.\n\nIn march 2025 I started to shed like crazy… This shed lasted until today, and still going. I tried to increase my dut dosage up to x2 and x3 with x7 fin per week but nothing changed.\n\nTo clarify, I do not use generic brands. Only propecia and avodart.\n\nSo, the question rises now: What should I do?\n\nA) Stop dutasteride fully because it gives damage (?) to my hair and only stick with finasteride. 9 month is already enough.\n\nB) 2-3x dut is not enough so increase it to ED.\n\nFor the option A, I do find it weird to be honest because some people say that I might not be responding enough to dut But dont forget, I have never stopped using 7x fin.\n\nCould you guys help me, or just share your ideas please? I am planning to see a doctor but they are generally useless since they are mainly not pro fin/dut in my country.\n\nI appreciate all the support\n\nBest",

However, I really just don’t know where to start. I’ve tried various methods (albeit using the same products) and it always comes out frizzy and messy, rather than defined neat curls.\n\nThese pictures were taken about an hour after hair washing. My routine was:\n\n-Washed hair with Tresemme repair shampoo once\n-Left tresemme conditioner in hair for about 5 minutes and then rinsed it out\n-Squeezed excess water out of hair, dried excess hair with micro fibre towel\n\n-let air dry for about 15 minutes \n-ran Tresemme Curls leave-in conditioner through ends and then blow-dried\n-ran Elive oil through hair (I don’t tend to do this but was told it would stop hair-clumping, which was an issue. Regardless it ended up more or less the same as without)\n\nThe result has, so far, always been a few nice curls which is ruined by extremely frizzy hairs and a lot of hair that just hasn’t curled properly. It leads to a sort of half-curled blob that looks more like an unkempt mess than anything nice.\n\nI’m aware I need a haircut too, but I’m unsure what I’d ask for, I want to promote curling and continue to grow out my hair but I don’t even know how to do that with product, let alone a haircut.\n \nAny help would be massively appreciated, I’d really love to have pretty, curly hair, and on the rare occasion I will get a very curly hair day, but I can never recreate it.",

However, I have a suspicion that my acne is mostly hormonal related and I’m wondering if anyone else has dealt with severe hormonal acne and if they’ve found anything that helps? I know the classic answer for women is to get on BC but BC always has a negative affect on my mental health so I’m not eager to get back on it. I only know about tret because a friend recommended it and I’ve heard about acutane but unfortunately I cannot afford it currently, are there any other possible treatments I can try to seek out? Also, I got a laser skin treatment at the start of 2024 and it did not help.",

I added some pictures of my hair and how it’s looked at some different points within the last year.\n\nMy current routine is\n1. Shampoo with Olaplex Bond Maintenance Shampoo (I have pretty short hair so I end up just distributing it evenly throughout all of my hair) and rinse\n2. Condition with Olaplex Bond Maintenance Conditioner, distributing evenly, leave in for a few minutes while I wash my body then rinse\n3. Put hair in a microfiber towel while I dry off\n4. Distribute around a nickel-sized amount of Pattern Leave-In Conditioner throughout hair\n5. Blow dry on medium heat and low fan speed. I used to use a diffuser attachment but I found using it was making my hair very frizzy I also used to use Jamaican Black Castor Oil but haven’t been using it because it was making my hair feel too oily.\n\nI don’t mind some higher end products but I’d prefer something that isn’t more than around $30 or $35.",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

I'll admit I'm pretty lazy, but nothing I do seems to help so I go low maintenance. \n\nOne major problem is that it stays curly in the back, but looses curl in the front (probably because I'm always messing with it or putting it behind my ears). I also have two cowlicks in the front, think devil horns, and a terrible hair line, so I never know how to part it. Also I sweat a lot along my hairline, so it gets messy very easily. Most days, if I even try to make it look nice, I'll end up putting it in a messy bun before 10am. \n\nRoutine below, but I'm hoping for any advice on how to care for my hair, daily styles that work with my mess, and fancier styles that might work.\n\nRoutine: \n\n1. Wash and condition with argan oil products\n2. Wrap with a microfiber towel\n3. OXG argan oil defining cream\n4. Air dry\n5. Usually sleep on it because I shower at night\n\nThanks to anyone that can help, I'm hopeless :/\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nt34rqs59b0g1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3383c90f4120724fa840b258edd67770bbe3b450\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qx4pdqs59b0g1.jpg?width=1841&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af811688fdd8b1ebf9b24ba2d7ca25d897d3d01\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbrp7qs59b0g1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2690cdfe38405338241a44dde34fc02a6e41ef1f\n\n",
