It’s frustrating cuz well.. it looks curlier but it doesn’t last very long (have to rewet it all the time) versus if I put product in it, I like how defined it looks near the ends and how long it lasts but the roots feel flat. the first image is right after a wash\n\nAny advice here?\n\nUsually when i’m doing a routine with product in it, it’s-\n\n1x a week full hair wash with curlsmith shampoo, then shea moisture conditioner, then shea moisture curl cream, some gel or mousse, curlbounce brush and then air dry or diffuse (it rlly depends on the day)\n\ni went a while without using shea moisture products too (mielle leave-in and ouidad gel) and it still looked similar, if not worse (ouidad gel did not leave a gel cast on my curls unless i dumped like 2 pounds of it, which caused it to frizz early)",

I use the Ego QV Gentle Wash cleanser and Cerave Moisturiser.\n\nI did switch from the green hydrating cerave cleanser to the Ego QV cleanser about a week before coming back to the UK for 2 weeks. Should I go back?\n\nI’ve also worn the Beauty of Joseon suncream the past 2 days and I’m debating removing that from my routine as well.\n\nI’m wearing sudocreme and benzoyl peroxide to bed, letting the benzoyl sit for 15 mins before applying the sudocreme.\n\nI’m at a complete loss as I feel out of control with my skin for the first time in years 🥲 I did take these photos straight out of the shower so that might’ve increased the redness but the texture is just as bad as it looks - it’s a mental challenge washing my face at the moment and just feeling it.\n\nAny help would be greatly greatly greatly appreciated, this has been a huge knock on my confidence entirely.",

      "content": "So lately I've been seeing a lot of posts saying CeraVe has moved it's manufacturing in India for the Indian market and they are giving low quality or different ingredients as compared to its US or EU counterparts. \n\nSo, I took some time and did some digging on one of it's products (more comparisons may come soon): \n\nCeraVe Foaming Cleanser:\n\nLeft (India) &amp; Right (USA)\n\nAs you can see in the above comparison, Indian one is almost neck to neck similar with the USA one. It's also Paraben free and Reef safe. \n\nNext I checked the full ingredients list. Here's what I found:\n\nThere are a few differences within the ingredients:\n\nHumectants: India uses Propanediol | USA uses Propylene Glycol\n\nHyaluronic Form: India uses Sodium Hyaluronate | USA uses Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid\n\nPreservatives: India uses Phenoxyethanol and Ethylhexylglycerin | USA uses Parabens, like Methylparaben &amp; Propylparaben\n\nRest all ingredients as similar to the USA variant!!!\n\nRight now I just kept it short and simple. Let me know if you guys wanna see more of such comparisons 🙂",

I'm from the Philippines so some products may be limited in availability to me.\n\nCurrently, my products include the Mise en Scene Perfect Serum Styling Shampoo &amp; Treatment, Selsun Blue Extra Moisturizing Shampoo (I only use this once or twice a week), Mise en Scene Perfect Serum Super Rich and Curls by Zenutrients Leave-in Conditioner.\n\nI usually wet my hair first and wash my scalp with either Mise en Scene Styling Shampoo or Selsun Blue (depends if my hair has some flakes in it) then I rinse it off and use the Styling Conditioner on my ends. After rinsing the conditioner off, I use 1-2 pumps of the Super Rich serum and then use the Leave-in Conditioner on my ends and scrunch them. I then leave it to air-dry or either just clip it up.\n\nI usually protect my hair while sleeping by wearing a silk bonnet but other than that everything I've mentioned above is all I do to my hair currently.\n\nCan you guys help me with a routine, the right products and what method I can do to fully bring my curls out? Thank you in advance!!! ♡",

Sharing my Jan &amp; Feb empties.\n\nSkin type: Acne-prone combination\n\nSeason: Winter (my skin becomes dry)\n\nDuring winter, I focused more on hydration and barrier repair while slowly targeting acne\n\n• COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Essence\n\nUsing this for the past 3 years and always keep it stocked. Great for hydration and calming acne without clogging pores. A solid staple for my winter routine.\n\n• L’Oréal Glycolic Bright Serum\n\nUsing regularly at night for pigmentation. It works gradually acne marks fade with consistent use. Needs patience.(WRP)\n\n• L’Oréal Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\nOkay-okay hydration. Lightweight, layers well, not sticky. Nothing extraordinary, but does the job. I personally prefer this over The Ordinary one. (WNRP)\n\n• L’Oréal Eye Serum\n\nBetter for puffiness. I mainly have dark circles (no puffiness), and it helped slightly but not dramatically.\n\n(WNRP)\n\n• The Derma Co AHA-BHA-PHA Peeling Solution\n\nFirst time trying it. Helped with texture and mild acne marks but caused some irritation. (WNRP)\n\n• Earth Rhythm Phytoceramide Moisturizer\n\nReally helpful for winter dryness. Texture is similar to CeraVe or Bioderma — creamy, barrier-supporting, and nourishing without clogging pores. Worked very well for my dry skin during winter. (WNRP)\n\n• Moody Sunscreen\n\nVery lightweight and great for humid weather. My tube was close to expiry, so I finished it during winter. Texture-wise, better suited for summer. (MRP)\n\n• Deconstruct Sunscreen\n\nGood for winter, slightly heavier. Budget-friendly, but I don’t think I can use it in summer. (WNRP)\n\n• Parachute Body Lotion\n\nBasic winter body lotion. Does the job for dryness.",

      "content": "I have PIE and frequent whiteheads that flare up from almost anything, mostly on my chin, around/on my nose, and between my brows/forehead. My cheeks have been clear for a while. I’ve heard rice toners can help even out skin tone, but I’m not sure if I should instead get with BHA since my skin seems dehydrated.\n\nMy routine: MIXSOON Master Serum; Real Barrier Aqua Soothing Cream (working well, but whiteheads persist); Skin1004 Centella Tone Brightening Gel Foam (AM &amp; PM); once a week, I use I’m From Fig Enzyme Powder for \\~90 seconds. I’ve been using Anua 10% Azelaic Acid for 7 months with little improvement.\n\nI’m going to Bali in a month and need a daily sunscreen with chemical filters, suitable under makeup, not too dewy, and won’t darken my PIE. Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing breaks me out; I’ve been eyeing Dr. Althea Green Tea Fresh Sunscreen (but there’s few reviews).\n\nAny recommendations for sunscreens, toners, spot treatments for whiteheads, or dermatology treatments for PIE would be helpful! 🙏",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

      "content": "Hi guys, I’ve been struggling with stubborn spots and redness around my chin and upper lips for the last year. It all started when I overdid it with a combo of tazarotene and glycolic acid, and heavily compromised my skin barrier. In an effort to repair it, I then stuck with using occlusives that were probably too heavy for my skin, which caused further breakouts. I also have to shave, which only exacerbates the problem - this is unavoidable, but I am pursuing hair removal to remove the necessity for shaving.\n\nI wanted to ask if anybody had any thoughts on what is the likely cause?\n\nOver the last couple of weeks, I’ve been using nothing but Avene Cicalfate and a hydrating, sulfate-free cleanser, and it has improved somewhat. I was at a point a while ago where my skin was so dry that moisturiser wouldn’t even absorb properly and my whole chin would be flakey.\n\nAny help would be super appreciated!",
