Nice loose curls even after waking in the middle of the night with wet hair to take my dog to emergency vet 😵‍💫(she’s fine now!)\n\nUnfortunately, the back of my hair does still need some work especially with frizz. Does anyone have tips on how to refresh the back or should I just pretend it doesn’t exist?\n\nMy routine in the shower:\n\nShampoo: As I Am dry itchy sc\\*lp care shampoo\n\nConditioner: mielle rosemary mint strengthening conditioner\n\nOccasionally I will co-wash\n\nMy routine after shower:\n\nHair cream scrunched in hair: miss jessie’s Pillow soft curls\n\nMousse: aunt Jackie’s frizz control setting mousse\n\nMousse: As I Am rosemary styling mousse\n\nScrunch hair in t-shirt and wrap hair for about thirty minutes and then air dry\n\nI find my hair is more likely to actually have curls and not just puff and frizz if I shower in the evening and sleep on a satin pillow. I don’t sleep with any head wrap which I know is not great but honestly when I did in the past it kept coming off because I move a lot in my sleep &lt;/3\n\nThanks for any feedback and criticism! I love curly hair!",

It's also Paraben free and Reef safe. \n\nNext I checked the full ingredients list. Here's what I found:\n\nThere are a few differences within the ingredients:\n\nHumectants: India uses Propanediol | USA uses Propylene Glycol\n\nHyaluronic Form: India uses Sodium Hyaluronate | USA uses Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid\n\nPreservatives: India uses Phenoxyethanol and Ethylhexylglycerin | USA uses Parabens, like Methylparaben &amp; Propylparaben\n\nRest all ingredients as similar to the USA variant!!!\n\nRight now I just kept it short and simple. Let me know if you guys wanna see more of such comparisons 🙂",

Maybe you lovely people could suggest any changes to help get a bit more definition and less poofiness? You can see my hair is really trying!! I would love just some nice beach waves to be honest. And my curtain bangs to be less weird shaped haha \n\n2 washes ago I started! I double shampooed, first with head n shoulders and then with the L’Oréal clarifying shampoo as shown in pic 3. I wash hair like once or twice a week and it’s so thick I tend to shampoo twice to get it nice and clean. Planning to use L’Oréal shampoo every couple of weeks or so as our water is very hard here. \n\nMy routine: double shampoo using head and shoulders, then use wella conditioner in pic 3 and let it sit while I wash my body. Then rinse and plop for a bit with my towel before applying the garnier curl cream, scrunch it a bit with my hands and then try not to touch it and pray that my daughter doesn’t pull the crap out of it… once it is dry I add a bit of the argan oil serum in like a wiping and scrunching motion on the frizzy bits and ends. \n\nI’m trying not to buy more crap I don’t need so not sure I need to invest in silk pillows and special microfibre towels? My hair is too thick for a T-shirt to plop with I think. ",

      "content": "Hello this is a long post and i did posted  on here before but i just wanna know what can i do. it’s been a month, and i have only been more depressed (Which i already was before January but this was kinda my breaking point). i gotten this really big scar on my cheek that looks like to be a rolling scar? i’m not sure, but it’s not noticeable under sunlight, but in every other lighting. Yes it does appear more indented than the rest of my face and it’s not really hyperpigmentation. \n\n\n\nIt appeared so suddenly just by little inflammation, that itself took me over the edge especially when i was just about to find confidence and seeing myself pretty and had clear looking skin(not clear obviously but even skin). To describe a bit more it’s not a deep pit like an ice pick scar, but more so that it fades when i pull my skin like a skateboard rink dip. \n\n\n\nBut i would say that also shakes me. As it’s right in-front on my face and also appears to look like a sunken eye bag(it’s not but looks like from afar). My family said that it would go away with time and be patient, but will it? I would like to believe them, but every time i look in the mirror and seeing a glimpse of my face, trying vitamin c serum with gentle skincare with spf 50 sunscreen, drinking water with getting moderate sleep, and doing research, what is there left to do?  \n\n\n\nI’m scared to try anything new because i don’t want more of a risk of more scars, but at the same time i fear that the more i wait the more chances it will get worse. I don’t have insurance or money for dermo or professional facial treatments (not that i would like to do them). So is this a patience thing or i need to do something more? (i’m also a teen if that helps)",

      "content": "Hey all -\n\nHoping someone here can help with this. I’ve got redness around nose and mouth that is sooooo annoying. I notice it every day (although some days are better than others). No itchiness for the most part, but every once in a blue moon I get a bit of texture underneath my lips… You can see this in slide 3. I used to get a little flakey around the nose, nowhere else. The flakiness cleared up when I switched from petrolium-based ointment (Aquaphor) to a lighter moisturizer (Dr. G Red Blemish cream).\n\nI’ve seen a dermatologist and she diagnosed it as seb derm. I was prescribed Zoryve (roflumilast foam)— which believe is helping, but the redness still doesn’t go away. I’ve been using the Zoryve for a few months now.\n\nIf it’s not one skin issue then it’s another !! Grr. \n\nHas anyone dealt with similar? Is there a product that makes it go away or an issue with my current routine?\n\n**Some background info / routine:**\n\n**Medications**\n\n\\* Mirena IUD\n\n\\* 50 mg Spirinolactone for hormonal acne (usually presents around jawline)\n\n**A.M.**\n\n\\* La Roche Posay EFFACLAR Medicated Gel Cleanser, 2% salicylic acid\n\n\\* Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Exfoliating Toner\n\n\\* Dapsone Gel 7.5% (spot treatment)\n\n\\* WINLEVI (clascoterone) cream 1%\n\n\\* Dr. G Red Blemish moisturizer\n\n\\* Aquaphor on lips\n\n**+ On Makeup Days**\n\n\\* Dr. Jart Cicapair Color Correcting Treatment\n\n\\* Milk Hydro Grip Primer\n\n\\* Dior Forever Skin Correct concealer\n\n\\* *Occasionally* Hourglass Ambient Soft Glow Foundation\n\n\\* Charlotte Tilbury setting spray\n\n**P.M.**\n\n\\* Makeup removed with Garnier Micellar Water (sensitive skin) \n\n\\* Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% - Sulfur 5% Cleanser\n\n\\* ZORYVE (roflumilast) foam\n\n\\* Dapsone Gel 7.5% (spot treatment)\n\n\\* Obagi Retivance - Retinaldehyde serum\n\n\\* WINLEVI (clascoterone) cream 1%\n\n\\* Dr. G Red Blemish moisturizer\n\n\\* Aquaphor on lips\n\nSorry if the skincare listing is excessive - it’s my first post on this sub and I feel like detail is key…",

The one on my stomach and breast are really troublesome for me to look at everyday. \n\nI have talked to my dermatologist and they recommended a BP wash and to exfoliate. It’s been over a year and I have seen absolutely no improvement other than the redness and swelling has gone away. \n\nI’m hoping someone can recommend a product or a specific routine I can implement to help reduce the appearance of them. I follow a consistent routine for my face, so I am able to comply to any type of routine. \n\nTIA ☺️🙌🏼 \n\nSide note: if you saw this before it’s because the past 2x I tried to post it got removed for not having the correct tag 😭🤞🏻 hoping it works now!",

My skin has started clearing up, but all of the sudden I have these little under the skin bumps all over my forehead, sides of nose, and in the corners of my eyes. They’re a little itchy and almost rash-like. When I put makeup on, it looks like my skin is melting. I haven’t changed anything in my routine. I use the Vanicream gentle cleanser, the La Roche Posay Toleraine Moisturizer, and the PanOxyl Salicylic Acid cleanser maybe twice a week, although I haven’t used it since my skin got this reaction. Any advice is much appreciated!! Thank you!!",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",
