My face gets so dry and puffy, especially under my eyes, my cheeks, jaw, really my emtire face, puffy and my fingers and stomach feel so swollen. It was like this throughout a wedding functions throughout my trip last year. It was very hard to get over the symptoms.  I infact couldn't... \n\nI have several South Asian wedding functions coming up across the border and I’m terrified of looking like this in all the photos.\n\n​I feel like I’m doing everything \"right\", I drink water, I try to watch my salt, I even try to use a Gua Sha when I get there, but nothing is working. I’m clearly missing something.\n\n​Is it the sitting in the vehicle while getting to the destination?\n\n​Is it the air in the car? Was it the air in the hotel that dried out my skin?!\n\n​Am I drinking too much water? Or not enough??!\n\n​Should I be using specific products or tools during the drive? or after? \n\nShould I take my nuface with me? or gua sha it ? I don't know what to do!! \n\n​I honestly have no idea what to do at this point. If anyone has ever dealt with this or has a \"holy grail\" trick to stop the swelling before it starts, please help! I'm desperate!\n\nI really don't want to suffer, I was in bittersweet sadness throughout the family wedding.  I don't want to be haunted by the same issue by this trip too. I am open all advice!!! ",

      "content": "So lately I've been seeing a lot of posts saying CeraVe has moved it's manufacturing in India for the Indian market and they are giving low quality or different ingredients as compared to its US or EU counterparts. \n\nSo, I took some time and did some digging on one of it's products (more comparisons may come soon): \n\nCeraVe Foaming Cleanser:\n\nLeft (India) &amp; Right (USA)\n\nAs you can see in the above comparison, Indian one is almost neck to neck similar with the USA one. It's also Paraben free and Reef safe. \n\nNext I checked the full ingredients list. Here's what I found:\n\nThere are a few differences within the ingredients:\n\nHumectants: India uses Propanediol | USA uses Propylene Glycol\n\nHyaluronic Form: India uses Sodium Hyaluronate | USA uses Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid\n\nPreservatives: India uses Phenoxyethanol and Ethylhexylglycerin | USA uses Parabens, like Methylparaben &amp; Propylparaben\n\nRest all ingredients as similar to the USA variant!!!\n\nRight now I just kept it short and simple. Let me know if you guys wanna see more of such comparisons 🙂",

      "content": "I (32F) had almost flawless skin up until I hit 30, then hormones did as they do and I ended up with bad acne - one PCOS diagnosis later, and I'm now on spironolactone and topical tretinoin to help, but I'm finding my dynamic wrinkles are getting worse and worse. My skin looks bright and feels bouncy - I don't even have fine lines usually, but when I smile my skin folds like paper around my eyes and mouth. \n\nThere's a pretty high chance this is just genetics, but even so, I wanted to see if there is something I'm doing wrong, or should be doing as well. Going through other posts, I think vitamin A and Botox/neurotoxins are the only things I haven't tried - partially because I'm worried about upsetting my skin now it's finally recovered. \n\nI used to have a more complex routine with double washing and all that, but I found it worsened my skin and a simple routine works best for me. The climate here is dry with very strong UV rays (you can get sunburned overcast day), so perhaps I'm not doing enough to mitigate that? I'm also thin due to an overactive metabolism and I wonder if I can get more weight on if this will help. \n\nSkin type:\n\n* Skin type: sensitive, combo normal with dry T zone. I also get eczema, especially around my eyes and lips although it isn't severe and bouts usually clear up in a few days. \n\nRoutine:\n\n* AM - gentle foaming cleanser, ceramide gel moisturiser, and sunblock.\n* PM - wash with water and a wash cloth, LED mask (blue and red lights for 10 mins), topical tret every other day, and the same moisturiser. \n* Treatments - micro-needling every 7 weeks (primarily to heal the acne scars) and a mild exfoliating facial. Once a week I'll use a slightly rougher face cloth to exfoliate, as I have yet to find a topical exfoliator that suits my skin. \n\nLifestyle:\n\n* 2-3L water daily, relatively healthy diet (however it's mostly vegetarian, because meat is expensive, and I don't like fish), and usually pretty good sleep with a silk pillow. Exercise is pretty light at the moment due to injury, and I always use sun protection (so hats, glasses, masks etc). \n\nTIA!",

The first day it’ll be like 3 big and defined ringlets, but after just one day several long and straight pieces will fall out. I’m not sure what to do to fix it! I’ll put my routine below. Many people suggest finger coiling but I’m actually so bad at it and my hair always slips out.\n\n  \nROUTINE: shampoo (native moisturizing) and condition (Aussie miracle curl moisturizing). Immediately after, scrunch in Harry’s gel sculptant (highest strength. Finger coil (to the best of my abilities) the longer pieces. Then scrunch dry with t-shirt. Wait awhile (the longer the better) and diffuse. Once mostly dry, scrunch out cast. Style with hair spray if needed. On refresh days: spray with a little bit of water, diffuse, then style with hairspray (and shea butter on bad days) as needed. ",
