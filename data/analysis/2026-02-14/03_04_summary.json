      "content": "ok so i've been really deep in the skincare world for a few years now and there are some \"rules\" that get repeated so often they feel like gospel but they're either outdated, oversimplified, or just straight up wrong. here are the ones that annoy me the most:\n\n**1. \"You need to wait 20 minutes between products for them to absorb\"**\n\nthis gets repeated constantly and it's not really backed by much. most derms say you can apply the next product once the previous one feels dry to the touch (usually 30-60 seconds). the idea that ingredients need 20 minutes to \"absorb\" before you can put anything else on is based on... nothing specific honestly. the exception is sunscreen - you DO want that to form a film before sun exposure, but even that's debated now.\n\n**2. \"If it burns/tingles, it's working\"**\n\nNO. please stop telling people this. a slight tingle from an AHA or vitamin C can be normal, but actual burning or stinging that lasts more than a few seconds is your skin telling you something is wrong. i see people on here pushing through barrier damage because someone told them the pain means it's \"doing something.\" it's doing something alright - it's destroying your moisture barrier.\n\n**3. \"You need separate AM and PM cleansers\"**\n\nyou really don't. unless you have a specific reason (like using an oil cleanser at night for double cleansing), one gentle cleanser is fine for both. the skincare industry LOVES selling you two of everything. your vanicream or cerave cleanser doesn't know what time it is.\n\n**4. \"Natural/clean ingredients are better for your skin\"**\n\npoison ivy is natural. arsenic is natural. \"natural\" tells you nothing about whether something is good for your skin. some of the most effective skincare ingredients (retinoids, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid in most formulations) are synthetic. and some \"natural\" ingredients like essential oils and citrus extracts are common irritants. marketing ≠ science.\n\n**5. \"You should change your products every few months because your skin gets used to them\"**\n\nthis is one of the most persistent myths and it drives me crazy. your skin doesn't \"get used to\" products and stop responding to them. what actually happens is: the product fixes the initial problem (dryness, dullness, etc.) and the dramatic improvement plateaus because... your skin is already better now. that's not the product stopping working. that's the product having worked.\n\nthe only real exception is prescription retinoids where your skin does adapt to the irritation over time - but that's your barrier getting stronger, not the retinoid becoming less effective.\n\n---\n\nwhat other \"rules\" do you guys think are BS? i feel like there's at least 10 more of these floating around.",

It's also Paraben free and Reef safe. \n\nNext I checked the full ingredients list. Here's what I found:\n\nThere are a few differences within the ingredients:\n\nHumectants: India uses Propanediol | USA uses Propylene Glycol\n\nHyaluronic Form: India uses Sodium Hyaluronate | USA uses Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid\n\nPreservatives: India uses Phenoxyethanol and Ethylhexylglycerin | USA uses Parabens, like Methylparaben &amp; Propylparaben\n\nRest all ingredients as similar to the USA variant!!!\n\nRight now I just kept it short and simple. Let me know if you guys wanna see more of such comparisons 🙂",

      "content": "Hey all -\n\nHoping someone here can help with this. I’ve got redness around nose and mouth that is sooooo annoying. I notice it every day (although some days are better than others). No itchiness for the most part, but every once in a blue moon I get a bit of texture underneath my lips… You can see this in slide 3. I used to get a little flakey around the nose, nowhere else. The flakiness cleared up when I switched from petrolium-based ointment (Aquaphor) to a lighter moisturizer (Dr. G Red Blemish cream).\n\nI’ve seen a dermatologist and she diagnosed it as seb derm. I was prescribed Zoryve (roflumilast foam)— which believe is helping, but the redness still doesn’t go away. I’ve been using the Zoryve for a few months now.\n\nIf it’s not one skin issue then it’s another !! Grr. \n\nHas anyone dealt with similar? Is there a product that makes it go away or an issue with my current routine?\n\n**Some background info / routine:**\n\n**Medications**\n\n\\* Mirena IUD\n\n\\* 50 mg Spirinolactone for hormonal acne (usually presents around jawline)\n\n**A.M.**\n\n\\* La Roche Posay EFFACLAR Medicated Gel Cleanser, 2% salicylic acid\n\n\\* Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Exfoliating Toner\n\n\\* Dapsone Gel 7.5% (spot treatment)\n\n\\* WINLEVI (clascoterone) cream 1%\n\n\\* Dr. G Red Blemish moisturizer\n\n\\* Aquaphor on lips\n\n**+ On Makeup Days**\n\n\\* Dr. Jart Cicapair Color Correcting Treatment\n\n\\* Milk Hydro Grip Primer\n\n\\* Dior Forever Skin Correct concealer\n\n\\* *Occasionally* Hourglass Ambient Soft Glow Foundation\n\n\\* Charlotte Tilbury setting spray\n\n**P.M.**\n\n\\* Makeup removed with Garnier Micellar Water (sensitive skin) \n\n\\* Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% - Sulfur 5% Cleanser\n\n\\* ZORYVE (roflumilast) foam\n\n\\* Dapsone Gel 7.5% (spot treatment)\n\n\\* Obagi Retivance - Retinaldehyde serum\n\n\\* WINLEVI (clascoterone) cream 1%\n\n\\* Dr. G Red Blemish moisturizer\n\n\\* Aquaphor on lips\n\nSorry if the skincare listing is excessive - it’s my first post on this sub and I feel like detail is key…",

Now I can barely leave the house because of my skin.\n\nCurrent routine: (as prescribed by a dermatologist)\n\nAM\n\ncerave 4% benzoyl peroxide acne foaming cleanser\n\nclindamycin topical lotion 1%\n\ncerave moisturizing lotion\n\nPM\n\nla roche posay gentle hydrating cleanser\n\ncerave moisturizing lotion\n\nBeen using this routine for about three weeks now. The derm also prescribed me tretinoin, but I am nervous to start it because I was under the impression you shouldn’t start it with other actives in the mix.  \n\nI am also worried because, when the acne first started, I tried using a salicylic acid cleanser (PM only, no AM routine at all) with no moisturizer (very stupid, I know). When it was clearly only irritating my skin, I quit that cleanser started only using cerave moisturizing lotion. \n\nI am concerned that I have damaged my skin barrier and am reluctant to start tret if that is the case. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? The derm has been unhelpful and uncaring and I can’t afford to see someone better with my insurance. \n\nI’ve noticed that after putting on moisturizer in the AM/PM, my skin becomes unbearably itchy and **so, so, so** oily. The itchiness has been consistent when using the salicylic acid and then the moisturizer, but I never noticed my skin being so insanely oily before.   I think my skin is more on the oily side naturally, but I am honestly not really sure. \n\nThank you!! 🩷",

Maybe you lovely people could suggest any changes to help get a bit more definition and less poofiness? You can see my hair is really trying!! I would love just some nice beach waves to be honest. And my curtain bangs to be less weird shaped haha \n\n2 washes ago I started! I double shampooed, first with head n shoulders and then with the L’Oréal clarifying shampoo as shown in pic 3. I wash hair like once or twice a week and it’s so thick I tend to shampoo twice to get it nice and clean. Planning to use L’Oréal shampoo every couple of weeks or so as our water is very hard here. \n\nMy routine: double shampoo using head and shoulders, then use wella conditioner in pic 3 and let it sit while I wash my body. Then rinse and plop for a bit with my towel before applying the garnier curl cream, scrunch it a bit with my hands and then try not to touch it and pray that my daughter doesn’t pull the crap out of it… once it is dry I add a bit of the argan oil serum in like a wiping and scrunching motion on the frizzy bits and ends. \n\nI’m trying not to buy more crap I don’t need so not sure I need to invest in silk pillows and special microfibre towels? My hair is too thick for a T-shirt to plop with I think. ",
