It's also Paraben free and Reef safe. \n\nNext I checked the full ingredients list. Here's what I found:\n\nThere are a few differences within the ingredients:\n\nHumectants: India uses Propanediol | USA uses Propylene Glycol\n\nHyaluronic Form: India uses Sodium Hyaluronate | USA uses Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid\n\nPreservatives: India uses Phenoxyethanol and Ethylhexylglycerin | USA uses Parabens, like Methylparaben &amp; Propylparaben\n\nRest all ingredients as similar to the USA variant!!!\n\nRight now I just kept it short and simple.

Minimalist salicylic acid \n2. CeraVe Resurfacing retinol serum \n3. Cetaphil oily skin cleanser \n4. Neutrogena cleanser normal to oily (just started this one though) \n\nI use cheap neem face washes (medimix and Himalaya) or pears shower gel. They haven't aggravated my skin, just serve their basic purpose I guess. \n\nI do love and use the Himalaya neem face pack, that one actually feels great, eliminated some bad acne and gave me an overall brighter clean look. \nI also have really bad hyperpigmentation on the rest of my body and blackheads on my nose.\n\nI don't use much moisturizer on my face due to having oily skin and commute that exposes me directly to pollution for long periods. \n\nI did go to a dermat about two years ago who gave me a bunch of products but told me mine was hormonal. I don't have PCOS, my periods are regular. I am overweight by 20kgs (working on losing it) just 10k steps and reducing meal quantities.\n\nWill this be fixed by weight loss? Or are there products that can aid this? ",

(I have a 9-hour one coming up this summer), my body just... rebels.\n\n​By the time I arrive to my destination,I don’t even recognize myself in the mirror. My face gets so dry and puffy, especially under my eyes, my cheeks, jaw, really my emtire face, puffy and my fingers and stomach feel so swollen. It was like this throughout a wedding functions throughout my trip last year. It was very hard to get over the symptoms.  I infact couldn't... \n\nI have several South Asian wedding functions coming up across the border and I’m terrified of looking like this in all the photos.\n\n​I feel like I’m doing everything \"right\", I drink water, I try to watch my salt, I even try to use a Gua Sha when I get there, but nothing is working. I’m clearly missing something.\n\n​Is it the sitting in the vehicle while getting to the destination?\n\n​Is it the air in the car? Was it the air in the hotel that dried out my skin?!\n\n​Am I drinking too much water? Or not enough??!\n\n​Should I be using specific products or tools during the drive? or after? \n\nShould I take my nuface with me? or gua sha it ? I don't know what to do!! \n\n​I honestly have no idea what to do at this point. If anyone has ever dealt with this or has a \"holy grail\" trick to stop the swelling before it starts, please help! I'm desperate!\n\nI really don't want to suffer, I was in bittersweet sadness throughout the family wedding.  I don't want to be haunted by the same issue by this trip too. I am open all advice!!! ",

Sharing my Jan &amp; Feb empties.\n\nSkin type: Acne-prone combination\n\nSeason: Winter (my skin becomes dry)\n\nDuring winter, I focused more on hydration and barrier repair while slowly targeting acne\n\n• COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Essence\n\nUsing this for the past 3 years and always keep it stocked. Great for hydration and calming acne without clogging pores. A solid staple for my winter routine.\n\n• L’Oréal Glycolic Bright Serum\n\nUsing regularly at night for pigmentation. It works gradually acne marks fade with consistent use. Needs patience.(WRP)\n\n• L’Oréal Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\nOkay-okay hydration. Lightweight, layers well, not sticky. Nothing extraordinary, but does the job. I personally prefer this over The Ordinary one. (WNRP)\n\n• L’Oréal Eye Serum\n\nBetter for puffiness. I mainly have dark circles (no puffiness), and it helped slightly but not dramatically.\n\n(WNRP)\n\n• The Derma Co AHA-BHA-PHA Peeling Solution\n\nFirst time trying it. Helped with texture and mild acne marks but caused some irritation. (WNRP)\n\n• Earth Rhythm Phytoceramide Moisturizer\n\nReally helpful for winter dryness. Texture is similar to CeraVe or Bioderma — creamy, barrier-supporting, and nourishing without clogging pores. Worked very well for my dry skin during winter. (WNRP)\n\n• Moody Sunscreen\n\nVery lightweight and great for humid weather. My tube was close to expiry, so I finished it during winter. Texture-wise, better suited for summer. (MRP)\n\n• Deconstruct Sunscreen\n\nGood for winter, slightly heavier. Budget-friendly, but I don’t think I can use it in summer. (WNRP)\n\n• Parachute Body Lotion\n\nBasic winter body lotion. Does the job for dryness.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",
