It's also Paraben free and Reef safe. \n\nNext I checked the full ingredients list. Here's what I found:\n\nThere are a few differences within the ingredients:\n\nHumectants: India uses Propanediol | USA uses Propylene Glycol\n\nHyaluronic Form: India uses Sodium Hyaluronate | USA uses Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid\n\nPreservatives: India uses Phenoxyethanol and Ethylhexylglycerin | USA uses Parabens, like Methylparaben &amp; Propylparaben\n\nRest all ingredients as similar to the USA variant!!!\n\nRight now I just kept it short and simple. Let me know if you guys wanna see more of such comparisons 🙂",

      "content": "I (32F) had almost flawless skin up until I hit 30, then hormones did as they do and I ended up with bad acne - one PCOS diagnosis later, and I'm now on spironolactone and topical tretinoin to help, but I'm finding my dynamic wrinkles are getting worse and worse. My skin looks bright and feels bouncy - I don't even have fine lines usually, but when I smile my skin folds like paper around my eyes and mouth. \n\nThere's a pretty high chance this is just genetics, but even so, I wanted to see if there is something I'm doing wrong, or should be doing as well. Going through other posts, I think vitamin A and Botox/neurotoxins are the only things I haven't tried - partially because I'm worried about upsetting my skin now it's finally recovered. \n\nI used to have a more complex routine with double washing and all that, but I found it worsened my skin and a simple routine works best for me. The climate here is dry with very strong UV rays (you can get sunburned overcast day), so perhaps I'm not doing enough to mitigate that? I'm also thin due to an overactive metabolism and I wonder if I can get more weight on if this will help. \n\nSkin type:\n\n* Skin type: sensitive, combo normal with dry T zone. I also get eczema, especially around my eyes and lips although it isn't severe and bouts usually clear up in a few days. \n\nRoutine:\n\n* AM - gentle foaming cleanser, ceramide gel moisturiser, and sunblock.\n* PM - wash with water and a wash cloth, LED mask (blue and red lights for 10 mins), topical tret every other day, and the same moisturiser. \n* Treatments - micro-needling every 7 weeks (primarily to heal the acne scars) and a mild exfoliating facial. Once a week I'll use a slightly rougher face cloth to exfoliate, as I have yet to find a topical exfoliator that suits my skin. \n\nLifestyle:\n\n* 2-3L water daily, relatively healthy diet (however it's mostly vegetarian, because meat is expensive, and I don't like fish), and usually pretty good sleep with a silk pillow. Exercise is pretty light at the moment due to injury, and I always use sun protection (so hats, glasses, masks etc). \n\nTIA!",
