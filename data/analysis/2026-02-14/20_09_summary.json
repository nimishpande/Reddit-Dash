I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

I also have final some volume on top which i almost never ever achieve when using too much products and/or the curly girl method (but curls are looking a lot more defined and with more shine). This way i also do not care when it goes more wild later due to wind etc. I have now so many curly products and not sure if i even want to use them anymore 🤣.",

I have since then prescribed it to friends and family when suitable and achieved amazing results. Friends of friends have found out about it and asked for treatment too. The drugs are quite cheap in my country. My consultation fee is at the average lowest. And the hair/dermatologic market space is saturated of expensive treatments that just milk money from patients with zero to minimal effect. Its just that people are not well informed on fin/min.\n\nI would like to reach more people and help them regain the hair they love.\n\nI am not sure how to proceed, since I currently have almost no advertising of this treatment. Also, the drugs can simply be prescribed by any other doctor too. How should I go about this when marketing? I am not sure how to proceed.\n\nHow did you find out about it? How do you think I can reach more patients and help?\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "Took me a while, but I think I’ve finally figured out how to make my Dyson styling actually work — especially on my curly (2C/3A) hair.\n\nThis is the exact order I follow:\n\n• On damp hair, I apply a damage-repair leave-in. Currently using the Redken ABC leave-in.\n\n• Then I layer a small amount of L’Oréal Paris Hyaluron leave-in for extra moisture and the L’Oréal Extraordinary Oil serum for smoothness and shine.\n\n• I let my hair air dry a bit before using heat. If I’m in a hurry, I rough dry slightly first.\n\nFor styling:\n\nMost days, I either use just the round brush attachment for a simple blowout, or just the paddle brush if I want it straighter and sleeker.\n\nToday, I first used the paddle brush attachment to smooth everything out and create a base. After that, I switched to the round barrel attachment for volume and a soft 90s-style blowout.\n\nI work in smaller sections — around 3 seconds on high heat, followed by 4 seconds of cool shot to set.\n\nThe most important step: hairspray after finishing each section. I used Schwarzkopf Taft Ultra. That’s what actually makes the style last without making it stiff.\n\nPeople at work have been asking if I style my hair every day, but I don’t. I do this once a week and it lasts till my next wash.\n\nSharing pictures because this might be my best Dyson day so far.",

I’m getting fewer active breakouts, but my biggest issue now is dark spots.\n\nI currently use Aklief, which is a topical retinoid, along with azelaic acid. I’ve recently started lightly adding tranexamic acid from Good Molecules in the morning to help with hyperpigmentation.\n\nMy main concerns now are texture and occasional breakouts every few weeks that leave dark spots. I have many tiny bumps across my skin, and when squeezed, a thin white substance sometimes comes out. I’m not sure if these are sebaceous filaments. My skin is generally dry, though it can look oily after products. I also experience flaking under my eyebrows, but not significant irritation.\n\nRoutine:\nMorning: Vanicream gentle cleanser, CeraVe PM, Biore UV Aqua Rich SPF 50. \nNight: Same cleanser, Aklief, CeraVe PM, sometimes a thin layer of Vaseline.\n\nI’ve also improved my diet and am eating more vegetables, which seems to have reduced breakouts. I’m wondering if this is a long-term process. Any advice would be appreciated!!",

      "content": "\nI (27F) have had acne since I was 13. I feel like I have tried everything under the sun and am trying spirnolactone now but pretty much at my wits end if it doesn’t work well. \nIt became much worse and more cystic over the past 4-5 years, and especially over the past year. For a while I was getting regularly monthly facials from a med spa, usually alternating between hydro facials, biorepeels, and about once a year or so a chemical peel. I’ve always used cerave products and used olay moisturizer for years until I went to a derm 3 years ago and now use vanicream. My skin is uber sensitive. I used a gel clindamyacin and tret for about 2 years which was somewhat help at keeping things at bay but they never really got better. Eventually I got insane flare ups of cystic acne lasting weeks and all coming up in clumps around one another. I stopped everything and have essentially started from scratch again. My mom struggled with adult acne too, and my derm seems to think it’s more genetics than anything. Doesn’t think it’s food related whatsoever and my hormones are pretty consistently balanced. Obviously androgens do play a role. Just got started on 25 mg of spirnolactone. Current routine: double cleanse with cerave hydrating face wash at night, moisturizer, tret, sometimes a hydrating face mask or cell protection balm (glymed+). Sometimes for white heads (if ever, typically closed) I will put on a dab of eminence clay mask. \nMorning is typically just a rinse, face wash if I feel necessary, vanicream moisturizer, cell protection balm for extra moisture. My current state (pictured) is the best my skin has looked in honestly probably a year or so. I did start drinking peppermint tea every day for inflammation so maybe that is also helping??? \nI use an antibacterial facial mist sometimes. And every once in a while, pimple patches if coming to a head too or super inflamed. \nAny recs for all the dark/red spots? I’ve heard of a CO2 laser working wonders but I wonder how safe it is if you still have cystic acne? I don’t many esti’s wont touch cystic (for the best). I just feel defeated with my skin because I don’t feel confident in my relationships, personal and work. A lot of people think I’m younger (bc of my acne), which I try to take as a compliment :). \nTYIA! ",

I had been straightening it for about 7-8 years and only a few months ago decided that i want to go natural. I practically shaved my head off and now only have 2-3 inches of growth.\n\nI live in Japan so its a bit harder to get products for curly hair. I think i have a good routine but i still have no idea what im doing. Whenever i look up videos to help they are all of girls with long curls and i cant do the stuff that they do yet.\n\nBecause of this I often leave the house with a lot of frizz, at first i was just so happy to finally have my natural hair I thought my frizz was cute and natural but many of my friends or people say stuff like\n\n“define it!”\n\n“It looks goofy when its frizzy-“\n\n“you dont know how to take care of your hair do you?”\n\n“You should use gels.”\n\nAnd because im a beginner i dont wanna just ignore them but they all have straight hair with little to no experience with hair like mine and often times it just feels like criticism without actual advice. It makes me irrationably angry sometimes.\n\nIve seen many people talk about frizz and i know that its normal and i see posts with girls with long curly hair with comments like\n\n“Love the normalization of frizz!”\n\nBut my hair isnt long. Its really short. I dont know if im allowed to have frizz.\n\nThis isnt a post asking for advice to get rid of frizz i just wanna know if you guys deal with this too. Do people often comment about your hair? Try to subtly touch your hair? Try to tell you how to fix it when you didnt even ask? Am i going to have to get used to these things?\n\nOf course any tips on taking care of hair is MORE than welcome too tho!\n\nMy routine..(if you can even call it a routine) 3b-3c\n\n1. Wash twice (dove shampoo intense repair)\n2. Rake Leave in through curls. (African pride olive miracle from amazon)\n3. Rake coil sculpting custard and finger curls some parts of the head (Mielle pomegranate and honey custard)\n4. Put bonnet on and sleep\n5. Wake up and shake my head a bit to loosen curls.\n\nPLEASE help. Anything. Tips on haircare, how to deal with people touching, if frizz is unhealthy, funny stories with your curls, im just so lost right now.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

They're like festoons but not that voluminous, mostly just looks like a deep wrinkle, and i don't understand why is it so noticeable in one side but not the other. Wondering whether microneedling could be of help with this or not??\n\nI'm also worried about my skin looking so droopy and having fine lines at 20, is that normal? or is it just dehydration? \nI confess I don't moisturize that often, because I've always had a very oily skin, that makes it prone to acne (specially the small whitehead pimple kind), clogged pores and blackheads. But since I use a SA cleanser for that (Cerave), I usually do apply some hydrating cream every morning. Even when I don't, my skin soon gets somewhat oily by itself. \nBesides from that, there's not much I do for skincare. I use glycolic acid occasionally for the blackheads and pores, i think it helped to reduce the size of the blackheads overtime but my pores are still very clogged and big.\n\nI'm fairly lost here so any guidance, advice or honest opinions are very much appreciated 🙏",

I’ll attach some unflattering pictures of myself in the name of solving my issues.\n\nI’ll start with some details about myself:\n\n\\- 26F\n\n\\- combination/dry very sensitive skin\n\n\\- don’t suffer from any known facial skin problems, I do have psoriasis but it’s only ever shown on my hands and elbows\n\n\\- on birth control (not sure this is relevant but why not)\n\n\\- never really suffered from acne, if i do get spots it will be one big mean one in the middle of my forehead or something\n\n\\- I live in the UK - in case anyone wants to recommend products\n\nA few months ago, lets say end Oct-Nov, I realised my skin is getting really dull and lifeless, I never really had a skin care routine apart from the occasional azelaic acid 10% when i had some redness, cicaplast baume B5 (cream or gel version) again when needed, moisturiser the ordinary natural factors+HA, and sunscreen (BOJ or Caudelie stick) when spring/summer starts since I live in Wales and the autumn/winter months i don’t actually see the sun since I leave for work in the early hours when it’s dark and leave work late afternoon also dark\n\nSo, I decided it was time to put a skincare routine together to brighten my face up a bit. Here is what I do:\n\nMorning\n\nNo face wash\n\nSKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n\nAveeno Calm + Restore gel moisturiser (I changed from the ordinary one because I started seeing some breakouts from it even tho I’ve been using it for years, and I felt I needed a heavier moisturiser as my skin felt much drier)\n\nEvening\n\nRound Lab 1025 Dokdo Cleanser\n\nPurito Wonder Releaf Centella Serum Unscented\n\nAveeno Calm + Restore gel moisturiser\n\nI am very aware it’s extremely simple but I don’t understand what could be causing this reaction on my skin. I have stopped using azelaic acid because I started thinking maybe my skin is too sensitive for it\n\nMy current issues that show up at least once a week for the past 2 months:\n\n\\- red and irritated on my forehead\n\n\\- itchy\n\n\\- bumps and spots that are not whiteheads, they are never to be popped (minus the one you see on my lip, those happen every so often, and I wax my upper lip)\n\n\\- mostly around my forehead and between my brows, and my chin a lot too\n\nI had an incident just before christmas where I had a hot bath and then as I came out of the bath and dried off, i thought it was a good idea to put moisturiser on straight after and I probably gave myself heat irritation because my skin looked horrendously inflamed so i stopped using any products for a few days and that was fine\n\nI tried using the LRP Cicaplast gel and the cream a couple weeks ago because my skin looked a bit irritated again and those made it worse so I stopped using those entirely, it became red and looked like in the pictures.\n\nI was considering to introduce a retinol in my routine  once a week, then progressively increase the frequency and wanted to start either with the CeraVe retinol serum or the The Inkey List Starter Retinol, but open to other suggestions for those too (more budget friendly if possible)\n\nPlease help me understand what is going on and if you can recommend some gentle products.\n\nHope this is enough information but happy to answer questions if needed!!\n\nThank you Reddit 🫶🏼",

I'm from the Philippines so some products may be limited in availability to me.\n\nCurrently, my products include the Mise en Scene Perfect Serum Styling Shampoo &amp; Treatment, Selsun Blue Extra Moisturizing Shampoo (I only use this once or twice a week), Mise en Scene Perfect Serum Super Rich and Curls by Zenutrients Leave-in Conditioner.\n\nI usually wet my hair first and wash my scalp with either Mise en Scene Styling Shampoo or Selsun Blue (depends if my hair has some flakes in it) then I rinse it off and use the Styling Conditioner on my ends. After rinsing the conditioner off, I use 1-2 pumps of the Super Rich serum and then use the Leave-in Conditioner on my ends and scrunch them. I then leave it to air-dry or either just clip it up.\n\nI usually protect my hair while sleeping by wearing a silk bonnet but other than that everything I've mentioned above is all I do to my hair currently.\n\nCan you guys help me with a routine, the right products and what method I can do to fully bring my curls out?

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

      "content": "Long story short: I (22M) have low to moderate acne on my face+upper back. The derm prescribed benzoyl peroxide 4% wash and Aklief (and moisturiser). But he also said not to use BPO wash on the whole face, and just try it on the cheeks (because according to him my skin is dry; it is also very oily). But I also get some bigger pimples/pustules on my temples/forehead occasionally (especially since I started using Aklief). So I thought I‘d use some 5% Benzac BPO for these spots only, maybe every day or every second day. Right now I am only starting with Aklief and am using it every 4th day but after a few weeks I should ramp it up to every day.\n\nNow the question is: is it a good idea or not? Have you tried using Aklief with BPO? Did it irritate/damage your skin? Is it maybe better to leave BPO on there for a few minutes/hour and wash it off?\n\nIt’s my first real treatment so I‘d be glad if someone could help me get some answers or their own routine.\n\nThanks!",

      "content": "I’ve been on 25mg a day of spiro for almost a year for acne/acne rosacea\n\nLast June was when the spotting started. I had been traveling a lot so figured that’s why I was spotting even though I was nowhere near starting my period. Later, when I went back to the dermatologist, they mentioned it may cause spotting. So mystery solved!\n\nIt’s gotten to a point now where it’s after EVERY cycle. I can’t stand it, my periods are rough enough I am not trying a round 2 😭😭 I’m at the point where I wanna switch meds.\n\ni just want to know if anyone else experienced this, if anything helped, what didn't help, and if they continued on spiro after??\n\nthank you!! 💓💕",
