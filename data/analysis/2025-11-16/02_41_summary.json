      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

The only thing is I have REALLY tough and deep dark marks and hyperpigmentation and I worry that the only way to get rid of them is getting a chemical peel/microneedling/etc whatever else lmao. I am not opposed to it but its expensive af. Do yall think these spots will fade without professional intervention and I can just continue on my current routine? Of note I use Vitamin C, AHA, the Faded Topicals cream (which has TXA, niacinamide, kojic acid, and azelaic acid) and 0.005% tretinion (its a small concentration but its my first time using tret so my next bottle will be 0.02%). I would really appreciate any help, included pictures, with different lighting too! (i am wearing blush in the 2nd and 4th pic but that’s the only face makeup I am wearing!)",

I've been recommended wide-tooth combs a lot, but I can't even pass fingers through my hair. It gets tangled and matted so fast! \n\nMy living conditions are also far from ideal. I work in wildland fire in the summer, and chainsaw work in the winter. So I wear hardhats all the time, in very hot and very cold conditions, I always end up with twigs and branches struck through my hair, which end up damaging my hair when I try to pull it out. \n\nI also live in a dry cabin with a woodstove, so its very dry inside in the winter, and I don't have a regular access to a shower. (I setup a camping shower in the greenhouse this summer and it's been awesome, but it's now winter and I'm not showering outside at -30 😅)\n\nSo far, my routine has been to shampoo, condition and use a detangle brush every time I shower, then air dry. It varies from everyday up to a week between a proper overhead shower. I'm not brand-loyal when it comes to toiletries, but I try to avoid the cheaper brands.\n\nI always wear hats, but I'm hoping for a way to get better coils/waves instead of a giant poof in the back of my head.

But for me personally, the biggest issue wasn’t diet at all. My skin completely freaked out because:\n\n\t•\tI was using way too many products in a short period of time\n\n\t•\tI didn’t give my skin any time to breathe\n\n\t•\tOne of the products I used was actually expired (I only realized later…)\n\n\t•\tAdd stress + bad sleep on top of that, and it was a recipe for disaster\n\nOnce I simplified my routine, stopped piling on new products, and focused on reducing stress and getting better sleep, things improved so much.\n\nAnother thing I’ve realized: we always see our own skin as worse than it really is. Nobody pays as much attention to our face as we do. Getting super close to the mirror is one of the biggest mistakes—you end up analyzing every pore and every tiny bump, when in reality no one else sees your skin from that distance.\n\nI’m sharing this in case anyone else has gone through something similar or feels overwhelmed by all the skincare trends and recommendations out there. \n\nYour skin doesn’t always need more—sometimes it just needs a break. And remember: every skin is different, so don’t feel pressured to follow everything you see online.\n\nAnd just a little heads-up for anyone struggling right now: it really does get better. Hang in there.",

I don't quite have a strict routine. \n\nMy normal hair care is: \n- Wash with shampoo and conditioner (Jeval don't go changing colour)\n- Squeeze out water with a towel and spray leave-in (Bhave super nova multi-use spray)\n\nAnd to dry I either \n1 blow dry and straighten\n2 VO5 curl defining mousse and diffuse (like photo)\n3 braid and sleep with them in.\n\nI also don't do anything for night time.

I want to try to use this as a healing restart to finally learn how to care for my 4C Haitian hair with love and patience.\n\nI was adopted by a white family when I was a baby, and never really learned how to care for my afro. My family learned how to do box braids, so I’ve just rocked those my whole life. \n\nBut now I could really use some help building a daily/weekly/monthly routine, with affordable product suggestions. I’m also open to beginner-friendly protective style recommendations. \n\nThank you all ahead of time for any feedback.",

To speed up drying after cast is well set, use cone on roots, upside-down, holding casts with arm to keep from blowing around until fully dry.\n14. 3 drops Righteous Roots hair oil warmed in palms, gather hair on top of head and gently squeeze to ends. Fluff roots. Scrunch any cast around face by smoothing lengths roots to ends with \"triangle fingers\".\n15.

      "content": "Hi all! For context, these pads from SkinMedica have been a holy grail product for me for the past year because I’ve been using tretinoin for years but struggled with the constant peeling and buildup of dead skin on my face. These pads completely fixed that problem for me and really took me to that next, ‘glass skin’ level where my skin is always new and smooth with no buildup sitting on top, my other products don’t pill, and makeup sits so much better now that there is no dead skin or flakiness for it to cling to. I also feel like it has helped fade my PIH, helps clear up any active pimples so quickly, and it helps me ensure my skin is extra clean (after double cleansing the pads will sometimes still pick up some makeup residue!).\n\nNow the catch is each jar is $60, so $1 per pad. I don’t use them every day but still often enough to where I’ve repurchased them several times already. I always wonder if there’s a cheaper alternative but I’m scared to try something new and break out when these work for me so well. I’m hoping someone here knows of any dupes, or could take a look at the ingredients I screenshotted from the SM website and let me know if I truly need all of these key ingredients together to get the benefits I listed above or if there’s just one of them that’s doing most of the work that I could buy from The Ordinary or something and get the same results? Thank you all so much in advance! &lt;33 (sorry for the literal essay I could talk about skincare for HOURS lol)",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",

I have weird random waves in the front and the rest of my hair pretends to be wavy, but a lot of the time it’s just shapeless and flat.\n\nWhen I try to bring out my waves, pretty much all products just weigh my hair down and make it oilier faster. So I think I’ll just stop trying with that.\n\nI don’t have enough time or talent to spend time heat styling my hair. But weirdly, if I don’t blow dry it after I wash it, my hair is already an oily mess by the next day.\n\nI just recently had it cut so it’s actually a lot less ratty than it used to look. 😅\n\nDoes anyone have any routine/product suggestions? Feeling pretty hopeless. Thanks so much in advance for any guidance!! 🙏🏻",

My routine is (once a week) Olaplaex shampoo followed by an Argan oil hair mask.\n\nI used Wet Brushes for a while, but I absolutely destroy them (the bristles break) and my hair stays tangly. I don’t think they are strong enough. I started using a cheap nylon brush from Target that works better.\n\nI need something with power behind it. No flexible “wet brush” type detangling brushes that leave my hair tangly. No boar bristle brushes, they make my hair so frizzy. Any suggestions? ",
