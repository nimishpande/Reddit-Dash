      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "(psa - all identities and identifying information have been hidden and i don’t mean this stylist any harm) For context, I wouldn’t have ever booked w them on my own because of an unsatisfactory first experience with this stylist, and the fact that they’re newer and little inexperienced. I will say he did a WAYYY BETTER job this time and I am glad to see his progress, but my hair is very curly, long, and thick, therefore, very hard and time consuming to style and requires a lot of skill, that’s why I didn’t think I would be an ideal client for them and never really considered rebooking. I think my mistake was thinking that the offer still stood weeks later, but I mean they left it up to me to book whenever and said the they service would be on them. They didn’t mention any prices during our session or set any expectation that this was paid session, not to mention that their suite wasn’t even completely set up yet. I think a free service is not crazy when you walk into what I walked into, items scattered on the floor, not cleaned properly between clients (i.e. cut hair still on the chair) and their wash sink being in the unfinished and sketch basement of the suite building. And to top it all off they were goneeee 🍃when i got there lol, like i could care less if you smoke or not, but time and place, how do you expect to build a business with no type of professionalism towards your own establishment. Also I mentioned I have very curly hair, my texture is comparable to 3a/b hair, so still a softer pattern, this context is important because he said I could choose any style I want. I just asked for pin straight hair and trim on the edges, he did not make it pin straight and instead did big waves, because he didn’t know how to work with my hair, and also did not trim it, after assuring me I could ask for whatever I wanted. Lastly, everything was well before this part, but he put a thick wax/pomade in my roots to make my hair lay flat, iykyk, but this type of product is usually used for wigs or i believe more coiler textured hair, MY HAIR TEXTURE IS TOO SOFT FOR THIS SORT OF STYLING, and now my roots are greasy and flat and I’m going to have to wash my hair and redo it myself. I understand their time should be valued but I think that it should’ve been communicated better as a business owner and not allow me to LITERALLY WALK OUT without clarifying lol, I will pay them nonetheless bc I am not one to try n skip a tab, NEVER!! I just would’ve preferably spent my money elsewhere had I known better, what do you guys think, am I entitled for expecting this service to be free today? ",

      "content": "I have some sort of wild mix of 2a-2c hair. Sometimes I get really cute wrapped curls, other times it loose and frizzy. Most of the time it’s a mix of both. I would love some advice on how to make it more consistently lean into the more wrapped/defined curls.\n\nI believe I have medium porosity hair, as water does bead up some when first getting it wet. Takes a good couple minutes to get it fully soaked. Here are the products / routine I am using currently.\n\nI am washing my hair every 3-4 days depending on what’s going on/ how it’s looking.\n\nStep 1- Get in the shower, soak my hair and use a light detangling spray. Currently using the Marc Anthony Grow Long spray. Brush out my hair completely with a denman type wet brush.\n\nStep 2- Shampoo and condition hair. I was using the Kristin Ess curly S &amp; C, but recently just switched to Rizos Curl Biotin S&amp;C\n\nStep 3- Still in the shower, apply Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Cury Envy Cream. Brush through my hair, and then while under the water scrunch my hair with a bit more cream in my hands.\n\nStep 4- Get out of the shower, get dressed, and scrunch some of the excess water out of my hair with a micro fiber towel.\n\nStep 5- Prayer hands apply Cantù Wave Whip Curling Mousse. Scrunch in if needed but usually try to avoid that.\n\nI do not do any diffusing / drying of my hair, which I know I’ll get some flack about. But I’m a working mom of 2 and never have the time to do it given how thick my hair is.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions on what I could do differently without adding a ton of extra time to my routine that would be amazing. Open to product recommendations or answering questions to help determine what I should do.",

      "content": "The other day I had a horrible breakout that attacked my entire face. I often get cysts and in recent years I've suddenly been getting these really painful clusters of white heads, when I pick them more white heads immediately just keep popping back up.\n\nMy entire jaw line was full of these combinations of painful pimples. One area I ripped the skin and started to scab. I was using hydrogen peroxide to try to \"clean up\" the affected areas, not realizing how bad that was. Then, my dumb a** was googling trying to find solutions to heal, so I came across the medicated hydrocolloid bandages. Well, after slapping those all over my face and waiting a few hours. I noticed the bandages were so moist and full of puss I decided to take them off.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I tried removing the one on my jawline with the scab and it ended up taking pretty much a layer of my skin and the scab off leaving a hole in my face. The others also turned into bigger wounds.\n\nI went to the walk in and was prescribed clindamycin/tretinoin - Biacna Gel. Now here is where I need advice, this area has only slightly started to dry up and still has active puss/pimples in some areas. The spot in my chin is still raw and full of whiteheads. Am I safe to apply the gel to these areas or should I wait? Is there anything else I can do for pain relief and healing?  If anyone out there has more advice for me or suggestions on products I should use after to help repair my skin barrier would also be greatly appreciated.\n\nI've attached pictures of right after, from yesterday and another of how my skin looks today after only washing my face with hot water as I was told not to use anything else. \n",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I recently had my graduation, and since it was a special day, I decided to get my makeup done professionally… and honestly, it was awful. My brows were super square, the base didn’t look good, and I was already running late, so I just had to go as I was. The photos were such a disappointment, and instead of feeling confident, I felt uncomfortable the whole time.\n\nBecause of that experience, I’ve decided I want to learn to do my own makeup. I’ve always wanted to, but I never really learned. In my whole life, I’ve worn makeup maybe 5 times: 4 were done by my sister (she’s no longer with us, so it hurts that I never got to learn from her), and the 1 time I paid for it… which was this time, and it went terribly.\n\nI’m a very simple/natural person. I just want to learn how to enhance myself a little for special occasions—natural skin, decent brows, soft makeup, nothing heavy.\n\nSo I wanted to ask:\n\nWhere should a complete beginner start?\n\nWhat are the basic products I should buy?\n\nAny simple beginner-friendly techniques for natural makeup?\n\nDo you recommend any channels, tutorials, or creators for soft/natural looks?\n\nAnything you wish you had known when you first started?\n\n\nThank you so much for any advice. ❤️",

I mostly struggle with acne and the stuff you get on your nose, I'm unsure on what products are best for it since I'm aware everyones skin can be different, I will state I'm underage won't say how old but above 15 (Just uncomfortable saying my age) I know saying can help since some products can be harmful if you're too young.\n\nAs for my skin type.. I really don't know it's not oily or anything besides on my nose, not dry either it's just kinda chill besides acne, I normally just get it on my forehead, nose, chin, and sometimes my cheeks, besides that I think my skin is healthy?? Who knows honestly but that's all I really hope someone can help out!! Thank you for reading \n",

I put a little NYM Flash Freeze gel (5) just on then ends that tend to straighten.\n10. Microplop depending on porosity, enough to dry fairly fast (YouTube) \n11. Diffuse cupping just the ends, just a little to set cast on the ends but not put weird bends. \n12. Hover diffuse - set cast to 70% dry\n[Ali Noskowiak diffuse routine ](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cz347PyO6LC/?igsh=MWoweWVuZWw1b2NoYw==)\n13. To speed up drying after cast is well set, use cone on roots, upside-down, holding casts with arm to keep from blowing around until fully dry.\n14. 3 drops Righteous Roots hair oil warmed in palms, gather hair on top of head and gently squeeze to ends. Fluff roots. Scrunch any cast around face by smoothing lengths roots to ends with \"triangle fingers\".\n15.

Now, everywhere I go, people label me as the ‘bird’s nest hair guy’ and ngl I’m getting kinda sick of it, so I want to make it look better or just presentable.\n\nI’ve tried many things in the past, but my current routine is shampooing every week or two, with more frequent conditioning. Ive tried oils in the past too, but none seem to work and even smells rancid after a couple hours out in the sun, so I don’t use em now. Short haircuts also don’t work thanks to my Vegeta hairline which I would like to hide. \n\nAnyone knows what to do in my situation? Like any low-cost and low-maintenance routine I can do to at least not make it look so dry under the sun and puff up like crazy? I thinking of grabbing a Tsubaki Hair Mask, so do let me know what you think of that, but in the mean time I’m a fairly broke college student so I can’t afford luxury or high end products/treatments 😭. \n\nThanks in advance :)",
