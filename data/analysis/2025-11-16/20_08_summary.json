My roommate always threads her face and eyebrows.  Dyes her eyebrows and waxes and shaves regularly. I grew up in a house where my elder had no hair growth on her body or face and my mom is toooo pretty for these things. Same with her as well no hair growth. But me. I'm complete opposite. I have v uneven eye brows. Alot of face hair and body hair.  The problem is because my mom and my sister never did any sort of such things.  I never learned. But now that I'm living among other girls I finally see that wow I have been living like a man.  \nBut Idk where to start. I have alot of acne scars.  I'm scared that if I wax my face and eye brows it will idk come back worst.  I got the Braun trimmer something for my facial hair but idk I feel extremely weird using it.  Idk if I should dye my eyebrows or wax my hands too. I feel idk.  Out of place.  Idk how to adapt to these things. And when I ask my mom about it she makes it a big deal honestly.\nSo I turned to the random mom's of the internet. What do you think I should do. Or start with. I want honest replies please. I'm in a new country with new environment can't look like a dracula here. Need to look my best. So please help. ",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

We do this every 4ish days. But always by the next day it gets tangled again. \nI want to know, how can I help him style his hair to keep it safe and manageable while still long? \n\nAnd a side question: what type of hair salon could handle this type of hair best in the event that I screw up?

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I’m a former cosmetologist who specialized in curl and wave styling, it’s genuinely some of my favorite things to do. recently, my partner had me cut their hair up to her shoulders for the first time in years, and the waves we’ve suspected were there are starting to show through. her hair is INSANELY thick, like she could keep her phone under it while showering and it would be fine. we figured their previous length weighed down the waves too much to have much of a shape, but her new short hair has let them peak through a bit more especially when wet. they’ve been experimenting with scrunching and styling in the shower, but any waves they create are gone by about noon because of the density and weight of her hair.\n\nI know she is generally very low maintenance when it come to hair, and doenst really know where to start, so next weekend I’m planning on styling their hair wavy for the first time so she can see what’s possible (and I can figure out what works if they want it again). Does any one have product recommendations for 2b/2c hair that will hold without weighing down her already heavy hair?\n\nTL;DR, my partners hair is too heavy to hold waves, product recommendations? (specifically gel/serums/curl creams and maybe some leave in conditioners)\n\nObviously I don’t have a routine laid out quite yet, but it’s required to post so here’s what I have so far: I’m not sure what shampoo/conditioner they normally use but I’ll be bringing one thats curl friendly (sulfate and silicone free!) as well as an argan oil hair mask that has always left my hair extremely moisturized. I might also attempt to add some Not your mothers sea salt spray if anyone thinks that might help, and I already own Eco gel for my own hair if you guys dont think that will weigh things down. I will be diffusing instead of air drying at they HATE the feeling of wet hair, especially on their neck.",

WHAT do i do ??? i always make sure to take care of my hair and it was SO healthy for years but this just destroyed a chunk of it in seconds. is there anyway to fix this? should i use a special product? should i expect the ends of the strands to fall out in the next few days? i straighten my hair every time i wash it (with lots of heat protector), is that gonna make it instantly fall out ? i always see horror stories so im very worried. any advice would be helpful!!! \nalso it only sucked up like a small chunk and only like 1.5 inches high so it could definitely be worse, but i have layers and its in the middle layers so i dont want it to ruin the layered look if it does fall out sooner then my hair would with natural damage. should I just go to my hairdresser and have her fix it ?

Also I know it’s technically a moisturizer, but she’s having me use it more like a serum so I follow up with a heavier moisturizer at night. Because of this, I’d prefer a light, gel or serum texture.
