I have a lot of baby hair that's finally growing out, and I hope it can grow thick and long, although I think it will take quite a while yet",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "(New post since last title flagged auto mod) \n\nI have somehow only recently discovered how horrible my middle part is, I’ve always known it went super far back but as far as I was concerned the top of my head is none of my business. However this picture made me realize how bad it looks, and that since I’m 5” even literally everyone taller than me is seeing the top of my head! I’m sure part of it is I have a very light scalp and dark hair, but it looks bad even on the blonde! I was thinking maybe it’s because my roots are flat because of the weight of my hair as well? (Looking into long layers to try and take some weight off) I’ve tried going halfway back my head and combing that hair backwards to atleast shorten the part, I tried clipping it and letting it dry that way but after 6 HOURS my hair had not dried at all in the sections clipped and as soon as I took them out the dreaded middle part returned just as strong. I’ve seen some tutorials from people with straight hair about brushing the part back while blow drying but I’m not sure how this would work on frizz prone and loose curled hair that looses shape easy. Not to mention I’d have to get someone else to do it for me because it’s so far back. Is the brush/comb and blow dry method my only option? I’ve tried looking at some “no part” curly hair tutorials but I’m not really understanding them. \n\nRoutine as of now:\n1. Wash hair once a week, shampoo with Ogx Coconut Curls and condition with the same conditioner \n2. Clip hair with conditioner in it up onto my head to sit while I finish showering\n3. Comb hair with conditioner in it, then rise when detangled \n4. Squeeze hair just enough so it’s not dripping and add Aussie Hair Insurance leave in, Not your Mothers curl cream, and Not your mothers curl defining gel and brush through with curl brush to evenly distribute \n5. Scrunch sopping wet hair + products and then plop/wrap in a cotton t-shirt for 15 minutes\n6. Let hair down, scrunch out some more water, let air dry\n\nSome notes: I know gel is much heavier than mousse but I’m out of mousse and my hair did the exact same thing at the part with mousse. I’ve also tried adding some claw clips to my roots to try and get them to not dry flat but it always looks silly, I’m sure it’s because of the kind of clip I’m using, I just haven’t figured anything else out. I also do not *think* this is my hair thinning, as I can look back at videos of me from almost 5 years ago and the part is just as bad! I guess I am just now becoming self aware??",

I was going for a 90’s bob / “Pixar mom” cut (inspo on pics 5-7). I’ve had my hair cut short both professionally and non-professionally by my mom, so I thought I knew what to expect.\n\nI let my boyfriend cut my hair and pics 2-4 is how it turned out. Immediately after the haircut, I felt hesitant. We applied some hair mousse and clay, and it looked fine from the front. Once I got home, I combed out my hair and more thoroughly checked the sides.  My hair is so choppy! :(\n\nAnd before anybody says it: I am aware that the inspo pics are styled. I was hoping to achieve somewhat of a similar look with enough heat, round brushing, and mousse + putty. But I just didn’t expect him to cut so short. It’s also really uneven.\n\nSo my question is: is this fixable?? I think I’m going to visit a hair salon rather than have my boyfriend, who says he believes in himself, fix it. Will I be able to get the inspo pic or do I have to change it? If so, does anybody have any suggestions? What should I ask for?",

I also use a gentle cleanser at night before I apply retinol or moisturizer. I’m buying these products on Amazon based on popularity so I don’t know they are optimal. \n\nMy main goal is to look as young as possible for as long as possible and maintain a youthful look. I am 28 and want to achieve an early 20s look and maintain it for as long as possible. Vanity qualms aside does anyone have advice for how to achieve this? I get the basic routine listed in the wiki for this subreddit but that’s geared toward maintenance. There’s so much information out there about what we should be doing - snail secretion moisturizer, copper peptides, retinol/retinoids vs tret, etc etc. What is the ultimate routine to maximize youthfulness and promote anti-aging? I have the basics down (moisturizer, sunscreen, cleanser) but I am looking for the ultimate routine to maximize youthfulness and maintain for as long as possible. Can someone help me parse through this complicated world? Thank you.",
