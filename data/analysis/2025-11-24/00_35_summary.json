      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I’ve been using Minimalist’s 8% glycolic toner and their 32% AHA/BHA/PHA peel for a while. When I first started, both used to sting a lot. Recently… nothing. No burn, no tingle.\n\nI thought the formulas had gone weak, so I tested both with pH strips.\nThe glycolic toner still shows pH ~3.5–4, and the peel gives that classic low-pH orange/red edge that strong acids normally show.\n\nSo the formulas are absolutely fine.\n\nThat’s when the concept of barrier adaptation made total sense.\n\nHere’s what actually happens:\n\nYour barrier gets stronger with consistent use. Early stinging is normal, but long-term users often stop feeling it.\n\nIf your routine already includes other actives (like lactic acid, vitamin C, glycolic masks), you’re already exfoliating → less reaction.\n\nMore hydration = less sting. Moisturizers, snail mucin, hyaluronic sunscreen all buffer acids naturally.\n\nHealthy skin doesn’t scream. Once your barrier is stable and non-irritated, acids feel mild regardless of pH.\n\nStinging is not a measurement of effectiveness. pH + concentration determine performance, not sensation.\n\nTL;DR:\nIf your acids stop stinging, it usually means your skin has adapted — not that the products lost strength.",

I know Botox is the only real fix, but I’d love to include something that could gently soften them.\n\nShe’s *extremely* low-maintenance, so a big routine won’t work.\n\n* She only uses micellar water (and **doesn’t rinse it**)\n* She **dislikes** foaming cleansers because they feel time-consuming\n* She doesn’t use SPF (but works from home with her desk facing a **very sunny window...**)\n* She sometimes travels for work - because of that, I’d love to give her a full-size product plus a small travel-size version she can take with her (but it’s not that important)\n\nDo you have recommendations for a **very quick, non-overwhelming routine** for someone like her? Maybe:\n\n* a low-effort cleanser\n* something simple for dryness/fine lines\n* an easy SPF she might actually use\n\nEven though she says she’s very low-maintenance, when I mentioned wanting to pamper her, she didn’t reject the idea — so I don’t think this would be a bad gift at all!\n\nThanks so much for any recs!\n\n**EDIT (adding):**  \nJust to clarify: I did talk to my sister about trying a couple of low-maintenance products and she **didn’t reject the idea** — she’s very honest and would definitely tell me if she didn’t want skincare, she just doesn’t feel like researching anything herself lol. I obviously didn’t mention her lines to her; I only shared that detail here to help with recommendations. She doesn’t need “fixing” at all — she’s genuinely beautiful — I just included that info so people know her skin type.

      "content": "My skin can’t make up its mind\n\nI really just want some consistency. It has gotten a lot better, but rn I do have a few of these deep hard lumps, not painful after a few days but stays for weeks and weeks. One on my cheek and a couple small ones on my chin. \n\nIts a rollercoaster. Since 2018 I’ve experienced acne (cystic and normal pimples). The pictures show my skin at its best (2023/2024) and then at its worst (June 2024). \n\nI have a prescription for Epiduo. \n\nMy routine is as follows: \nAM\n1. tir tir milk skin toner (been using for a few weeks and no new breakouts, very calming)\n2. Torriden Dive in serum (if my skin is extra dry\n3. Vitamin C – Purito or Mediheal\n4. Skin1004 sun screen \n*makeup (try to stay conscious of ingredients)\n\nPM\n1. balm/oil cleanser – Banilla Co, the ordinary squalane\n2. cleanser – blemish control by Cerave\n3. toner – tir tir milk skin toner (if skin is extra dry)\n4. 1-2 serums (in order of how often)\n- azelaic acid – anua 10+, Cos De Baha \n- torriden dive in serum\n- skin1004 poremizing fresh ampoule \n- anua PDRN 100+\n- the ordinary Niacinamide \n5. Epiduo (every other night)\n6. Moisturiser – Purito Oat-In Gel or Mighty Bamboo panthenol cream \n7. Pimple patches\n*which serum I use depends a little on my skin. F.ex the PDRN is wonderful at soothing, but if I use it too many days in a row it breaks me out, but once in a while doesn’t seem to cause an issue. The pure Niacinamide serum is a bit strong for me, so I only use it occasionally. When I use Epiduo, I limit the use of harsh actives in my other serums. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to get rid of those hard lumps? Or if anything in my routine is alarming? \n\nI have found this works the best so far. It’s been great at treating my scars, and my breakouts are a lot more manageable. And this is the routine that got me away from my worst and kept me away from it. But I still get 1-2 decent size cystic acne spots very month. Do I just have to live with it?\n\nMy doctor said to use Epiduo every night, but that feels harsh. I wanna balance skin barrier with acne treatment. \n\nI have always noticed my period plays a role. I am on the pill, and has been on the same one until a few months ago when I changed to Yana (Dienogest and Ethinylestradiol) because of suspected endometriosis, and I do not take ‘period breaks’ as per gyno orders. My cramps are now a lot better. Not sure if it’s had an effect on my skin. ",

Easy to blend. Might pill if you layer too many products or use a thick/matte moisturizer underneath it. I skip moisturizer when I use it.\n\nWhite Cast : Low to None\n\nFragrance : None\n\nBest Suited for : All skin types except for oily. I have combination acne-prone skin and it did not break me out.\n\nSweat proof : No (Check out the unwind version)\n\nEye sensitivity : No stinging\n\nPrice : 599 but you can get it under 300 for 50 grams\n\nProtection : 7/10, gives decent protection. Better than a lot of gimmicky sunscreens, but there are better ones out there. \n\nReapplication : Easy to re-apply but definitely feels heavy.\n\nMy experience: \n\nI mainly use it for indoors for two reasons :\n\n1. It works like moisturiser + sunscreen in one. I skip moisturizer as it is quite moisturising.\n\n2. Two fingers’ worth feels heavy on me, and makes me sweat and makes my face look a little dull. So for indoors I apply less amount and it works fine.\n\n\nBeen using it for about a year now. Earlier this was the only sunscreen I used, but I did notice slight tanning with outdoor sun exposure (even with 2 fingers worth). My only real issue is that it feels more like a moisturizer with an SPF, which works on most days but once you get tanned it’s hard to reverse, especially with the UV index in summers. For indoor, it does the job.\n\nVerdict : Would repurchase for indoor use only.",

I have a bob shaped layering on the top then a long bottom almost like a jellyfish, I’ve tried to get it thinned out but it grows back 10x thicker.\n\nMy dad is half black/mixed so I think that’s where I get my hair texture from, it’s more loose then his but his was a tighter 3A/B.\n\nThe second photo is my best example of how thick and big it is, a lot of these are cropped because of my face but it doesn’t even cover how big my hair is irl. It’s also just after I washed it and dried without products or brushing so it looks very  thick and dense, ( basically knotted/tangled ).\n\nI use curl smith mostly and cantu for my shower products. I’ve heard pattern and bounce curl are good but I’m unsure whether to purchase.\n\nI have box dyed my hair and bleached it around 3-2 times. I like my volume but I wish my hair was slightly more defined as the week goes on my hair gets more and more wavy or just puffy. The front stays intact but the back looks a mess 😭,\n\nIt’s extremely dense as well and barely absorbs water unless it get sprayed down completely, it soaks up any liquid completely if that helps with defining qualities of my hair. I don’t wash my hair often. Usually over a week I wait as I can get away with just spraying some curl refresher on it ( 7-8 days is how long I wait in between washes)\n\nI use a bonnet to sleep in and just shove my hair in and refresh it with water mixed with leave in curl cream. \n\nAny help or tips would be greatly appreciated, I really want my hair to be more defined but still voluminous. As I want my curls to show off more rather than my big frizzy poof. Thank u &lt;3\n\nRoutine- \n1. Curl smith shampoo and loose cantu curl cream \n2. Drugstore curl mousse i scrunch in after half air drying\n3. Diffuse \n4. sleep in bonnet ",

I used the brass off mask from Matrix and I never notice a change at all. I have even tried putting it on dry hair for 30-40mins. What colour should I use to neutralize. Purple, Blue, both??

      "content": "Hey everyone, need some help and wanted to share something that recently happened to me\n\nI’ve always used Afnan 9PM before—bought from different sellers and never had any issues. But this time I ordered it from a seller called Perfume Palace, and after applying it on my wrists, I got red patches, itching, burning sensation, and swelling. Both wrists turned red and painful within minutes.\n\nA similar reaction happened recently with Lattafa Khamrah Quahaa — my whole body started itching and became red after using it. I’m genuinely shocked because I’ve never reacted to fragrances before.\n\nRegarding the seller experience (Perfume Palace):\n\nI had already emailed them to cancel my order because I got suspicious after reading a few bad reviews about them.\n\nThey ignored my email, didn’t respond for 4 days, and later claimed the order was already shipped — which was false because they shipped only after that.\n\nI noticed they delete negative comments on their Instagram, which feels very sketchy and dishonest.\n\nOverall, 1/10 experience — would not recommend.\n\n\nBecause of this whole situation, I’m planning to ask them for a refund and return pickup, since I don’t trust the product quality anymore I don't know what they are mixing cozz  the reaction was serious.\n\n\nLooking for advice:\n1. Has anyone else experienced skin reactions from Afnan 9PM or Lattafa Khamrah / Quahaa Decants?\n\n2. Could this be a fake / reformulated / bad storage batch?\n\n3. Any tips on writing a strong refund request email or dealing with sellers legally?\n\nI’ve currently stopped using any fragrance until my skin heals.\n\nSummary:\nApplied Afnan 9PM from Perfume Palace → burning, swelling, and red patches on wrists\nKhamrah Quahaa also caused full-body itching and redness\nSeller ignored cancellation request, deleted negative comments, and delayed reply\nTrying to get a refund and warn others\nNeed help/advice from the community 🙏",

This is the state of my skin at the moment (it’s way worse in person) and it’s been the same for about 5/6 weeks with no improvement. Before using this retinal I was using a 0.025% from a different brand for about 9 months give or take, and with that one I saw no difference with my skin, good or bad, hence why I upped the strength and started the A game. \nI have combination skin and I’m focusing on moisturising and hydrating products (all that I used way before starting the retinal so I know it’s not these products irritating my skin) and I’m not using any other actives alongside the A game. I’m manually exfoliating once a week. I’ve noticed my skin is a bit drier since starting the 0.05%. My skin has never been like this before, I’ve never had clear skin and I do breakout pretty much everywhere on my face, but only 1 or 2 spots at a time and not an entire face full like I’m experiencing now. \nAm I still purging? Is this a bad reaction to the A game? Should I continue and wait it out or stop using it? My skin is really getting me down and I don’t know what to do. Any help is much appreciated.",
