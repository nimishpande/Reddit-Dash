      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I’ve recently bought an LED light mask which comes with red light (anti-ageing), near infrared light (pore refinement), yellow light (brightening), and blue light (acne) settings. \n\nThe recommended treatment times are 3 x week, 10 mins for the red light, 2 x week, 20 mins for blue light, 3 x week, 20 mins for yellow light, and 3 x week, 10 mins for the near infrared light. \n\nI want to use all of these modes but spending over 2.5 hours each week with an LED mask on seems like a lot. Is there a maximum recommended amount generally? \n\nAm I approaching this correctly by doing them all together, or should I be alternating (6 weeks doing the recommended routine for red light, then switching to yellow etc), or something else entirely? Does anyone have any experience with at home LED masks? Or even better, specifically with the BeautyPro Photon LED mask. \n\nI feel like I should alternate days because each colour has different skincare recommendations (I’m thinking Vitamin C on the red and/or near infrared days, salicylic once a week on the blue days, and a hydrating moisturiser on the other days), but I’m open to suggestions on that too as it’s just some recommendations from the box. Niacinimide irritates my skin but I’ve never had another ingredient cause problems and I’ve tried plenty. \n\nI’m a mid thirties woman with quite uneven skin tone, some thread veins and burst blood vessels, a little bit of sun damage, and blackheads with occasional spots (maybe 2-3 per month). I’m concerned mainly with even skin tone and anti-ageing. Thanks for any advice you can offer! ",

I’m looking for some routine advice for my curls because my texture has changed a lot recently and I’m not sure how to work with it anymore.\n\nMy hair used to be much fuller, but now it’s straighter at the top and curlier at the bottom. I also wear hijab, which means my hair is usually in a bun for most of the day and even when I’m at home I tend to keep it tied up. Because of that, my curls usually dry smushed or stretched out.\n\nMy current routine:\n\t•\twash + condition with OGX Coconut Curls\n\t•\tbrush, then use pomegranate/manuka honey hair oil\n\t•\tthen I put it in a bun right away (including sleeping with it up)\n\nBy the next morning it’s dry but frizzy/undefined, so I brush it out and add more oil — which makes it easier to manage but the curls don’t look great.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of product recommendations, but I’m not sure what works best when you wear hijab and need your hair to be wrapped most of the day. Some products also feel messy or leave residue, which shows on scarves, so I’m hesitant.\n\nDoes anyone have tips for:\n\t•\tcurl-friendly routines for people who keep their hair wrapped often\n\t•\tways to avoid losing curl definition from constant buns\n\t•\thijab-friendly lightweight products that won’t stain\n\t•\tstyles that protect curls without completely flattening them",

I use the same routine except i use a mousse now. My hair doesn't hold curls like it used to. Only the ends are super curly. Am i lacking moisture? Do i need to add a hair mask? Parts of my hair like the back top and the sides by my ears are more coarse and don't hold curls. They just become frizzy S curls. If i do my hair i always get thick sections that never soak up water or dry well no matter if i brush style or finger curl. I don't like volume because i have so much hair and it gets hot. Please help me if you can. \n\nI have high porosity hair. Also don't mention any unevenness lol i cut my own hair.\n\nROUTINE: \nShampoo and conditioner: Marc anthony 3x moisture \nLeave in: As I am Leave in \nCream: Miss Jessie's Multicultural curl cream\nGel: Camille Rose Curl Maker \nMouse: Doux Def Texture Mousse \n\ni wet my hair, divide in 2 and use leave in. I part jn 4 sections (two my ears, one on my crown and one on back of my head) and apply the cream, brush through, then gel and brush with knock off bounce curl brush. I shake a bit and add mousse and scrunch it in. I do that in sections in each section all over my head. I scrunch excess wetness out with a cotton t shirt and then blow dry on high until it's mostly dry then i switch to warm and hold the diffuser to my head.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

However, she currently doesn’t have one and I don’t know if it’s smart to shell out a ton of money on one, or to get a budget (sub ~$100) hair dryer for her to try first and see if she likes it. On top of that, I see posts talking about diffusers. I know nothing about that, but should I buy that attachment as well? Will it help with her hair? Any recommendations are greatly appreciated. (U.S if that matters)\n\nHer routine includes some sort of conditioner in the shower (I want to say it’s called “function of beauty” it’s a yellow bottle. Out of the shower, I have seen her use some curl cream. I know she’s used kinky curls and shea moisture before, but I’m not 100% if she’s still using one of those or switched, I can find out if that helps. Our whole time together, she’s only brushed her hair and lets it air dry. I’ve heard her complain about frizz here and there, so hopefully we can fix that issue! Thank you curly hair community.\n\n*She has low porosity",
