Everyone around me has been amazed by the results and says their hair is much thicker and darker, but i’m not fully satisfied, i want to improve especially on the front. I have a lot of baby hair that's finally growing out, and I hope it can grow thick and long, although I think it will take quite a while yet",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Honestly the least frizzy photo I had lol. Previous to this, my hair was a completely uncontrollable mess. Now, it actually has life to it!😁 Can’t wait to see how farther along it gets!\n\n       \n        🎀 HAIR ROUTINE 🎀\nAsk for face framing long\n\n- [x] 1st Week: Hydration Week → Hydration Shampoo, Hydration Hair Masque, Hydration Conditioner (add Hydration Masque only once if washing more than once that week)\n\n- [x] 2nd Week: Protein Week → Hydration Shampoo + bonding protein treatment. Light.\n\n- [ ] 3rd Week: Hydration Week → Hydration Shampoo + Conditioner (Hydration Masque if dry)\n\n- [ ] Clarify Week → Clarifying Shampoo (2 lathers) + Protein Masque\n\n⸻\n\n🧴 Wash Products\n\n1. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo\n\t•\tUse: Weekly (non-clarify weeks)\n\t•\tHow: Focus on scalp &amp; roots only. Massage with fingertips (not nails). Let suds run through lengths as you rinse.\n\t•\tRinse: Thoroughly with lukewarm water.\n\n2. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner\n\t•\tUse: Weekly (after Hydration Shampoo, except Clarify Week)\n\t•\tHow: Apply to mid-lengths &amp; ends (avoid roots to prevent heaviness). Use wide-tooth comb or fingers to detangle.\n\t•\tRinse: After 3–5 minutes, rinse lightly (leave a little slip if your hair likes it).\n\n3. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Masque\n\t•\tUse: Every 1–2 weeks (instead of conditioner).\n\t•\tHow: Apply generously mid-lengths → ends. Detangle with wide-tooth comb. Smooth with “praying hands.”\n\t•\tWait: 10–15 minutes (cover with cap for extra effect).\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n4. SheaMoisture Protein Masque\n\t•\tUse: Once a month (after Clarifying Shampoo).\n\t•\tHow: Section hair, apply mid-lengths → ends first, then lightly on roots if needed. Brush through for even coverage. Light scrunch to help curls.\n\t•\tWait: 10–15 minutes.\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\t•\tConditioner: Skip (this masque replaces it).\n\n5. SheaMoisture Strengthen &amp; Restore Clarifying Shampoo\n\t•\tUse: Once a month (Clarify Week).\n\t•\tHow: Do 2 lathers — first lifts buildup, second deep cleans. Focus on scalp, let suds rinse through lengths.\n\t•\tFollow with: Protein Masque (not conditioner).\n\n6. SheaMoisture Bond Repair Masque (optional/alternate)\n\t•\tUse: Every 2–3 weeks or when hair feels weak/breaking.\n\t•\tHow: Same as Hydration Masque — mid-lengths → ends, detangle, smooth in.\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n⸻\n\n🌿 Leave-In &amp; Styling Products\n\n7. Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream\n\t•\tUse: Daily or after every wash/restyle.\n\t•\tHow: Apply to damp hair (after wash, or re-wet for daily refresh). Rake through with fingers from roots to ends, then smooth with praying hands.\n\t•\tAmount: Start with a nickel-sized amount per section, adjust as needed.\n\t•\tFinish: Scrunch lightly to encourage waves/curls.\n\n8. Curlsmith Frizz Rescue Curl Retainer\n\t•\tUse: After cream (daily).\n\t•\tHow: Scrunch into damp hair, focusing on mid-lengths &amp; ends. This helps lock curl shape and reduce frizz.\n\t•\tTip: Use hands or microfiber towel to “cup &amp; scrunch” upward.\n\n9. Curlsmith Frizz Rescue Finishing Serum\n\t•\tUse: After styling, when hair is 100% dry.\n\t•\tHow: Warm 2–3 drops in hands, then scrunch out any crunch or frizz. Glide lightly over surface for shine.\n\t•\tWhen: End of styling, or as touch-up on dry hair between washes.\n\n⸻\n\n\n",

However, she currently doesn’t have one and I don’t know if it’s smart to shell out a ton of money on one, or to get a budget (sub ~$100) hair dryer for her to try first and see if she likes it. On top of that, I see posts talking about diffusers. I know nothing about that, but should I buy that attachment as well? Will it help with her hair? I will add a picture in the comments for hair style. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated. (U.S if that matters)\n\nHer routine includes some sort of conditioner in the shower (I want to say it’s called “function of beauty” it’s a yellow bottle. Out of the shower, I have seen her use some curl cream. I know she’s used kinky curls and shea moisture before, but I’m not 100% if she’s still using one of those or switched, I can find out if that helps. Our whole time together, she’s only brushed her hair and lets it air dry. I’ve heard her complain about frizz here and there, so hopefully we can fix that issue! Thank you curly hair community.\n\n*She has low porosity",
