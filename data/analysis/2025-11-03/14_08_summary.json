These are suppose to be the best years of my life and I am so miserable. I have slept away all of this time. I can't live with myself looking like this.\n\n  \nI have been on dutasteride and oral min for about 2 years now. I was thinking I might be okay with many hair transplants and using these meds but a few weeks ago I learned that my biological dad isn't who I thought it was. After seeing a picture of who my bio dad actually is, I now know he is fully bald. I am so depressed and am so panicked.\n\n  \nIn this time I have been scrolling tressless endlessing. Googling answers hoping to find some miracle cure. I have researched hair transplants endlessly but honestly they don't look good at all. Even from top doctors, they are all clearly the product of surgery.\n\n  \nI just want my old hair back. I have been going to therapy twice a week and tried like 20 different antidepressants in this time and none of it will convince me that I am fine the way I am, i just hate it. I go to the gym 3 times a week but I don't feel better during or after. I just stare at all those mirrors on the wall just hating myself.\n\n  \nI have always been a very weak man. I know that I have some pretty severe depression, anxiety, ocd, and body dysmorphia, but I have been seeing a therapy since I was 11 and I don't feel like I have gotten any better since. I just feel like I wasn't meant to be here.\n\n  \nMen go bald all the time, yet this very small thing has completely ruined me. One of my closest friends is balder than me and I don't think he has thought about it for more than 10 combined minutes. I would probably guess that balding has consuming about 8-12 hours of my day for the entire past 4 years. But I guess that is just the OCD loop that won't stop.\n\n  \nI should be happy with my life. I think I am conventially attractive and have a nice body otherwise, I have a girlfriend, many good friends, I have a very good paying engineering job. But I can't get over this one thing and don't think I ever will.",

My college is in Hyderabad, where the weather is usually dry  and my skin is perfectly fine there, more on the normal to slightly dry side.\n\nBut every time I go to Bombay for internships (where my family also stays), my skin completely changes. It becomes extremely oily, sweaty, and sticky the moment I step out. Since I’m constantly running around in formal clothes for court/office, by noon my skin looks super shiny, dull, sticky and just... disheveled. Like not the glowy kind of oily, it's the tired, heavy, “why does my face feel like it’s melting” kind. And it feels uncomfortable ngl\n\nI’ve tried blotting papers, which help for a while but even after that my skin feels heavy and sticky for some reason. I also tried the Innisfree No Sebum Powder, but it made my skincare kind of pill (that weird rolling feeling on the skin), and I hate that texture.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\n\nMorning:\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n2. L’Oréal Revitalift Serum\n3. L’Oréal Revitalift Hyaluronic Acid Cream\n4. Dot and Ket Watermelon Sunscreen\n\n\nNight:\n\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n2. Earth Rhythm Serums (I alternate between the CLEAR SKIN SERUM and 10% NIACINAMIDE SERUM)\n3. Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer\n\n\nI don’t wear makeup daily, maybe just sunscreen and Etude water tint. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, but my skin just hates Bombay weather. Is it the humidity? My routine? Any product or routine adjustments that could help?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice, I’m tired of looking like a greaseball by lunchtime 😭",

Could this be directly caused by the makeup or a flare up? \n\nI was on a topical Antibiotic for 3 months which gave me fungal acne, so i switched some products to fungal acne safe ones. I now use Geek &amp; Gorgeous moisturizer and have been on it for 1 month, so i was wondering if this could also be a cause of cysts. \n\nI use Garnier sensitive skin Miscellar water, Vanicream cleanser, Hydration Station Moisturizer, and Omi Bear Sunscreen. Occasionally benzoyl peroxide as well. \n\nI also have hormonal acne flare ups but Spironolactone did not help me (made it worse) So some days are better than others, it’s hard to find out a root cause of the acne. \n\nBut i haven’t had cysts like these in months-years. My fungal acne looks to have gotten better but i’m unsure if the cysts are caused my hormones, the makeup, or the moisturizer lol. \n\n\nAny advice? similar experiences? ",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a guy with (I think) 2c/3a curls on top and on the upper sides of my hair. Recently, I have read A LOT about curly hair routines. While most of them focus on women with longer hair, I picked out what is suitable for me.\n\nNow, the thing is, I like how my curls are shaped when I have an out of bed look. The curls clump a bit together, and it makes a \"fluffy and full\" appearance. However, it is a bit too much unruly and frizzy.\n\nWhat I did before, was using a curl defining shampoo (not everyday) and a curl defining conditioner (every day). Because I found out that a curl cream distorted the fluffy look too much, I used it for years on almost dry (or bit damp) hair. This worked a bit. Even though, after a few hours my hair got a bit frizzy, and the curls weren't that well defined.\n\nNow, after I have read a lot about curl routines, I found out that the best way to apply a styling product is on full wet hair, so that it spreads out trough all of your hair.\n\nI indeed find that the curl cream is doing its job better. But, it weights my hair down too much for my liking and gives a bit too much of an overly styled look. The curls are defined so well, that they appear more as individual curls, while I do like it when the curls are more clumped together with a more \"natural look\". Also, I loose volume and the hair is more weighed down to my scalp.\n\nI have 2 examples of an appearance I do like, of which I think my curls would be very capable of:\n\n\\- [https://share.google/images/uQc89vXmrO4JZFKoN](https://share.google/images/uQc89vXmrO4JZFKoN)\n\n\\- I do like the example showed of the male curls on the Bumble and Bumble Seaweed line: [https://www.bumbleandbumble.com/product/19053/119068/care/treatments/seaweed-nourishing-air-dry-cream](https://www.bumbleandbumble.com/product/19053/119068/care/treatments/seaweed-nourishing-air-dry-cream)\n\nSo what do you guys advise. Should I switch to a gel and scrunch it out when dry? To a mousse? To another more light cream? I also saw a lot of styling product from Curlsmith, but they do not advise anything for males.\n\nI used the curl defining shampoo, conditioner, and cream lines of both Moroccanoil and Bumble and Bumble. There were a few differences, but I think using the right styling product (or maybe shampoo and conditioner) would have a bigger influence than the brand.\n\nThank you all :)",

      "content": "Still new to this and learning. I have wavy hair, very uneven curl pattern. Low porosity, fine-medium texture and high density. I feel like my hair is very weird with protein. When I’ve used is as a leave in or rinse out conditioner it gets stringy and limp with a weird feel and shine to it (like dull and shimmery at the same time). It gets frizzy in the shower and is not clumping as well after application. Since it is low porosity I now understand this could be related to build up.\n\nBUT I’ve also observed some benefits. Like it does feel like the curl is stronger, more able to form ringlets, and the pattern starts higher up (still limp and stringy but this is probably related to build up?). I’ve also had some amazing results from Curlsmith Bond Rehab Salve (contains proteins), which is a pre-poo treatment. And since my hair is fine I’ve heard it could be requiring more protein?\n\nThese observation brings me to my question. How should a person with low porosity hair best approach protein? Is it better to use it as a mask (leave it on for a longer time/with heat for the hair to absorb it) and then rinse out with shampoo? Can anyone relate to this issue?\n\nRoutine: Still trying to figure it out! Wash 2 times/week. Shampoo and conditioner varies. Squish to condish. Gel (Aussie Instant Freeze), scrunch. Diffuse to form cast and then air dry.",

The only existing medical issues I have is being chubby and having depression/anxiety. It is sometimes itchy but not enough that I feel a strong urge to scratch it, it just burns. I used to have (what I assume was) eczema on the bottom of my right foot, I would get blisters that itched so bad, that the need to scratch it felt like a primal urge.\n\nI can use these products everyday and be fine and just randomly I'll break out. For example, i wake up often with puffy eyes and the eye gel will smooth them so well. But during a flare up I tried it and it further irritated my eyes.\n\n Sometimes it will be right after putting my products on, sometimes it will be on my way home after having the products on my face all day. It has started recently affecting my eyes and making them swell. At times my face has started getting really red and warm to the touch. This probably happens 1-2 times a week max, and once a month minimum, and has been occurring for about 3 years. My face is very sensitive right now and even crying made my skin burn earlier.\n\nI don't currently have insurance and I'm in college so kinda broke too.\n\n\n\nVanicream gentle cleanser(just started 2 weeks ago)\n\nWitch hazel (always used this)\n\nCerave SA lotion for rough and bumpy skin(just started about 2 months ago)\n\nThe ordinary retinol in squalane (only a few times a week, started 3-4 months ago)\n\nGood molecules Yerba mate wake up gel(just started a few weeks ago)\n",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
