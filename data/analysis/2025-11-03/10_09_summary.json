These are suppose to be the best years of my life and I am so miserable. I have slept away all of this time. I can't live with myself looking like this.\n\n  \nI have been on dutasteride and oral min for about 2 years now. I was thinking I might be okay with many hair transplants and using these meds but a few weeks ago I learned that my biological dad isn't who I thought it was. After seeing a picture of who my bio dad actually is, I now know he is fully bald. I am so depressed and am so panicked.\n\n  \nIn this time I have been scrolling tressless endlessing. Googling answers hoping to find some miracle cure. I have researched hair transplants endlessly but honestly they don't look good at all. Even from top doctors, they are all clearly the product of surgery.\n\n  \nI just want my old hair back. I have been going to therapy twice a week and tried like 20 different antidepressants in this time and none of it will convince me that I am fine the way I am, i just hate it. I go to the gym 3 times a week but I don't feel better during or after. I just stare at all those mirrors on the wall just hating myself.\n\n  \nI have always been a very weak man. I know that I have some pretty severe depression, anxiety, ocd, and body dysmorphia, but I have been seeing a therapy since I was 11 and I don't feel like I have gotten any better since. I just feel like I wasn't meant to be here.\n\n  \nMen go bald all the time, yet this very small thing has completely ruined me. One of my closest friends is balder than me and I don't think he has thought about it for more than 10 combined minutes. I would probably guess that balding has consuming about 8-12 hours of my day for the entire past 4 years. But I guess that is just the OCD loop that won't stop.\n\n  \nI should be happy with my life. I think I am conventially attractive and have a nice body otherwise, I have a girlfriend, many good friends, I have a very good paying engineering job. But I can't get over this one thing and don't think I ever will.",

I wash once or twice a week and use a raw silk towel, air dry, and then keep my hair in a silk deft bun when I’m at home (most of the time). From being in the deft bun my hair gets a really nice curl. However….. When I take my hair down or put it in a ponytail, the curls fall out almost immediately. I use some serum / oil products for hydration but those don’t seem to help my curls stay in at all. I don’t know what kind of product I need, a gel? a wax? Something brushable and flexible, hopefully. Please help 🙏",

However, one day when my mom was looking at my head, she told me I had a bald spot. I'd like to ask for help as to how to treat this issue. I don't know where the little bump is from and how to get rid of it, but my main concern as of the moment is how to regrow my hair in that spot. Can hair follicles still grow there? I really don't want to have a permanent bald spot this early into my first year of college. I'm really sorry for rambling but I'm just so scared and panicking right now since I don't know what to do—I'm massaging coconut oil on my scalp while writing this post. If anybody has some tips or advice please do share, I'd really appreciate the help thank you 🥹",

      "content": "Ok so basically the first pic is my hair first ever lifting. I found a stylist that would help me go blonde. The original plan though was just blonde highlights because I do have previous box dye in my hair but I didn’t touch it for over a year. It lifted great and actually suprised me cuz after one lift I had a yellow honey blonde highlights yay! But it was patchy and not what I wanted like I really just want to be blonde but I was so thankful and yea she had high hopes of me going blonde acted like it was so easy for me. So a few month go by I go back in to lift the high lights again I did some research and I knew if I lifted one more time it would be closer to the blonde I want mind you I’m 21 and not rich my man paid for my hair so I made it very clear to her this is my last time coming in for a while like maybe ever just for the highlights I paid 450 and a 30$ tip so that’s just back story. She tells me well if you want your blonde dream your hair lifted great I think I can get you to honey blonde we can just do bleach all over and you can have your blonde hair. I’m like hell yes ! And for 330 when I was gonna pay 200 for the just lifting of my high lights. So I agree she kept saying you will be blonde I kept telling her ok are you sure because I can’t afford to come back in and I really would just lift the light lights again cuz I know that’ll be at least the blonde I want. So as you can see my hair is orange I wasn’t upset but I just am a little because even when she could see my hair was orange she said it was blonde and now I’ve paid 800$ for orange hair and I was willing to pay whatever in my budget 1k but for BLOBDE HAIR and I wish she would’ve told me you’ll need to come in 3-4 times until it’s blonde. So idk I need HELP IS ANYONE IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA AND KNOWS SOMEONE WHO SPECIALIZES IN BLONDE.I MEAN AT LEAST SOME OF THE WORK IS DONE. WOULD YOU SAY IF I BLUE SHAMPOO TF OUT OF MY HAIR ITLL BE BETTER? Or am I able to bleach and tone one more time at home ? And get at least honey blonde or is that a no no? OR WOULD YOU SAY SHE DID A GOOD JOB ITS NOT ORANGE IT LOOKS GOOD GET OVER IT. IDK (ALSO THIS PART MIGHT BOT MATTER BUT I LEFT WITH HALF BLOWN OUT HALF WET HAIR SHE SAID IT WAS A LITTLE FRIZZY SO I SHOUKD JUST WAIT A FEW DAYS AND STYLE IT MYSELF BUT I DIDNT WANT TO DO THAT I WAS ALREADY ANNOYED WITH Everything. But thanks for reading",

      "content": "I AM ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE FOR HELP DEALING WITH CHRONIC PERIORAL DERMATITIS‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️ 23/Female\n\nI am genuinely feeling at my wit’s end in dealing with perioral dermatitis. I have experienced it on and off again (mainly on) for the past 13 years with nothing providing a real solution. Many dermatologists, rounds of doxycycline or other antibiotics, topical after topical, clean laundry products, clean toothpaste. You name it, I have tried it at least twice or maintained doing it over the past 10 years. My skin is otherwise relatively decent, breakouts here and there that tend to be hormonal, manageable, and never cystic. Sensitive skin and a history of different skin cancers run in my family, and I have always been very diligent when it comes to taking care of my skin, even from a young age with very sensitive, eczema-prone skin.\n\nNote- the pictures included are of recent flare-ups, and the final is with light makeup to show the consistent flaky dryness\n\nMy current routine has been consistent over the past few years-\n\nAM-\n\nWash- Ketoconazole shampoo for face wash Moisturizer- La Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer Dieux Instant Angel Lipid-Rich Firming (have been trying and enjoying for about a month)\n\nSPF- Neutrogena SPF 60 facial serum\n\nPM-\n\nWash- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil (don’t use daily, 3-4 times a week, and primarily when removing makeup) Cera Ve SA Renewing SA Cleanser\n\nTreatment: 0.05% Tretinoin Cream (started using tretinoin at 14 for acne, have been consistent at 0.05% for 6 years)\n\nMoisturizer: La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer\n\nOther: \nVaseline (as needed for discomfort relief) Tri-Estrella Birth Control (hormonal birth control prescribed by a dermatologist at 15 to manage severe acne) Ketoconazole 2 % topical cream and tacrolimus 0.1 % topical ointment (recently prescribed and intended to use both twice a day, but they have caused severe irritation so I paused and notified my dermatologist) Hello Brand Toothpaste Clean no-scent detergent Hypochlorous Acid Spary Clean make-up, body, and hair care\n\nI could go on listing the products and prescriptions I have tested over the years, and when I say nothing has truly provided long-term relief, let alone a “cure”, NOTHING has worked.\n\nIf anyone can offer any recommendations or advice, it would be so greatly appreciated!!!!! This has been one of my biggest physical insecurities for the better part of my life. At its best, I am uncomfortable and itchy, and at its worst, it is burning and painful. This is a cry for help, TYIA🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
