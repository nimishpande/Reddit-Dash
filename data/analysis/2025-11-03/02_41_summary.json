I used to layer 6–7 products every wash day. My scalp felt heavy, my routine took forever, and somehow my hair still didn’t look or feel healthy. It made me realize how disconnected curl care can become when it stops feeling like self-care.\n\nOver the past year, I’ve been working on something called Chryosis\n\nIt’s a one-step, wellness-focused curl cream that is fragrance free and lightweight designed to reset the scalp, boost growth, and help your curls form naturally again with definition. \n\nI’ve also started doing short “Curl Wellness Class” on Instagram, just simple education around scalp care, growth, and finding calm in your routine because I want this to be more about wellness than just another product drop. I also engage actively to help those who have questions about their hair. \n\nStill, I keep wondering if people actually want simpler routines, or do most love the multi-step layering ritual?\n\nWould you ever switch to a single product if it truly worked long-term?\n\nI’m launching soon but feeling a bit anxious not about sales, but about whether this idea even resonates. I genuinely just want to build something real, something that makes curls and wellness feel connected again.\n\nThanks for reading this long post. If you have thoughts or honest feedback — I’d truly appreciate it 🫶\n\n\n\nRoutine: My own Chryosis Curl Cream only for now \n\n",

I've tried switching razors from a 4 blade to a 1 blade and i sort of helped but, still, i cut myself and get redness and bumps (pictures 2-4). I tried switching shaving creams but it didnt help.

I use sensitive skin barbasol, single blade bic razors, and dr squatch aftershave. ",

I’ve never been good at maintaining a skin care routine because one, I don’t like buying a lot of expensive products, and two, I’ve never seen results from anything. My skin concerns are dryness, acne, and enlarged pores/sebaceous filaments. I’ve always had issues with complexion products like foundation because my skin looks terrible with makeup on top. I tried to post pictures of my face with no concealer, I don’t have any closeup photos of my skin. My current routine is barely one, but it’s this:\n\n-Try to wash my face every night with neutrogena hydro boost face wash but in reality it’s like once a week. When I shower I just wash with water if I don’t use the neutrogena.\n-moisturize with neutrogena hydro boost water gel either after washing my face or when I take my makeup off with micellar water. \n-I was trying to do a bha chemical peel from the Ordinary once a week but I fell off and don’t do it anymore.\n\nThat’s it. Is there a serum I should be using? Also, are there any other ways to exfoliate besides chemical peels? I find my skin too sensitive to handle it for even a minute. I’d like to keep my current two main products if possible. Thanks.\n",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

Does anyone have any recommendations for products (all - shampoo, conditioner, leave-in, etc.) that leave your hair smelling really good? I have type 2 wavy-ish hair with a few type 3 curls thrown in but only on wash day. It’s thick but fine, low porosity, and VERY dry. I also live in a dry climate. The smell of lavender gives me migraines, and I’m partial to warm vanilla-y scents during fall/winter, coconut scents during summer, and rose scents during spring (I used to love Carol’s Daughter wash day delight in rose but they discontinued the rose scent). I also don’t follow the CG method so any and all ingredients are fine (except lavender lol).\n\nRoutine because I apparently need to: pattern clarifying shampoo, regular shampoo, sometimes detangler, medium conditioner, leave-in. If I’m going out or something, I’ll use the mousse. And I just let it air dry.",

Now they’re telling me I have thin hair. I’m not balding at all, but my hair does seem thin. I don’t have the thick head of hair I once had in my younger days. I like wearing my grey hair longer but I don’t want it to look all stringy. I wouldn’t mind a hair regimen that would help restore my hair’s fullness. Do products like Rogaine help?  Thank you to all for any tips. ",
