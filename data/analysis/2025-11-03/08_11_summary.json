These are suppose to be the best years of my life and I am so miserable. I have slept away all of this time. I can't live with myself looking like this.\n\n  \nI have been on dutasteride and oral min for about 2 years now. I was thinking I might be okay with many hair transplants and using these meds but a few weeks ago I learned that my biological dad isn't who I thought it was. After seeing a picture of who my bio dad actually is, I now know he is fully bald. I am so depressed and am so panicked.\n\n  \nIn this time I have been scrolling tressless endlessing. Googling answers hoping to find some miracle cure. I have researched hair transplants endlessly but honestly they don't look good at all. Even from top doctors, they are all clearly the product of surgery.\n\n  \nI just want my old hair back. I have been going to therapy twice a week and tried like 20 different antidepressants in this time and none of it will convince me that I am fine the way I am, i just hate it. I go to the gym 3 times a week but I don't feel better during or after. I just stare at all those mirrors on the wall just hating myself.\n\n  \nI have always been a very weak man. I know that I have some pretty severe depression, anxiety, ocd, and body dysmorphia, but I have been seeing a therapy since I was 11 and I don't feel like I have gotten any better since. I just feel like I wasn't meant to be here.\n\n  \nMen go bald all the time, yet this very small thing has completely ruined me. One of my closest friends is balder than me and I don't think he has thought about it for more than 10 combined minutes. I would probably guess that balding has consuming about 8-12 hours of my day for the entire past 4 years. But I guess that is just the OCD loop that won't stop.\n\n  \nI should be happy with my life. I think I am conventially attractive and have a nice body otherwise, I have a girlfriend, many good friends, I have a very good paying engineering job. But I can't get over this one thing and don't think I ever will.",

      "content": "I recently wore Maybelline Fit me Foundation and afterwards noticed a few cysts on my face appear after a few days. Could this be directly caused by the makeup or a flare up? \n\nI was on a topical Antibiotic for 3 months which gave me fungal acne, so i switched some products to fungal acne safe ones. I now use Geek &amp; Gorgeous moisturizer and have been on it for 1 month, so i was wondering if this could also be a cause of cysts. \n\nI use Garnier sensitive skin Miscellar water, Vanicream cleanser, Hydration Station Moisturizer, and Omi Bear Sunscreen. Occasionally benzoyl peroxide as well. \n\nI also have hormonal acne flare ups but Spironolactone did not help me (made it worse) So some days are better than others, it’s hard to find out a root cause of the acne. \n\nBut i haven’t had cysts like these in months-years. My fungal acne looks to have gotten better but i’m unsure if the cysts are caused my hormones, the makeup, or the moisturizer lol. \n\n\nAny advice? similar experiences? ",

However, one day when my mom was looking at my head, she told me I had a bald spot. I'd like to ask for help as to how to treat this issue. I don't know where the little bump is from and how to get rid of it, but my main concern as of the moment is how to regrow my hair in that spot. Can hair follicles still grow there? I really don't want to have a permanent bald spot this early into my first year of college. I'm really sorry for rambling but I'm just so scared and panicking right now since I don't know what to do—I'm massaging coconut oil on my scalp while writing this post. If anybody has some tips or advice please do share, I'd really appreciate the help thank you 🥹",

I wash once or twice a week and use a raw silk towel, air dry, and then keep my hair in a silk deft bun when I’m at home (most of the time). From being in the deft bun my hair gets a really nice curl. However….. When I take my hair down or put it in a ponytail, the curls fall out almost immediately. I use some serum / oil products for hydration but those don’t seem to help my curls stay in at all. I don’t know what kind of product I need, a gel? a wax? Something brushable and flexible, hopefully. Please help 🙏",

      "content": "I AM ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE FOR HELP DEALING WITH CHRONIC PERIORAL DERMATITIS‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️ 23/Female\n\nI am genuinely feeling at my wit’s end in dealing with perioral dermatitis. I have experienced it on and off again (mainly on) for the past 13 years with nothing providing a real solution. Many dermatologists, rounds of doxycycline or other antibiotics, topical after topical, clean laundry products, clean toothpaste. You name it, I have tried it at least twice or maintained doing it over the past 10 years. My skin is otherwise relatively decent, breakouts here and there that tend to be hormonal, manageable, and never cystic. Sensitive skin and a history of different skin cancers run in my family, and I have always been very diligent when it comes to taking care of my skin, even from a young age with very sensitive, eczema-prone skin.\n\nNote- the pictures included are of recent flare-ups, and the final is with light makeup to show the consistent flaky dryness\n\nMy current routine has been consistent over the past few years-\n\nAM-\n\nWash- Ketoconazole shampoo for face wash Moisturizer- La Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer Dieux Instant Angel Lipid-Rich Firming (have been trying and enjoying for about a month)\n\nSPF- Neutrogena SPF 60 facial serum\n\nPM-\n\nWash- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil (don’t use daily, 3-4 times a week, and primarily when removing makeup) Cera Ve SA Renewing SA Cleanser\n\nTreatment: 0.05% Tretinoin Cream (started using tretinoin at 14 for acne, have been consistent at 0.05% for 6 years)\n\nMoisturizer: La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer\n\nOther: \nVaseline (as needed for discomfort relief) Tri-Estrella Birth Control (hormonal birth control prescribed by a dermatologist at 15 to manage severe acne) Ketoconazole 2 % topical cream and tacrolimus 0.1 % topical ointment (recently prescribed and intended to use both twice a day, but they have caused severe irritation so I paused and notified my dermatologist) Hello Brand Toothpaste Clean no-scent detergent Hypochlorous Acid Spary Clean make-up, body, and hair care\n\nI could go on listing the products and prescriptions I have tested over the years, and when I say nothing has truly provided long-term relief, let alone a “cure”, NOTHING has worked.\n\nIf anyone can offer any recommendations or advice, it would be so greatly appreciated!!!!! This has been one of my biggest physical insecurities for the better part of my life. At its best, I am uncomfortable and itchy, and at its worst, it is burning and painful. This is a cry for help, TYIA🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼",

This itching is so crazy I want to scratch my face off lol. I hear that this is normal when starting off on this cream, but I want to also know how yall handle this extreme itch when using this cream? What do yall do? How do you cope?\n\nFyi I apply this cream to my bare skin after wetting and cleaning my face and then trying my best to dry it. This extreme itch doesn’t slow down at all unless I apply moisturizer on it.\n\nI will appreciate any tips/advice :)",
