      "content": "I live in southeast GA. I use the same products basically everyday. I have changed a few products over the years but nothing my skin immediately responded to. The only existing medical issues I have is being chubby and having depression/anxiety. It is sometimes itchy but not enough that I feel a strong urge to scratch it, it just burns. I used to have (what I assume was) eczema on the bottom of my right foot, I would get blisters that itched so bad, that the need to scratch it felt like a primal urge.\n\nI can use these products everyday and be fine and just randomly I'll break out. For example, i wake up often with puffy eyes and the eye gel will smooth them so well. But during a flare up I tried it and it further irritated my eyes.\n\n Sometimes it will be right after putting my products on, sometimes it will be on my way home after having the products on my face all day. It has started recently affecting my eyes and making them swell. At times my face has started getting really red and warm to the touch. This probably happens 1-2 times a week max, and once a month minimum, and has been occurring for about 3 years. My face is very sensitive right now and even crying made my skin burn earlier.\n\nI don't currently have insurance and I'm in college so kinda broke too.\n\n\n\nVanicream gentle cleanser(just started 2 weeks ago)\n\nWitch hazel (always used this)\n\nCerave SA lotion for rough and bumpy skin(just started about 2 months ago)\n\nThe ordinary retinol in squalane (only a few times a week, started 3-4 months ago)\n\nGood molecules Yerba mate wake up gel(just started a few weeks ago)\n",

My college is in Hyderabad, where the weather is usually dry  and my skin is perfectly fine there, more on the normal to slightly dry side.\n\nBut every time I go to Bombay for internships (where my family also stays), my skin completely changes. It becomes extremely oily, sweaty, and sticky the moment I step out. Since I’m constantly running around in formal clothes for court/office, by noon my skin looks super shiny, dull, sticky and just... disheveled. Like not the glowy kind of oily, it's the tired, heavy, “why does my face feel like it’s melting” kind. And it feels uncomfortable ngl\n\nI’ve tried blotting papers, which help for a while but even after that my skin feels heavy and sticky for some reason. I also tried the Innisfree No Sebum Powder, but it made my skincare kind of pill (that weird rolling feeling on the skin), and I hate that texture.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\n\nMorning:\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n2. L’Oréal Revitalift Serum\n3. L’Oréal Revitalift Hyaluronic Acid Cream\n4. Dot and Ket Watermelon Sunscreen\n\n\nNight:\n\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n2. Earth Rhythm Serums (I alternate between the CLEAR SKIN SERUM and 10% NIACINAMIDE SERUM)\n3. Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer\n\n\nI don’t wear makeup daily, maybe just sunscreen and Etude water tint. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, but my skin just hates Bombay weather. Is it the humidity? My routine? Any product or routine adjustments that could help?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice, I’m tired of looking like a greaseball by lunchtime 😭",

When I’ve used is as a leave in or rinse out conditioner it gets stringy and limp with a weird feel and shine to it (like dull and shimmery at the same time). It gets frizzy in the shower and is not clumping as well after application. Since it is low porosity I now understand this could be related to build up.\n\nBUT I’ve also observed some benefits. Like it does feel like the curl is stronger, more able to form ringlets, and the pattern starts higher up (still limp and stringy but this is probably related to build up?). I’ve also had some amazing results from Curlsmith Bond Rehab Salve (contains proteins), which is a pre-poo treatment. And since my hair is fine I’ve heard it could be requiring more protein?\n\nThese observation brings me to my question. How should a person with low porosity hair best approach protein? Is it better to use it as a mask (leave it on for a longer time/with heat for the hair to absorb it) and then rinse out with shampoo? Can anyone relate to this issue?\n\nRoutine: Still trying to figure it out! Wash 2 times/week. Shampoo and conditioner varies. Squish to condish. Gel (Aussie Instant Freeze), scrunch. Diffuse to form cast and then air dry.",

I read a tip on this page to put mousse in dry hair, and after an unsuccessful wash day figured I would give it a shot, and I love the results!\n\nRoutine: I applied a tiny amount of Mais Cacho’s leave-in after my shower when hair was soaking wet. I raked through the Kinky Curl Custard and brush-styled the top section only (I find this helps with volume) and micro-plopped with a microfiber towel, and diffused / air dried. It was my first time trying this routine (normally I use TiGi Curls Rock and no cream)  and I wasn’t happy once my hair was dry and I scrunched out the crunch. My curls were defined, but I had very little volume, and the curls were too clumped together, limp, and stringy. Right before bed I decided to glaze through a small amount of the Curlsmith mousse, scrunched and diffused on medium heat. I used a Renee Furterer mouse on the other side of my head. Right away, my curls came to life and became voluminous and shiny! I slept with a pineapple on my head and when I woke up in the morning, my curls still looked fantastic. Normally, I refresh my hair with spray water and a bit more gel, but I didn’t even have to do that! I just walked right out the door. \n\nNote that the side shown in the picture is where I use the Curlsmith mousse. The side where I used the Renee Furterer mousse looks noticeably worse and much frizzier. \n\nThank you to everyone who made this great recommendation!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
