      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I used to live in the Western Rockies in 2015 and idk what it was about the water or air there but my curls were the longest/healthiest they’ve ever been! (First picture)\n\nMy hair doesn’t feel as thick anymore, nor do my curls keep their shape like they used to. I work in construction and keep my hair under a bandana for hours. I’m careful not to pull my hair back so I don’t stress my hair. Just feels like my scalp is thinning like crazy and more of it falls out after every wash. (Last pics)\n\nRoutine over the years:\nI’ll wash once every 5-8 days, and doing an apple vinegar rinse/refresh every 3 days or so. I also have a shower filter.\nI’ve used alternated natural solid shampoo bars / conditioner bars and hair oils by PlantMade.\nDetoxifying shampoo, curl cream, light gel, hair skin and nail vitamins from Bounce Curl. \n\nRecently started taking saw palmetto as recommended by my stylist. Also sleep with a satin bonnet and diffuse on cold days. \n\nWhatever I do I can’t get it to grow past my shoulders either. Would you say it’s time to see a doctor or dermatologist? ",

I currently use the First Aid Beauty Bump Eraser which has both AHA's and BHA's. It certainly makes me skin feel smoother, but i feel like i have yet to really get rid of the bumps. I'm also looking for more of a treatment and/or lotion for this area as opposed to a scrub. Something i can put on after the shower.\n\nIn learning, i understand that AHA's are best for dry skin a they exfoliate more of the surface of your skin while BHA's are better for oily, acne prone skin and penetrate deeper. I've also learned that Lactic Acid, Glycolic Acid, Malic Acid, etc are all AHA's, and Salicylic Acid is BHA. These are all things i've heard people talking about here but never really understood how to know what to choose, especially for my face (which im also open to suggestions for). I have dry skin.\n\nWhich one of these would be a good treatment for butt pimples? Does anyone have any product suggestions or more insight for me and my learning?",

When I stretch my face like this, it certainly feels tight like dehydration and major dryness but I’m also nearing 30 so I’m also wondering if maybe there’s no fixing this cause it could just be aging… with that said, I have a feeling that aging skin around my age can be improved (looks wise) just with proper hydration cause I’ve realized that the more dry my skin is, the more aged it looks.\n\nI also want to help my skins dullness and my dark under eyes (which you can sort of see in this picture). I feel like I always look sick and exhausted because of these issues and I really want to fix this. I want brighter, hydrated looking skin and idk what I’m doing. I do use a rose hip oil at night along with my Aestura 365 moisturizer and I’ve started putting the oil on in the morning as well cause I’m so dry and it sort of helps (compared to when I don’t use it along with the rest of my products) but it still just isn’t enough and my skin just looks shiny, dull, and wet all while STILL feeling really dry and tight. I’m on the search for some new products cause what I’ve got right now is not it. \n\nI do have low iron and very mild crohns which affects my nutrient absorption and want to look into an iron supplement maybe along with diet. I understand that this may improve my under eyes as well.\n\nAny suggestions? I’ve been thinking of going back to exploring more of Laneige cause I do like some of their stuff but I’m open to whatever at this point. Keep in mind, however, I am not rich haha. \n\nThanks in advance!",

      "content": "Hello curly community.\n\nReupload bc I forgot to include the pics lol. \n\nBasically, I’ve lost my curls over the years. I used to have SUPER curly hair, as pictured. It was very voluminous but thin/fine, with tight ringlets. Those pictures are from around 13-15 years old. I only used cheap L’Oréal shampoo &amp; conditioner, not even for curly hair, &amp; no other products. Around that age I started trying to take care of my hair using shea moisture &amp; Cantù products, and they absolutely wrecked my curls. At 20, I decided to cut my hair shoulder length for more volume &amp; to bring back the curls. I had never, ever cut my hair before (only ends), and unfortunately I didn’t go to a curly hair stylist. After that, my hair is basically wavy, sometimes straight even. I tried using the denim brush, but I unfortunately used it as a detangling brush in the shower for a few months, I’m sure that caused some damage. I’m in my mid-20s now, the after pictures are recent.\n\nI’m pretty sure my hair is fine, low-porosity. Went from 3a curls to 2a. Curls totally flatten after 3 days :(.\n\nMy routine now is: wash 2x a week. Not your mother’s shampoo &amp; Pantene curly conditioner, detangle with fingers. Aussie’s curly mouse, miss Jessie’s multicultural curl cream, &amp; not your mother’s gel. Air dry. I don’t refresh in between washes. The 1st “after” is 3 days after a wash, the last picture is right after styling &amp; fully air dried.\n\nExtra info: My entire life I never use heat. I have always only air dried my hair, and straighten my hair once a year, if that. So it’s not heat damage related. I also don’t take any birth control, as I’ve seen people hint to that. Please help! I miss my curls so much.",

I plan on tapering off TRT, I’m currently taking about 90mg of testosterone cypionate a week, I plan to decrease dose by 25% every 2 weeks till I’m not taking anymore. I plan to continue to take HCG till my natural testosterone kicks in again. I might even start taking clomid to help restart my natural testosterone. But eventually will stop taking everything.\n\nI’m also losing my hair fast, so I want to start taking finasteride. I’ve already been on Minoxidil for years now.
