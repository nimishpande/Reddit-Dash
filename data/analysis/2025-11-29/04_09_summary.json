      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

(First picture)\n\nMy hair doesn’t feel as thick anymore, nor do my curls keep their shape like they used to. I work in construction and keep my hair under a bandana for hours. I’m careful not to pull my hair back so I don’t stress my hair. Just feels like my scalp is thinning like crazy and more of it falls out after every wash.

      "content": "I always thought my hair was straight. When I was younger, I used to “scrunch” my hair with a sea salt spray, but I typically wear my hair straight by towel drying it well, brushing it, and letting it air dry or blow drying with a round brush. My hair is fine and on the thinner side, dries quickly (high porosity?), and I wash every 2-3 days with neuma’s volume shampoo and conditioner. I have been very unhappy with my hair as it started thinning within the last 6 months, so I decided to explore my hair’s natural texture to increase volume.\n\nI’ve been doing some reading about wavy hair, and have been following recommendations to not brush my hair outside of the shower, or to use a wide tooth comb when my head is upside down and the hair is still sopping wet. I have been applying my living proof leave-in conditioner and any other products (usually Aveda curl enhancer cream, and Aveda volumizing tonic to my roots) when my hair is really wet and then plopping and scrunching with a microfiber towel. When I let my hair air dry after doing this, my hair is still wavy at the end of the day. Tonight, I also used frizz ease heat protectant and made a feeble attempt at using the diffuser, and this is how it looks. I’m looking for advice on what type of hair I have (2a/b?) and recommendations on products and routines that might help me get the most out of my hair’s texture. Also, what’s a good refresh routine for the next day so my hair can look halfway decent after sleeping on it 😅\n\nThank you in advance, my curly-haired people!",

      "content": "So I’ve been on TRT for 5+ years, I want to stop due to the recommendation of my doctor. I’ve been taking HCG for a couple of years as wellto keep my testicles alive. I plan on tapering off TRT, I’m currently taking about 90mg of testosterone cypionate a week, I plan to decrease dose by 25% every 2 weeks till I’m not taking anymore. I plan to continue to take HCG till my natural testosterone kicks in again. I might even start taking clomid to help restart my natural testosterone. But eventually will stop taking everything.\n\nI’m also losing my hair fast, so I want to start taking finasteride. I’ve already been on Minoxidil for years now. I plan on seeing an endocrinologist to get his opinion as well. I’m hoping someone who has quit TRT can chime in, but I’d love to hear what other people in this subreddit think.",

      "content": "3 months ago I went to a salon for the first time in over a decade, I’ve been doing my own hair for so long now but I decided to treat myself and go in for a haircut.. my hair was already on the short side but very bulky and boxy so I asked the guy who cut my hair (he’s been at this salon since I was a kid, I’m 28) to just remove the bulk from the back and add layers and a trim.. this is what I left with. I have been devastated since that day I’m so embarrassed by my hair and my self confidence is in the negatives at this point. I have to wear it up for work so there’s a lot of tension on the top half (the only half I can actually put up) and i feel like it’s never going to grow because of that. It’s so bad I’ve been wearing wigs when I go out I don’t even want to look at it. What should I do? Should I rough it out until it finally grows or should I go to a different salon and go shorter? Is there even a way to fix this monstrosity? I hate it so much please help :( I’ve also tried clip ins but it doesn’t blend with ANYTHING due to the length and texture (I’ll insert a picture of my before hair (with tape ins))",

      "content": "Hello curly community.\n\nReupload bc I forgot to include the pics lol. \n\nBasically, I’ve lost my curls over the years. I used to have SUPER curly hair, as pictured. It was very voluminous but thin/fine, with tight ringlets. Those pictures are from around 13-15 years old. I only used cheap L’Oréal shampoo &amp; conditioner, not even for curly hair, &amp; no other products. Around that age I started trying to take care of my hair using shea moisture &amp; Cantù products, and they absolutely wrecked my curls. At 20, I decided to cut my hair shoulder length for more volume &amp; to bring back the curls. I had never, ever cut my hair before (only ends), and unfortunately I didn’t go to a curly hair stylist. After that, my hair is basically wavy, sometimes straight even. I tried using the denim brush, but I unfortunately used it as a detangling brush in the shower for a few months, I’m sure that caused some damage. I’m in my mid-20s now, the after pictures are recent.\n\nI’m pretty sure my hair is fine, low-porosity. Went from 3a curls to 2a. Curls totally flatten after 3 days :(.\n\nMy routine now is: wash 2x a week. Not your mother’s shampoo &amp; Pantene curly conditioner, detangle with fingers. Aussie’s curly mouse, miss Jessie’s multicultural curl cream, &amp; not your mother’s gel. Air dry. I don’t refresh in between washes. The 1st “after” is 3 days after a wash, the last picture is right after styling &amp; fully air dried.\n\nExtra info: My entire life I never use heat. I have always only air dried my hair, and straighten my hair once a year, if that. So it’s not heat damage related. I also don’t take any birth control, as I’ve seen people hint to that. Please help! I miss my curls so much.",

I think mine does so I've stayed away from it, but I feel like my skin just needs more hydration. I've had my eye on glycerin for something I make, but now I'm wondering if I should look into it for some eye patches I'd like to treat lines. Any recommendations on eye patches that use glycerin instead of HA and are good for sensitive skin?",
