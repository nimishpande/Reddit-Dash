      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

This time I saw it on JioMart for ₹550, got a little greedy, and ordered two.\n\nI only opened the new one a week later (after finishing my old bottle) and realized it’s completely fake. In the pics, the real one is on the left and the fake one is on the right.\n\nI basically wasted ₹1200. I contacted JioMart but since their return window is only 4 days, they refused to help.

I used to remove hair via waxing but it didn’t suit my skin. I also had to stop doing laser hair removal as it gave me recurring hives (but apart from that it was the best option).

      "content": "So basically this treatment is being hyped up as it’s actually a natural protein found in your body that helps seal immune responses and counter inflammation. People who lack this protein cannot resolve inflammation anywhere in the body. It was initially being used as a treatment to speed up wound healing and it worked remarkably, leaving no identifiable scar tissue. Studies showed that in the healed areas, there was actually new hair follicles. The idea is that as an anti - inflammatory response it sends actually makes NEW follicles, a process known as Neogenesis. Now while the initial and published studies are done on mice, some studies were done on human tissues and actually showed similar results, with new hair follicles producing hairs and actively being in anagen. This protein also prolongs the anagen phase as it imcfeasss growth factors like EGF and VEGF and decreases TGFB-1. It also prevents apoptosis or cell death, which is usually what ends the anagen phase. Now while this is far away, the company actually released a cosmetic product that will be available December 15, but at the insane price of 15,000€ per liter I mean that’s insane. ",

      "content": "I work a desk job and get pimples on my butt and i know my job really doesn't help but i've kind of always had this issue. Same with the bumps on my thigh and butt. I currently use the First Aid Beauty Bump Eraser which has both AHA's and BHA's. It certainly makes me skin feel smoother, but i feel like i have yet to really get rid of the bumps. I'm also looking for more of a treatment and/or lotion for this area as opposed to a scrub. Something i can put on after the shower.\n\nIn learning, i understand that AHA's are best for dry skin a they exfoliate more of the surface of your skin while BHA's are better for oily, acne prone skin and penetrate deeper. I've also learned that Lactic Acid, Glycolic Acid, Malic Acid, etc are all AHA's, and Salicylic Acid is BHA. These are all things i've heard people talking about here but never really understood how to know what to choose, especially for my face (which im also open to suggestions for). I have dry skin.\n\nWhich one of these would be a good treatment for butt pimples? Does anyone have any product suggestions or more insight for me and my learning?",

When I stretch my face like this, it certainly feels tight like dehydration and major dryness but I’m also nearing 30 so I’m also wondering if maybe there’s no fixing this cause it could just be aging… with that said, I have a feeling that aging skin around my age can be improved (looks wise) just with proper hydration cause I’ve realized that the more dry my skin is, the more aged it looks.\n\nI also want to help my skins dullness and my dark under eyes (which you can sort of see in this picture). I feel like I always look sick and exhausted because of these issues and I really want to fix this. I want brighter, hydrated looking skin and idk what I’m doing. I do use a rose hip oil at night along with my Aestura 365 moisturizer and I’ve started putting the oil on in the morning as well cause I’m so dry and it sort of helps (compared to when I don’t use it along with the rest of my products) but it still just isn’t enough and my skin just looks shiny, dull, and wet all while STILL feeling really dry and tight. I’m on the search for some new products cause what I’ve got right now is not it. \n\nI do have low iron and very mild crohns which affects my nutrient absorption and want to look into an iron supplement maybe along with diet. I understand that this may improve my under eyes as well.\n\nAny suggestions? I’ve been thinking of going back to exploring more of Laneige cause I do like some of their stuff but I’m open to whatever at this point. Keep in mind, however, I am not rich haha. \n\nThanks in advance!",

Based on a little googling, I’m wondering if my skin is dehydrated? I use a gentle cleanser (either la roche or cerave) to cleanse and I haven’t been wearing makeup so I only cleanse once a day. I use vit c, niacinamide, peptides, HA, tatcha dewy skin cream, and caffeine serum under eyes. I do use Paula’s choice every other day which I have done for a while now without issue and I’ve been using Farmacy honey grail all this week. I’m thinking of laying off PC? I’m also planning on using my humidifier tonight to see if that helps. Any other tips that may help? Less products? A product to add in that’ll be a miracle worker? :)",

I have to brush my hair with my fingers or use a wide tooth comb when it’s wet \n\nMy friends have given me some advice over the years (sleep with a bonnet, use coconut oil on your roots, keep your hair long so it doesn’t look bushy, use leave in conditioner, don’t lean your head against anything while your hair dries, let your hair air dry, use a scrunchie instead of a hair tie etc) but I still really don’t practice, or know much about, hair care\n\nANY advice, insight, hairstyles, products, etc would be appreciated \n\nPlease don’t hold back, but please don’t be rude either!\n\nI know my hair has greater potential than how it looks right now :)",
