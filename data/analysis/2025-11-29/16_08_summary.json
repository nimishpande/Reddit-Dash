      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "My skin was totally clear until sixth grade. And ever since then I have had extremely deep and painful cystic acne all over my face. I went to a dermatologist whilst my face was full of deep red acne and the dermat said that in my age (14) it is normal and hormonal. She prescribed me ahaglow facewash and zitmoist as mousturizer. That was all. \n\nMy experience with both was very bad. Bad in the sense that neither of it did absolutely nothing for my acne. The facewash felt too drying for me and the zitmoist gel felt like nothing. It was not at all hydrating or moisturizing. \n\nI switched to a more hydrating moisturizer (Johnson's milk+rice cream) and a different gentler cleanser (Neutrogena extra gentle cleanser). I would say in terms of hydration these were better but my acne was still super bad. \n\nThen I began researching into skincare and nutrition. I cut down on dairy especially milk and sugar. And I decided that I had to use an active to target my acne. I ended up buying the Cosrx BHA serum. I used it for nearly 1.5 years and it did help with my acne to some extent. But it works extremely slow. Took me about 6 months to notice a reduction in my acne. I started using plum gel moisturizer also and Joy 5.5 hydrating gel face wash. \n\nAfter that I used tranexamic acid and alpha arbutin serum from minimalist for all the scars that had formed on my face. I absolutely love alpha arbutin for scars and hyperpigmentation. And for the active acne I started using The Ordinary glycolic acid. I had high hopes for it but it did not do anything for my acne. 😭 It had absolutely zero effect anywhere either on my face or body😢\n\nAnyways this is my current routine now which for me has been working absolutely fabulously. I only get a few acne during my periods, they are like surface level white heads and they just dry out in a day and pop on their own and don't leave scars. So I'm not really bothered by them. I'm very happy with how my skin looks and I'm going to stick to this routine.\n\nMy skin is by no means perfect. I have quite a few icepick scars from the acne plus there is hyperpigmentation as well. But imo those are part of my natural skin and this is just how I look and I'm totally okay with it. Acne is tough to live with, I know. You just have to be patient and find the products that works for you. It took me more than a decade to get here and who knows it might come back later too. But believe you me acne is not going to stop my life, nor has it ever😇\n\nCURRENT ROUTINE\n\nAM \n\n1. Simple barrier care replenishing cream cleanser\n2. Aziderm 10% gel \n3. Cosrx snail mucin. \n4.

Now I love my hair and I'm trying my best to take care of it but I can't tell what type it is or if there's something wrong with my technique or products. I have to restyle it every morning and I'm not sure how to style it so it's soft instead of in a rigid middle part. \n\nSo my routine is this so far. I start by shampooing my hair thrice, once with a gentle wash, then with a curly hair shampoo then with a two in one shampoo and conditioner. I then use coconut conditioner, brush, ten minutes and wash. After that I apply Aunt Jackie's Leave in, brush and separate into the top part of my hair and the bottom. Apply mark anthony curl cream and Aunt Jackies mousse to the bottom and curl with a curl brush. Do the same to the top. I'm not sure how to use gel without it creating wet frizz so I don't use it anymore. Scrunch with a silk cloth and let it air dry. That's it! I'd love any advice!",

Even tiny pimples leave marks.\nI am tanned and want to lighten my tan without irritating my skin.\n\nWhere I live:\nI live in Delhi, which means hard water and heavy pollution.\nThe weather swings a lot, with super hot summers and very cold winters right now.\n\nWhat I have tried so far:\nAzelaic acid 10 for a month, thinking of trying 20 all over.\nVitamin C and glycolic acid backfired completely and darkened my skin and worsened texture.\nScrubs and exfoliants caused irritation and roughness.\nMoisturizers and matte sunscreens still make my skin feel oily.\n\nProducts I have now:\nNiacinamide 5 and 10 from Minimalist.\nPonds gel moisturizer.\nConsidering Aziderm 20.\n\nMy goals:\nReduce tan and fade PIH marks.\nSmooth out texture.\nGet healthy, glowing, glass like skin that actually looks radiant.\n\nI would really appreciate advice that is specific to my situation.

      "content": "I'm not sure what exactly is going on, thinking mostly a damaged skin barrier, although I'm starting to suspect mild fungal acne on my forehead? Overall I have plenty of closed comedones that are visible when I stretch my skin near my chin/cheeks, and a rough looking forehead even though it's relatively smooth to the touch.\n\nI'm feeling a bit out of my depth here, I struggled with quite severe acne when I was 17, two years ago at this time, and adapalene/benzoyl peroxide fixed me up. For a few months. My barrier was certainly never perfect but moving to a different climate this year and starting university had some effect on my skin, and it's not happy anymore. I don't use any actives right now, I'm focusing on gently healing my skin barrier, although I'm not entirely sure how. \n\nI currently do use makeup wipes and rinse with water at night and would like to stop doing that in favor of a cleansing balm and water cleanser combo. I don't know. I use a mild cerave pm moisturizer morning and night. \n\nTL;DR my skin barrier is damaged and I'd like some recommendations if you have any.",

I don't want the gel on my scalp so I apply it with my head turned over, but today I'm noticing I've missed the entire layer of hair that lays against me but the surface layers are covered OK. \n\nMy local Shoppers carries Aussie Instant Freeze in a hair spray - would this help for touch ups?  \n\nDoes gel applied to dry hair have the same effect?\n\nWhat hair oils can I use between casts to help with protein?
