I've been over the moon about how good my hair looks now. I did want a haircut, just to clean up the sides. \nBut my hair was absolutely butchered. First pic is right before, second is when I got home from the curly hair salon. It looks awful, and barely curls anymore. She thinned out the top a ton, and my volume is gone. No point to this post other than just sharing my pain. Right back to insecure about my hair.\nRoutine is simple. Just shea moisture conditioner in the shower, then not your mother's curl talk cream then gel immediately after I get out. Then scrunch and let it air dry. Now that's not working anymore because of how she cut my hair",

      "content": "Okay so I was literally hovering over the \"Place Order\" button on Nykaa when my desi instincts kicked in like \"beta, have you checked other apps first?\"\nI'm SO glad I listened to that inner voice because y'all... the price difference for the SAME THREE PRODUCTS was ₹360. That's literally another full-size Minimalist product just... sitting there for free if you're smart about where you order.\n\nWhat I was buying:\n1. Minimalist 8% Glycolic Acid Toner (150ml)\n2. Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Serum (30ml)\n3. Minimalist Vitamin B5 Moisturizer (50g)\n\nThe shocking price breakdown:\n\nTIRA - ₹1,186 (THE CLEAR WINNER)\n1. Cheapest price\n2. FREE Minimalist tote bag as GWP\n\nNYKAA - ₹1,441\n1. ₹255 more expensive than Tira 😬\n2. Zero freebies but you'll be paying for lice pink packaging??\n\nMYNTRA - ₹1,321\n1. ₹135 costlier than Tira\n2. No GWP either\n\nBLINKIT - ₹1,428\n₹242 more than Tira BUT delivers in 14 minutes (see screenshot lol)\n\nAJIO - ₹1,546 💀\n1. Most expensive by FAR (₹360 more than Tira!)\n2. Had random GWPs like travel vouchers??? (for skincare???). There was a coupon but it straight up refused to apply\n\n\nThat ₹360 difference is literally the price of another Minimalist product. Do. The. Math. It took me 10 minutes to check all these apps and I basically got a free product out of it. Also I'm attaching all my cart screenshots because I know the skincare community loves RECEIPTS 📸\nIs anyone else this obsessive about price-checking or is it just my broke millennial energy?",

      "content": "Hi y'all! I just recently started looking into how to properly take care of my hair and began trying out a curly hair routine a couple days ago. This is how it looked this morning after showering, putting in products, and diffusing. I know that it takes time for curls to reach their full form, but there's definitely room for improvement and I need some advice from the experts! First, here is my current routine/products I use:\n\n1.\t⁠Kristen Ess Extra Gentle Shampoo and Conditioner\n\n2.\t⁠Detangle with Wet brush, apply Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream\n\n3.\t⁠apply Curlsmith Hydro Style Flexi Jelly, flip head upside down and scrunch\n\n4.\t⁠apply John Frieda Frizz Ease Curl Reviver Mousse to roots and scrunch again\n\n5.\t⁠plop hair in t-shirt for a few minutes\n\n6.\t⁠diffuse until mostly dry, scrunch to break the gel cast, and put the hair near my part in a claw clip for a bit for volume\n\nSo far, I'm happy with the results of this routine, as my curls held their shape throughout the day, though my hair got a little less voluminous as time went on (and there wasn't too too much volume to begin with). The biggest thing I'm concerned about is that my hair looks dry and a little frizzy, especially towards the ends where it's more damaged, which I think is affecting the definition of my curls. I believe hair oil is a possible solution, so if you have any brand recommendations (preferably on the affordable side) or other ideas on how to fix it, let me know! Here's a list of other things I would love some advice on:\n\n\\- My roots and front pieces seem to have a very hard time curling, should I use more product there or a different method when applying product?\n\n\\- What's the best way to refresh curls after sleeping on them? There are a lot of contrasting opinions whether or not you should wet your hair and what products to use, which makes it very confusing!\n\n\\- I believe I have medium-to-high porosity hair. Should I use oil, and if so, when should I use it (before bed, to refresh hair, on wet hair, dry hair, etc.)?\n\nOk-- question tirade is over. Thank you in advance for your time and suggestions :)",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "I suffered some raised hypertrophic scarring in September 2022 on my arms and have been unable to fully get rid of them or make them less noticeable. At first, I went to a dermatologist who recommended laser treatments, which I got in Fall 2023 and Spring 2024, but those did not lower the scars at all. Then, I was given some injections in Spring 2024, which only flattened them slightly but they still remained fairly visible. I also tattooed over the scars in Summer 2024, but that undid the work of the injections and the scars are still visible even through the tattoos. \n\nRight now, I am looking mainly for a method that involves flattening the scars so that the tattoos I already have and possibly some extra makeup can make the scars have less visibility. So what are the best methods at this point to flatten raised hypertrophic scars? Are there any cheap methods that work effectively on scars that are 3+ years old, or would this require an expensive cosmetic or medical procedure? I have heard of silicon scars sheets recently, but none of the dermatologists I consulted recommended this to me, and I do know about their effectiveness or how to use them properly. I would appreciate some helpful insight.",

Most of them are depressed scars, so I am considering subcision, as these scars need to be lifted. \n\nWill I get good results with subcision, possibly combined with CO₂ laser or microneedling, depending on the type of scars? It would be helpful if someone who has personally undergone this treatment could share their experience.\n\nAlso, why isn’t subcision discussed as much? Most people seem to recommend CO₂ lasers, which usually give minimal results for depressed scars since they cannot lift them. Even two dermatologists have advised me to go for a CO₂ laser for this type of scarring.\n\nIs subcision not recommended for Indian skin, or is it considered too risky?",

I have dry skin and get annoying flakes around my nose and mouth every winter, so I played it safe and used this only about twice a week, never daily. Over time, it actually helped - less flaking, smoother texture, and my makeup finally stopped clinging to dry patches. No instant glow, no overnight “glass skin” moment though, i finished the bottle and ended up restocking another because it did exactly what I needed it to do.

      "content": "\n\nMy Greying Timeline (Brief &amp; Clear)\n\nAge ~12.5 years:\nI first noticed a few grey hairs, mainly on the top/crown area. The number was very small, so I didn’t take any medical action at that time.\n\nAge 12.5–14 years:\nI did not take any treatment for around 2 years. During this period, the greys increased slowly and gradually. By my own observation, they reached around 25–40 strands, mostly on the top and sides of my scalp. The progression was slow, not sudden.\n\nFirst dermatologist visit (around age 14.5-15):\nI consulted a dermatologist and was prescribed H-Black (Melitane 5% gel).\nI used it for about 5 months, but not perfectly regularly—around 5–6 times a week, roughly 20 applications per month, totaling less than 90 applications over 5 months.\n\nAlong with H-Black:\n\nI took biotin tablets for 3 months\n\nI took vitamin B12 supplements for about 2 months\n\n\nObservations during this period:\nThe greying appeared to slow down. I noticed 2–4 hairs showing black roots or partial repigmentation, which suggested some response to treatment.\n\nSecond dermatologist visit (14 January 2026):\nI visited a more experienced dermatologist. After examining my scalp and greying pattern, he prescribed a new Melitane 5% liquid spray (Altris-5) to be used twice daily, along with Dandsol Shampoo and pigment-support MOM-XL capsules.\nHe asked me to follow the treatment strictly and return after 1 month for review.\n\nCurrent situation:\nI am now following the new treatment more consistently, with better topical medication, proper shampoo, supplements, and dietary support (chia seeds, milk, eggs). I am waiting for the next review to assess progress.\n\nAs a teenager this has affected my confidence a lot and I'm very anxious abt myself in very unsure that would these meds even work , i read on reddit abt a guy who spent 15k in a span of 8 months and still saw no results. Im very sad and depressed rn , i have around 40-45 greys now 🥀🥀is anyone in the same boat as me? Or anyone how was in this stage and repigmented their hairs using some meds ? Please help me.\n\n(Used Chatgpt for better framing and formatting)\n\n\n\n",

I took a strand of my hair and pulled from both ends, and it stretched a bit before snapping.\n\nMy current routine (I currently stay in Bengaluru, India):\n\nManetain Clarifying Shampoo (every 3 washes aka every 3 weeks)\n\nBare Anatomy Curl Defining Shampoo\n\nFix My Curls Deep Conditioner\n\nFix My Curls Leave In Cream\n\nFix My Curls Flaxseed Gel\n\nI double shampoo, condition and detangle and leave it in for two minutes and then rinse. I then section my hair, rake through emulsified curl cream and curl train with a brush handle, before applying a coin sized amount of gel to each section. I then let it air dry. I currently stay in dorm and cannot afford a diffuser (besides, we have to pay to keep a hair dryer in our rooms).\n\nI tie my hair into a loose low bun at night and sleep in a satin bonnet on a satin pillowcase. If I refresh, I dampen my hair until I can detangle it easily and once again section it and rake through a little emulsified curl cream.\n\nI used to live in the Middle East, where Pantene has a curly hair line (Curlastic). Those products really seemed to agree with my hair, especially the curl cream, which was very lightweight. However, the line is not available in India and my curls haven't been as consistently defined with these new products.\n\nAdvice on how to repair moisture overload (if that is what I'm experiencing) would be extremely helpful. I'm especially stumped on whether I need a protein treatment and if I do, which one to use (available in India).\n\nThanks so much!",

      "content": "I bought this lip balm about two weeks ago after hearing that it helps reduce lip pigmentation while providing good moisturization.\n\nMoisturizing:\nIn terms of hydration, it’s quite decent. It moisturizes the lips well, gives a subtle pink tint, and stays on for a few hours if left untouched. When used overnight, it leaves my lips feeling soft by morning.\n\nPigmentation:\nI don’t think it’s effective for reducing lip pigmentation. I haven’t noticed even a slight improvement in my lip color. If it were working, there should have been at least a minimal visible difference by now but unfortunately, there hasn’t been any even after consistent use.\n\nBecause of this, I’m considering switching to another lip balm specifically for pigmented lips. I already use the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which offers similar (or better) moisturization and also heals my lips overnight. So it makes more sense for me to continue investing in Laneige and look for a different product to target pigmentation.\n\nIf anyone could suggest some other quicker effective options for lip pigmentation... please feel free to drop it in comments.
