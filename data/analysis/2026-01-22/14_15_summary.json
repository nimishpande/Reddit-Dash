I've been over the moon about how good my hair looks now. I did want a haircut, just to clean up the sides. \nBut my hair was absolutely butchered. First pic is right before, second is when I got home from the curly hair salon. It looks awful, and barely curls anymore. She thinned out the top a ton, and my volume is gone. No point to this post other than just sharing my pain. Right back to insecure about my hair.\nRoutine is simple. Just shea moisture conditioner in the shower, then not your mother's curl talk cream then gel immediately after I get out. Then scrunch and let it air dry. Now that's not working anymore because of how she cut my hair",

Ever since I moved here I’ve struggled a lot with acne, but I’ve managed to get it under better control (no deep cysts anymore yay).\n\n⸻\n\nAM routine\n\t1.\tLukewarm water rinse\n\t2.\tLightweight moisturiser (Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion with Hyaluronic Acid)\n\t3.\tSunscreen (mineral, fragrance-free — used only when going outside)\n\n⸻\n\nPM routine\n\t1.\tMicellar water (if wearing makeup) and then lukewarm water cleanse\n\t2.\tApply Cos De Baha Azelaic Acid 10% on fully dry skin — wait 10 minutes\n\t3.\tMoisturiser (same as AM, sometimes applied more generously)\n\n⸻\n\nDaily habits\n\t•\tNo sugar, alcohol, or smoking\n\t•\tMostly whole foods\n\t•\tRegular pillowcase changes\n\t•\tMinimal makeup (concealer + powder)\n\n⸻\n\nWhat I’m hoping to get advice on\n\t•\tDoes my skin look like it’s in a healing phase vs still actively breaking out?\n\t•\tWould you recommend staying minimal for longer, or slowly reintroducing something else?\n\t•\tAny suggestions specifically for lingering redness/PIE on sensitive skin?\n\t•\tI wonder if my skin would benefit from a hydrating serum before moisturiser, and if so which ones might suit sensitive, acne-prone skin?\n\nThanks so much xx\n",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I took a strand of my hair and pulled from both ends, and it stretched a bit before snapping.\n\nMy current routine (I currently stay in Bengaluru, India):\n\nManetain Clarifying Shampoo (every 3 washes aka every 3 weeks)\n\nBare Anatomy Curl Defining Shampoo\n\nFix My Curls Deep Conditioner\n\nFix My Curls Leave In Cream\n\nFix My Curls Flaxseed Gel\n\nI double shampoo, condition and detangle and leave it in for two minutes and then rinse. I then section my hair, rake through emulsified curl cream and curl train with a brush handle, before applying a coin sized amount of gel to each section. I then let it air dry. I currently stay in dorm and cannot afford a diffuser (besides, we have to pay to keep a hair dryer in our rooms).\n\nI tie my hair into a loose low bun at night and sleep in a satin bonnet on a satin pillowcase. If I refresh, I dampen my hair until I can detangle it easily and once again section it and rake through a little emulsified curl cream.\n\nI used to live in the Middle East, where Pantene has a curly hair line (Curlastic). Those products really seemed to agree with my hair, especially the curl cream, which was very lightweight. However, the line is not available in India and my curls haven't been as consistently defined with these new products.\n\nAdvice on how to repair moisture overload (if that is what I'm experiencing) would be extremely helpful. I'm especially stumped on whether I need a protein treatment and if I do, which one to use (available in India).\n\nThanks so much!",

      "content": "Hi y'all! I just recently started looking into how to properly take care of my hair and began trying out a curly hair routine a couple days ago. This is how it looked this morning after showering, putting in products, and diffusing. I know that it takes time for curls to reach their full form, but I know there's room for improvement and I need some advice from the experts! First, here is my current routine/products I use:\n\n1. Kristen Ess Extra Gentle Shampoo and Conditioner\n\n2. Detangle with Wet brush, apply Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream \n\n3. apply Curlsmith Hydro Style Flexi Jelly, flip head upside down and scrunch\n\n4. apply John Frieda Frizz Ease Curl Reviver Mousse to roots and scrunch again\n\n5. plop hair in t-shirt for a few minutes\n\n6. diffuse until mostly dry, scrunch to break the gel cast, and put the hair near my part in a claw clip for a bit for volume\n\nSo far, I'm happy with the results of this routine, as my curls held their shape throughout the day, though my hair got a little less voluminous as time went on (and there wasn't too too much volume to begin with). The biggest thing I'm concerned about is that my hair looks dry and a little frizzy, especially towards the ends where it's more damaged, which I think is affecting the definition of my curls. I believe hair oil is a possible solution, so  if you have any  brand recommendations (preferably not super expensive, I'm a broke college student) or other ideas on how to fix it, let me know! Here's a list of other things I would love some advice on:\n\n\\- My roots and front pieces seem to have a very hard time curling, should I use more product there or a specific method?\n\n\\- What's the best way to refresh curls after sleeping on them? I've seen a lot of people say that you should avoid wetting them every day, so if that's the case, then what should I do?\n\n\\- I believe I have medium-to-high porosity hair. Lots of mixed opinions about oil usage on these hair types. Should I use it, and if so, when should I use it (before bed, to refresh hair, on wet hair, dry hair, etc.)?\n\nOk-- question tirade is over. Thank you in advance for your time and suggestions :)",

It moisturizes the lips well, gives a subtle pink tint, and stays on for a few hours if left untouched. When used overnight, it leaves my lips feeling soft by morning.\n\nPigmentation:\nI don’t think it’s effective for reducing lip pigmentation. I haven’t noticed even a slight improvement in my lip color. If it were working, there should have been at least a minimal visible difference by now but unfortunately, there hasn’t been any even after consistent use.\n\nBecause of this, I’m considering switching to another lip balm specifically for pigmented lips. I already use the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which offers similar (or better) moisturization and also heals my lips overnight. So it makes more sense for me to continue investing in Laneige and look for a different product to target pigmentation.\n\nIf anyone could suggest some other quicker effective options for lip pigmentation... please feel free to drop it in comments.

I’m at 3-4 months post procedure and still need a few more months for full collagen  remodeling to see the full result.\n\nWhat is the best product stack in the meantime? Oral daily vitamins and topical creams/serums? Right now I use “Drunk Elephant Vitamin C &amp; multi-peptide under eye cream”, GHK-CU, and Vitamin D supplement.\n\nShould I try:\n\nSkinbetter Science EyeMax AlphaRet Overnight Cream: It uses a proprietary retinoid-plus-AHA molecule that provides collagen-building retinol\n\nOr\n\nAlastin Restorative Eye Treatment: This uses \"TriHex Technology\" specifically designed to clear out old, damaged collagen and elastin (which can happen after procedures) and support the growth of new, healthy tissue. It is highly effective for the \"crepey\" texture that can sometimes linger post-plasma. \n\nApparently I need to be using some sort of retinal or Vitamin A? And also what about oral vitamins like vitamin K or any other vitamins? Any benefit? Please help I would genuinely appreciate it so much. The main dermatologist (who did my procedure) at my clinic is out with back injury. I can’t get good advice.\n\nAlso thought on the procedure results so far? I’m thinking o go back for round two. One eye seemed to have better results than the other, making it uneven. I never noticed uneven coloring before.",

I've never really put any thought into my hair and the extent of styling it in the morning is finger combs to make it look fairly presentable. My hair tends to grow out more than down so I wait until it's too unmanageable then once a quarter or so I get shorn and the cycle starts again. \nAll this said, my question is what do I ask for when I get into the chair? I usually make non committal noises and when they ask about grades I look blank and it's over all awkward. I want it short enough that it's value for money, without being too short, and slightly shorter than that on the sides! Any advice would be appreciated and would stop the anxiety leading up to it, and the awkwardness at the time! Cheers! ",

Finally I found out that it was - most likely - the water causing all this havoc as minerals form a layer on naked skin slowly drying it out.\n\nThere is no good solution like waterfilter here for me (none that seem really promising/too expensive a.s.o.) and apart from my skin issues I can deal with the rest (there are solutions for everything else that work).\n\nSo after some research I discovered distilled water rinses after showers (basically showering my whole body with lukewarm distilled water after the shower) and at first I thought I found my holy grail - until the itching started.\n\nSo now I'm even deeper into the rabbit hole and read up on osmosis and how distilled water (being pure) temporarily even draws out water.\n\nSo how do I do this? I read 2 things but I'm not sure which one is better and maybe you can help me/have an even better solution:\n\n1.) add a tiny smidge of sea salt to stop water from being pulled out and instead hydrate?! So in that case how much salt do I add to 1 1/2 litres of distilled water? A pinch?\n\n2.) Maybe add some clean bottled mineral water ... but how much from that? Just a tiny bit? Would that prevent an osmotic pull?\n\nI would be so grateful for any ideas! The itching after the showers (every 2 days) are driving me insane! :-)",
