I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

When I don’t have makeup on, I look my age but I need to have help with completion and scars. \n\nI have a good skin care routine, red light therapy, and will continue microneedling but I need some advice on makeup application. \n\nWhat tinted moisturizer should I use (if not foundation)? What cream blush? What primer (is my moisturizer not enough)? What setting powder? \n\nShould I try a powder foundation instead? \n\nHELP! ",

I've bought this before and from memory it was not so thick that it applies like a paste. 😭 When I tried to apply it to my lash strips, it was like glue that's old and has dried out (and to no one's surprise - did not stick). They sent me a new one as a replacement and it came solid just like the first one.  \n\nNow I'm thinking - does lash glue solidify in the nail since it's winter? Does anyone recommend just placing it in warm water or will that mess up the formula somehow? Am I a dummy and misremembering their formula? Lol!!\n\nPlease help!",

It used to be long and thick and beautiful as I’ve maintained my blue color for two decades. Now it is near transparent, dry, lifeless, continuously falling out. \n\nI use K18 molecular repair serum and am going to invest in the shampoo and conditioner next. \n\nMy hair is a big part of who I am, my identity, personality, and happiness. Pics are attached.

My hair constantly feels weighed down and over-moisturized. I've been integrating a clarifying shampoo but still feels like my hair hates everything, including my old products. \n\nIncluding two photos. The one with me alone is me with my hair at it's best a year ago. In the second, you can really see how I've lost definition. My hair does well with lightweight (not too goopy or sticky) products that still leave a strong cast.

I don’t think there’s much I can do to fully stop it, but I’m hoping to at least slow it down or make it look better.\n\nUp until recently I usually got a low or mid fade and then styled the top messy at home. I stopped doing that because it felt like my hair was getting worse. My hairline has started to take on more of an “M” shape.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* Is it worth going to a doctor at this stage?\n* Are there treatments that actually help this early on?\n* What kind of haircut would suit me best right now?\n\nFor context, my face is fairly oval/lean with softer features.\n\nAny advice is appreciated. Hope everyone’s having a great day.",

I don't think I have dark armpits, my skin tone is still quite even, its just that the hair shows through so much. I'm not really interested in waxing, plucking, or threading it all out whenever I'm wearing a tank top. I shave my armpits really only whenever I'm going outside in a tank top or something with very short or no sleeves which isn't too often. I know I shouldn't care what people think about it but I'm not looking for that advice. I don't really care what other people think of it, I am the one who wants it less visible. I'm not sure if this is really fixable without eliminating the hair but I'm willing to try things that aren't too expensive. The only thing I've tried besides shaving is nair and at home laser removal which neither worked to lighten or get rid of the hair.",

I genuinely had no idea I had any natural texture.\n\nRecently, after a lot of digging and experimenting (and realizing there were *many* signs), I learned that I actually have wavy—maybe even curly—hair. I know it can take time for the true pattern to show, but I’m very new to all of this and feeling a bit lost.\n\n**Current routine:**\n• **Wash frequency:** Every other night\n• **Shampoo &amp; conditioner:** R+Co Gemstone\n• **Styling product:** Briogeo Curl Charisma (applied on wash nights)\n• **Styling method:** Scrunching on soaking-wet hair\n• **Drying:** Diffuse to about 80%, then air dry the rest\n• **Brushing:** None (used to brush straight daily, now stopped)\n• **Heat:** No blow-drying with a brush anymore\n• **Sleep:** 100% silk pillowcase\n\nThat’s basically my entire routine right now, and this is what I’m getting so far. It’s honestly wild realizing how much I was damaging my hair for years with heat and brushing.\n\n**Questions:**\nWhere do I go from here? How do I figure out what my hair actually needs as my pattern starts to show? Should I be adding or removing anything from this routine while my hair adjusts? I know it can take weeks or months for things to settle, but I’d love guidance on how to support that process properly.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

It doesn’t look thin by any means, but is definitely not thick either. My hair (minus the ends where I’m growing out bleach) is very smooth and shiny. I’m grateful for this BUT I would loveeee to have a big bouncy blowout but unfortunately my hair doesn’t hold any shape or volume. I’ve kind of accepted that this is the case. Does anyone have any advice on products or styling techniques I can use to make it even the slightest bit more voluminous? I feel like it just looks less put together than the rest of me and makes me look a bit scraggly even though I wash and blow dry almost everyday, and upkeep with trims and maintain my layers.
