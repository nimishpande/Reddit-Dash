This is how it looked this morning after showering, putting in products, and diffusing. I know that it takes time for curls to reach their full form, but I know there's room for improvement and I need some advice from the experts! First, here is my current routine/products I use:\n\n1. Kristen Ess Extra Gentle Shampoo and Conditioner\n\n2. Detangle with Wet brush, apply Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream \n\n3. apply Curlsmith Hydro Style Flexi Jelly, flip head upside down and scrunch\n\n4. apply John Frieda Frizz Ease Curl Reviver Mousse to roots and scrunch again\n\n5. plop hair in t-shirt for a few minutes\n\n6. diffuse until mostly dry, scrunch to break the gel cast, and put the hair near my part in a claw clip for a bit for volume\n\nSo far, I'm happy with the results of this routine, as my curls held their shape throughout the day, though my hair got a little less voluminous as time went on (and there wasn't too too much volume to begin with). The biggest thing I'm concerned about is that my hair looks dry and a little frizzy, especially towards the ends where it's more damaged, which I think is affecting the definition of my curls. I believe hair oil is a possible solution, so  if you have any  brand recommendations (preferably not super expensive, I'm a broke college student) or other ideas on how to fix it, let me know! Here's a list of other things I would love some advice on:\n\n\\- My roots and front pieces seem to have a very hard time curling, should I use more product there or a specific method?\n\n\\- What's the best way to refresh curls after sleeping on them? I've seen a lot of people say that you should avoid wetting them every day, so if that's the case, then what should I do?\n\n\\- I believe I have medium-to-high porosity hair. Lots of mixed opinions about oil usage on these hair types. Should I use it, and if so, when should I use it (before bed, to refresh hair, on wet hair, dry hair, etc.)?\n\nOk-- question tirade is over. Thank you in advance for your time and suggestions :)",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

      "content": "I recently was gifted a Sephora gift card and decided to make the most of it by getting sample sizes of some items I’ve been wanting to try/hearing a lot of positive buzz about. Mainly, the L’Occitane Shower Almond Oil, which I was most excited about. I love almond, oud, gourmand scents, and I love to layer scents throughout my getting ready process, so I was very hyped to try this and see how it layered into my routine. \n\nOh man was it horrific. The bottle was sealed and packaged well; it was not physically damaged or bulging/bloated suggesting a spoiled product. Upon first removing the inner plastic lining, the smell was mild but pleasant. I went to use it and with a small dollop in my palm, the fragrance was suddenly overwhelming and… metallic. Specifically, it smelled like pennies. Copper. Dirty change. I was really bewildered and thought maybe it was the water from the shower head suddenly bringing up some minerals (I live in an area with hard water and heavy chlorine treatment). Maybe it was one of my products mixing with this shower oil smell and causing a weird chemical reaction. Maybe it was my nose. It definitely couldn’t be this very hyped, quite expensive shower oil. \n\nBut lo’ and behold, upon lathering this oil up, I smelled distinctly like pennies and once I connected the scent to that imagery, it was over for me. I’ve since returned the product and definitely won’t be returning for a second chance. \n\nHas anyone else found this product to smell weird? I’ve had plenty of almond scented products and none have ever been so malodorous. ",

Possibly because I wasn’t using it correctly or so.. \n\nMy hair feels coarse and VERY dry, and frizzes up very fast. And it’s also quite voluminous.. childhood photos show that my hair grew out very big, like a lion’s mane from what my uncle would like to call it.\n\nI figured out I have medium-high porosity hair with around 2C-3A curls, but I’m not completely sure about it yet. \n\nI’ve tried brushing my hair after shower but it just makes it flat and products barely hold on, so I might try brushing before shower but I often just hop in the shower so I have to remember ",

I am wondering if anyone can explain to me scientifically the discussion and recommendation of not washing the hair until 48-72 hours after a color service due to the cuticle not being “completely closed”. I know cuticles dont work like blinds that just open and close. In my experience, washing 24 hours after color shouldn’t affect the longevity because the color doesn’t continue processing &amp; the conditioner seals with an acidic pH. I’m confusedddd",

It moisturizes the lips well, gives a subtle pink tint, and stays on for a few hours if left untouched. When used overnight, it leaves my lips feeling soft by morning.\n\nPigmentation:\nI don’t think it’s effective for reducing lip pigmentation. I haven’t noticed even a slight improvement in my lip color. If it were working, there should have been at least a minimal visible difference by now but unfortunately, there hasn’t been any even after consistent use.\n\nBecause of this, I’m considering switching to another lip balm specifically for pigmented lips. I already use the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which offers similar (or better) moisturization and also heals my lips overnight. So it makes more sense for me to continue investing in Laneige and look for a different product to target pigmentation.\n\nIf anyone could suggest some other quicker effective options for lip pigmentation... please feel free to drop it in comments.
