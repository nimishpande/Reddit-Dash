I've been over the moon about how good my hair looks now. I did want a haircut, just to clean up the sides. \nBut my hair was absolutely butchered. First pic is right before, second is when I got home from the curly hair salon. It looks awful, and barely curls anymore. She thinned out the top a ton, and my volume is gone. No point to this post other than just sharing my pain. Right back to insecure about my hair.\nRoutine is simple. Just shea moisture conditioner in the shower, then not your mother's curl talk cream then gel immediately after I get out. Then scrunch and let it air dry. Now that's not working anymore because of how she cut my hair",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

The first picture is my own hair and the second one is my highlight color inspiration. \n\nI have virgin curly hair and I was looking to get some highlights done (in the color of the 2nd picture), but I’m scared it might ruin my curls. I already have some natural ones, specially after sun exposure and I like the look, just wondering if it’s worth it going trough bleaching just to get a somewhat similar result… \n\nI’ll also be cutting my hair at the same time (I know my current hair isn’t in the best shape right now, pls don’t judge &gt;\\_&lt;), so I’m trying to decide if highlights are a good idea or if I should just stick to a cut and keep things natural… Thanks!! \n\nMy routine:\n\n1- Shampoo and Conditioner from the brand “Angel en Provence” the exact name being: “Curly hair Rose Extract”\n\n2 - Curly Cream/Gel from the brand Lola Cosmetics, name: “Plot Twist - Guava Gel”, Mousse: “Pantene Pro-V Curl Mousse” and Olaplex N7 Bonding Oil to remove the cast. \n\n3 - Diffuse for volume and definition but in this picture it was very wet and air drying ",

I took a strand of my hair and pulled from both ends, and it stretched a bit before snapping.\n\nMy current routine (I currently stay in Bengaluru, India):\n\nManetain Clarifying Shampoo (every 3 washes aka every 3 weeks)\n\nBare Anatomy Curl Defining Shampoo\n\nFix My Curls Deep Conditioner\n\nFix My Curls Leave In Cream\n\nFix My Curls Flaxseed Gel\n\nI double shampoo, condition and detangle and leave it in for two minutes and then rinse. I then section my hair, rake through emulsified curl cream and curl train with a brush handle, before applying a coin sized amount of gel to each section. I then let it air dry. I currently stay in dorm and cannot afford a diffuser (besides, we have to pay to keep a hair dryer in our rooms).\n\nI tie my hair into a loose low bun at night and sleep in a satin bonnet on a satin pillowcase. If I refresh, I dampen my hair until I can detangle it easily and once again section it and rake through a little emulsified curl cream.\n\nI used to live in the Middle East, where Pantene has a curly hair line (Curlastic). Those products really seemed to agree with my hair, especially the curl cream, which was very lightweight. However, the line is not available in India and my curls haven't been as consistently defined with these new products.\n\nAdvice on how to repair moisture overload (if that is what I'm experiencing) would be extremely helpful. I'm especially stumped on whether I need a protein treatment and if I do, which one to use (available in India).\n\nThanks so much!",

I've heard a lot about not using AHAs and retinoids together, and given my previous experiences using tretinoin I'm mildly worried about having a reaction somewhere, somehow.

It moisturizes the lips well, gives a subtle pink tint, and stays on for a few hours if left untouched. When used overnight, it leaves my lips feeling soft by morning.\n\nPigmentation:\nI don’t think it’s effective for reducing lip pigmentation. I haven’t noticed even a slight improvement in my lip color. If it were working, there should have been at least a minimal visible difference by now but unfortunately, there hasn’t been any even after consistent use.\n\nBecause of this, I’m considering switching to another lip balm specifically for pigmented lips. I already use the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which offers similar (or better) moisturization and also heals my lips overnight. So it makes more sense for me to continue investing in Laneige and look for a different product to target pigmentation.\n\nIf anyone could suggest some other quicker effective options for lip pigmentation... please feel free to drop it in comments.

      "content": "Hi y'all! I just recently started looking into how to properly take care of my hair and began trying out a curly hair routine a couple days ago. This is how it looked this morning after showering, putting in products, and diffusing. I know that it takes time for curls to reach their full form, but I know there's room for improvement and I need some advice from the experts! First, here is my current routine/products I use:\n\n1. Kristen Ess Extra Gentle Shampoo and Conditioner\n\n2. Detangle with Wet brush, apply Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream \n\n3. apply Curlsmith Hydro Style Flexi Jelly, flip head upside down and scrunch\n\n4. apply John Frieda Frizz Ease Curl Reviver Mousse to roots and scrunch again\n\n5. plop hair in t-shirt for a few minutes\n\n6. diffuse until mostly dry, scrunch to break the gel cast, and put the hair near my part in a claw clip for a bit for volume\n\nSo far, I'm happy with the results of this routine, as my curls held their shape throughout the day, though my hair got a little less voluminous as time went on (and there wasn't too too much volume to begin with). The biggest thing I'm concerned about is that my hair looks dry and a little frizzy, especially towards the ends where it's more damaged, which I think is affecting the definition of my curls. I believe hair oil is a possible solution, so  if you have any  brand recommendations (preferably not super expensive, I'm a broke college student) or other ideas on how to fix it, let me know! Here's a list of other things I would love some advice on:\n\n\\- My roots and front pieces seem to have a very hard time curling, should I use more product there or a specific method?\n\n\\- What's the best way to refresh curls after sleeping on them? I've seen a lot of people say that you should avoid wetting them every day, so if that's the case, then what should I do?\n\n\\- I believe I have medium-to-high porosity hair. Lots of mixed opinions about oil usage on these hair types. Should I use it, and if so, when should I use it (before bed, to refresh hair, on wet hair, dry hair, etc.)?\n\nOk-- question tirade is over. Thank you in advance for your time and suggestions :)",

      "title": "[Review] My routine that allows me to do skincare every other day",
      "content": "Not sure what flair to put but I’ll say review.\n\nSo I was discussing skincare with a friend and mentioned my schedule. She was SHOCKED. I figured some other people might benefit from my routine since I’ve found something that works so infrequently.\n\nBasically, I shower every other day (after the gym). I do my skincare after my shower and that’s it—nothing until my next shower.\n\nSo what is my routine that somehow lasts 48 hours? I’ll go over each step and why it’s important.\n\nTo start, I triple cleanse in the shower. First I use a gentle but oil-removing cleanser (shea moisture black soap foaming cleanser). This is important because the next step doesn’t work as well on oily skin.\n\nStep 2 is a fruit enzyme peeling gel, I use either Beauty of Joseon apricot peeling gel or Anua peeling gel. Put it on your skin and let it sit for a minute, then gently massage into your skin. You’ll feel it start to pill. Don’t rinse your hands while you do this, you want the pills to be worked into your skin. They are sticky plant cells that stick to your dead skin and pull it away. Yes, some of the pilling is the product but if you don’t believe it’s removing dead skin, try it a second time and you can see how little pilling there is compared to when you first did it. However, don’t use it twice ever again, only once if you doubt its efficacy. It WILL irritate your skin if you use it twice, it is a PHYSICAL exfoliant first and foremost. \n\nStep 3 is any kind of gentle cleanser. You want to strip the revealed sticky layer of new skin of any oils so your skincare can penetrate. I’m using biodance collagen cleanser because it was in an advent calendar but anything gentle will work.\n\nThe cleansing is so important because we need everything else to SOAK IN. Having oils or dead skin on your face just prevents everything from penetrating.\n\nStep 4 is mega important. DRY YOUR FACE. I know, this is going to upset some people given the next step.\n\nStep 5, hyaluronic acid. There are so many, but you want one with low molecular weights. Torriden dive in serum, isntree low weight hyaluronic acid, hada labo gokujyun moist are all good options.\n\nHere’s the important part: apply multiple layers. Apply a layer all over your face (you can even put it on your eyelids and lips) and let it absorb for 5-10 minutes. I do three layers with absorption time between each. I read a study on hyaluronic acid and the researchers applied the serum SEVEN TIMES and saw a 30% increase in hyaluronic acid within the epidermis. Repeat application absolutely helps, and this is why you want a serum that doesn’t have a lot of other stuff in it.\n\nStep 6, “toners”. I use quotes because I do not mean anything with actives. No exfoliants, no vitamin C, no acids. Gentle watery toners with calming ingredients.\n\nGo HAM. Slap that toner on and let it absorb then do it again. Again and again. I usually use 2-3 different kinds. They only need a few minutes to absorb!\n\nStep 7. Now that your skin has sucked up all the moisture it can handle, it’s time for a serum or two. Thicker, more ingredients, this is when you want to include acids and niacinimide and azelaic acid and the like. Again, no exfoliants! Your skin is already so exfoliated from the cleansing. I have like 10 and use whatever I feel like using at the time.\n\nI’m a huge fan of the axis-y spot correcting serum because of the scent, the consistency and the extracts. I don’t have dark spots so I can’t comment on that. I also love the CosRX propolis ampoule.\n\nFinally, step 8, a thick moisturizer. I use Abib heartleaf calming tube. It just needs to be thick and sit on your skin to lock in all the shit you just used.\n\nNow this is when most of yall would do sunscreen so I’ll say that’s what you should do next but I personal don’t. If you do that shouldn’t affect the longevity of this routine unless your sunscreen is drying.\n\nObviously your mileage may vary. I have no acne and never have, but I have combination skin (oily nose and dry skin everywhere else). I also have super high natural cell turnover and. Issues I do have are visible sebaceous filaments (working on a routine to fix that, any recommendation helps!) and some fine lines, but I’m 37 and have only a single forehead wrinkle.\n\nGenetics is going to play a huge part in this. However, I will say that my skin does NOT naturally stay moisturized for two days. If I don’t do every step of my routine I noticed dry ashy patches on my jaw and forehead by the end of the day.\n\nI think the exfoliation and hyaluronic acid are the heavy hitters in this routine. If you modify it at all I recommend not changing those, and you absolutely MUST follow the HA with lots of high water content products so the HA has something to bind to within your skin.\n\nThanks for reading!",

Oral daily vitamins and topical creams/serums? Right now I use “Drunk Elephant Vitamin C &amp; multi-peptide under eye cream”, GHK-CU, and Vitamin D supplement.\n\nShould I try:\n\nSkinbetter Science EyeMax AlphaRet Overnight Cream: It uses a proprietary retinoid-plus-AHA molecule that provides collagen-building retinol\n\nOr\n\nAlastin Restorative Eye Treatment: This uses \"TriHex Technology\" specifically designed to clear out old, damaged collagen and elastin (which can happen after procedures) and support the growth of new, healthy tissue. It is highly effective for the \"crepey\" texture that can sometimes linger post-plasma. \n\nApparently I need to be using some sort of retinal or Vitamin A? And also what about oral vitamins like vitamin K or any other vitamins? Any benefit? Please help I would genuinely appreciate it so much. The main dermatologist (who did my procedure) at my clinic is out with back injury. I can’t get good advice.\n\nAlso thought on the procedure results so far? I’m thinking o go back for round two.
