I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Possibly because I wasn’t using it correctly or so.. \n\nMy hair feels coarse and VERY dry, and frizzes up very fast. And it’s also quite voluminous.. childhood photos show that my hair grew out very big, like a lion’s mane from what my uncle would like to call it.\n\nI figured out I have medium-high porosity hair with around 2C-3A curls, but I’m not completely sure about it yet. \n\nI’ve tried brushing my hair after shower but it just makes it flat and products barely hold on, so I might try brushing before shower but I often just hop in the shower so I have to remember ",

I've bought this before and from memory it was not so thick that it applies like a paste. 😭 When I tried to apply it to my lash strips, it was like glue that's old and has dried out (and to no one's surprise - did not stick). They sent me a new one as a replacement and it came solid just like the first one.  \n\nNow I'm thinking - does lash glue solidify in the nail since it's winter? Does anyone recommend just placing it in warm water or will that mess up the formula somehow? Am I a dummy and misremembering their formula? Lol!!\n\nPlease help!",

      "content": "I recently was gifted a Sephora gift card and decided to make the most of it by getting sample sizes of some items I’ve been wanting to try/hearing a lot of positive buzz about. Mainly, the L’Occitane Shower Almond Oil, which I was most excited about. I love almond, oud, gourmand scents, and I love to layer scents throughout my getting ready process, so I was very hyped to try this and see how it layered into my routine. \n\nOh man was it horrific. The bottle was sealed and packaged well; it was not physically damaged or bulging/bloated suggesting a spoiled product. Upon first removing the inner plastic lining, the smell was mild but pleasant. I went to use it and with a small dollop in my palm, the fragrance was suddenly overwhelming and… metallic. Specifically, it smelled like pennies. Copper. Dirty change. I was really bewildered and thought maybe it was the water from the shower head suddenly bringing up some minerals (I live in an area with hard water and heavy chlorine treatment). Maybe it was one of my products mixing with this shower oil smell and causing a weird chemical reaction. Maybe it was my nose. It definitely couldn’t be this very hyped, quite expensive shower oil. \n\nBut lo’ and behold, upon lathering this oil up, I smelled distinctly like pennies and once I connected the scent to that imagery, it was over for me. I’ve since returned the product and definitely won’t be returning for a second chance. \n\nHas anyone else found this product to smell weird? I’ve had plenty of almond scented products and none have ever been so malodorous. ",

I don't think I have dark armpits, my skin tone is still quite even, its just that the hair shows through so much. I'm not really interested in waxing, plucking, or threading it all out whenever I'm wearing a tank top. I shave my armpits really only whenever I'm going outside in a tank top or something with very short or no sleeves which isn't too often. I know I shouldn't care what people think about it but I'm not looking for that advice. I don't really care what other people think of it, I am the one who wants it less visible. I'm not sure if this is really fixable without eliminating the hair but I'm willing to try things that aren't too expensive. The only thing I've tried besides shaving is nair and at home laser removal which neither worked to lighten or get rid of the hair.",

My hair constantly feels weighed down and over-moisturized. I've been integrating a clarifying shampoo but still feels like my hair hates everything, including my old products. \n\nIncluding two photos. The one with me alone is me with my hair at it's best a year ago. In the second, you can really see how I've lost definition.

It’s like patch with a yellow tinge. I usually wear glasses so I didn’t notice it.

      "content": "So, basically every night I apply a layer of vaseline over my lips after I've brushed my teeth. I don't brush or exfoliate my lips with a brush or any scrub. My lips are damp when I put the vaseline on.\n\nThis is the only thing I put on my lips to hydrate or ig heel them. However, every morning when I wake up and go to take the vaseline off, a layer of skin comes off from both my bottom and top lips.\n\nI wanted to know if this is normal or not?\n\nI drink plenty of water, or at least try to. However, if I miss a single day of not using vaseline, my lips become horrible and usually a cut/crack appears right in the middle of my bottom lip, even if I'm drinking plenty of water. Oh, and I forgot to mention, when the skin of the bottom lips comes off, it usually comes off as two pieces, the skin on the left and right side do not appear to be one, and it seems the middle separates them. This is especially evident when the skin is dry, and you can see the two parts of my lip being separated by a cut/crack in the middle. But after applying vaseline and taking the skin off in the morning my lips appear fine for the day. Again, idk if I'm overreacting or if this is normal.\n\nAnother note is that when I take the skin off in the morning, it comes off really easily. It's not like the times when I don't have vaseline on and I'm trying to take the skin off. At those times it's painful. But when the vaseline is on them, the skin comes off really easily and without any pain at all.\n\nAny tips? I do not wish to use lip balm as I've heard people get addicted or ig bound by these products and then can not stop using them, otherwise their condition gets worse.\n\nAnyway, if someone could tell me if something is wrong with my lips and/or give me guidance on how to improve their condition, that would be great :)",

I live in the Midwest (USA), so my skin deals with very cold winters and hot, humid summers.\n\nI have combo skin, but lately I’ve been waking up with dry flakes, especially in the mornings. I use tret, so I’m guessing my barrier needs more support. Right now I use Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream in the AM and I’m From Rice Cream in the PM, but I think I may need something more hydrating and barrier focused??\n\nFor additional context, I had very clear skin growing up and throughout high school. My hormonal/stress-related acne started after I began college, so I’m fairly confident it’s stress-related rather than something I’ve dealt with long term.\n\nMoisturizers I’m considering:\n\n\\-Aestura Atobarrier 365 Cream\n\n\\-Dr. Althea 345 Relief Cream\n\n\\-BOJ Dynasty Cream\n\n\\-Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream\n\n\\-Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nAM\n\n\\-vanicream cleanser (PanOxyl 10% a few times a week)\n\n\\-Good Molecules Hyaluronic Acid\n\n\\-COSRX Snail Mucin Essence\n\n\\-Good Molecules Discoloration Serum OR 15% Azelaic Acid a few times a week\n\n\\-Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream\n\n\\-BOJ SPF\n\nPM\n\n\\-Bioderma Sensibio Micellar Water\n\n\\-Vanicream cleanser\n\n\\-Good Molecules Hyaluronic Acid\n\n\\-COSRX Snail Mucin Essence\n\n\\-Clindamycin\n\n\\-Tretinoin 0.025% (every other day)\n\n\\-I’m From Rice Cream\n\nLike I mentioned, I also struggle with mild hormonal/stress-related acne and I’m trying to manage it topically. I’m not interested in oral meds. For context, I already have solid lifestyle habits: I work out regularly, go on walks, eat pretty clean, cut out dairy (which helped a bit), drink a lot of water and herbal teas, and sleep 8–9 hours on a consistent schedule. I’m a full-time college student taking 18 credits while working \\~20 hours/week, so stress is somewhat unavoidable, but I manage it as best I can.\n\nI’m mainly looking for topical/barrier support and routine tweaks. If anyone has moisturizer recommendations or feedback on my routine, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks!",
