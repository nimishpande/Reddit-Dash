People treat me better, with even cashier girls at supermarkets now being flirty and giggly at times, making conversations, mutual friends seem to show interest, currently talking to a girl rn, it’s like I became a completely different person. \n\nThe world feels completely different now.\n\nSure, rare few men may pull off bald looks, but for the majority of young men, having a thick, healthy head of hair really does make a massive difference.\n\nIf you’re in the early stages of hair loss, please don’t give in to the “just shave it and lift weights” advice or finasteride phobia, unless that's something you truly want.

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "\nSo, I moved to Noida about four years ago — new job, new city, new life… and suddenly, new problem.\nMy hair started falling like crazy.\nLike actual bunches of hair every wash.\n\nI’ve had acne since my teens, but my parents always brushed it off like, “yeh toh normal hai.”\nOnce I started working, I finally decided — okay, no one’s coming to save me, I’ll figure this out myself.\n\nObviously, I started where everyone starts — YouTube and Instagram 😭.\nTried onion juice, rosemary oil, random “hair detox” tips from influencers.\nEvery reel felt like a new hope, and every shower felt like heartbreak.\n\nThen I realised — I’m actually going to go bald at this rate if I keep experimenting.\nSo began the hunt for a real dermatologist.\nAnd because I’m a typical social media junkie, I started with the ones who looked the most perfect online.\n\nDermat #1:\nThe “prettiest dermatologist” in South Delhi (you know the one whose husband’s also a social media star).\nWent to her for 3 months. She’s from one of those fancy private colleges, looks amazing on Instagram… but her treatment? Confusing.\nShe’d say one thing online, prescribe another in person.\nIt felt like she didn’t even believe in her own advice.\n\nDermat #2:\nNext was a senior male doctor from a big Delhi hospital.\nTotally arrogant. Didn’t listen, kept interrupting. Also, he was completely bald — I’m sorry, but that did not inspire confidence. 😐\n\nDermat #3:\nThen I tried the husband of one of the biggest dermatologists on Instagram.\nHe was good — calm, professional, actually explained things.\nBut their system was impossible. Getting an appointment was like applying for a visa. Truth was , on a weekday noon, which i always prefer, clinic was always empty.\nAnd when I finally got treated, I realised it was the same protocol most good dermats follow.\nNothing unique — just great packaging.\n\n\nDermat #4:\nBy now, I had learnt some lessons.\nSo I found a young dermatologist from a government college — she’d built her page around her degrees and her own acne journey. She was based in Hauz khas.\nI liked her vibe, but she was too cautious.\nShe kept saying my hair loss was normal, just fix your lifestyle.\nLike girl, my lifestyle is already squeaky clean — I needed help, not another “sleep more, drink water” lecture.\nShe waited months before starting anything real, and by then I was exhausted.\n\nFinally…\nOne of my office colleagues kept insisting I go to this low-profile dermatologist in Noida — someone who isn’t even on social media.\nI went with zero expectations, honestly just out of frustration.\nAnd that’s when it hit me — the really good doctors don’t have time for reels and filters. They’re busy doing actual work.\n\nIf you’ve read this far — thank you 🫶\nI just wanted to share this because I know how easy it is to get swayed by social media.\nAnd atleast someone should benefit from my own hard earned money funded research. 😀",

This has been happening for probably 6 months now, just varying degrees of breakouts on and in between my eyebrows. I have no idea whats causing it. These aren't just whiteheads either, they never come to a head, I just have to ignore them. I've been getting extremely painful, huge blind pimples in the center of my eyebrows as well. Also pictured is the huge blind pimple on my temple. Those I just have to wait out.\n\nI haven't been to a dermatologist yet because there isn't a single one near me that has an opening. I've called and begged and nothing. I feel so defeated. I don't like going outside anymore because I'm so embarrassed of my acne and when I cover it up with makeup it looks and gets even worse. I dont know if this is cystic, hormonal or fungal. Every active I use makes it worse (salicylic and BP so far have irritated it and BHA drys me out). I dont even know what to do anymore. Trying anything new makes it angry and pop back up. I'm desperate though. Any advice or suggestions is welcome. I'll answer questions as best as possible, I wfh luckily so I'll be next to my phone all day.\n\nRoutine: \nAM- Splash with cold water and pat dry on a separate towel just for my face, apply Good Molecules Lightweight Daily Moisturizer, let it sink in and use Black Girl Sunscreen. I reapply sometimes but not always.\nPM- Wash face with the Vanicream Daily Cleanser. I don't dry my face and apply the Neutrogena Alcohol Free Toner with a cotton pad. This cleared up my skin a few weeks ago but it's since come back. After toner, I use the same Good Molecules moisturizer.\nThats it. I change my pillowcase every week and style my hair away from my face. Even after I'm done styling my hair, I make sure to splash water on my face just in case. I try not to touch my face with dirty hands and try to clean all my makeup brushes, applicators and tools after at least a couple of uses. I'm so close to just not doing anything at all. I cry every day about it.",

For a few months now I’ve had bad breakouts of spots, mainly on my cheeks, but also forehead and that part where my earlobes meet my jawline (not sure if there’s a better name for that!).\n\nI’ve never had consistently bad skin before, just the occasional spots that clear and leave me with pretty decent skin again. I’m not very well versed in skincare and all the ingredients so could do with some help identifying what the cause may be and eliminating it or replacing it with something that could work better for me. \n\nAt the moment I use:\n\nMorning:\n– Beauty of Joseon Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/green-plum-refreshing-cleanser\n– Beauty of Joseon Calming Serum : Green tea + Panthenol https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/calming-serum-green-tea-panthenol\n– Freck Rich Bitch Cactus + Vitamin C moisturiser https://www.freckbeauty.com/products/rich-bitch\n– Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics SPF https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/relief-sun-rice-probiotics-spf50-pa-uk\n\nEvening:\n– Beauty of Joseon Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser (again) https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/green-plum-refreshing-cleanser\n– Medik8 Crystal Retinal Ceramide Eye 3 https://www.medik8.com/products/crystal-retinal-ceramide-eye\n– Freck Rich Bitch Cactus + Vitamin C moisturiser (again) https://www.freckbeauty.com/products/rich-bitch\n\nRecently I tried swapping the eye cream for Medik8’s general Crystal Retinal 3 on my whole face, but my breakout seemed to get worse so I stopped using it for now.\n\nWhen I started using Rich Bitch moisturiser a couple of years ago I liked the not-too-creamy almost chalky texture, but now I’m questioning whether this is the problem product. It kind of feels lightweight but is it actually too rich for me?\n\nI’d like my routine to be simple, with minimal products, which are ideally cruelty-free/vegan. I’d like to include sun-protection and, if possible, something to signs of ageing at bay (which is why I introduced Crystal Retinal).\n\nAny advice on potential causes / things to look out for would be greatly appreciated :) Thanks in advance!

They said they did, but either way she fell asleep on the beach and got burnt bad.  This burn was Sunday night. Today is Tuesday. I knew she got burnt but not this bad until late last night when she said it had weeping blisters.  She never sent pictures until I asked for them.  \n\nI know this is going to need some serious aftercare.  She flies home tonight.  What products should I use  OR should avoid to help prevent scarring.  I have access to Ulta, drug store,  target/Walmart, and the internet. Like exact products to order, I'll order them.  \n\n  I have a minimal selection of products at home already.  Kiddo doesn't have a skincare routine except occasionally benzoyl peroxide, and i figure obviously not to use that while it's healing.  But otherwise I'm completely clueless on where to start here, especially on such a sensitive region. \n\nShould I take her to urgent care when she lands? Is there anything they can offer that I can't get from Ulta? She has government insurance so they won't pay for alot of specialty stuff, so that a concern.  \n\nI appreciate any help you can provide!",

I don't have problems with i.e. putting moisturizer on my face, seruns or spf.\n\nmy dermatologist started me on retinol (very happy) so i think need to have a better way to cleanse my face daily, even when i can't wash it properly (pleaseee if you don't understand my struggle, abstain from criticizing as this is a sensitive topic for me 🥹 i know the best way is to cleanse it so the skin is oil free to absorve the product!!!)\n\n1. currently, when i can't wash it PM, i use micellar water (a lot) on a cotton pad (doesn't need to rinse, doesn't foam, doesn't get sticky) and my face feels dry afterwards (in a good way!!! dry as in not oily) afterwards.  + moisturizer\n\n2. i can wash it with (just) water in the morning + spf\n\ndo you think this is enough to start retinol, considering my limitations? do you think it would be better to i.e. use a lukewarm wet microfiber cloth? with water and/or micellar water?\ndo you have any tips for alternatives like these?\n\nmy dermatologist is a busy guy, he just rushed me and I didn't have the opportunity to ask... i also think he would roll his eyes at me lol\n\nthanks a lot (◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠).♪✧⁠*♡",
