      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Just my personal preference, but for years I’ve been using leave-in conditioner as a curl cream instead. That worked for a while until I found THIS product.\n\nMy routine:\n\nStraight out of the shower, I wrap my hair in a microfibre cloth for about five minutes. After that while it’s still wet, I apply the cream all over (not all the way to the root) and use a coconut oil based hair oil on the ends. After that I let it air dry (diffusing and me just don’t get along LOL) and my hair has never looked better.\n\nI also use a Jamaican black castor oil hair mask once a week and ALWAYS sleep in a silk bonnet, which I’m sure has helped as well, but the cream is the real start of the show.\n\nI’d love to know if anyone else has used this product and what they think of it!",

      "content": "\nSo, I moved to Noida about four years ago — new job, new city, new life… and suddenly, new problem.\nMy hair started falling like crazy.\nLike actual bunches of hair every wash.\n\nI’ve had acne since my teens, but my parents always brushed it off like, “yeh toh normal hai.”\nOnce I started working, I finally decided — okay, no one’s coming to save me, I’ll figure this out myself.\n\nObviously, I started where everyone starts — YouTube and Instagram 😭.\nTried onion juice, rosemary oil, random “hair detox” tips from influencers.\nEvery reel felt like a new hope, and every shower felt like heartbreak.\n\nThen I realised — I’m actually going to go bald at this rate if I keep experimenting.\nSo began the hunt for a real dermatologist.\nAnd because I’m a typical social media junkie, I started with the ones who looked the most perfect online.\n\nDermat #1:\nThe “prettiest dermatologist” in South Delhi (you know the one whose husband’s also a social media star).\nWent to her for 3 months. She’s from one of those fancy private colleges, looks amazing on Instagram… but her treatment? Confusing.\nShe’d say one thing online, prescribe another in person.\nIt felt like she didn’t even believe in her own advice.\n\nDermat #2:\nNext was a senior male doctor from a big Delhi hospital.\nTotally arrogant. Didn’t listen, kept interrupting. Also, he was completely bald — I’m sorry, but that did not inspire confidence. 😐\n\nDermat #3:\nThen I tried the husband of one of the biggest dermatologists on Instagram.\nHe was good — calm, professional, actually explained things.\nBut their system was impossible. Getting an appointment was like applying for a visa. Truth was , on a weekday noon, which i always prefer, clinic was always empty.\nAnd when I finally got treated, I realised it was the same protocol most good dermats follow.\nNothing unique — just great packaging.\n\n\nDermat #4:\nBy now, I had learnt some lessons.\nSo I found a young dermatologist from a government college — she’d built her page around her degrees and her own acne journey. She was based in Hauz khas.\nI liked her vibe, but she was too cautious.\nShe kept saying my hair loss was normal, just fix your lifestyle.\nLike girl, my lifestyle is already squeaky clean — I needed help, not another “sleep more, drink water” lecture.\nShe waited months before starting anything real, and by then I was exhausted.\n\nFinally…\nOne of my office colleagues kept insisting I go to this low-profile dermatologist in Noida — someone who isn’t even on social media.\nI went with zero expectations, honestly just out of frustration.\nAnd that’s when it hit me — the really good doctors don’t have time for reels and filters. They’re busy doing actual work.\n\nIf you’ve read this far — thank you 🫶\nI just wanted to share this because I know how easy it is to get swayed by social media.\nAnd atleast someone should benefit from my own hard earned money funded research. 😀",

I wet my hair then add a detangler mixture (water &amp; skala &amp; Pacifica detangler) and pre-poo (African pride). Detangle my hair in sections. Usually I leave that in my hair for a little while. Then I shampoo (Native moisturizing or soapbox coconut oil bar), rinse, and put in hair mask/deep conditoner for like 5-10 minutes depending on which one. I will admit I’ve been over using my hair masks, oops. So now, I will be conditioning my hair instead of masking on most wash days. But other than that tweaking, what else can I do? Any general advice and product recommendations to reduce breakage for wavy/curlyish color treated hair? Specifically looking for brushes to detangle wet 2c hair. Included- a picture of my hair.

It never seems to be in stock where I am, they don’t ship to Canada, and whenever I do find a buy online option, it’s way too expensive. \n\nI’ve been trying other gels (ie. Curls Blueberry Bliss Control Jelly, Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Sculpting Gel, Eco Styler Olive Oil Gel) but they don’t give me the same hold/look. For example, the Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk only keeps hold for a day before my hair starts looking super frizzy and I usually like to leave 2-3 days between washes. \n\nMy current routine (I recently switched it up) is Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Shampoo and Conditioner. I use Curls Blueberry Bliss Leave-In Conditioner before gel (currently using Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Gel) and scrunch them both into damp hair in the shower before wrapping it up in a microfibre towel. I usually let it air dry after changing my clothes and doing skincare. And I wear a bonnet to bed and have a silk pillowcase. Not sure if people still subscribe to this, but I’ve been told I’m around 3A/B. \n\nAny and all suggestions are welcome, thank you so much! Let me know if there’s any other info I can provide that would help. ",

I also own BHA (Paula’s Choice) and Azelaic Acid, but I paused them for now.\n\nMy dermatologist prescribed Epiduo Forte to “clear everything up,” but honestly I’m hesitant — it feels like a strong treatment for relatively mild issues, and I don’t want to wreck my skin barrier unnecessarily 😅\n\nMy questions:\n\t•\tFor those with mild acne and PIE, did Epiduo Forte actually make a noticeable difference? Or was it overkill?\n\t•\tIf you did start Epiduo Forte, how did your skin react in the first weeks, and was it worth it?\n\t•\tAny alternatives or milder actives that worked well for PIE + light breakouts?\n\nI’d really appreciate any personal experiences or advice. 🙏\nRight now I’m torn between starting Epiduo slowly or just sticking to a simpler routine with actives I already know.\n\nThanks!\n",

I've come for a bit of help, maybe some advice during a slight bumo of my own. \n\nI did have acne as a teen, very bad, went on accutane. Throughout my 20s it had mostly cleared, some small bouts and antibiotics helped. Thirties very few and last year i had skin so clear it genuinely made me happy in and of itself. I eat relatively okay, not squeaky clean at weekends but overall nothing over the top. Meat, veg, some sandwiches here and there and some fried food at weekends. I don't drink. Im healthy, hygenic, pillows changed once a week. Essentially, since my \"clear year\" last year, nothing has changed, except for my skin. Im getting older obviously but all the same. \n\nI get rather large boil type acne when i do get it, the painful kind! Only on my face, generally on cheeks, nose and thay place between nose and eyes, you know the place! My skin is in a shambles at the moment. Large blackheads, oily nose each morning, one large spot on left cheek (painful), few smaller on right.\n\nRecently started using CeraVe Sa Smoothing cleanser at night for the past few weeks. Earlier in the year i used cetafil(?), and also tried The Ordinary Nicinamide plus Zinc to help my pores. I use CeraVe Facial Moisturising Lotion (PM), each day, have done for years. I also use Acnecide on fresh spots but that is hit or miss. And the doctor precribed me Epiduo this year but that didn't help at all. Wondering id the issue is inside rather than out but last year just made me super hopeful.\n\nAnyway, if you have read this far, im wondering if anybody has suggestions.

      "content": "\nSorry for long post, I just know long and descriptive posts helped me while I was researching to try and find solutions for my acne. \n All my issues started postpartum. Super painful and stubborn cystic zits. \n\nThis was all over a two year period. So I gave each new routine a good try. I tried sooo many cleansers, moisturizers, etc. Face reality is my solution!! \n\nPictures really don't capture how bad my skin really was. I also included a photo of my skin on the prescription Clindamycin that wrecked my skin. \nHere's everything I tried. Current routine at the end. \n\nWhat I was on pre pregnancy, during pregnancy and post pregnancy while breastfeeding. I had no skin issues while pregnant or before really. \n-Curology Azeliac Acid 10%, Clindamycin phosphate 1%, Niacinamide 4%, purpose face wash, and dermalogica gel moisturizer. \n\n9 months pp \n-I went to esthetician and was put on a Rhonda Allison Acne Remedies routine. Skin became dry, still breaking out. Blemishes progressively worse. \n\n13 months pp\n-Switched back to originally curology routine. Blemishes worsened. \n\n17 months pp. Went to dermatologist. stopped breastfeeding (my back acne improved after weaning) so I could try Spiro. I was desperate. \n-Tried for two weeks. Made me super sick and unwell. Went off of it. \n-Started on prescription topical.  cindamycin phosphate, adapalene\nand benzoyl peroxide) Topica Gel\n1.2%/0.15% /3.1%. \n-Tried multiple different moisturizers they recommended as well. I started slow on the topical like advised. It immediately was burning my face terribly. They told me it was normal 🙄 I tried the sandwich method, which helped. But my skin was still burning and dry after almost 6-7 weeks. I decided the derm was no help at all. \n\n\nSeptember 10th, 22 months pp, not even 5 weeks ago. \nWent to a different esthetician.  \nShe put me on a face reality routine. I was so skeptical after being put on so many different things. And was afraid I was just being sold something new. But what did I have to lose? \nWithin a week, my skin started responding. I did purge a little. Got very oily. Broke out in spots I've never broken out. She did tell me most of the hormonal break outs could be from months ago, so to hang in there. \nYou guys, it's freaking working!!!! \nMy new routine: \nAM (or after morning workout)\n-Ultra gentle gel cleanser \n-Calming Facial Toner\n-5% Mandelic serum\n-Cran-peptide cream \n\nPM\n-Ultra gentle gel cleaner \n-Calming facial Toner \n-2.5% advanced acne med (benzoyl peroxide) \n-Cran-peptide cream. \n \nThen, the Sulfur spot treatment as needed. This stuff is AMAZING. I use it daily and nightly. Whenever I feel something, I lather it on. It either makes the blemish disappear before coming to a head, or brings it quickly to the surface, where I can neatly extract it. Then I continue to spot treat it after popped and it scabs. Disappears SO FAST. My blemishes used to be so so PAINFUL and take a week to come to a head, then have to be popped like several days in a row, and then would stick around for weeks. \n\n\n",
