      "content": "Folks… run, don’t walk.\n\nThe Innersense quiet calm curl control cream has changed my hair’s life.\n\nI’ve never been a mousse person because I don’t love the way that it makes my hair feel crunchy and flat. Just my personal preference, but for years I’ve been using leave-in conditioner as a curl cream instead. That worked for a while until I found THIS product.\n\nMy routine:\n\nStraight out of the shower, I wrap my hair in a microfibre cloth for about five minutes. After that while it’s still wet, I apply the cream all over (not all the way to the root) and use a coconut oil based hair oil on the ends. After that I let it air dry (diffusing and me just don’t get along LOL) and my hair has never looked better.\n\nI also use a Jamaican black castor oil hair mask once a week and ALWAYS sleep in a silk bonnet, which I’m sure has helped as well, but the cream is the real start of the show.\n\nI’d love to know if anyone else has used this product and what they think of it!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "\nSo, I moved to Noida about four years ago — new job, new city, new life… and suddenly, new problem.\nMy hair started falling like crazy.\nLike actual bunches of hair every wash.\n\nI’ve had acne since my teens, but my parents always brushed it off like, “yeh toh normal hai.”\nOnce I started working, I finally decided — okay, no one’s coming to save me, I’ll figure this out myself.\n\nObviously, I started where everyone starts — YouTube and Instagram 😭.\nTried onion juice, rosemary oil, random “hair detox” tips from influencers.\nEvery reel felt like a new hope, and every shower felt like heartbreak.\n\nThen I realised — I’m actually going to go bald at this rate if I keep experimenting.\nSo began the hunt for a real dermatologist.\nAnd because I’m a typical social media junkie, I started with the ones who looked the most perfect online.\n\nDermat #1:\nThe “prettiest dermatologist” in South Delhi (you know the one whose husband’s also a social media star).\nWent to her for 3 months. She’s from one of those fancy private colleges, looks amazing on Instagram… but her treatment? Confusing.\nShe’d say one thing online, prescribe another in person.\nIt felt like she didn’t even believe in her own advice.\n\nDermat #2:\nNext was a senior male doctor from a big Delhi hospital.\nTotally arrogant. Didn’t listen, kept interrupting. Also, he was completely bald — I’m sorry, but that did not inspire confidence. 😐\n\nDermat #3:\nThen I tried the husband of one of the biggest dermatologists on Instagram.\nHe was good — calm, professional, actually explained things.\nBut their system was impossible. Getting an appointment was like applying for a visa. Truth was , on a weekday noon, which i always prefer, clinic was always empty.\nAnd when I finally got treated, I realised it was the same protocol most good dermats follow.\nNothing unique — just great packaging.\n\n\nDermat #4:\nBy now, I had learnt some lessons.\nSo I found a young dermatologist from a government college — she’d built her page around her degrees and her own acne journey. She was based in Hauz khas.\nI liked her vibe, but she was too cautious.\nShe kept saying my hair loss was normal, just fix your lifestyle.\nLike girl, my lifestyle is already squeaky clean — I needed help, not another “sleep more, drink water” lecture.\nShe waited months before starting anything real, and by then I was exhausted.\n\nFinally…\nOne of my office colleagues kept insisting I go to this low-profile dermatologist in Noida — someone who isn’t even on social media.\nI went with zero expectations, honestly just out of frustration.\nAnd that’s when it hit me — the really good doctors don’t have time for reels and filters. They’re busy doing actual work.\n\nIf you’ve read this far — thank you 🫶\nI just wanted to share this because I know how easy it is to get swayed by social media.\nAnd atleast someone should benefit from my own hard earned money funded research. 😀",

      "content": "Hey, Reddit.\n\nI have noticed the past couple years my hair is even thinner. It was always \"fine\" and was mid-back to butt-length for most of my life. I cut it super short like 6ish years ago, and it did appear thicker because of that.\n\nBut I'm growing it back out, and even compared to before-the-bob, I see a slightly worrying difference. Pictures are labeled with the years to compare. When it's down now, it's like 1-ply toilet paper compared to the 2-ply in my teens - you can see through it. I look like Gollum any time I sweat even a little.\n\nI have been trying to implement brushing less often and sleeping with a silk bonnet and a loose braid.\n\nI'm sure the reasons* for the thinning are multiple. Stress, nutrition, hormones, etc.\n\nAny tips on promoting healthy, thicker hair? It tends toward being dry. I wash 2-3x/week but I do work out and sometimes have to wash more often. I condition only the bottom, shampoo only the scalp. Did start using Blonde shampoo every few washes to bring my color out, less than a year ago, but it was thin before that.\n\nI clamp it with the towel, don't rub. I cut down on brushing it - maybe twice a day I brush. I don't own a hair dryer and don't have to straighten it because it sticks flat to my head already. No heat whatsoever.\n\nI don't use any other products on it. No mousse or hairspray or oils.\n\nNothing seems to really be helping. I have the thickest facial and arm hair on any woman I know 🙄 but my head is wilting for some reason.\n\nPlease help.\n",

It never seems to be in stock where I am, they don’t ship to Canada, and whenever I do find a buy online option, it’s way too expensive. \n\nI’ve been trying other gels (ie. Curls Blueberry Bliss Control Jelly, Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Sculpting Gel, Eco Styler Olive Oil Gel) but they don’t give me the same hold/look. For example, the Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk only keeps hold for a day before my hair starts looking super frizzy and I usually like to leave 2-3 days between washes. \n\nMy current routine (I recently switched it up) is Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Shampoo and Conditioner. I use Curls Blueberry Bliss Leave-In Conditioner before gel (currently using Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Gel) and scrunch them both into damp hair in the shower before wrapping it up in a microfibre towel. I usually let it air dry after changing my clothes and doing skincare. And I wear a bonnet to bed and have a silk pillowcase. Not sure if people still subscribe to this, but I’ve been told I’m around 3A/B. \n\nAny and all suggestions are welcome, thank you so much! Let me know if there’s any other info I can provide that would help. ",

      "content": "Hi all, 41 m here. I realise alot of you are struggling much worse than myself and i can say it does get better for sure. However sometimes there are bumps in the road. I've come for a bit of help, maybe some advice during a slight bumo of my own. \n\nI did have acne as a teen, very bad, went on accutane. Throughout my 20s it had mostly cleared, some small bouts and antibiotics helped. Thirties very few and last year i had skin so clear it genuinely made me happy in and of itself. I eat relatively okay, not squeaky clean at weekends but overall nothing over the top. Meat, veg, some sandwiches here and there and some fried food at weekends. I don't drink. Im healthy, hygenic, pillows changed once a week. Essentially, since my \"clear year\" last year, nothing has changed, except for my skin. Im getting older obviously but all the same. \n\nI get rather large boil type acne when i do get it, the painful kind! Only on my face, generally on cheeks, nose and thay place between nose and eyes, you know the place! My skin is in a shambles at the moment. Large blackheads, oily nose each morning, one large spot on left cheek (painful), few smaller on right.\n\nRecently started using CeraVe Sa Smoothing cleanser at night for the past few weeks. Earlier in the year i used cetafil(?), and also tried The Ordinary Nicinamide plus Zinc to help my pores. I use CeraVe Facial Moisturising Lotion (PM), each day, have done for years. I also use Acnecide on fresh spots but that is hit or miss. And the doctor precribed me Epiduo this year but that didn't help at all. Wondering id the issue is inside rather than out but last year just made me super hopeful.\n\nAnyway, if you have read this far, im wondering if anybody has suggestions. The painful acne knocks me for six. Really shatters my confidence and maybe somebody here has had similar issues and got past it. Some photos below. Thanks all. ",

Like teeth whitening or some kind of wrinkle cream, or lip plumping or… I don’t know, great shape wear? some kind of amazing bra?? I was thinking about getting a Brazilian blowout hair treatment, but I don’t know if people even do that anymore.

I’m about to be 41 and I feel like at 39 I started to have a more and more issues.\n\nI’ve done IPL and I liked the results but they were very brief.\n\nCurrently I’m using Vanicream Face Wash, a Vitamin C serum and I was using some retinol but it seemed to be causing some issues for me but I may have been using too much. I also thought maybe it was hyaluronic acid that seems to be in everything but wasn’t sure.\n\nI used Vanicream moisturizer for a few weeks but it seemed a little greasy and not working as needed so I’m currently using CeraVe moisturizer with hyaluronic acid to see if that helps and if I can rule it out as an issue.\n\nI used to drink but I don’t anymore and I live a pretty healthy lifestyle at this point. I know I can’t escape aging but I feel like it’s sort of hit me all at once and really want to improve my complexion. Any thoughts/recommendations would be very appreciated. Thanks everyone.",
