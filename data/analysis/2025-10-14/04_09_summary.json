It was exciting when Halsey did it, when Lady Gaga did it, when Selena Gomez did it - they were at the forefront. Now, I'm just... \"meh\" toward it all. It's just over-saturated. Every product is marketed as the latest \"new thing,\" but it's the exact same thing as the 13 different products before it. Not even Beyonce launching her own brand could excite me.\n\nI feel like smaller brands with *actual* incredible products are stuck in the background because of the millions going into marketing for celebrity brands. Granted, I'm in marketing and was a beauty editor for years, so perhaps this is also why I'm so *blah* these days - it's all the same advertising, every single time, just a different adjective or color. It's all been done before.\n\nAm I alone in this? Or are you under/overwhelmed by it all, too? And are there any new(er) brands (not  celebrity-founded) that are exciting you lately?",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

First time poster, long time lurker.\n\nSorry that this one is so long; I’m seeking some guidance as I’m new to this.\n\nI (F23) have never had any sort of skin care routine and I have finally taken measures to try and put something together.\n\nI am acne prone on my face, chest, and back, but don’t get breakouts regularly. Painful pimples here and there, with some that can get inflamed and persist for a while. Of course many years of this and not leaving them also have left me with minimal dark spots and scarring. I have oily type skin and take daily showers.\n\nThe assortment:\n\nI picked up a few things from The Ordinary:\n1. Salicylic Acid 0.5% Body Serum\n2. Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5\n3. Niacinamide 5% Face and Body Emulsion\n\nI also picked up a simple lotion:\n1. Vanicream Lite Lotion for sensitive skin\n\nAnd have a daily face wash:\n1. Cetaphil Derma Control Oil Removing Face Wash \n\nI intended to do these all mostly at night, as that works best for my routine and I think would keep me more disciplined about holding up the routine. I also have an assortment of daily SPF that I will work through from different brands that I do intend to use in the mornings.\n\nThe last thing I want to do is cause undo harm as my acne has toned down in my young adult years, so I’m really seeking some friendly advice.\n\nMy Questions:\n\n1. Are these the right items for me?\n2. If not, what should I get instead or add to this assortment?\n3. What order should I be using these things in?\n4. Any additional advice or concerns that maybe I’m not considering?\n\nThank you in advance for all of your help!",

      "content": "Hi! I'm not sure how to take care of my hair properly because my dad used to have curly hair which he passed to me but he no longer does because he cut it all off. I have dyed + bleached pink hair with most of my roots still showing and an undercut for my thick hair. My routine for showers (every 2-3 days) is below.\n\n\nI lather my roots w/ Native shampoo (I've heard good and bad things about native, so thats why I'm here) and I let the same brand of conditioner sit in my hair. I noticed that I lose a good bit of hair while using it but I am not sure if its because of my bleached ends or not. I scrunch it at the end of every shower and let it air dry. Usually if I take a shower at night I put it in a satin bonnet but sometimes I lay it out behind me on my pillowcase. My pillowcase is polyester. On occasion if I want my hair to be more defined I use a maui curl cream (I would prefer to find one that is less scented if possible?) If I forget to wash my hair for longer I use hairitage dry shampoo and leave in conditioner, but I rarely forget. I have motivation problems and so not all the products I use I have the will to use all the time. I also sometimes use argon oil from ogx because my dad recommended it. I also use the hairitage mane event spray if my hair is frizzy (it usually is but I dont always use it) but it does little to help. \n\n\nTLDR: Native shampoo + conditioner every 2-3 days, air dry, either lay on polyester pillowcase or put in bonnet, very rarely use other products (Hairitage mane event, Hairitage dry shampoo, Hairitage leave in conditioner, OGX argon oil, Maui coconut curl cream), have very frizzy and less defined curls that I want to fix with products that have little to no smell and have a short routine. Frequently brush out curls or try to add more water to enhance shape. \n\nPreferable to have cheapish products!! Any tips are welcome\n\nI also noticed after dying my hair a second time that my curls are still a bit looser!! It is now a hot pink color but I do not have good photos.",

For some reason it seems like now, my skin (even when it looks and feels moisturized) flakes/sheds/peels at random and I cannot figure out why. What else can cause this besides barrier damage? Out of an abundance of caution I stopped all actives for 2 months to see if it was my barrier, but nothing changed. I want to use my tret again because my skin doesn’t look nearly as good without it but I’m afraid to cause more issues. \n\nRoutine: \n\nMorning: Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, Inkey List Vitamin C every other day, Cerave Nighttime Moisturizer, Beauty of Joseon Rice Relief SPF50+\n\nNight: Softymo Oil Cleanser, Cerave Hudrating Cleanser, Tret every other day (on non-vitamin C days), Cerave Renewing Night Cream. \n\nAre there non barrier damage reasons for peeling?

During my teenage years my hair started gradually getting frizzy and curly, and now it’s super curly and the top strands are really frizzy. The hair at the back of my head is especially curly and tough to straighten. The front strands and top of my hair is a bit straighter. It’s been a tough adjustment bc I only know how to take care of my straight hair, and feel the need to blow dry it all the time to make it presentable. It’s so frizzy that I just can’t seem to do anything with it. I’ve only dyed it twice and have been using the k18 hair mask, but nothing seems to work. How can I fix the friziness especially in the top layers?  ",

Here’s my current routine:\n\n* I wet my hair in the shower every morning to detangle and restyle, but I only shampoo once a week. after words i use products listed below\n\n**Wash Day Products:**\n\n1. I use OUAI Clarifying Shampoo and Redavid Shampoo/ conditioner .\n2. For styling, I usually use AG Care Mousse, Amika Curl Cream, Amika Hair Oil, and sometimes a gel.\n3. After applying products, I wrap my hair in a 100% cotton turban to lock in moisture and let it air dry.\n\n**Problems I’ve Been Noticing:**\n\n* My curls don’t form all the way up to the root.\n* I’ve had more frizz than what I’d consider normal for curly hair.\n* I stopped clarifying weekly because I thought you were only supposed to do it once a month, and that’s when the dryness started getting worse.\n\nTo try to fix it, I bought the Pattern Leave-In Conditioner and the AG Care Snow Mushroom Moisture Mask. I just finished wash day and my hair still feels dry and frizzy. I usually go product-free for at least one day after wash day.\n\nAny tips or tricks would be super appreciated I'm happy to answer any questions I just want my curls to be healthy, happy, and bouncy again!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rer90g8b00vf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84dcb522cac8efe8e2533aad48eb9e41de499639\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rd0n22ub00vf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f239c18312f2a9825ada900dce24c549c3623e3\n\n",
