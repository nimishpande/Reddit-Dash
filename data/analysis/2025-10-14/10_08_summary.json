      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Cleansing+retinol+autism\n\nhey guys!\n\ni am autistic and i struggle A LOT to wash my face daily, due to high sensory sensitivity (I'd say i can cleanse it properly 2-3x/week)\n\nmy problem is with wet hands, water and cleansers on my face. I don't have problems with i.e. putting moisturizer on my face, seruns or spf.\n\nmy dermatologist started me on retinol (very happy) so i think need to have a better way to cleanse my face daily, even when i can't wash it properly (pleaseee if you don't understand my struggle, abstain from criticizing as this is a sensitive topic for me 🥹 i know the best way is to cleanse it so the skin is oil free to absorve the product!!!)\n\n1. currently, when i can't wash it PM, i use micellar water (a lot) on a cotton pad (doesn't need to rinse, doesn't foam, doesn't get sticky) and my face feels dry afterwards (in a good way!!! dry as in not oily) afterwards.  + moisturizer\n\n2. i can wash it with (just) water in the morning + spf\n\ndo you think this is enough to start retinol, considering my limitations? do you think it would be better to i.e. use a lukewarm wet microfiber cloth? with water and/or micellar water?\ndo you have any tips for alternatives like these?\n\nmy dermatologist is a busy guy, he just rushed me and I didn't have the opportunity to ask... i also think he would roll his eyes at me lol\n\nthanks a lot (◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠).♪✧⁠*♡",
