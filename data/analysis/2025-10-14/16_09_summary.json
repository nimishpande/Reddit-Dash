      "content": "26M here. I started balding around 18-20. It got really bad over time, but I started with minoxidil and finasteride, which helped me regrow a decent amount of hair and stabilize the loss. Last year, I got a great hair transplant, and now I have a high volume messy fringe.\n\nI literally went from almost invisible, like, when my hair was thinning and I tried to make it look better with stupid fades, to suddenly getting noticed and checked out often. People treat me better, with even cashier girls at supermarkets now being flirty and giggly at times, making conversations, mutual friends seem to show interest, currently talking to a girl rn, it’s like I became a completely different person. \n\nThe world feels completely different now.\n\nSure, rare few men may pull off bald looks, but for the majority of young men, having a thick, healthy head of hair really does make a massive difference.\n\nIf you’re in the early stages of hair loss, please don’t give in to the “just shave it and lift weights” advice or finasteride phobia, unless that's something you truly want. Start medication as soon as possible, the earlier the better.\n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "\nSo, I moved to Noida about four years ago — new job, new city, new life… and suddenly, new problem.\nMy hair started falling like crazy.\nLike actual bunches of hair every wash.\n\nI’ve had acne since my teens, but my parents always brushed it off like, “yeh toh normal hai.”\nOnce I started working, I finally decided — okay, no one’s coming to save me, I’ll figure this out myself.\n\nObviously, I started where everyone starts — YouTube and Instagram 😭.\nTried onion juice, rosemary oil, random “hair detox” tips from influencers.\nEvery reel felt like a new hope, and every shower felt like heartbreak.\n\nThen I realised — I’m actually going to go bald at this rate if I keep experimenting.\nSo began the hunt for a real dermatologist.\nAnd because I’m a typical social media junkie, I started with the ones who looked the most perfect online.\n\nDermat #1:\nThe “prettiest dermatologist” in South Delhi (you know the one whose husband’s also a social media star).\nWent to her for 3 months. She’s from one of those fancy private colleges, looks amazing on Instagram… but her treatment? Confusing.\nShe’d say one thing online, prescribe another in person.\nIt felt like she didn’t even believe in her own advice.\n\nDermat #2:\nNext was a senior male doctor from a big Delhi hospital.\nTotally arrogant. Didn’t listen, kept interrupting. Also, he was completely bald — I’m sorry, but that did not inspire confidence. 😐\n\nDermat #3:\nThen I tried the husband of one of the biggest dermatologists on Instagram.\nHe was good — calm, professional, actually explained things.\nBut their system was impossible. Getting an appointment was like applying for a visa. Truth was , on a weekday noon, which i always prefer, clinic was always empty.\nAnd when I finally got treated, I realised it was the same protocol most good dermats follow.\nNothing unique — just great packaging.\n\n\nDermat #4:\nBy now, I had learnt some lessons.\nSo I found a young dermatologist from a government college — she’d built her page around her degrees and her own acne journey. She was based in Hauz khas.\nI liked her vibe, but she was too cautious.\nShe kept saying my hair loss was normal, just fix your lifestyle.\nLike girl, my lifestyle is already squeaky clean — I needed help, not another “sleep more, drink water” lecture.\nShe waited months before starting anything real, and by then I was exhausted.\n\nFinally…\nOne of my office colleagues kept insisting I go to this low-profile dermatologist in Noida — someone who isn’t even on social media.\nI went with zero expectations, honestly just out of frustration.\nAnd that’s when it hit me — the really good doctors don’t have time for reels and filters. They’re busy doing actual work.\n\nIf you’ve read this far — thank you 🫶\nI just wanted to share this because I know how easy it is to get swayed by social media.\nAnd atleast someone should benefit from my own hard earned money funded research. 😀",

      "content": "For some ungodly reason, I (25F) can't get the breakout between my eyebrows to stop. This has been happening for probably 6 months now, just varying degrees of breakouts on and in between my eyebrows. I have no idea whats causing it. These aren't just whiteheads either, they never come to a head, I just have to ignore them. I've been getting extremely painful, huge blind pimples in the center of my eyebrows as well. Also pictured is the huge blind pimple on my temple. Those I just have to wait out.\n\nI haven't been to a dermatologist yet because there isn't a single one near me that has an opening. I've called and begged and nothing. I feel so defeated. I don't like going outside anymore because I'm so embarrassed of my acne and when I cover it up with makeup it looks and gets even worse. I dont know if this is cystic, hormonal or fungal. Every active I use makes it worse (salicylic and BP so far have irritated it and BHA drys me out). I dont even know what to do anymore. Trying anything new makes it angry and pop back up. I'm desperate though. Any advice or suggestions is welcome. I'll answer questions as best as possible, I wfh luckily so I'll be next to my phone all day.\n\nRoutine: \nAM- Splash with cold water and pat dry on a separate towel just for my face, apply Good Molecules Lightweight Daily Moisturizer, let it sink in and use Black Girl Sunscreen. I reapply sometimes but not always.\nPM- Wash face with the Vanicream Daily Cleanser. I don't dry my face and apply the Neutrogena Alcohol Free Toner with a cotton pad. This cleared up my skin a few weeks ago but it's since come back. After toner, I use the same Good Molecules moisturizer.\nThats it. I change my pillowcase every week and style my hair away from my face. Even after I'm done styling my hair, I make sure to splash water on my face just in case. I try not to touch my face with dirty hands and try to clean all my makeup brushes, applicators and tools after at least a couple of uses. I'm so close to just not doing anything at all. I cry every day about it.",

      "content": "Hello girls, I need some advice… I recently went to the hairdresser I’ve been seeing for a while and asked her to do a balayage refresh. It didn’t turn out how I expected — it looked quite dark in the salon, but I thought that after a few washes the toner would fade and it would look better. After washing my hair a few times and the toner faded, I noticed an orange patch in the middle of my hair. I told her about it, but she said it was my fault, that I didn’t take care of my hair properly, and that there’s nothing she can do except tone it again. She said she will not cover the repair of my hait and I’d only have to pay for the products. In the meantime, through a mutual acquaintance, I found out she spoke quite badly about me, so I didn’t feel comfortable going back to her (plus, what she suggested wouldn’t have been a long-term solution anyway — just another waste of money, since the first toner only lasted 2–3 washes).\n\nAnyway… the thing is, right now I can’t really afford a color correction, and I don’t think my hair could handle another bleaching session either. I tried using a Londa Londaplex toner, but it barely did anything.\n\nDo you have any advice? I was thinking of toning it myself at home with a toner mixed with a 1.9% developer (I honestly have no idea, I just saw it on TikTok 😅), but I’m not sure if it would come out even, since my hair has two different tones. Thank you so much for any tips! 💛",

      "content": "25M, My story is long but I will try to keep it short.\n\nI have been losing my hair in my areas since I was 18. I did a small transplant of 900 grafts on the gulfs at 22 years old.\n\nI didn't want to take finasteride until I realized I was really losing my hair.\n\nI decided to take a topical fin + min solution from sons in October 2024.\n\nIt was effective for 4 months (1st bottle) and the next 3 months were a disaster (I suspect the 2nd bottle was wrongly dosed).\n\nI stopped the solution (May 2025) because of a major anxiety attack following burnout + anxiety about losing my hair. I blamed finasteride and started psychobing day and night.\n\nI took blood tests to measure DHT (I know it's useless, vitamin D, ferritin)\n\nI had a vitamin D deficiency and a low ferritin level, so I took supplements from June 2025. I also decided to talk about my hair loss and he prescribed finasteride 1mg from the Bailleul laboratory.\n\nI started at .5mg the first month (July 2025) then at 1mg from August 2025.\n\nMy balls hurt in August but I decided to ignore it knowing full well that it is a common but temporary side effect.\n\nI had an increase in libido the first 2 weeks of taking it (normal because it increases the level of Testo temporarily) and I had a small drop in libido in August.\n\nIn September my libido seemed to return to normal (I stopped porn and limited wanking to 3x per week instead of 2x per day) and well I can tell you that I get hard like a horse when I wake up, in short.\n\nI forgot to specify that I take oral min 2.5mg which I bought online from a London pharmacy. Oral minoxidil is incredible, I was never a big responder in topical format (even with tretinoin) and it gave me greasy + itchy hair.\n\nOral Minox is a miracle I have the impression and no side effects so cool, apart from the hairs which grow faster and the eyebrows fuller.\n\nIMPORTANT: I ​​had a tricho test in a clinic (CRLab), I recommend because we were able to determine where my itching was coming from under the microscope.\n\nI have a form of dermatitis (a lot of sebum which has accumulated in the scalp) so I have to exfoliate and use anti-oily dandruff shampoo. I started treatment 2 weeks ago (2x per week), I will keep you updated.\n\nps: You should know that combing my hair helped me a lot, regulated sebum and removed the impurities that remained on my scalp. I no longer wet my head when I take the shower, (only for shampooing twice/week) before I rinsed my hair every day.\n\nI lost around 50 - 150 hairs a day while combing my hair. Now I only lose about ten.\n\nI see a huge progression in the quality of my hair and density, I no longer need to do a 2nd transplant for the moment.\n\nAnyway, enough talking, here are the photos.",
