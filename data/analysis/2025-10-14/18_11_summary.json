      "content": "26M here. I started balding around 18-20. It got really bad over time, but I started with minoxidil and finasteride, which helped me regrow a decent amount of hair and stabilize the loss. Last year, I got a great hair transplant, and now I have a high volume messy fringe.\n\nI literally went from almost invisible, like, when my hair was thinning and I tried to make it look better with stupid fades, to suddenly getting noticed and checked out often. People treat me better, with even cashier girls at supermarkets now being flirty and giggly at times, making conversations, mutual friends seem to show interest, currently talking to a girl rn, it’s like I became a completely different person. \n\nThe world feels completely different now.\n\nSure, rare few men may pull off bald looks, but for the majority of young men, having a thick, healthy head of hair really does make a massive difference.\n\nIf you’re in the early stages of hair loss, please don’t give in to the “just shave it and lift weights” advice or finasteride phobia, unless that's something you truly want. Start medication as soon as possible, the earlier the better.\n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "\nSo, I moved to Noida about four years ago — new job, new city, new life… and suddenly, new problem.\nMy hair started falling like crazy.\nLike actual bunches of hair every wash.\n\nI’ve had acne since my teens, but my parents always brushed it off like, “yeh toh normal hai.”\nOnce I started working, I finally decided — okay, no one’s coming to save me, I’ll figure this out myself.\n\nObviously, I started where everyone starts — YouTube and Instagram 😭.\nTried onion juice, rosemary oil, random “hair detox” tips from influencers.\nEvery reel felt like a new hope, and every shower felt like heartbreak.\n\nThen I realised — I’m actually going to go bald at this rate if I keep experimenting.\nSo began the hunt for a real dermatologist.\nAnd because I’m a typical social media junkie, I started with the ones who looked the most perfect online.\n\nDermat #1:\nThe “prettiest dermatologist” in South Delhi (you know the one whose husband’s also a social media star).\nWent to her for 3 months. She’s from one of those fancy private colleges, looks amazing on Instagram… but her treatment? Confusing.\nShe’d say one thing online, prescribe another in person.\nIt felt like she didn’t even believe in her own advice.\n\nDermat #2:\nNext was a senior male doctor from a big Delhi hospital.\nTotally arrogant. Didn’t listen, kept interrupting. Also, he was completely bald — I’m sorry, but that did not inspire confidence. 😐\n\nDermat #3:\nThen I tried the husband of one of the biggest dermatologists on Instagram.\nHe was good — calm, professional, actually explained things.\nBut their system was impossible. Getting an appointment was like applying for a visa. Truth was , on a weekday noon, which i always prefer, clinic was always empty.\nAnd when I finally got treated, I realised it was the same protocol most good dermats follow.\nNothing unique — just great packaging.\n\n\nDermat #4:\nBy now, I had learnt some lessons.\nSo I found a young dermatologist from a government college — she’d built her page around her degrees and her own acne journey. She was based in Hauz khas.\nI liked her vibe, but she was too cautious.\nShe kept saying my hair loss was normal, just fix your lifestyle.\nLike girl, my lifestyle is already squeaky clean — I needed help, not another “sleep more, drink water” lecture.\nShe waited months before starting anything real, and by then I was exhausted.\n\nFinally…\nOne of my office colleagues kept insisting I go to this low-profile dermatologist in Noida — someone who isn’t even on social media.\nI went with zero expectations, honestly just out of frustration.\nAnd that’s when it hit me — the really good doctors don’t have time for reels and filters. They’re busy doing actual work.\n\nIf you’ve read this far — thank you 🫶\nI just wanted to share this because I know how easy it is to get swayed by social media.\nAnd atleast someone should benefit from my own hard earned money funded research. 😀",

I did a small transplant of 900 grafts on the gulfs at 22 years old.\n\nI didn't want to take finasteride until I realized I was really losing my hair.\n\nI decided to take a topical fin + min solution from sons in October 2024.\n\nIt was effective for 4 months (1st bottle) and the next 3 months were a disaster (I suspect the 2nd bottle was wrongly dosed).\n\nI stopped the solution (May 2025) because of a major anxiety attack following burnout + anxiety about losing my hair. I blamed finasteride and started psychobing day and night.\n\nI took blood tests to measure DHT (I know it's useless, vitamin D, ferritin)\n\nI had a vitamin D deficiency and a low ferritin level, so I took supplements from June 2025. I also decided to talk about my hair loss and he prescribed finasteride 1mg from the Bailleul laboratory.\n\nI started at .5mg the first month (July 2025) then at 1mg from August 2025.\n\nMy balls hurt in August but I decided to ignore it knowing full well that it is a common but temporary side effect.\n\nI had an increase in libido the first 2 weeks of taking it (normal because it increases the level of Testo temporarily) and I had a small drop in libido in August.\n\nIn September my libido seemed to return to normal (I stopped porn and limited wanking to 3x per week instead of 2x per day) and well I can tell you that I get hard like a horse when I wake up, in short.\n\nI forgot to specify that I take oral min 2.5mg which I bought online from a London pharmacy. Oral minoxidil is incredible, I was never a big responder in topical format (even with tretinoin) and it gave me greasy + itchy hair.\n\nOral Minox is a miracle I have the impression and no side effects so cool, apart from the hairs which grow faster and the eyebrows fuller.\n\nIMPORTANT: I ​​had a tricho test in a clinic (CRLab), I recommend because we were able to determine where my itching was coming from under the microscope.\n\nI have a form of dermatitis (a lot of sebum which has accumulated in the scalp) so I have to exfoliate and use anti-oily dandruff shampoo. I started treatment 2 weeks ago (2x per week), I will keep you updated.\n\nps: You should know that combing my hair helped me a lot, regulated sebum and removed the impurities that remained on my scalp. I no longer wet my head when I take the shower, (only for shampooing twice/week) before I rinsed my hair every day.\n\nI lost around 50 - 150 hairs a day while combing my hair. Now I only lose about ten.\n\nI see a huge progression in the quality of my hair and density, I no longer need to do a 2nd transplant for the moment.\n\nAnyway, enough talking, here are the photos.",

It never seems to be in stock where I am, they don’t ship to Canada, and whenever I do find a buy online option, it’s way too expensive. \n\nI’ve been trying other gels (ie. Curls Blueberry Bliss Control Jelly, Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Sculpting Gel, Eco Styler Olive Oil Gel) but they don’t give me the same hold/look. For example, the Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk only keeps hold for a day before my hair starts looking super frizzy and I usually like to leave 2-3 days between washes. \n\nMy current routine (I recently switched it up) is Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Shampoo and Conditioner. I use Curls Blueberry Bliss Leave-In Conditioner before gel (currently using Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Gel) and scrunch them both into damp hair in the shower before wrapping it up in a microfibre towel. I usually let it air dry after changing my clothes and doing skincare. And I wear a bonnet to bed and have a silk pillowcase. Not sure if people still subscribe to this, but I’ve been told I’m around 3A/B. \n\nAny and all suggestions are welcome, thank you so much!

That worked for a while until I found THIS product.\n\nMy routine:\n\nStraight out of the shower, I wrap my hair in a microfibre cloth for about five minutes. After that while it’s still wet, I apply the cream all over (not all the way to the root) and use a coconut oil based hair oil on the ends. After that I let it air dry (diffusing and me just don’t get along LOL) and my hair has never looked better.\n\nI also use a Jamaican black castor oil hair mask once a week and ALWAYS sleep in a silk bonnet, which I’m sure has helped as well, but the cream is the real start of the show.\n\nI’d love to know if anyone else has used this product and what they think of it!",

I've now been on finasteride for about six years and minoxidil for around four and up until now, I haven’t had any issues. However, recently I’ve noticed a significant increase in shedding and an itch has started (Maybe DHT itch?) - this has been going on for a week now. \n\nI occasionally get dandruff from minoxidil (Sons spray) and I used to wash my hair twice a week. Nothing major has changed in my diet or lifestyle. I did recently start a business, but I don’t feel particularly stressed. I am working fully remote behind a desk now and so I'm no longer working outdoors. The weather is also getting colder so I’m wondering if that could be a factor. I've now started micro needing once a week and only today have I started using Nizoral Shampoo (2% ketoconazole) again. I also wash my hair every other day now to keep my scalp clean. \n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? Could this just be a normal shedding phase that’s long overdue, or is it possible that balding has started to catch up again and I’m losing the hair I managed to maintain these past six years? Should I consider switching to dutasteride?\n\nI am eventually looking at getting a hair transplant. Ideally I wanted to wait another 5 years but I'm not sure I'll have any hair left, It might be next year now but I'll still need to stop whatever is happening to me.\n\nAny help is hugely appreciated.
