      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Every product is marketed as the latest \"new thing,\" but it's the exact same thing as the 13 different products before it. Not even Beyonce launching her own brand could excite me.\n\nI feel like smaller brands with *actual* incredible products are stuck in the background because of the millions going into marketing for celebrity brands. Granted, I'm in marketing and was a beauty editor for years, so perhaps this is also why I'm so *blah* these days - it's all the same advertising, every single time, just a different adjective or color. It's all been done before.\n\nAm I alone in this? Or are you under/overwhelmed by it all, too? And are there any new(er) brands (not  celebrity-founded) that are exciting you lately?",

      "content": "Hi! I'm not sure how to take care of my hair properly because my dad used to have curly hair which he passed to me but he no longer does because he cut it all off. I have dyed + bleached pink hair with most of my roots still showing and an undercut for my thick hair. My routine for showers (every 2-3 days) is below.\n\n\nI lather my roots w/ Native shampoo (I've heard good and bad things about native, so thats why I'm here) and I let the same brand of conditioner sit in my hair. I noticed that I lose a good bit of hair while using it but I am not sure if its because of my bleached ends or not. I scrunch it at the end of every shower and let it air dry. Usually if I take a shower at night I put it in a satin bonnet but sometimes I lay it out behind me on my pillowcase. My pillowcase is polyester. On occasion if I want my hair to be more defined I use a maui curl cream (I would prefer to find one that is less scented if possible?) If I forget to wash my hair for longer I use hairitage dry shampoo and leave in conditioner, but I rarely forget. I have motivation problems and so not all the products I use I have the will to use all the time. I also sometimes use argon oil from ogx because my dad recommended it. I also use the hairitage mane event spray if my hair is frizzy (it usually is but I dont always use it) but it does little to help. \n\n\nTLDR: Native shampoo + conditioner every 2-3 days, air dry, either lay on polyester pillowcase or put in bonnet, very rarely use other products (Hairitage mane event, Hairitage dry shampoo, Hairitage leave in conditioner, OGX argon oil, Maui coconut curl cream), have very frizzy and less defined curls that I want to fix with products that have little to no smell and have a short routine. Frequently brush out curls or try to add more water to enhance shape. \n\nPreferable to have cheapish products!! Any tips are welcome\n\nI also noticed after dying my hair a second time that my curls are still a bit looser!! It is now a hot pink color but I do not have good photos.",

      "title": "Feeling hopeless about my skin after two rounds of Accutane and have no idea what to do about my acne and textured skin, please help [Acne]",
      "content": "Hello all!\n\nI am in serious need of advice about what to do about my skin. I am 25F and feel like I've exhausted all options for my skin and I just don't know what to do. Emotionally and mentally I'm feeling devastated and that I am just destined for problematic skin which is painful to even think about.\n\nTo keep a long story somewhat short, I started getting acne at age 12, every single kind; blackheads, whiteheads, cysts, closed comedones, etc. I have tried countless topicals, skincare routines, diets, estheticians, supplements, pills you name it nothing ever solved my issues.\n\nEverything relevant I've tried over the years: Cutting out dairy/sugar, Being vegan for a year, Birth Control, Spironolactone, Salicylic Acid, Benzyl Peroxide, Clindamycin/Benzyl Peroxide cream, Epiduo, Monthly Esthetician visits, Did a 3-month \"Acne Bootcamp\", Adapalene, Tretinoin both gel and cream form, Minocycline, Supplements, \"All natural skincare\", and finally Accutane!\n\nMy first round of Accutane was in 2022 and it cleared my skin beautifully, I had skin that I never imagined I could have. No active breakouts, minimal texture, smooth feeling skin, smaller pores and finally I was able to clear the years of hyperpigmentation. My skin was beautiful, glowing, smooth, my confidence was through the roof. I just felt so \"free\", I wasn't constantly worried about how my skin looked in certain lighting, my skin didn't feel icky or congested. I wasn't oily anymore, I just had smooth normal looking skin, everything I wanted!\n\nFast forward to August 2024 I noticed my skin was getting oily again and closed comedones/texture returning, instead of experimenting with topicals I did a second course of Accutane starting in September 2024. This course ending up being stronger than my last. I got all the way up 80mg for one month while I only ever got to 40mg on my first. Once again my skin cleared up beautifully but I experienced hair loss :( so not great, which I'm still dealing with today. I lost a lot of density all throughout my hair and am still experiencing significant shedding. Now to make matters worse not even three months after finishing my skin began ramping up oil again and little bumps started popping up.\n\nSo instead of trying to fix the issue on my own I went back to my Derm and they prescribed me Arazlo lotion, which I have been using for a month. The issue is my skin is not doing well, what started as a few small bumps is now reminiscent of my skin pre-Accutane. I have a cluster of whiteheads on my chin which I haven't experienced since before my first round, lots of congestion, bumps, texture and now dark marks being left behind. It feels like years of progress is going down the drain.\n\nMy skin feels both dry and oily and sticky, like I can feel my pores getting clogged. But what really bothers me the most is the overall texture of my skin, it's is bumpy and rough like the entire surface of my skin is textured. My pores look massive and I feel like the condition of my skin makes me look older than my age. I am worried that if my skin looks like this now as I get older these issues will get worse.\n\nAccutane was the only thing that gave me semi normal skin texture wise but I guess it's only temporary for me. I just don't know what to do to that will give me skin I feel confident and comfortable with. I feel like there's no point in me even trying it's like my skin is resistant to being nice. If anyone has any advice on what I should do, or consider doing. I don't want this to be my skin forever or get worse with age.\n\nAM Routine:\n\nWash face with cold water\n\nApply Tizo Photoceutical AM Replenish Lightly Tinted SPF 40 or TiZO 3 Facial Mineral Sunscreen and Primer Tinted SPF40 or Face Reality SPF 30 Plus\n\nPM Routine:\n\nWash face with cool water and Vanicream Gentle Cleanser\n\nApply Face Reality Barrier Care Gel Cream\n\nApply Arazlo 3x a week without moisturizer",

I also use EltaMD UV Clear Sunscreen in the daytime after I put on my Vanicream.\n\nI would deeply appreciate any tips or recommendations if I should change my routine or try something else.",

I did have irritation with the skin1004 centella spf with makes me think I’m slightly allergic to niacinamide(was fine on forehead not on cheecks). I have enlarged pores on my cheecks and a quite a few closed comodomes. The lines of a damaged barrier/dehydration are noticeable and on my cheek. My skin feels abit dull. It’s been like this for some time (due to me being stupid with a retinol and salycitic acids a few months ago) and Ik it’s to do with barrier repair(I think). While I’ve reduced my acne I’ve not noticed improvement on the lines and enlarged pores. I still get some acne and hyperpigmentation which takes a while to recover (not bad but great either) I’m quite acne prone so the lrp b5, austura 365 and even Vaseline breaks me out. Cetaphil gentle cleanser has some niacinamide? What products what u recommend or what should i cut because this is getting exhausting 😭should’ve never touched a retinol.",

Our current routine is using the marc anthony aragan oil  shampoo and conditioner, but that's it. We don't use anything after, and we usually airdry our hair. Our hair turns out frizzy and not that nice, mostly my sister though. My sister has higher porosity hair and i have a lower porosity. My sister has also undergone keratine before. This is our first time trying out hair products and we really want it to  go well. Also a bonnet isn't in our current budget and also no store close to us has one so if this brand is good, does anyone know how to preserve the curls overnigth? Also i have like 2b/c hair and my sister has like 3a hair. We both have thick hair, my sister's is thicker and both our hair is dry. Any review is good and apriciayex!\n\nEdit: My sister has low porosity hair.

I started off with 0.5 but recently realized that my skin doesn’t handle it especially when I am using azelaic acid along with it, so I moved to 0.025%.

      "content": "Hello curly-headed people! I’m new to the curly-hair scene and I’m looking for advice. A couple years ago I discovered that I had 2B/2C waves. When i discovered this my hair was significantly shorter, just past my chin, and so I started using products to help manage my hair and promote my waves. My routine has pretty much stayed the same, but i’ll go into more depth below. I’m looking for advice to help promote my wavy hair. As it has grown out i’ve noticed that the longer it gets the harder it is for my curls to form/stay in place without being stretched out, and I find a lot of products either don’t provide enough hold for my hair and it ends up frizzy, or my hair is weighed down and my roots look super flat. Below is my routine:\n\nFor wash day (3x a week bc my scalp gets greasy) I use Pantene smooth and sleek shampoo &amp; conditioner, then rinse and brush in the shower. Then I use NotYourMothers curl cream (rake and scrunch in while still dripping) followed up by the Herbal Essences Mousse (the one in the purple can, raked and scrunched in), and then follow it up with the L.A. looks extreme sport gel (raked and then scrunched in, used liberally). I tend to put one of those root volumizing clips at my roots for more volume, and then I either diffuse or air dry, letting the cast dry and then scrunching out with 100% jojoba oil. The problem I’ve run into is that my hair looks less and less defined as it’s gotten longer, and I’m not sure if it is the products weighing it down or just the weight of my hair itself. Also, diffusing tends to make my hair look very curly, but after 10 minutes all the curls tend to stretch out before give even broken the gel cast. Any tips?\n\nEdit: I don’t tend to plop my hair or move it around much while it’s drying, as it tends to make my hair frizzy and I lose my part really easy. I have to break up the cast in order to get my part back.",
