      "content": "3 months progress on 1mg Oral Finasteride and 5ml Topical Minoxidil. I micro-needle every 7-10 days or so. I also take cheap vitamin tablets: biotin, vitamin D, iron and zinc (have no idea if they do anything).\n\nBalding slowly since my late 20’s diffusively and never did anything about it until now.\n\n1st pic (wish I’d taken better pics) is the evening after I’d micro needled earlier in the day ready for the first minoxidil application. I went pretty hard, that’s why there’s loads of tiny scabs. I don’t really get scabs like that anymore, my scalp must of gotten used to the abuse.\n\n2nd pic is earlier today in bright sunshine. My hair’s a little greasy from min still but thought it was good light.\n\nAs you can see I was pretty far gone, probably Norwood 6/7. I didn’t really expect any kind of result but had nothing to lose. I was kind of amazed to see loads of tiny hairs pop up within probably the first 12 days. I never expected to get much regrowth due to my age and how long the hair had been gone, let alone as much as this in the first 3 months. I just hope the progress continues, the new hairs are small and fine like a new born baby’s but I have coverage over the entire scalp where it was practically slick bald. Best case scenario is that they continue to mature and I start to have the near appearance \nof a normal head of hair (though reminding myself to be positive yet realistic). Wish me luck and I hope this gives someone as far gone as me a little hope that some progress is possible, like so many other peoples posts have given me. Wish I’d known about these meds when I was younger!\n\nWill probably do an update later down the line.\n",

      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "It has officially been over a year since I've started this journey. At first I started using liquid minoxidil for the first 4 months and the effects the liquid had on me were really rough. I had skin flare ups, bad rashes and I had to stop. After a month break I switched to Foam the generic brand from Walmart. And since then I haven't had any issues with side effects pertaining to rashes or hot spots. I have not had any issues with finasteride what's so ever. Sexual libido is great and have had no issues. Only common thing is with the semen to be watery at times but most of the time it is normal. I've taken to vitamins on and off. At first I did microneedle but due to the fact that I have sensitive skin it would bother me from time to time and then I stopped. I know I still have a long journey ahead but I'm surprised to see these changes. I am considering in doing a HT in the near future just bc I still have less volume on top since it's still thin. I get my haircuts on the side to make it look not as light on top. I've learned alot throughout this community and I'm glad I gave my hair a chance I really wish I would've done this sooner at least 5 years ago when my hair was really thinning out throughout that time I buzzed my head. This is my first year that I've \"grown out\" my hair and I haven't felt this happy in long time. I shall keep you guys posted throughout my journey. Best of luck to all ",

In fact, they decided to divorce on an early birthday trip that she planned for herself and her husband (soon to be ex, thank god), she ended the trip early and flew home alone :(\n\nShe deserves and deserved a hell of a lot better of a husband, father, and partner than that piece of garbage, and she has been in a bad place for years due to their marital strife. I’d like to send her a really nice and thoughtful gift for her birthday, as she loves all things beauty (hair, skin, makeup, everything!). I live abroad so I can’t peep in her bathroom to see what brands she likes, and it would be suspicious to start asking if she’s been liking anything new lately! She is blonde and has fair skin, if that makes a difference for suggestions! Alternatively, if you have gone through a divorce, what has been a thoughtful gift you received from a friend? I know this is going to be a hard day for her, and I want to support her and show her how loved and special she is! Grateful for any and all suggestions. Budget is $150 if that helps! ",

I found that what I was after at the time was a scalp bleach, and began doing it myself for about 8/10 months. I didn't mind the tone I achieved although not great I wasn't unhappy with the way it looked considering I was doing it myself.\n\nAfter a while it became too much upkeep, especially considering my roots were so dark. I went to a salon and explained this, that I wanted to go back dark. I wasn't really happy with how ashy it was. I ended up dying over it with a brown box dye (I know, I know) and do so for about 6 months.\n\nRecently, I decided I wanted to go back blonde. I knew it would be a while to get there due to the colour in my hair. The hairdresser recommended full head of balayage due to me not wanting to come in to the salon every 8 weeks (I had originally asked for a full head of foils). I went through with the balayge and felt it lifted quite well considering but there was definitely still warmth which is understandable. \n\nI have now had 3 full heads of balayage foils (spaced over 10/12 weeks each time) and I feel like I need more blonde then I have, especially towards my roots.\n\nI suppose the advice I'm looking for is, do I continue with Balayage or do I opt for a full head foils and a root tap/smudge/melt so that my regrowth isn't as noticeable? \n\nMy goal is to be as blonde as possible, with a small blended root.\n\nAm I being too picky/unrealistic? 😂 thanks so much for reading it all 😁",

I find that gel moisturizers are best for my skin because it gets oily, but it also needs hydration or else I get flaky. I use the Red Bean water gel by Beauty of Joseon. I’ve tried many products in the past, including topicals, but I find that they irritate my skin and would make me break out. I’ve kept my routine as simple as possible, and my skin has gotten better. My skin is better, but not exactly good, or where I want it to be. My skin used to be really bad, I had hormonal cystic acne on my cheeks, chin and jawline specifically. Nowadays I still get an occasional pimple, sometimes I break out a lot especially before my period or when I’m not consistent with my skincare routine. (Or when I start picking at my face and spreading it lol) For the most part, I would like to minimize the redness on my face, while also preventing acne and fading scars. I would be open to any suggestions \n\nI do also have a question- I am 20F, is it a good idea to start using anti aging products like retinols? Or is it a bad idea if my skin is sensitive? My skin isn’t super sensitive, but it can get irritated easily. ",

      "content": "hello, I am in mid 20s, and I have been diagnosed with LPP.  I have suffered from severe clinical depression and was put on heavy doses on anti depressants. Due to this I have faced rapid weight gain and hyperpigmemtation.  The pigmentation started showing and worsening after I finished the course of anti depressants.  Now it has worsened and this has given me extremely low confidence,  to the point I hate my face,  and have stopped looking in the mirror. I have tried medication and ointment prescribed to be by my AIIMS dermat but its too slow to work on. I can live like this. I am planning to go for laser treatment for pigmentation reduction and seek advice on the same. I want to know its efficacy, how many sessions will it take to see visible results, etc as I am completely new to this. \n\nI am planning to get the procedure done in Surat, gujarat,  hence if anyone can suggest me a good dermat with reasonable prices it would be really helpful.

I have pretty flat/straight hair. I've done some research and keep hearing lots of different things like sea salt spray and other stuff but I don't really understand. Can anyone recommend specific products to get my hair like this? Something that will make it slightly wavy to stay in place. Also, any advice about a routine would be greatly appreciated as I do not know anything about blow drying, specific product use order etc.",
