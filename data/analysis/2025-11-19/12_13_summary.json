      "content": "3 months progress on 1mg Oral Finasteride and 5ml Topical Minoxidil. I micro-needle every 7-10 days or so. I also take cheap vitamin tablets: biotin, vitamin D, iron and zinc (have no idea if they do anything).\n\nBalding slowly since my late 20’s diffusively and never did anything about it until now.\n\n1st pic (wish I’d taken better pics) is the evening after I’d micro needled earlier in the day ready for the first minoxidil application. I went pretty hard, that’s why there’s loads of tiny scabs. I don’t really get scabs like that anymore, my scalp must of gotten used to the abuse.\n\n2nd pic is earlier today in bright sunshine. My hair’s a little greasy from min still but thought it was good light.\n\nAs you can see I was pretty far gone, probably Norwood 6/7. I didn’t really expect any kind of result but had nothing to lose. I was kind of amazed to see loads of tiny hairs pop up within probably the first 12 days. I never expected to get much regrowth due to my age and how long the hair had been gone, let alone as much as this in the first 3 months. I just hope the progress continues, the new hairs are small and fine like a new born baby’s but I have coverage over the entire scalp where it was practically slick bald. Best case scenario is that they continue to mature and I start to have the near appearance \nof a normal head of hair (though reminding myself to be positive yet realistic). Wish me luck and I hope this gives someone as far gone as me a little hope that some progress is possible, like so many other peoples posts have given me. Wish I’d known about these meds when I was younger!\n\nWill probably do an update later down the line.\n",

      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "It has officially been over a year since I've started this journey. At first I started using liquid minoxidil for the first 4 months and the effects the liquid had on me were really rough. I had skin flare ups, bad rashes and I had to stop. After a month break I switched to Foam the generic brand from Walmart. And since then I haven't had any issues with side effects pertaining to rashes or hot spots. I have not had any issues with finasteride what's so ever. Sexual libido is great and have had no issues. Only common thing is with the semen to be watery at times but most of the time it is normal. I've taken to vitamins on and off. At first I did microneedle but due to the fact that I have sensitive skin it would bother me from time to time and then I stopped. I know I still have a long journey ahead but I'm surprised to see these changes. I am considering in doing a HT in the near future just bc I still have less volume on top since it's still thin. I get my haircuts on the side to make it look not as light on top. I've learned alot throughout this community and I'm glad I gave my hair a chance I really wish I would've done this sooner at least 5 years ago when my hair was really thinning out throughout that time I buzzed my head. This is my first year that I've \"grown out\" my hair and I haven't felt this happy in long time. I shall keep you guys posted throughout my journey. Best of luck to all ",

Almost exactly like Mr Jekyll and Dr Hyde. Or a werewolf.\n\nI've resisted the urges many times, however, some days it's too powerful and I end up sucking D in a gas station/motel while dressed up like Sabrina Carpenter (specifically). This used to happen like a couple times a month most, but it's gone up to 3x.\n\nMy question is, what causes us to do this? And how do we resit/kill the urge? I tried transcendental meditation, but it's losing its effectiveness and I'm worried it's going to escalate to butt stuff and beyond.\n\nI don't watch porn, drink, smoke or do drugs. And this only happens after I take the fin pill (1mg in the evening) and fades away by the next morning if I resist, the rest of the day it doesn't exist and I'm 100% a normal, typical person. so I'm pretty sure it's finasteride (1mg) causing my dark second personality.\n\nI read on hairlosstalk this is a moderately common problem? Thoughts?\n\nTLDR: almost every time I take finasteride (1mg) daily, I have an intense urge to suck dick in a motel while dressed up like Sabrina carpenter, what do I do?

She also has rosacea, so anything to help with the redness would be helpful too.\n\nSome things I've looked up that I'm considering getting her include:\n\nLED mask - I've seen these generally rated well for skin care but do I have to buy a $500 one or will the $100 Amazon ones work just as well?\n\nRetinol - this always seems to be the highest rated product, but I have no clue what specific product with retinol in it to get. There are like a million creams and serums that say retinol. Which one is best?\n\nIce roller - these seem to be inexpensive, but I've seen them rated high for the puffy eye bags. Do they work? Any recommendations on a specific one?\n\nAny other suggestions for anti-aging creams/serums are welcome too. As for budget, we're not exactly rich, but I'm not afraid of dropping $100 on a serum or something for her, but I don't want to spend that on the wrong thing. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!

The new facewash seemed to mess up my skin barrier, so I went back to my old one — but now I can’t remember how I used to wash my face and I’m not getting the same results.\n\nQuick facts:\n\n* I tested different timing methods (2 min / 90s / 60s).\n* New facewash made my skin barrier feel damaged.\n* Went back to old facewash but don’t remember the exact steps/technique I used before.\n* I want a clear, simple, step-by-step routine: how long to lather, how many seconds to massage, water temp, tools, follow up (moisturizer, sunscreen), frequency, etc.\n\nPlease tell me exactly how YOU wash your face, step-by-step. I want simple, practical timings and tips I can follow.\n\nMy ideal answer would include:\n\n1. What to do in the morning vs night.\n2. How to prep (wet face / wet hands).\n3. How much cleanser (pea size? coin size?).\n4. How long to rub/emulsify in hands and how long to massage on face (seconds).\n5. How long to rinse and what water temp to use.\n6. Drying + how soon to apply moisturizer.\n7. If I should use double cleanse (when) and any immediate do’s/don’ts if my barrier is damaged.\n8. Any quick product-type suggestions (gentle, low-foam, fragrance-free) — nothing brand-specific if possible.\n\nExtra info that might help you help me:\n\n* I don’t want medical advice — just routine tips. If it’s serious I’ll see a doc.\n* I’m trying to fix my skin barrier fast and get back the old results.\n\nThanks a lot — please be simple and step-by-step.

The poofiness is very noticeable irl.\n\nMy texture has always been thick, coarse, and wavy. I keep finding TikToks that suggest it’s probably curly, but I really don’t think so. I’ve never had a curl pattern and had a nice natural wave when I was younger.\n\nI’m always changing up my shampoo/conditioner but currently use Paul Mitchell with tea tree oil. I scrunch it with a microfiber towel and then air dry the rest. While it’s still damp, I apply Paul Mitchell’s skinny serum and coconut oil. I also use the Olaplex No 8 mask once a week. And I own the Mason Pearson hairbrush, but it seems to make my hair even poofier.\n\nPlease help! Any advice for my thinning eyebrows and lashes is also appreciated.",

      "content": "So, will try and shorten my story 😂\n\nP.s photos are in order of the story! 😊\n\nI am naturally dark brown, I had bleached my hair a few years ago at a salon and felt like i could never get \"blonde enough\" with full head foils. I found that what I was after at the time was a scalp bleach, and began doing it myself for about 8/10 months. I didn't mind the tone I achieved although not great I wasn't unhappy with the way it looked considering I was doing it myself.\n\nAfter a while it became too much upkeep, especially considering my roots were so dark. I went to a salon and explained this, that I wanted to go back dark. I wasn't really happy with how ashy it was. I ended up dying over it with a brown box dye (I know, I know) and do so for about 6 months.\n\nRecently, I decided I wanted to go back blonde. I knew it would be a while to get there due to the colour in my hair. The hairdresser recommended full head of balayage due to me not wanting to come in to the salon every 8 weeks (I had originally asked for a full head of foils). I went through with the balayge and felt it lifted quite well considering but there was definitely still warmth which is understandable. \n\nI have now had 3 full heads of balayage foils (spaced over 10/12 weeks each time) and I feel like I need more blonde then I have, especially towards my roots.\n\nI suppose the advice I'm looking for is, do I continue with Balayage or do I opt for a full head foils and a root tap/smudge/melt so that my regrowth isn't as noticeable? \n\nMy goal is to be as blonde as possible, with a small blended root.\n\nAm I being too picky/unrealistic? 😂 thanks so much for reading it all 😁",

In fact, they decided to divorce on an early birthday trip that she planned for herself and her husband (soon to be ex, thank god), she ended the trip early and flew home alone :(\n\nShe deserves and deserved a hell of a lot better of a husband, father, and partner than that piece of garbage, and she has been in a bad place for years due to their marital strife. I’d like to send her a really nice and thoughtful gift for her birthday, as she loves all things beauty (hair, skin, makeup, everything!). I live abroad so I can’t peep in her bathroom to see what brands she likes, and it would be suspicious to start asking if she’s been liking anything new lately! She is blonde and has fair skin, if that makes a difference for suggestions! Alternatively, if you have gone through a divorce, what has been a thoughtful gift you received from a friend? I know this is going to be a hard day for her, and I want to support her and show her how loved and special she is! Grateful for any and all suggestions. Budget is $150 if that helps! ",

But the acne just never stops.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I took a full course of isotretinoin. My skin became absolutely clear during and after the treatment, and I finally felt confident… but after stopping it, within a few months the acne slowly started returning. Now it feels even worse at times.\n\nCurrently I’m using salicylic acid and niacinamide, but honestly I don’t think they’re helping much. New pimples still keep coming, especially out of nowhere. It’s really frustrating and mentally draining at this point.\n\nI just want to know if anyone else went through something similar — acne coming back after isotretinoin — and what helped you long-term? Did you go for a second course, change your routine, fix lifestyle triggers, or something else?\n\nAny advice, experience, or guidance will really help. Thank you ❤️",

      "content": "I picked up the Skin1004 sunscreen because I wanted something that felt more like skincare than a heavy sunscreen, and this one honestly comes pretty close. The texture feels like a light watery serum, it spreads easily, and it gives my skin a soft dewy finish that makes everything look a bit more plump and hydrated. It sits well under makeup and never leaves a white cast on me, and the centella plus the hydrating ingredients make it feel soothing, especially on days when my skin barrier feels a bit irritated. Overall it is the kind of sunscreen that actually makes me want to apply it every morning, which is rare for me.\nIt does have some downsides though. On hotter days it can look shiny pretty quickly, so people with very oily skin might find it too dewy. A few times I felt a slight sting near my eyes if I got too close to the area, so I would say patch test if you are sensitive. It also is not super sweat resistant, so I would not rely on it for outdoor or long sweaty days. Even with those issues, it has been a very comfortable daily sunscreen for me and one of the easiest Korean sunscreens to wear if you want something hydrating, gentle, and simple to add into a morning routine.\nSecond pic is the progress of using this sunscreen, using it never gets me any breakout, even though it’s a bit oily for me. I still love the texture.",
