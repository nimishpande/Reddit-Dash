But recently, I have been pushed to watch these curly hair “influencers”. \n\nThis channel, for example, already has several videos and pictures depicting a girl who “rates” curly hair products. Which is basically an AD for this oil.  No real person is using this product in the ads. \n\nAs AI keeps advancing, more videos of these “influencers” will keep popping up. So be hyper vigilant out there. \n\nPost asked for my hair routine. I wash and shampoo with Shea moisture products, use a denman brush and then use Pattern Beauty leave in and curl cream. Air dry. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

What about highlighters?\n\nWhat are we using to make our eyebrows more defined in 2026?\n\nAre creamy eyeshadows easier to use than powdery ones?\n\nMy skin is really fine, but well…please note that I’m not in my 20s anymore 😅\n\nI have so many questions and I would be really thankful for some help 🥹!",

Maybe my angle-y face doesnt suit it? Idk what to do, help.\n\nI asked for a shag with bangs- the hairdresser dry cut it. I told her i mostly wear it straight, but now this only looks decent when its curled. Im already upset at the fact the bangs and overall length and layers are uneven. I cant even put up my hair nice because the sides on the left and the right are completely different framing wise. My bangs are more choppy on the left making it harder to blend and i already trimmed the right side of my bangs and they still feel longer on that side, as well as the ends of my hair, but im scared to cut anymore at this point incase i make it worse. I just want to grow them out as fast as possible. I was thinking about contacting the girl who did it but i already fixed some of her mistakes and worried she will roll her eyes at me or something ",

They’re growing out at a slower pace than the rest of the undercut. So basically I have this constant frizzy look underneath of my hair that bugs the shit out of me. I tried this “hair food” stuff but it didn’t harden like gel so it just made me look greasy all day 😞. \n\nI also am having issue with tiny little hairs on my forehead looking a mess as well as the hairs that usually get swept behind my ears going all over the place. The hair behind my ears holds the shape of my ear so it comes up in a little C if I don’t just keep it swept. I think it’s been trained to stay back there and I don’t know how to make it lay flat without a straighter. \n\nI guess what i’m asking is how to tame these certain places? Also if anyone has any ideas for healthcare professional hair styles that aren’t a banana clip or a ponytail i’m all ears. \n\nI feel like i’m always in a state of not being able to control my hair and i’m getting to the point of wanting to chop it off again but I wanna stand strong this time 😩😤\n\nTIA ",
