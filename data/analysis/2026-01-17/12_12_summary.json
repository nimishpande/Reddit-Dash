      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI had curacne treatment for 8 months (took 20mg) - at the end of my treatment I started to have absolutely crazy rashes on my hands and I felt very very dry.\n\nI finished my treatment in may 2025 and I feel like since august my skin started to have pimples again. My doctor said that it’s not acne but skin reaction cause I have very sensitive skin (redness, itchiness, pimples)\n\nDoctor recommended me to use skinoren but it burned af so I stopped using it. Since then I used only cleanser at night (Bioderma Sensibio Gel Moussant) and that was it - my doctor told me „the less products you use, the better” but now I feel like I did more damage.\n\nI used Clinique Even Better Evens and Corrects makeup nearly everyday on bare skin and now I stopped.\n\nI started using La Roche Posay Toleriante Sensitive cream for my skin barrier recovery 5 days back - I use it at night after my Bioderma cleanser and also in the morning after I wash my face with water. I’m not sure if I should continue with using this cream due to new pimples showing up but I’ve seen some threads which said to push through.\n\nRecently I bought IT Cosmetics Your Skin But Better CC + Nude Glow makeup cause I can’t stand the redness on my skin and in general I feel much better with even skin tone. I plan to use it after the skin barrier cream.\n\nI feel very nervous cause I don’t use any SPF at all since everything makes my skin burn, itch or breakout.\n\nI feel like anything I do it hurts my skin. \n\nI’m feeling hopeless that there is no way to recover my skin barrier from being THIS reactive. \n\nIf you have any tips, recommendations on very light products or certain steps/procedures, please, let me know.\n\nThank you.",

      "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI had curacne treatment for 8 months (took 20mg) - at the end of my treatment I started to have absolutely crazy rashes on my hands and I felt very very dry.\n\nI finished my treatment in may 2025 and I feel like since august my skin started to have pimples again. My doctor said that it’s not acne but skin reaction cause I have very sensitive skin (redness, itchiness, pimples)\n\nDoctor recommended me to use skinoren but it burned af so I stopped using it. Since then I used only cleanser at night (Bioderma Sensibio Gel Moussant) and that was it - my doctor told me „the less products you use, the better” but now I feel like I did more damage.\n\nI used Clinique Even Better Evens and Corrects makeup nearly everyday on bare skin and now I stopped.\n\nI started using La Roche Posay Toleriante Sensitive cream for my skin barrier recovery 5 days back - I use it at night after my Bioderma cleanser and also in the morning after I wash my face with water. I’m not sure if I should continue with using this cream due to new pimples showing up but I’ve seen some threads which said to push through.\n\nRecently I bought IT Cosmetics Your Skin But Better CC + Nude Glow makeup cause I can’t stand the redness on my skin and in general I feel much better with even skin tone. I plan to use it after the skin barrier cream.\n\nI feel very nervous cause I don’t use any SPF at all since everything makes my skin burn, itch or breakout.\n\nI feel like anything I do it hurts my skin. \n\nI’m feeling hopeless that there is no way to recover my skin barrier from being THIS reactive. \n\nIf you have any tips, recommendations on very light products or certain steps/procedures, please, let me know.\n\nThank you.",

At 30 I have the skin I had dreamed of literally all my life!\n\nI always had very uneven skin, and I would get pimples here and there.\n\nI cut out dairy, and while it helped a lot and reduced the number of pimples significantly, I would still get pimples from time to time. Some of them were very big, and they would leave my skin scarred and stained for weeks…\n\nI always washed my face twice a day and moisturized every day, so I was really frustrated.\n\nMy brother, who had the same problem, did some research and started a routine that helped him a lot.\n\nI followed the same routine, and it worked wonders.\n\nI am not endorsing or marketing any particular brand.\n\nI am just sharing my routine for those of you who might be curious. Different things suit different people, so this might not be suitable for you!\n\nOne more thing! I had experience using retinol before, so starting with 5% is not advised!\n\nEven now, I use the 5% retinol every other day because my skin burns and gets red and irritated if I use it every day. So be careful with retinol! Always start small and with lower dosages!\n\nHere is my routine:\n\n**Evening routine**\n\nCleanser\n\nPaula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant\n\nVitamin C serum (I keep experimenting with different brands — I have just begun using the Balea Vitamin C serum)\n\nMoisturizer (hyaluronic acid, CeraVe)\n\nRetinol in squalane (2% or 5%)\n\n**Morning routine**\n\nCleanser\n\nPaula’s Choice 6% Mandelic + 2% Lactic Acid Liquid AHA Peeling\n\nVitamin C serum\n\nMoisturizer\n\nSunscreen\n\nHope this helps!\n\nBe consistent if you want to see results!",
