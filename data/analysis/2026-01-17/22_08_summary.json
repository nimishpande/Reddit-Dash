So be hyper vigilant out there. \n\nPost asked for my hair routine. I wash and shampoo with Shea moisture products, use a denman brush and then use Pattern Beauty leave in and curl cream. Air dry. ",

At 36, I started finasteride 1mg daily and stayed on it for about three years which stabilised my hair loss. Switched to dutasteride, moving straight to 0.5mg daily for around a year and noticed healthier-looking hair, with thickening at the temples and hairline.\n\nI added oral minoxidil 1.25 mg daily two years ago. I think there has been a decent improvement but nothing dramatic.\n\nSorry the hair length differs between photos but hopefully the progress is still clear. Overall, I’m happy that the hair loss has stopped. I’ll probably consider a transplant within the next five years as I’m not completely satisfied yet. My biggest regret is not starting sooner!\n\nNo side effects from any medication. No microneedling and no topical minoxidil.",

My skin was super duper red and dark red and damaged but after a few days it got better, all because of EGF (epidermal growth factor). This ingredient is my holy grail till now.\n\nEnough with the yapping, here's my routine.\n\nMorning: wash skin with water only, preferably lukewarm water cus it washes off the products on my skin easier. Then I'll apply sunscreen ONLY and go on with my day.\n\nNight: double cleanse, toner, EGF serum, anua azelaic acid 10% (sometimes), moisturiser.\n\nDouble cleansing I'll use micellar water then go with a sulfur amino acid cleanser. I use a spray toner then PAT it into my skin and immediately use egf serum because it's better on damp skin.\n\nOverall it took 2-3 months to get rid of most of my marks and redness. \n\nSorry if this was confusing lol im sleepy ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I saw an esthetician in December who recommended **MOXI only**, but I’ve since learned about doing **BBL + MOXI together**, which seems appealing since I have some redness and sun spots in addition to larger pores.\n\nI’m trying to figure out the best way to space out treatments with summer sun exposure in mind. My initial thought was **two treatments in the spring** and **one in late September**, but I’d love to hear from anyone who’s done BBL/MOXI or planned treatments around a big event.\n\nDoes that timing sound reasonable? Any experience or advice would be appreciated!",

I’m planning to do 3-6 rounds of microneedling + PRP as well as some TCA peels over the course of the year.\n\nI got a facial yesterday (hair salon and spa, NOT a med spa) and my conversation with her is what piqued my interest and she recommended different med spas for me to check out for microneedling, etc. she pitched me one of their packages where I could do 10% TCA peels with her at around $55 either monthly membership or through a bundle.\n\nI researched med spas in my area and one quoted me $325 for a 15% TCA peel.\n\nIs it a better deal to do monthly, lighter TCA peels at 10% or invest in a higher percentage one? It’s basically six 10% TCA peels for the price of one 15% peel… how much MORE powerful would the 15% be?\n\nThanks in advance!! 🌟",

Is washing twice daily with this cleanser okay? I'm also considering switching to Kiehls cleanser and moisturiser and wondering if that would make sense for my skin type.\n\nShould I be using SPF daily, and if so, where would it fit into my routine?

Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

After years of constant breakout my skin finally became acne free with only a few acne scars on my face. VERY UNFORTUNATELY the company has discontinued this and I’ve frantically searched everywhere online and it’s out of stock everywhere. I had no other option so I bought minimalists salicylic acid and a tranexamic acid serums separately, but ever since then a pimple or two repeatedly. I know it doesn’t sound like a huge deal after years of acne and being taunted for my skin, im extremely insecure of my skin and this has been bothering me way too much. PLEASE GUYS SUGGEST ME AN ALTERNATIVE, what do you think could be possibly breaking me out? I would’ve visited my dermatologist but im in college in a different city currently, please please suggest me alternatives, should i stop using tranexamic acid? or salicylic? ive posted the formulation of the serums in the succeeding slides.",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

How can I trim the ends myself at home? I'm terrified of cutting my hair and seeing a difference in length. I've always hated cutting my hair since I was a child, so my confidence in salons or barbers is very low. I would like some tips on how to trim the ends at home.\n\nNote: The hair in the photos is not in the best condition because I'm spending my vacation in a city that is dry and hot.\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. Wash and detangle on the same day (1-3 times) a week.\n2. Shampoo: Neutrox \"Curls and Waves\"\n3. Conditioner: Skala Curl Styling Cream\n4. Oil after washing: Salon Line \"S.O.S\" Curls\n5. Drying: Using a regular towel for a few minutes on the hair and then air drying.\n6. I don't use a satin bonnet before bed.\n\nThis is the routine I've maintained for a few years.\n\nBetween washes I don't do anything to my hair, I don't do any kind of styling.",

What about highlighters?\n\nWhat are we using to make our eyebrows more defined in 2026?\n\nAre creamy eyeshadows easier to use than powdery ones?\n\nMy skin is really fine, but well…please note that I’m not in my 20s anymore 😅\n\nI have so many questions and I would be really thankful for some help 🥹!",

I went to Mexico in November, and after I came back my skin started reacting to everything — even skincare products I’ve been using for over a year with no issues. I then got COVID in early December, and my skin has been a mess ever since.\n\nI stopped using my usual products and tried switching things up, hoping that would help. Some days my skin looks okay (still not how it used to), and other days I wake up with milia. My skin tone is also just… bad right now.\n\nI tried adding CorsRX Hyaluronic Acid in December, and it seemed to trigger milia, which it’s never done to me before — even after coming back from Mexico or getting sick. Yesterday morning I tried reintroducing a vitamin C serum and my face immediately turned red, though it calmed down after a few minutes. This morning I woke up like this.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nMorning\n\n* ma:nyo Herb Green Cleansing Oil\n* Shiseido Clarifying Cleansing Foam\n* CorsRX AHA/BHA Toner\n* Either CorsRX Niacinamide or CorsRX Vitamin C 13%\n* Shiseido Benefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Day Cream\n* Shiseido Benefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Eye Cream\n\nNight\n\n* ma:nyo Herb Green Cleansing Oil\n* Shiseido Clarifying Cleansing Foam\n* Sana Nameraka Honpo Soy Milk Isoflavone Wrinkle Night Cream\n* Shiseido Benefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Eye Cream\n\nTLDR; I have combination skin with sebaceous filaments in my T-zone. My goals are clearer skin, less noticeable pores, and a more even skin tone. I was able to achieve this last year, but now my skin seems to be reacting to everything. I’m also 35 and starting to notice fine lines and wrinkles creeping in, which makes this even more frustrating.\n\nProducts that used to work well for me are suddenly causing irritation, redness, or congestion, and my skin feels unpredictable day to day. At this point I’m trying to figure out what changed and how to get my skin back to a healthy, balanced place.",
