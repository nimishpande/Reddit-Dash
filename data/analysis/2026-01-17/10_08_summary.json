I have had hairdressers say I have a lot of hair but the strands themselves are very fine. \n\nThe photos show my hair air dried after using my regular routine of OGX Bond Protein Repair shampoo and L’Oréal Elvive renewing conditioner. I wash it every other day because if I go two days or more my scalp gets very greasy. \n\nI live in a very dry climate and when I go to humid places it definitely forms more of a curl which tells me it needs a lot more moisture but I haven’t found a conditioner that won’t weigh it down a lot. \n\nI’d love to see what it would look like with the waves/curls more well defined.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

One of my main things convincing myself to get my hair cut is that I can always grow it out. Also I need something that would looked good styled or unstyled and in a ponytail.\n\nSorry if this is a really difficult way to ask for advice I’m just lowkey terrified of getting my hair cut but I know I need this change :’)\n\noh also another funny thing was when I was a lot younger I had a straight across forehead fringe (my friend did too I wanted to match and then my mum ended up pinning them back half the time anyway 🙃) , and three years back I had ear length straight cut bangs but on the side of my face (I thought I cooked), but since then all I’ve had it two trims (one with a tiny bit of layering just at the front).

Would it make a difference if I added sunscreen after my face wipe in the AM? I hear so many people say they put on sunscreen in the AM but I work from home and don't go out often.\n2.

      "content": "Hello! I'm currently trying to find out what exactly breaks me out, so I've been trying different products and simplified my skincare.  \n  \nI have severe rosacea and dry and dehydrated skin that's easily irritated and gets breakouts.  \n  \nI've been trying one product on the right side of my face and another one on the left side to see the difference and because I only have a few weeks between potential hormonal acne breakouts. I only use a low amount of product to test it out.  \n  \nI'm trying to wash my face only once a day and then wait for a bit (at least 30 minutes up to a few hours) before applying anything. My cleanser is Geek &amp; Gorgeous Jelly Joker which hasn't been breaking me out so far.  \n  \nThree days ago I used Geek &amp; Gorgeous Happier Barrier on my right side and it didn't break me out. My acne got a bit better (the other side got much worse). So the next day I used it on my whole face and the acne got better again.  \n  \nYesterday I used the CeraVe moisturizing lotion on my right side. It didn't immediately irritate me (the left side got irritated though), but by evening I had one pimple on my right cheek. So I very gently washed my lower face and used Happier Barrier again. Now after waking up I have so many pimples on my right cheek again, even more than on my left.  \n  \nCan it still be from the CeraVe lotion? Was it because of washing twice a day? Or does Happier Barrier break me out after all? Because the CeraVe lotion didn't give breakouts on my forehead which I didn't wash again yesterday evening. I want to wash my face again in case there's still some CeraVe residue but I don't want to irritate it...  \n  \nOn the left side I first used the Purito Oat-In Calming Gel which gave me acne on my whole left side, also on the forehead. Yesterday I used Geek &amp; Gorgeous Hydration Station on my left side and it irritated my skin directly after using it and I have a little bit of acne on my cheek and chin now.  \n  \nThank you for your help!",

I got a haircut last summer which I didn’t like due to the blunt shape which I tried rectifying by trying this Wayne Tuggle 4 section haircut on YouTube. I assume this is what left me with a gap in the middle essentially. I then had a haircut at a curly hair stylist in the fall to fix all of it and we agreed not to completely trim it all in regards to the hole in the middle of the back since it seemed to camouflage well. I cut some curtain bags myself about a week later. I also started using a whole new line of products (Innersense).\n\nThat was end of October. Out of curiosity I filmed the back of my head yesterday and was shocked to see the bottom layers. I did notice that my hair seemed to be thinner at the bottom (especially when both parts are pulled to the front) which I chalked up to hormones/vitamin deficiencies and the face framing layers I got. But the videos seem to look even worse. A noticeable gap in the middle (prior to this hair cut I did have long hair with no gaps) and generally straggly bits at the bottom. I don’t even know what this from nor how to fix it. The stylist I saw is the only curly hair specialist in town. I’ve attached two videos (in one). I’d really appreciate any advice!\n\nRoutine:\n\nShampoo: Innersense Pure Harmony Hairbath and Vichy Dercos\n\nConditioner: Innersense Color Radiance\n\nStylers: a concoction of Sweet Spirit Leave in and I create volume as well as I create hold and I create lift (all from Innersense)\n\n\\\\- a little goes a long way; it was my first time doing this particular mix of products on this wash day and the hair seems to be good. I emulsify product with water and take it in wet hair. Then I scrunch and scrunch out excess water with microfiber towel. I let it sit like that for 5 minutes and then cup diffuse upside down and from side to side. I then fluff it out. Refresh is just taking a bit of water with sweet spirit leave in and coating frizzy, undefined strands with that as well as a bit of I create volume and then scrunching it up. Often I don’t need to do that. I sleep with my hair in a pineapple. Sometimes I use I create finish on dry hair.",
