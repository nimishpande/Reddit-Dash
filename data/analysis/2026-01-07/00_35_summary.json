I use it after showering and I’m good for the entire day. \n\nEasily a 10/10 WRP!!\n\nNivea Pearl &amp; Beauty Roll On:\n\nVery average. It was the first one i used (canon event). formula feels slightly sticky for the first few minutes. No sweat control, it just mixes the smell with the deo’s. And no visible brightening. \n\n6/10 WNRP because there are better options now.\n\nRexona Shower Fresh Roll On:\n\ndecent for odour control but way too strong for sensitive skin gave me a slight burning sensation especially on freshly shaved days. works if you need something heavy, but it’s definitely not gentle. \n\n7.5/10 WNRP for me personally cause i have too sensitive skin.",

Then wrung out my hair and put it in a turbie twist for a couple of hours, let loose and it air dried like this. I’m at a loss at what type curls these are (they are not trained, they have just been twisted in the towel and then air dried, my hair only does this in the front, meanwhile the underneath remains straight (always been told it’s because my hair is heavy, I do like layers however it doesn’t help the underneath parts). I don’t do anything special when sleeping, I’ve never had chemicals in my hair ever as well, no dye. \n\nSome background: as a kid I had pin straight, silky blonde hair. Enter puberty: my hair got coarse, thick, darker and was a frizzy, poofy mess when brushed. Neither parent has curly hair so I was never taught how to manage it, always took a brush to it and used the most damaging shampoo (Nizoral). I’ve spent probably over a hundred, maybe more on products. Tried Not Your Mother’s, Shea Moisture, Mielle. Shampoo/Conditioner has been so much I can hardly remember. Photo 3 is my hair when brushed out dry, and Photo 4 is after some salt-water at the beach a couple years ago for some variety. I guess my question is whether or not my whole head can be trained, or if I’m just unfortunate enough to have my front pieces curl and the rest (like the back) just isn’t. \n\nI’ve never posted anything on here so do correct me if I made a mistake or didn’t understand the rules correctly. I’m just very exhausted trying to figure out what direction I should go in after trying what feels like everything but curl resetting and training. ",

I then let it air dry. \n\nHello, I started my hair journey about a month ago. I have straightened my hair probably everyday for the past 3 years as well as dyed and bleached it for about a decade now. I always hated my hair due to it getting puffy. I recently found out it gets puffy because I have wavy hair and my hair is dead so it can't hold its \"wave\" pattern.\n\nI did some research and found so many people saying to use not your mothers products, so I bought them. I got the curl cream, gel and mousse. I started to use it but noticed it made my hair hard and crunchy. It also made my hair look wet all the time which I hate. I looked online and it said I was using too much product, so l used less; but it still happen. I did some more research and it said it was cause of the mousse so I stopped using it but It would still happen so I stopped using the gel.... and it stilled happened. Another thing I hate is how stringy it looks....\n\nI just came here for some advice. Am i still using too much product? Am I not using the right products for my hair? Is my hair just not naturally wavy and i'm forcing a pattern that's why it gets like this?",

However as i’m sure many of you are aware, due to the antibiotic in treclin you can only use it for maximum 6 months at a time. I stopped using it June 2025 and switched to differin gel &amp; azelic acid. I have been consistent with the differin gel using it each night however i only use the azelic acid once or twice a week. Ever since around november my skin has been getting progressively worse with around 50 closed comodones forming in my forehead and at least 10-15 active spots on my face at a time when from June-August my skin was almost completely clear. I don’t know what to try next. I’m considering low dose accutane. Or tretinoin gel alone. Or increasing my azelic acid use. I’m just lost with what to try anymore. Or to add a salicylic acid toner? Please help with recommendations.\n\nMy current routine: Cerave blemish control cleanser 1x per day, differin 1x per day, azelic acid 1-2x per week, cerave oil control moisturiser 1x per day. Occasionally a vitamin C serum and a hylauronic acid serum. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

I am debating between a thermal brush vs a blow dryer brush to blow out/style my hair and bangs. I am looking for recommendations for something okay for beginners that ideally is minimally damaging. \n\nIn the photo are a few from Sephora that I am considering. I’m also open to recommendations not from Sephora, I just want something decent quality and not crazy expensive like a Dyson.\n\nAlso please don’t recommend the revlon air brush because I had that before and really didn’t like it.\n\nThanks!",

      "content": "So i bought the ordinary peeling solution in November 2025 first week and when I used for the first time.....I was like, yes I found the one product which i can use of I want a instant glow, because it made my skin very clean. For context, I have normal skin with oily t zone and didn't have any pimples that time, but my face wasn't clear either. It had some small acne marks, and pores. I'm not saying peeling solution removed any of that, but for that week after using it, my face was brighter and it had that healthy glow. It was like an upper layer of skin of dead cells got removed (I know peeling solution is supposed to do that),I was so happy with it. And I used it after 10 days, the same thing happened, it gave me a glow. \n\nFast forward to the next time I used, nothing happened after I used it. I still got that tingling sensation the first time I used it, but there was no glow in my face. So i thought maybe it's because I was over exfoliating. So the next time I used was more than 2 weeks later. But still the same, there was no visible glow or any change at all. \n\nSo i want to know, what is actually happening here? Now all that peeling solution does is it kinda kills my one or two pimples which comes during periods. \nI searched in the internet for similar experiences, but found none. So if anyone have any idea regarding this please do share🥹\nI'm also attaching my skin right after I used the peeling solution for reference.",
