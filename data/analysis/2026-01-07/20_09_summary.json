      "content": "Because how, exactly, is my face supposed to absorb 32 products. Is my skin a USB port? A sponge? A black hole? \n\nLike I'm sorry, but after cleanser, serum, and moisturizer my skin is already like \"bestie we're full.\" You're telling me I should keep going?? With what? toner #6? Another essence that \"boosts glow\" in the exact same way as the last three??\n\nMeanwhile social media is like:\n\nfirst apply toner with your hands \n\nthen with a cotton pad \n\nthen with your soul\n\nI feel like those super long routines are more about the experience than the results. Very cozy, very aesthetic, very “I like potions.” Which is valid! Just maybe not required for having normal, healthy skin.\n\nSometimes a few solid products, used consistently, do more than turning your bathroom into a skincare buffet. Your skin doesn’t need everything, it just needs what works.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

This product is actually a 2 in 1 because not only does it soften your hair it does shape your curls.\n\nAfter that I put on curling gel, I specifically use Marc Anthony Strictly Curls gel. \n\nThen I diffuse. First I use the highest heat possible then when my hair is half dry I go to medium heat. This is to prevent my hair from getting too dry from being exposed from the highest heat for too long.\n\nThen to break up the case made from the gel I use Ciliganic Moringa oil.

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I don’t know why, but my skin reacted amazingly to it my active pimples completely cleared up within ~15 days, and no new breakouts came during that time. I wasn’t using any actives or serums alongside it.\nAfter coming back home and switching to my regular cleanser, my acne has started coming back 😞\nUnfortunately, the product doesn’t seem to be available anywhere in India.\nI’ve attached a photo / will attach ingredient details if needed.\nI’d really appreciate help finding it.\nOr recommendations for similar gentle, non-stripping cleansers that worked for acne-prone / sensitive skin\nThank you so much in advance 🤍\n",

The replies to that post were very helpful and I wanted some help on choosing some alternate products or sticking to this routine.\n\n- Moisturizer: should I stick with the ponds or switch to minimalist b12 since I'm using niacinamide and need to protect my skin barrier?\n\n- Sunscreen: this is where I am facing the biggest confusion (so are others when I searched this sub lol), I initially decided to go with the regular minimalist spf 50 but then I found out it has retinol in it (seperate thread on that later, because that makes no sense) which is a big no no with the other actives I'm using so decided to switch to the light fluid one instead. I've also heard korean ones are good as well as reequil ultra dry matte but there's so many choices and not enough budget to go around so please help me choose one :\")\n\nI hope y'all can provide a overall verdict on my routine, I'm scared and excited to be starting this journey for the first time after decades of tanning and negligence of my skin \n\nSee you on the other side 🤎",

      "content": "I've always had A LOT of hair, but it's been very fine and straight.  It could never hold a perm during the late '80s, and hair clips/bands would just slide right out of it.  I basically had a shoulder-length cut from 1st grade on.  Super easy.\n\nEnter perimenopause.  Suddenly my hair is wavy and frizzy.  My hair stylist helpfully said, \"Wow, your hair looks like a Christmas tree!\" (with how it goes wider the longer it grows.  Like Marge Simpson's sisters).  I have a straight iron, but I don't like straightening it.  It takes a long time and I just don't like to fuss with it.  If I let it dry naturally, use a little mousse and scrunch it, then carefully comb it, spray it with de-frizzing spray, and re-scrunch it, I have fairly nice curls/large waves (this is also fussier than I'd like to be, but I'm tired of hating it and this gives me some satisfaction).  But day #2 is a disaster.  Bushy, frizzy, shapeless.  I don't want to wash it daily because it's gone from being really, really oily (most of my life) to being dry.\n\nRight now, it's just past my shoulders, all one length.  Since I've never had \"curly\" or wavy hair, I'm not sure how to get it cut to encourage the curl.  Layers??  I don't know how to encourage the curls.  Mousse?  I'm so out of the loop.  Any advice?  I'm also between stylists right now...sigh.  Here's a photo that show the natural waviness that comes with an air-dry.  Oh, I also don't know how to blow dry curly/wavy hair.  :)  This is all new territory!  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7jz3ut9xczbg1.jpg?width=1964&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7d3cc29498fd1083c49754e91998a77e88aae59\n\n",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI really need sunscreen suggestions and I’m honestly scared at this point.\n\nFor context: I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin, and I’ve had actual dermatitis reactions from some popular “cosmetic” sunscreen brands, so I’m super cautious now.\n\nHere’s my sunscreen journey so far:\n\n\t•\tFixderma Shadow Gel SPF – This was the first sunscreen that worked well for my skin. No reaction, no breakouts.\n\nBUT I didn’t love the finish (a bit too shiny/gelly for my liking), so I thought I’d try others.\n\n\t•\tDot &amp; Key SPF &amp; Aqualogica SPF – BIG mistake. Both gave me dermatitis. Burning, irritation, texture — the whole nightmare. This really shook my confidence in cosmetic brands.\n\n\t•\tWent to a dermatologist:\n\n\t•\tSuggested Venusia sunscreen → made me extremely oily, felt heavy and uncomfortable and also i felt it didn’t work much i felt my tan increased with the use\n\n\t•\tThen suggested Acne UV.\n\n\t•\tAcne UV (50g) – LOVED it. Blended well, no irritation, skin was happy.\n\nSo I confidently bought the 100g version and… it was HORRIBLE.\n\nThick, doesn’t blend, terrible white cast, stays patchy on the skin. I don’t know if it’s a batch issue or formulation difference, but it was unusable.\n\n\t•\tUV Doux – Tried this too and it felt good on my skin. No immediate reaction.\n\n•\tBoj OG Sunscreen — Too heavy, felt like a moisturizing blanket for dry skin — not for me.\n\nNow I’m thinking: Korean sunscreens?\n\nI’ve seen people rave about them, but they’re costly, and I’m nervous because:\n\nI apply sunscreen properly (2–3 fingers) every day, so cost matters — but if something is truly worth it, I’m open to trying.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n\n\t•\tSafe for very sensitive skin\n\n\t•\tNo dermatitis / irritation\n\n\t•\tPrefer matte or comfortable, slight dew is okay\n\n\t•\tWorth the price for daily use\n\nIf you’ve had similar skin issues and found something that works (especially Korean or pharmacy sunscreens), please share 🙏\n\nI just want sun protection without my skin panicking .",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I only realised the connection after the course ended, when I finally began to feel like myself again. At the time, I was assured by the dermat that the acne would not return.\n\nHowever, it has come back, and this time, it feels worse. It seems hormonal, especially since I also have PCOS. I recently sprained my ankle as well, so my regular exercise routine has been disrupted, which may have contributed to the flare-up.\n\nRight now, I’m using the Effaclar serum from La Roche-Posay at night, along with a few topical creams prescribed by my dermatologist. She is now suggesting a chemical peel as the next step.\n\nTo be honest, I’m feeling quite exhausted and overwhelmed by the process. I double cleanse at night, religiously follow AM-PM skin care regimes - will this never go away?\n\nWhat has worked best for you if you have faced similar issues?\n\nTL;DR: Acne has returned after isotretinoin (which caused severe depression), likely hormonal due to PCOS. Current topicals aren’t helping much, dermatologist suggests a chemical peel. Feeling exhausted and unsure how to proceed.\n\nPS. Clicked this picture on one of the better days unfortunately ",

But my hold product - Curls Blueberry Bliss Gel - is too sticky apply to dry hair. Water alone just makes the poof worse.\n\nAny suggestions for \"creamy\", non-sticky products to use? I'm honestly okay if they weigh my hair down somewhat - I prefer definition over volume - think \"mermaid hair.\"\n\nCurrent Routine:  \n\\- wash with method moisturizing shampoo and cerave hydrating conditioner\n\n\\- microfiber towel out the excess, Curls Blueberry Bliss gel, plop\n\n\\- diffuse until 50% dry with a dyson hairdryer + diffuser, apply Pantene alcohol-free hairspray (per my hairstylist, this adds hold and the accelerants in the hairspray help your hair dry faster) and finish diffusing  \n\\- I sleep on a satin pillowcase in a loose updo if I'm trying to get 2nd or 3rd day hair.",
