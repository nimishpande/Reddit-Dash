Gave it three full pumps when i noticed that my spray was kind of strange, not the fine \"fog\" that it should've been and i immediately tasted something extremely sharp, toxic and spicy in my mouth. Then total burning sensation. I realized that i pumped three full shots of Minox into my throat. Oh boy. What a terrible, terrible taste. And you can imagine that it really didn't help with the coughing... Immediate thoughts of how dangerous this could be, but i drank a lot of water out of the sink to get rid of the taste and to thin the Minox in my stomach... Almost threw up... What an evening. Now my head feels warm and i have a terrible taste in my mouth. But i am also richer in experience.\n\nDon't make the same mistake as me. Minox may look like cough spray, but sadly it doesn't really help with a sore throat...",

I use it after showering and I’m good for the entire day. \n\nEasily a 10/10 WRP!!\n\nNivea Pearl &amp; Beauty Roll On:\n\nVery average. It was the first one i used (canon event). formula feels slightly sticky for the first few minutes. No sweat control, it just mixes the smell with the deo’s. And no visible brightening. \n\n6/10 WNRP because there are better options now.\n\nRexona Shower Fresh Roll On:\n\ndecent for odour control but way too strong for sensitive skin gave me a slight burning sensation especially on freshly shaved days. works if you need something heavy, but it’s definitely not gentle. \n\n7.5/10 WNRP for me personally cause i have too sensitive skin.",

This works well for me and I'm not looking for advice on it unless it specifically relates to your recommendation for treating 11s.\n\nMorning: Vitamin C powder mixed with a basic unscented water-based moisturizer + sunscreen\n\nNight: Micellar water to cleanse/remove makeup + phyto retinol night cream\n\nA few days a week I use a salicylic acid moisturizer (I'll stop once pregnant), eye patches with hyaluronic acid, oil-based cleanser, and rosehip seed oil.\n\nThank you for any thoughts, community! &lt;3",

I’m incredibly self conscious about every single part of my body, but i do think if i lost my double chin i would be more confident. I already have guasha stuff, and do my best to remember to use it. I do need to drink more water, i know that’s something that would help.

Where I live it is freezing cold and dry all winter and our summers are a dry heat.\n\nI travelled to a humid location a few years back and was completely at a loss for how to manage my curls and mitigate frizz. Also in the humidity my curl pattern intensified to a maybe a 3b.\n\nI am travelling to Mexico for a vacation in a week and this time I am looking for advice. What products should I buy and bring to make my curls thrive in the humidity? How do I manage the halo of frizz that instantly appears the minute I step off the plane? And if you’re feeling generous, tips for styling my hair sans heat because there’s really no point in trying to fight the curl in that kind of humidity 😅\n\nThank you in advance for all replies!\n\nMy usual routine on a wash day is shampoo and condition with television. Lightly towel dry. While still completely wet spray with IGK good behaviour 4 in 1 and brush through. Scrunch. Either diffuse gently or air dry. I don’t protect my hair while sleeping. I find the satin pillow cases too slippery 😩 but I will Mae the sacrifice if you all tell me this is what my hair needs. You will notice I don’t use any curl specific products, I have found them all too heavy and diminish my curls. But I also genuinely have no idea what I’m doing. ",

I also use a bonnet at night.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Routine: brush before shower, then used Maui brand in Coconut, the blue, moisture level 2 shampoo and conditioner. So far is the most satisfactory. Then wrung out my hair and put it in a turbie twist for a couple of hours, let loose and it air dried like this. I’m at a loss at what type curls these are (they are not trained, they have just been twisted in the towel and then air dried, my hair only does this in the front, meanwhile the underneath remains straight (always been told it’s because my hair is heavy, I do like layers however it doesn’t help the underneath parts). I don’t do anything special when sleeping, I’ve never had chemicals in my hair ever as well, no dye. \n\nSome background: as a kid I had pin straight, silky blonde hair. Enter puberty: my hair got coarse, thick, darker and was a frizzy, poofy mess when brushed. Neither parent has curly hair so I was never taught how to manage it, always took a brush to it and used the most damaging shampoo (Nizoral). I’ve spent probably over a hundred, maybe more on products. Tried Not Your Mother’s, Shea Moisture, Mielle. Shampoo/Conditioner has been so much I can hardly remember. Photo 3 is my hair when brushed out dry, and Photo 4 is after some salt-water at the beach a couple years ago for some variety. I guess my question is whether or not my whole head can be trained, or if I’m just unfortunate enough to have my front pieces curl and the rest (like the back) just isn’t. \n\nI’ve never posted anything on here so do correct me if I made a mistake or didn’t understand the rules correctly. I’m just very exhausted trying to figure out what direction I should go in after trying what feels like everything but curl resetting and training. ",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

      "content": "TLDR: 23 y/o, always treated my hair as straight. Hair can look wavy when scrunched out of the shower. Kinda frizzy when I brush it straight (I always assumed it was static from the brush?). Mom has 2c hair that she doesn’t take care of, got products to help her. Used on myself without diffuser (air dried), didn’t really hold. \n1st pic: wet hair, scrunched once. \n2: air dried, no products, not brushed out. \n\nSo my (23F) whole life I’ve treated my hair like it’s straight. Everytime I’d brush it out it’d get a little frizzy but I just assumed it was the static from the type of brush I’d use or from my clothes. I recently started taking care of my hair (oiling, silk pillow case) cause it’s fine. My mom has always had 2c wavy hair that she never took care of so I recently got Aussie curl mousse and fructise spray gel to use on her. I looked up tutorials on how to use them, hair plopping, and tried it all on my myself just for funsies. When I plopped my hair, I noticed a pretty obvious soft wave pattern. But, thought nothing of it because whenever I’d lay down with my hair in a towel it did that, then I’d just brush it straight. I tried using the products, then air dried and it kinda just became tangled and the waves fell with my hair only curled up at the end. We have a diffuser but I just didn’t really know exactly how to use it. \n\nI’ve just grown more curious, so I’d scrunch my hair after being freshly washed (first pic) but then it’d just dry like in the second pic. \n\nAnyway, let me know! I feel like maybe I just have straight hair with subtle waves in them if it dries mostly straight? Also let me know if there might be better products for my mom :p",

      "content": "I'm 39. I have scars from teenage cystic acne on my cheeks and basically a breakout on my chin 100% of the time. I can't remember a time my chin was clear of blemishes. I have very obvious pores and I furrow my eyebrows. A lot. My wrinkles are there, and I am getting deep nasolabial lines. I don't really wear makeup at all.\n\nI'm interested in anti-aging products, too. I don't really know what to prioritize or what products can do double duty. Here's what I use, followed by what I have. I'd really like any suggestions for improvement.\n\nAM: Cetaphil daily cleanser &gt; Thayer's rose petal toner &gt; Olay super serum &gt; Cerave daily lotion with spf (Walgreens dupe)\n\nPM: Cerave Acne Control cleanser &gt; Niacinamide brightening toner &gt; Cerave retinol resurfacing serum &gt; Cerave night cream (Walgreens dupe)\n\nI HAVE but don't generally use:\n\n- Starface cream+salycilic acid\n- Cerave nighttime lotion (Walgreens dupe)\n- Byoma retinol sensitive serum \n- Elf melting balm (I do use if I wear makeup which is rare, followed by cleanser etc)\n- Cerave brightening vitamin C serum (ordered, not arrived yet)\n- The Ordinary volufilline 92% serum \n- First Aid facial radiance exfoliating pads \n- Noxema salycilic acid pads \n\nI'm cool to spend a few bucks but I'm not trying to break the bank. Once a single product gets over $25, I start raising an eyebrow. If I'm better suited to replace something in my routine with something I already have, I'd prefer it.  I'm also lazy. So to keep the routines at cleanse/toner/serum/moisturizer twice a day feels mostly manageable. \n\nAm I on the right track? Should I have the same routine morning and night or am I good to have two? Suggestions for improvement? My goals are: slowing the signs of aging, clearing up my acne, and maybe minimizing my pores if that is real.",

Around 2-3 months ago, I started a skincare routine, which consists of using a water based cleanser, salyclic acid serum and moisturiser/spf. I cleanse and moisturise every night, and use the SA every 3 days at for the first month and a half, then I went to every 2 days, but it genuinely hasn't done anything except make me breakout the day after I use it. Even more blackheads and pimples are appearing now and I am so frustrated. Does anyone have a recommendation for a product that will help with getting rid of the blackheads and stopping pimples. I have a product list of what I use down below. I can provide more info if asked. Please be kind :)\n\nProduct currently in routine:\n\nArencia Fresh Green Rice Mochi Cleanser\n\nCetaphil DAILY FACIAL MOISTURISER\n\nThe Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution\n\nCancer Council Hydrating Sunscreen for Men SPF50+\n\nProducts I also have but don't use right now:\n\nAnua Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner\n\nMadagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil SKIN1004\n\nAnua Niacinamide 10% + TXA 4% Serum",

Thank you everyone! \n\nMy routine:\nAll camille rose: sweet ginger cleansing rinse, morrocan pear conditioner, algae renew mask once a week. Out of the shower, I apply honey hydrate to damp hair, then wet hair with a spray bottle, and use a pea sized amount of their almond jai butter as a curl cream. I follow it up with the curl maker gel scrunched in, spiked honey mouse, then diffuse on medium heat. After this I gently scrunch in their rosemary oil. ",
