      "content": "Chemist at Play Underarm Roll On:\n\nMy absolute favourite super gentle, absorbs fast, and actually helps with both odour control and underarm darkness over time. no burning, no sticky mess, no weird white residue. I use it after showering and I’m good for the entire day. \n\nEasily a 10/10 WRP!!\n\nNivea Pearl &amp; Beauty Roll On:\n\nVery average. It was the first one i used (canon event). formula feels slightly sticky for the first few minutes. No sweat control, it just mixes the smell with the deo’s. And no visible brightening. \n\n6/10 WNRP because there are better options now.\n\nRexona Shower Fresh Roll On:\n\ndecent for odour control but way too strong for sensitive skin gave me a slight burning sensation especially on freshly shaved days. works if you need something heavy, but it’s definitely not gentle. \n\n7.5/10 WNRP for me personally cause i have too sensitive skin.",

Gave it three full pumps when i noticed that my spray was kind of strange, not the fine \"fog\" that it should've been and i immediately tasted something extremely sharp, toxic and spicy in my mouth. Then total burning sensation. I realized that i pumped three full shots of Minox into my throat. Oh boy. What a terrible, terrible taste. And you can imagine that it really didn't help with the coughing... Immediate thoughts of how dangerous this could be, but i drank a lot of water out of the sink to get rid of the taste and to thin the Minox in my stomach... Almost threw up... What an evening. Now my head feels warm and i have a terrible taste in my mouth. But i am also richer in experience.\n\nDon't make the same mistake as me. Minox may look like cough spray, but sadly it doesn't really help with a sore throat...",

I plan to tell the artist to change these things for the day-of, but I’m looking for other opinions as well.\n\nI’m just looking for feedback on the makeup, since I can’t look at it objectively and am not used to wearing much makeup.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I’m incredibly self conscious about every single part of my body, but i do think if i lost my double chin i would be more confident. I already have guasha stuff, and do my best to remember to use it. I do need to drink more water, i know that’s something that would help.

Routine: brush before shower, then used Maui brand in Coconut, the blue, moisture level 2 shampoo and conditioner. So far is the most satisfactory. Then wrung out my hair and put it in a turbie twist for a couple of hours, let loose and it air dried like this. I’m at a loss at what type curls these are (they are not trained, they have just been twisted in the towel and then air dried, my hair only does this in the front, meanwhile the underneath remains straight (always been told it’s because my hair is heavy, I do like layers however it doesn’t help the underneath parts). I don’t do anything special when sleeping, I’ve never had chemicals in my hair ever as well, no dye. \n\nSome background: as a kid I had pin straight, silky blonde hair. Enter puberty: my hair got coarse, thick, darker and was a frizzy, poofy mess when brushed. Neither parent has curly hair so I was never taught how to manage it, always took a brush to it and used the most damaging shampoo (Nizoral). I’ve spent probably over a hundred, maybe more on products. Tried Not Your Mother’s, Shea Moisture, Mielle. Shampoo/Conditioner has been so much I can hardly remember. Photo 3 is my hair when brushed out dry, and Photo 4 is after some salt-water at the beach a couple years ago for some variety. I guess my question is whether or not my whole head can be trained, or if I’m just unfortunate enough to have my front pieces curl and the rest (like the back) just isn’t. \n\nI’ve never posted anything on here so do correct me if I made a mistake or didn’t understand the rules correctly. I’m just very exhausted trying to figure out what direction I should go in after trying what feels like everything but curl resetting and training. ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

This was my favorite of the ones I’ve tried, but it did pill pretty often.\n\n2.\t⁠Aveeno Calm and Restore Triple Oat Serum. I hated this. It left a gritty texture on my skin and felt really heavy.\n\n3.\t⁠Cosrx Centella Aqua Soothing Ampoule. This left my skin feeling super dry.\n\n4.\t⁠Dr. Jart Cicapair Intensive Soothing Repair Serum. This is why I’m currently using. I had really high hopes for it because I have mild rosacea and I thought this would help, but it’s breaking me out and makes my skin look and feel greasy.\n\nI’m starting to feel really frustrated.

I don't really wear makeup at all.\n\nI'm interested in anti-aging products, too. I don't really know what to prioritize or what products can do double duty. Here's what I use, followed by what I have. I'd really like any suggestions for improvement.\n\nAM: Cetaphil daily cleanser &gt; Thayer's rose petal toner &gt; Olay super serum &gt; Cerave daily lotion with spf (Walgreens dupe)\n\nPM: Cerave Acne Control cleanser &gt; Niacinamide brightening toner &gt; Cerave retinol resurfacing serum &gt; Cerave night cream (Walgreens dupe)\n\nI HAVE but don't generally use:\n\n- Starface cream+salycilic acid\n- Cerave nighttime lotion (Walgreens dupe)\n- Byoma retinol sensitive serum \n- Elf melting balm (I do use if I wear makeup which is rare, followed by cleanser etc)\n- Cerave brightening vitamin C serum (ordered, not arrived yet)\n- The Ordinary volufilline 92% serum \n- First Aid facial radiance exfoliating pads \n- Noxema salycilic acid pads \n\nI'm cool to spend a few bucks but I'm not trying to break the bank. Once a single product gets over $25, I start raising an eyebrow. If I'm better suited to replace something in my routine with something I already have, I'd prefer it.  I'm also lazy. So to keep the routines at cleanse/toner/serum/moisturizer twice a day feels mostly manageable. \n\nAm I on the right track? Should I have the same routine morning and night or am I good to have two? Suggestions for improvement? My goals are: slowing the signs of aging, clearing up my acne, and maybe minimizing my pores if that is real.",

Then it was the straight hair again in 7th grade (8th grade I shaved my whole head for religious reasons so idk what it looked like as I wore a stank ass beanie 24/7 with a hoodie over it. And then only when I started highschool, did my 2a-3a hair start popping out. I had a routine for a while and then got off due to laziness. I started it again in October and it was going well for a bit but its been like a flat 1c aince December ._. I thought it was product overload, or moisture overload, but like I said at the beginning, nothing worked. Am I just going through a hormonal phase of less texture again? 😭 my waves comes and goes in waves??\n\nRoutine: \n•\t⁠rhyme and reason wave revival shamp/condish (I shampoo often)\n•\t⁠odele clarifying shampoo once a week when I have a lot of build up( it kinda has not been working the way its supposed to. Not clean enough personally)\n•\t⁠as I am co wash bar in between wash days bc my hair gets oily but also dry?? 😭\n•\t⁠as I am rosemary water on wash days\n•\t⁠bread beauty hair oil -&amp;honey deep moisture shamp/condish\n•\t⁠curl talk gel/foam -mielle coil custard (heard its good for low porosity hair no matter the curl pattern/type) -miss jessie’s leave-in\n\ni also wanna say I’m like a medium porosity? Sometimes it takes a minute to get wet, others it gets soaked instantly. Same with drying. My hair quite literally has a mind of its own atp 😭\n\nCurl police pls don’t come for me, the wavy hair sub didn’t let me add emojis or personality and I’m not gonna be dry asf when talking about my dry ass hair, thank you.",
