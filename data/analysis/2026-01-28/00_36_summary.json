      "title": "Update (Part 2): I emailed Indian sunscreen brands asking for ISO reports; outcomes after 30+ days",
      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is Part 2 / update to my [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/1pn678r/i_emailed_indian_sunscreen_brands_asking_for_iso/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) where I mentioned reaching out to sunscreen brands to verify their SPF, UVA, and water-resistance claims.\n\nI waited over a month before posting this update so brands had sufficient time to respond. Below is a factual summary of what I asked and what I received.\n\n**What I requested (same from all brands):**  \nISO 24444: SPF in-vivo test report (with lab name &amp; accreditation)  \nISO 24442 or ISO 24443: UVA protection test report (with numerical UVA-PF / critical wavelength data)  \nWater resistance testing (WR40 / WR80), if applicable\n\n# Responses after ~1 month\n\n# 🟢 High transparency\n\n**Re’equil**\n\n→ Shared full ISO 24444 SPF report, UVA data, and water-resistance testing (WR40/WR80).\n\n→ Detailed documentation provided.\n\n# 🟡 Partial transparency\n\n**The Derma Co (Honasa)**\n\n→ Directed to a publicly available “Certificate of Sunscreen Efficacy Testing” on their product page.\n\n→ Certificate confirms: In-vivo SPF testing as per ISO 24444:2019 (SPF ≈ 50) In-vitro UVA assessment (critical wavelength ≈ 379 nm)\n\n→ Full test reports and water-resistance data were not shared.\n\n**Minimalist**\n\n→ Shared ISO 24444 in-vivo SPF report.\n\n→ When asked specifically for water-resistance testing (WR40/WR80 or ISO 16217/18861) to support their “80-minute water resistance” claim, the request was escalated but no documentation was shared even after 1+ month.\n\n**La Shield (Glenmark)**\n\n→ Shared numerical SPF/UVA values via email.\n\n→ No test date, full methodology, or lab accreditation details were shared\n\n# 🔴 No data shared (after 30+ days)\n\nThe following brands acknowledged the request, raised tickets, or said they would revert, but did not share any SPF/UVA/WR documentation even after 30+ days:\n\n* Aqualogica\n* Conscious Chemist\n* Brinton (UV Doux)\n* IPCA (Acne UV Gel)\n* Blynds\n* Photostable\n* Episoft\n\nFor this update, lack of response after 30+ days (despite tickets or acknowledgements) has been treated as an outcome, not a pending state.\n\n**Scope note:** Brands listed were selected based on products frequently mentioned on this sub and those I personally used or see recommended. This is not an exhaustive list of all Indian sunscreens.\n\n***Edit:*** *A few people suggested emailing additional brands. I won’t be expanding the scope further at this point, this update reflects only the brands I had already contacted and responses received within a fixed time window. I may revisit this in the future, but not right now.*",

      "content": "In exactly one month from today, I will reach 5 full years of sobriety from alcohol 🥹💖\n\nSomething I once truly believed would never be possible.\n\nI haven’t talked much about this, but when I was drinking, my body began to seriously break down.\n\nBy 2016, I was losing my hair rapidly. My health was failing. I was deeply ashamed and terrified.\n\nThat’s when wearing the bandana became a constant, because I didnt recognize myself anymore.\n\nWhat many people don’t know is that my hair didn’t start improving until about a year and a half ago, when I finally began healing for real and started treatment with dutasteride and minoxidil.\n\nToday, for the first time, I’m ready to show you my hair regrowth progress 😄\n\nBut this goes so much deeper than hair.\n\nMy liver went from 40% function to normal.\n\nMy blood pressure is normal for the first time in 10 years.\n\nA body I thought was permanently damaged is healing.\n\nIf you’re struggling right now physically, mentally, or with addiction, please hear this.\n\n✨ Your body wants to heal. You are not broken. And you are not alone. ✨\n\nI am endlessly grateful to be alive, sober, and here with you today.\n\nI love you all so much, my friends. Thank you for walking this journey with me 💖🙏",

It's getting closer, but I've been really struggling with curl definition and frizz (thanks, Texas humidity!), but I switched up my routine a bit on yesterday's wash day and I've got the best results so far! Any other tips for fighting frizz are welcome!\n\nRoutine:\n1. Wash with Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration (I clarified last week)\n2. Garnier Hair Filler + Bonding for 5 minutes (new)\n3. Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration conditioner and detangle\n4. While still in shower and hair is dripping wet, apply Aussie Sprunch mousse + leave-in conditioner \n5. Shake head so hair isn't dripping, but still really wet to get out of shower (new)\n6. Apply small amount of Lush Super Milk (not really enough to do anything, I just like the smell 😁)\n7. Section top of hair into two sections and apply Ouidad Advanced Climate Control strong hold gel generously \n8. Brush through and style with Denman brush\n9. Scrunch out excess water with microfiber towel\n10. Apply a light layer of watered down gel \n11. Spray EVA NYC Shapeshifter hair spray (newish- I've done this a few times)\n12. Hover diffuse on low speed and low heat until 60% dry, then air dry the rest of the way (new, as I had been diffusing until 100% dry, which I don't think my hair liked)\n13. Slept in satin bonnet then shook hair at the roots this morning and sprayed a little water and did a dry SOTC\n\nEdit: added step 11 that I forgot",

I discovered that the reason why I had dry skin isn’t because my moisturizer isn’t good enough but the flakes were because of a damaged barrier, and that’s when the first domino fell, I got a cica cream and then thought about fixing hyperpigmentation on my elbows with glycolic acid and now I want to add retinol for uneven skin tone and some small crater scars from chicken pox when I was 6, I am aware that the scars may be permanent now but I am also thinking about adding at home microneedling stamp to help fade it to its extent. Now that’s my main concern but as a side concern I also have some back acne scars that I’ve never paid attention to since the acne was never visible and I wanted to know if retinol would be enough for those and also I have some stretch marks on my hips and lower back which I wanted to use microneedling and retinol.\n\nEXCUSE THE YAPPING, now is there something I should know before proceeding, and would the use of Vitamin C and/or glycolic acid help my issue? and what products/brands do you suggest and which ones to stay away from? For now I use the la Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 and their Anthelios UVmune400 SPF50 sunscreen for my face and The ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% for my elbows and thinking about adding a Cica body lotion",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi! I’m having a hard time figuring out how to manage my hair and would really appreciate some advice.\n\nMy curl pattern is really mixed. The underneath and lower back sections of my hair are around 2C/3A, but the top layer is more like 2B. After a few days, the top section falls flat and almost straight, while the bottom stays wavy/curly. It makes my hair look uneven — like it’s big and frizzy on top but curlier underneath — instead of defined and put together.  I'm not sure if its because it flattens when I sleep or if I need a bonnet, but i dont think my hair is curly enough to need that?\n\nAnother big issue is dryness. My hair always *feels* dry and kind of rough, even though I deep condition and use oils. It only feels properly moisturised when it’s soaking wet, and once it dries, or even gets damp, that dry/frizzy texture comes back.\n\nI’d love advice on things like:\n\n* how to style a mixed curl pattern, especially getting the top layer to hold waves/curls longer\n* how to stop the crown from going flat\n* why my hair still feels dry even after conditioning and oil\n* any product recommendations for moisture and frizz control (leave-ins, creams, gels, etc.)\n* Any styling tips for wavy hair, I can only really find stuff for curly hair and I'm not sure if it would still work for me?\n\nTysm! I feel like I’m constantly fighting my hair every wash day 😭😭😭\n\nRoutine:\n\n* Oil ends with coconut oil for an hour before shower\n* double cleanse with aussie curly shampoo\n* aussie curly deep conditioner\n* aussie curl hair oil\n* (I dont really style it too much, i just scrunch and air dry as i dont really know how)\n\nP.s. I'll be honest and say I'm still pretty new to this whole curly hair stuff and i can't really afford high end products, so any help at all would be appreciated, whether its styling sleep protection, products or just tips and tricks!",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy sister has been struggling with a lot of acne and small breakouts on her back. The bumps are tiny, rough, and kind of feel like thorns or goosebumps. They’re not very inflamed but make the skin texture really uneven.\n\nWe were thinking of trying the Dove 1% Salicylic Acid body wash and wanted to know if it actually helps with this kind of back acne / clogged pores. Has anyone used it for similar issues?\n\nAlso, how long does it usually take to see results, and is it safe for regular use? Any advice or alternative suggestions would be really appreciated. Thanks! 😊",

I've been using it for ca 2-3 months, and it's starting to get empty. I like the product, and feel like it's helping a bit. I also just like the feel of applying it and doing my small \"skincare\" routine in the evening (i don't really use so much else, other than a BHA and moisturizer).\n\nIt's veeeery pricey, and I am looking into the possibilities of changing to another brand. I've been looking at The Ordinary and The Inkey List, but have been finding different opinions, and also people saying that it breaks them out or pills off. My skin isn't really very sensitive or acne-prone, but it would be nice to not add anything that would affect my skin negatively. Would anyone want to share their experiences with these brands, or recommend other brands that might go under the radar? Thank you so much!",

      "content": "Hi! A post was made on here a couple years back where someone was having the same struggles, but it’s not very recent. I’m a 19yo F and I struggle with combination skin where I consistently get painful inflammatory acne around my period and deep, stubborn clogged pores in the oily areas (mainly my t-zone). For the dryer areas, around my mouth and eyes, I tend to struggle with eczema during the dry months. As for my acne, I’m bad about picking at it and causing bright red spots, but it’s mainly because it’s painful and often won’t go away for a long time until I do mess with it. I can really only use inexpensive products due to being a broke college student, so any recommendations within a budget would be appreciated. This is my current routine that is not working at all for me right now, but did during the summer months:\n\nMorning: I try to stick to water so as not to irritate my skin, then use an SPF (still haven’t found one that doesn’t get greasy or pill that I like)\n\nNight:\n\n\\-If I wear makeup (all non comedogenic): Remove with ELF Holy Hydration cleansing balm\n\n\\-Cleanser: 10% PanOxyl (ik it’s harsh but during the summer, when my skin is more oily and I get nodular acne, it’s all that helps)\n\n\\-If my skin needs exfoliating to remove dead skin (usually to look better under makeup): PanOxyl Clarifying Exfoliant with 2% Salicylic Acid on a cotton round\n\n\\-Acne Spot Treatment: Adapalene 0.1% gel\n\n\\-Moisturizer: PanOxyl PM Balancing Repair Moisturizer, Niacinamide and Ceramides\n\n\\-When my eczema is flaring up: Skip anything but Vanicream Gentle Cleanser, Hydrocortisone OTC, and Vanicream Moisturizing Cream for the areas that have said eczema.\n\nPlease help! My face is a red, blotchy, flaky, scabby, hot mess and I’ll do anything at this point. Should I just go ahead and see a dermatologist?",

It doesn’t last long, takes an eternity to dry and sometimes still feels a teeny bit wet the next day. I have some mild wet frizz and just lack of definition overall. It’s usually 2c/3a. Low-medium porosity.\n\nFor my routine i’m styling upside down in sections and using  L’oréal everpure clarifying shampoo and head and shoulders alternating. I wash my hair every 2-3 days. Im using head and shoulders conditioner and detangling in the shower. NYM curl talk curl defining cream, (very little), NYM curl talk flash freeze gel, and Xmondo wave tech foam.\n\nI was looking into getting NYM conditioner and mousse because it supposedly has protein. Also looking at Curlsmith rebond salve. Or do i need something else? If there’s any treatments or tips you can share i’d be so grateful!",

      "content": "hi y'all! recently i purchased a new shampoo and i was wondering if it was safe to use regularly, if i should use it only sometimes or if i shouldn't use it at all. (picture of the shampoo ingredients included).\n\ni was thinking it might be clarifying as it has both sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate, but i also saw it contains dimethiconol... i'm unsure if this is similar to dimethicone? i purchased it to use regularly as i tend to put products on my hair (curl cream, hair gel, mousse + hair oil) and i don't want my hair to look greasy or weighed down and i want to get rid of product build up from the get go, but i'm afraid that by using it regularly i might be drying out my hair, causing frizz or damaging it.\n\npardon the frizzy (day 4) hair! i tried to refresh it and did it wrong lmao, it normally doesn't look this frizzy on day 4 but i'm planning on washing tomorrow as i recently purchased a new bonnet (the other one was too big for me... might use that one when i have more hair as i want to grow it out a lot more) and it's getting here tomorrow as well! i'm low porosity, and i believe medium to high density and medium texture.\n\nmy routine (sorry if some of the ingredients are in spanish, i'm not a chemist and idk how to translate the ingredients to english and could only find them in spanish):\n\n* i wait for all my hair to get wet, then i wash my scalp with the *herbal essences anti-frizz lavender &amp; almond oil shampoo* (ingredients on first picture), using only my fingers. i apply most product to the back of my scalp, some to the sides, and then the rest to the front. i then rinse it out, and i repeat this step twice.\n* i put the *herbal essences anti-frizz lavender &amp; almond oil conditioner* on my mids and ends and let it sit there for 5-15 minutes (i'm trying to squish-to-condish and i think i'm doing it right?), i detangle with the conditioner still on using a wet brush, starting from the ends and then moving up towards the roots, after i'm finished with detangling i rinse the conditioner out.\n   * **CONDITIONER INGREDIENTS:** Aqua, Stearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Parfum, Benzyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Disodium Edta, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citric Acid, Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool, Citronellol, Benzyl Salicylate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Citral, Lavandula Angustifolia Flower Extract, Benzyl Benzoate, Coumarin, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.\n* after finishing that, i make sure my hair is pretty wet to add more products. i section my hair and apply curl cream, specifically the *herbal essences defined curls &amp; anti-frizz curl cream*, and after i'm done putting it on my mids and ends (+ the bangs) via raking and using the praying hands method, then i scrunch.\n   * **CURL CREAM INGREDIENTS:** Agua, Dimethicone, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Quaternium-18, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sorbitan Caprylate, Benzyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Parfum, Peg-2m, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oleyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Citric Acid, Polysorbate 60, Hexyl Cinnamal, Zea Mays Silk Extract, Prunus Serotina Fruit Extract, Orchis Mascula Flower Extract.\n* i section my hair again, and i apply mousse on my roots and ends, scrunching it into my hair. i used the *aqua net perfect curls mousse*, but this next wash way i'm switching it up to the *herbal essences curly hair mousse* as i don't feel like the aqua net mousse makes my hair look as voluminous as i would like it to be... and back when i started on my curly hair journey i used the *herbal essences perfect waves mousse* and i felt like it made my hair look good, so i thought of switching back to their products but this time using one meant for curly hair.\n   * **CURRENT MOUSSE INGREDIENTS:** Aqua, Isobutane, Propane, Polyquaternium-4, Cetet 10, Copolímero de Octacrilamida / Acrilato / Butilaminoetil Metacrilato, DMDM Hidantoína, PEG-40 Aceite de Castor Hidrogenado, Dimethicone, Fragancia, Lauret-4, Aminometil Propanol, Ácido cítrico y Extracto de Cacao Theobroma.\n   * **FUTURE MOUSSE INGREDIENTS:** Aqua, Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Polyquaternium-11, Polyquaternium-4, Phenoxyethanol, Laureth-23, Isoceteth-20, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Peg/Ppg-18/18 Dimethicone, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal.\n* finally, i section for the final time, brush through my hair using an old brush that looks like a denman brush (unsure as to what brush it actually is, but it's pretty much a 9 row denman brush, picture attached as well). after brush styling it, i apply the *xtreme lady gel* using the praying hands method and then scrunching. i'm thinking of switching this up a little and applying the gel before i brush through because it might be easier for me? idk.\n   * **GEL INGREDIENTS:** Aqua (Water, Eau), Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylic Acid, Parfum (Fragance), Tetrasodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Chitosan Succinamide, Polyquatemium-10, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Geraniol, Methoxycinnamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Pantenol, Ext. Violet 2 (CI 60730), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice.\n* after ALL THAT, i diffuse my hair! i use medium heat and high speed because i just don't have the time to diffuse all my hair... it normally takes me TOO LONG if i diffuse on medium speed so... i hover diffuse my roots while switching up my head position (upside down, sides, leaning back...), then begin hover diffusing my ends and mids after my roots have dried up a little. after my roots are pretty dry i press the diffuser up to my roots and move it in a circular motion slightly to get more volume. when i feel a cast is at least somewhat formed i begin cup diffusing and scrunching my hair slightly. i keep doing that until my hair is all dry.\n* i don't usually break the cast, as i go to sleep with it on. i tie my hair up in a loose pineapple bun and i put on my bonnet (i use the *xl kitsch bonnet* but i'm switching it up to the *yanibest silk bonnet* in size large because the kitsch bonnet is currently too big for my hair).\n* when i wake up i use the *ogx renewing argan oil of morocco extra penetrating oil*, (i used to use the *kerashine silica pretherapy argan treatment*, but i switched two days ago as i felt it didn't do anything to tame the frizz and i had finally run out), i do the prayer hands method through the mids and ends of my hair, and then i fluff out my roots gently using my fingers!\n\ni believe that is everything... i don't usually refresh, as when i try i tend to do it wrong and haven't gotten the hang of how to refresh lmao.",
