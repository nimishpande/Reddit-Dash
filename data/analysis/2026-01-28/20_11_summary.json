Burns, cuts, pimples—you name it. It works quickly and soothes the skin really well. Apparently, it can also be consumed for digestive or internal issues, but I haven’t personally tried that.\n\n2.\tBoronil – Super effective for dry or irritated skin. I like to keep it on hand; it’s like an Ayurvedic moisturizer with healing properties. I use it for face lips and hands.\n\n3.\tTup Anjan (ghee-based eye balm) – This one’s underrated! I use it for dry or tired eyes, and surprisingly, it helps me sleep better too.\n\nWould love to hear if others have discovered lesser-known Ayurvedic or traditional remedies that actually work for everyday use.

La Roche-Posay Cicablast Baume B5+**\n\n**10/10 HG**\n\nI’ve been getting this product (incidentally, through a friend of my husband’s) for over a year now because I have very dry eczema prone skin. And I love this shit. my biggest gripe is that i run out of it so soon. It’s a thick THICK occlusive cream which I apply as the last step in my PM routine and wake up with “healthy” feeling skin.\n\n**2. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume**\n\n**8/10 Will always RP**\n\nThis one feels a lot more hydrating than LRP if that makes sense? So typically I use this in the mornings when I am not layering too many products and I need the same moisturiser to hydrate and seal\n\n**3. Skin1004 Centella Light Cleansing Oil**\n\n**8/10 Will always RP**\n\nSo I use this because my absolute holy grail Softymo Speedy is very hard to source in India. This one is lightweight though and smells really really good \n\n**4. numbuzin no. 2 protein creamy serum**\n\n**9/10 WRP**\n\nI am fairly new to this. But the texture of this has to be the best I have ever used and I have used a ton of milky toners. It’s actually thicker than milky toners/ usual serums, almost a body lotion texture if you will.  Thats why I love it so much for my DRY dry skin\n\nI am just not very sure if I absolutely need this in my routine given that I already use so many other barrier repair products all the time. But most likely will repurchase just to have it handy for extra dry days. \n\n**5. Skin1004 Centella Sunstick**\n\n**9/10 Will always RP**\n\nHeadsup: I don’t use it over makeup. I just reapply through the day when i am not wearing makeup using this because it feels like nothing on your skin. not sticky not heavy. Love it for that reason \n\nCiao✨",

So years later i still deal with occasional spots that keep giving me more PIE scars.\n\nI see everywhere saying it heals in 6-12months but it’s been 4+ years for me and some acne scars i had then i still see now.\n\nDoes anyone know how to completely fade them away for good? And how to heal fresh ones quick too? It would be very helpful :)\n\nMy skin type: **Combination, sensitive, acne prone**\n\nMy **current routine** focusing on **barrier damage** control:\n\n**AM:**\n\n\\- Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser (normal to oily, sensitive skin)\n\n\\- Eucerin SPF 50 Oil Acne Prone Skin\n\n**PM:**\n\n\\- Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser\n\n\\- The Ordinary Azelaic Acid 10% (every two days)\n\n\\- Cicaplast Baume B5+\n\nI’ve tried Azelaic acid for years i honestly don’t think it’s doing anything. I even got prescribed Skinoren 20% it didn’t do much either. I’m very consistent with spf and cleansing. I just feel like my old PIE scars just never want to leave. I’ve been working on barrier control but i feel like i am going in a loop of pie healing yet getting more acne. (it’s also hormonal acne)\n\nAny suggestions on what to do for years old PIE? \n\nI saw this person suggest **Silicone Gel Sheets**, could be a safe test?",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Today was the first time I’ve tried a different routine, I got my hair damp, applied a air foam mousse, and then put a little bit of curling cream in my hair, I then proceeded to scrunch my hair and let it hair dry, these pictures are a couple hours after. My question, is it supposed to look like this or did I mess up the new hair routine. If so, is there any advice that you can give me for the future? Thanks.",

      "content": "I have thin straight 1A hair, I wouldn’t say my hair is very fine but it is most definitely nowhere near thick. I've used multiple shampoos, from loreal, to head n shoulders which claims to work on all hair types, to even a special shampoo called \"Milk Shake\" that I’ve heard is good and none have been able to sort out my greasy hair issue. I washed my hair yesterday with head n shoulders and right now I'm sitting with my curtain bangs being greasy. Even after I wash them the next day I am still left with greasy bangs. It's extremely annoying especially when summer arrives because my issue becomes worse. I can't last even a day without my hair becoming greasy and it's really embarrassing and annoying because it seems as if I don’t wash my hair when I do. I wash my hair every 2 days otherwise it will look like oil was spilled on my head. Even after one day of no washing it tends to looks bad. I try to scrub my scalp well and most times I try not to brush or touch my hair with dirty hands some may say that my pillowcase isn’t washed but I reassure you my sheets get switched into clean ones often. I believe maybe it’s a product issue, but finding a shampoo/conditioner from some good brand with a well price is difficult as most are way over 50 euros and my budget would be typically below that. Can anyone give me some products or solutions to fix it..? Any solutions would do wonders as I have been struggling for a long time now!",

Mostly off. Pretty inconsistent)\n\n6) CerVe eye repair cream for dark circles and puffy under eyes (used 5+ years). I have tried other eye creams throught out the years but have gone back to this one. \n\n7) CerVe moisturizing cream (used 5+ years)\n\n8 every other night) RoC retinol Correxion (used 5+ years) \n\n9) Dr. Melaxin Cemenrete Calcium Volume Multi Balm (used less than a month) \n\n11) moisture again often. Not always. With CerVe.\n\n10)under eye collagen eye mask. Been using random brands but going to use Dr. Melaxin  (used on and off for years.
