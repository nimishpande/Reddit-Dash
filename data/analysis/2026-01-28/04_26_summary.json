      "title": "Since a lot of people asked in my last posts, I made a rough guide/tutorial (In Post Body)",
      "content": "Before I get in to the actual details I think a lot of it is just genetics. I got blessed with good hair color, and my hair is naturally thick and doesn't break easily. A lot of my routine is based around minimizing frizz because my hair will naturally form curls very easily. The first two pictures I attached to the post were Day 3 morning hair so you can see some frizz showing up. The last one is after being out working in humidity for that full day.\n\n\n\n# Basic Care\n\nThe one thing I think I have done for my hair that's been super beneficial is that I have never used heat products. If you straighten/curl your hair on certain occasions you're probably fine honestly, I choose not to just to play it safe.\n\nBesides that you probably already know most of the things. A silk bonnet or a silk pillow case is always a good idea, not dunking your hair in buckets of dirt and grease (or just using too much product) will also definitely help. Keep it tied back during physical activity in order to prevent knots and frizz.\n\n\n\n# Wash Routine\n\nA lot of my routine is based off of the Curly Girl Method (CGM). While CGM does take it a bit far in my opinion a lot of my routine is taken from it. If you are interested you can find a lot of guides on reddit, but be careful as it can cause product build up.\n\nWhat I have found works best for me is-\n\n1. Get hair DRENCHED as much as possible\n2. Detangling with a curl defining hair brush (skip this if you have fine hair or hair that easily tangles)\n3. Shampoo (2x a week, or if hair is greasy/dirty)\n4. Rinse thoroughly\n5. A LOT of conditioner, brush through with curl defining brush.\n6. Let conditioner sit for \\~3 minutes\n7. Rinse thoroughly \n8. While hair is still dripping wet use product, comb through or just scrunch in depending on product (skip if you feel like you are starting to get product buildup or if its just not needed)\n9. Scrunch extra water out with hands\n\nAfter that my hair is still \"wet\" by most standards but I normally go to sleep since I shower right before bed. There is probably a hundred reasons not to do that but when I wake up its always tangle free and I just need to scrunch/shake it out which is really nice in the mornings. I use a silk pillow case so I just \"whip\" my hair on to it before I sleep.\n\nThis is what I have found works for me, if you know something doesn't work for you personally just swap it out or skip it.\n\n# Products\n\nI say this with complete sincerity there is one product I would literally go to war for. [Lush Super Milk](https://www.lush.com/us/en_us/p/super-milk-conditioning-spray/100ml) is my absolute saving grace. I never skip using this, it prevents frizz and smells amazing. The only other product I use is [Function of Beauty Curl Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Function-Beauty-Curl-Cream-Curly/dp/B0CT2FY1S5), it helps to revive my hair but I don't use it every time.\n\nFor shampoo and conditioner I honestly use anything that says curly on it. However what I normally use when I can get my hands on it is the [Aussie Miracle Curls](https://www.amazon.com/Aussie-Miracle-Curls-Collection-Conditioner/dp/B0886XTJDN) line (the link has the full set but I recommend just getting the shampoo/conditioner).\n\n# Closing\n\nLike I said this is definitely not perfect for everyone but I find it works nicely for me. If anyone has any advice for me I would love to hear it. Improving a routine never hurts :)",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

The bumps are tiny, rough, and kind of feel like thorns or goosebumps. They’re not very inflamed but make the skin texture really uneven.\n\nWe were thinking of trying the Dove 1% Salicylic Acid body wash and wanted to know if it actually helps with this kind of back acne / clogged pores. Has anyone used it for similar issues?\n\nAlso, how long does it usually take to see results, and is it safe for regular use? Any advice or alternative suggestions would be really appreciated. Thanks! 😊",

If I did get bangs, I would certainly be willing to blow dry/style them as needed. Thanks in advance for any advice/input :) ",

Any advice on how to get my roots and back of head to curl? Or is it just going to take way longer for the roots to start curling? Is it just my hair type or am I doing something wrong?\n\n\n\n🎀 HAIR ROUTINE 🎀\n\n   Ask for face framing long\n\n\\- \\[x\\] 1st Week: Hydration Week → Hydration Shampoo, Hydration Hair Masque, Hydration Conditioner (add Hydration Masque only once if washing more than once that week) Jan 27\n\n\\- \\[ \\] 2nd Week: Protein Week → Hydration Shampoo + bonding protein treatment. “Bond repair masque” green bottle \n\n\\- \\[ \\] 3rd Week: Hydration Week → Hydration Shampoo + Conditioner (Hydration Masque if dry) \n\n\\- \\[ \\] Clarify Week → Clarifying Shampoo (2 lathers) + Protein Masque\n\n⸻\n\n🧴 Wash Products\n\n1. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo\n\n\t•\tUse: Weekly (non-clarify weeks)\n\n\t•\tHow: Focus on scalp &amp; roots only. Massage with fingertips (not nails). Let suds run through lengths as you rinse.\n\n\t•\tRinse: Thoroughly with lukewarm water.\n\n2. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner\n\n\t•\tUse: Weekly (after Hydration Shampoo, except Clarify Week)\n\n\t•\tHow: Apply to mid-lengths &amp; ends (avoid roots to prevent heaviness). Use wide-tooth comb or fingers to detangle.\n\n\t•\tRinse: After 3–5 minutes, rinse lightly (leave a little slip if your hair likes it).\n\n3. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Masque\n\n\t•\tUse: Every 1–2 weeks (instead of conditioner).\n\n\t•\tHow: Apply generously mid-lengths → ends. Detangle with wide-tooth comb. Smooth with “praying hands.”\n\n\t•\tWait: 10–15 minutes (cover with cap for extra effect).\n\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n4. SheaMoisture Protein Masque\n\n\t•\tUse: Once a month (after Clarifying Shampoo).\n\n\t•\tHow: Section hair, apply mid-lengths → ends first, then lightly on roots if needed. Brush through for even coverage. Light scrunch to help curls.\n\n\t•\tWait: 10–15 minutes.\n\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n\t•\tConditioner: Skip (this masque replaces it).\n\n5. SheaMoisture Strengthen &amp; Restore Clarifying Shampoo\n\n\t•\tUse: Once a month (Clarify Week).\n\n\t•\tHow: Do 2 lathers — first lifts buildup, second deep cleans. Focus on scalp, let suds rinse through lengths.\n\n\t•\tFollow with: Protein Masque (not conditioner).\n\n6. SheaMoisture Bond Repair Masque (optional/alternate)\n\n\t•\tUse: Every 2–3 weeks or when hair feels weak/breaking.\n\n\t•\tHow: Same as Hydration Masque — mid-lengths → ends, detangle, smooth in.\n\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n⸻\n\n🌿 Leave-In &amp; Styling Products\n\n7. Curlsmith Frizz Rescue Curl Retainer\n\n\t•\tUse: After cream (daily).\n\n\t•\tHow: Scrunch into damp hair, focusing on mid-lengths &amp; ends. This helps lock curl shape and reduce frizz.\n\n\t•\tTip: Use hands or microfiber towel to “cup &amp; scrunch” upward.\n\n8. Curlsmith Frizz Rescue Finishing Serum\n\n\t•\tUse: After styling, when hair is 100% dry.\n\n\t•\tHow: Warm 2–3 drops in hands, then scrunch out any crunch or frizz. Glide lightly over surface for shine.\n\n\t•\tWhen: End of styling, or as touch-up on dry hair between washes.\n\n⸻\n\nIn shower process:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT TO DO\tWHY\n\n1\tDetangle only with conditioner in\tPrevents root stretch\n\n2\tRinse conditioner thoroughly\tSlip flattens roots\n\n3\tLight scrunch before turning water off\tEncourages curl memory\n\n4\tExit shower with hair clumped\tPreserves pattern\n\nWash day styling:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT TO DO\tWHY\n\n1\tKeep hair soaking wet\tCurl forms only when wet\n\n2\tDetangle once (wide tooth, straight down)\tNo shaping yet\n\n3\tApply Curl Retainer FIRST (diluted)\tRoots need early hold\n\n4\tRoot Pinch: small sections, pinch curl upward at scalp (2–3 sec)\tShortens curl path\n\n5\tOne gentle scrunch (mid → root)\tActivates curl upward\n\n6\tDirectional set: push hair forward → back → side to side\tPrevents straight drying\n\n7\tOptional: ½ pea cream on ends only\tSoftness without slip\n\n8\tOptional micro-plop 2–3 min max\tEncourages curl, protects roots\n\nDiffusing for root curl:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT TO DO\tWHY\n\n1\tSet diffuser to low heat + low airflow\tPrevents stretch\n\n2\tStart diffusing at the roots first\tSets curl near scalp\n\n3\tHold diffuser bowl close to scalp but not touching\tEncourages lift\n\n4\tDiffuse in short holds (15–30 sec), then move\tPrevents frizz\n\n5\tTilt head side to side, forward slightly\tCreates root bend\n\n6\tDiffuse lengths last\tPrevents pulling curls down\n\n7\tStop at 90–95% dry\tAvoids over-dry stretch\n\nAfter shower:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT TO DO\tWHY\n\n1\tLet hair cool fully\tSets curl\n\n2\tScrunch out cast gently\tSoftens curls\n\n3\tSeparate only thick clumps\tLess Victorian look\n\n4\tOptional serum on ends\tSeal, don’t weigh down\n\nFront hair line:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT YOU DO\tHOW / NOTES\n\n1\tHair fully wet + styled\tCurl retainer already applied\n\n2\tApply extra-light retainer at hairline\tUse residue on hands only\n\n3\tRoot pinch at hairline\tSmall sections, pinch upward 2–3 sec\n\n4\tTilt head slightly back\tNOT upside down\n\n5\tPlace diffuser bowl close to scalp\tDo not press into skin\n\n6\tHold diffuser 15–20 seconds\tThen lower gently\n\n7\tMove bowl along hairline\tTemple → center → temple\n\n8\tStop when hairline is 80–90% dry\tOver-drying flattens\n\nPinch → tilt back → bowl close → short holds\n\nDay 2 refresh:\n\nSTEP\tWHAT YOU DO\tHOW / NOTES\n\n1\tLightly mist roots first\tSpray or wet fingertips\n\n2\tOptional: diluted curl retainer\tPea-size TOTAL, watered down\n\n3\tRoot pinch at flat areas\tEspecially hairline + crown\n\n4\tOne light scrunch mid → root\tStop early\n\n5\tDiffuse on low heat + low airflow\tSame settings as wash day\n\n6\tStart diffusing at roots\tRoots before ends\n\n7\tTilt head side-to-side\tEncourages bend\n\n8\tStop at 90% dry\tPrevents frizz &amp; stretch\n\nMist roots → pinch → light scrunch → diffuse roots → stop early",

It’s supposed to resemble a lighter brown with some blonde thrown in here and there. \n\nIs this normal just as a way to protect my scalp or something or is it just a bad highlight job?

I don’t think the cleansers are the problem.\n\nBefore, I was using the cerave oil control moisturiser, but that used to make my skin oilier and gave it an orange tint? Back then, I had no closed comedones at all, but the redness and dullness bothered me and I’m sure it was the moisturiser 😭\n\nI honestly have no idea what to do, everything is a risk for my skin. Has anyone with similar skin problems got any products that have worked for them?

      "content": "Hi! I’m having a hard time figuring out how to manage my hair and would really appreciate some advice.\n\nMy curl pattern is really mixed. The underneath and lower back sections of my hair are around 2C/3A, but the top layer is more like 2B. After a few days, the top section falls flat and almost straight, while the bottom stays wavy/curly. It makes my hair look uneven — like it’s big and frizzy on top but curlier underneath — instead of defined and put together.  I'm not sure if its because it flattens when I sleep or if I need a bonnet, but i dont think my hair is curly enough to need that?\n\nAnother big issue is dryness. My hair always *feels* dry and kind of rough, even though I deep condition and use oils. It only feels properly moisturised when it’s soaking wet, and once it dries, or even gets damp, that dry/frizzy texture comes back.\n\nI’d love advice on things like:\n\n* how to style a mixed curl pattern, especially getting the top layer to hold waves/curls longer\n* how to stop the crown from going flat\n* why my hair still feels dry even after conditioning and oil\n* any product recommendations for moisture and frizz control (leave-ins, creams, gels, etc.)\n* Any styling tips for wavy hair, I can only really find stuff for curly hair and I'm not sure if it would still work for me?\n\nTysm! I feel like I’m constantly fighting my hair every wash day 😭😭😭\n\nRoutine:\n\n* Oil ends with coconut oil for an hour before shower\n* double cleanse with aussie curly shampoo\n* aussie curly deep conditioner\n* aussie curl hair oil\n* (I dont really style it too much, i just scrunch and air dry as i dont really know how)\n\nP.s. I'll be honest and say I'm still pretty new to this whole curly hair stuff and i can't really afford high end products, so any help at all would be appreciated, whether its styling sleep protection, products or just tips and tricks!",
