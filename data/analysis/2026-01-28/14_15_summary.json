My underarms just refused to behave and it honestly made me feel humiliated especially when wearing sleeveless.  \n  \nI’ve tried several underarm products before, mostly budget friendly ones, but nothing really worked long term. So in that trial phase, I decided to give the be bodywise underarm roll on a chance too. It’s been few weeks now, and honestly, it’s been pretty good to me. It keeps things fresh for a long time, doesn’t sting (only purpose for me particularly) additionally doesn’t feel sticky either. I wouldn’t call it magic but compared to what I was dealing with earlier it’s been a noticeable improvement.  \n  \nAs it’s been only few weeks-  i wanted to know if anybody honestly has been using it for long term and seen good results ?",

Most recently are the Nivea day cream (not moisturising, at all.), cetaphil rich night cream (I would believe you if you told me I had rubbed chilli oil on my face), no.7 radiance vitamin 2 moisturiser - best in terms of hydration but still made my skin burn a little and isn’t all that moisturising and the simple hydrating light moisturiser (works pretty well but not really enough moisture for me). Originally, I thought it might be a damaged skin barrier but after reducing my routine to three products (the other two are holy grails) I’m lost on what to do with my moisturiser. I have really dry skin in my t-zone to the point of my skin peeling and cracking so I absolutely need a moisturiser but I’m scared to waste anymore money on moisturisers that are simply going to burn and irritate me.\n\nI’m fairly certain I have combination skin and my other two products are the Thayers milky toner and the cetaphil daily facial cleanser. I used to use the simple soothing toner however I’ve cut it out since I’ve had all these moisturiser based issues. Does anyone know any ingredients that could be causing this issue and have any recommendations? ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "title": "Since a lot of people asked in my last posts, I made a rough guide/tutorial (In Post Body)",
      "content": "Before I get in to the actual details I think a lot of it is just genetics. I got blessed with good hair color, and my hair is naturally thick and doesn't break easily. A lot of my routine is based around minimizing frizz because my hair will naturally form curls very easily. The first two pictures I attached to the post were Day 3 morning hair so you can see some frizz showing up. The last one is after being out working in humidity for that full day.\n\n\n\n# Basic Care\n\nThe one thing I think I have done for my hair that's been super beneficial is that I have never used heat products. If you straighten/curl your hair on certain occasions you're probably fine honestly, I choose not to just to play it safe.\n\nBesides that you probably already know most of the things. A silk bonnet or a silk pillow case is always a good idea, not dunking your hair in buckets of dirt and grease (or just using too much product) will also definitely help. Keep it tied back during physical activity in order to prevent knots and frizz.\n\n\n\n# Wash Routine\n\nA lot of my routine is based off of the Curly Girl Method (CGM). While CGM does take it a bit far in my opinion a lot of my routine is taken from it. If you are interested you can find a lot of guides on reddit, but be careful as it can cause product build up.\n\nWhat I have found works best for me is-\n\n1. Get hair DRENCHED as much as possible\n2. Detangling with a curl defining hair brush (skip this if you have fine hair or hair that easily tangles)\n3. Shampoo (2x a week, or if hair is greasy/dirty)\n4. Rinse thoroughly\n5. A LOT of conditioner, brush through with curl defining brush.\n6. Let conditioner sit for \\~3 minutes\n7. Rinse thoroughly \n8. While hair is still dripping wet use product, comb through or just scrunch in depending on product (skip if you feel like you are starting to get product buildup or if its just not needed)\n9. Scrunch extra water out with hands\n\nAfter that my hair is still \"wet\" by most standards but I normally go to sleep since I shower right before bed. There is probably a hundred reasons not to do that but when I wake up its always tangle free and I just need to scrunch/shake it out which is really nice in the mornings. I use a silk pillow case so I just \"whip\" my hair on to it before I sleep.\n\nThis is what I have found works for me, if you know something doesn't work for you personally just swap it out or skip it.\n\n# Products\n\nI say this with complete sincerity there is one product I would literally go to war for. [Lush Super Milk](https://www.lush.com/us/en_us/p/super-milk-conditioning-spray/100ml) is my absolute saving grace. I never skip using this, it prevents frizz and smells amazing. The only other product I use is [Function of Beauty Curl Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Function-Beauty-Curl-Cream-Curly/dp/B0CT2FY1S5), it helps to revive my hair but I don't use it every time.\n\nFor shampoo and conditioner I honestly use anything that says curly on it. However what I normally use when I can get my hands on it is the [Aussie Miracle Curls](https://www.amazon.com/Aussie-Miracle-Curls-Collection-Conditioner/dp/B0886XTJDN) line (the link has the full set but I recommend just getting the shampoo/conditioner).\n\n# Closing\n\nLike I said this is definitely not perfect for everyone but I find it works nicely for me. If anyone has any advice for me I would love to hear it. Improving a routine never hurts :)",

I’ve been using a little dandruff shampoo for about two weeks now, about 2 X a week. The redness hasn’t went away so far. I have extremely dryyyy and sensitive skin this winter. I tend to be dry and sensitive anyway but for some reason this winter has been the worst. I use vanicream in the tub or cerave lotion to moisturize my body and face. If I’m having a bad flare up I only cleanse with cerave hydrating cleanser and just moisturize. I’m eczema prone but this doesn’t feel/look like my typical eczema flare-ups at all. It’s not really itchy, it’s mainly raw and sore feeling if that makes sense? It seems like when I cleanse with my typical cleanser like cerave salicylic acid or Differin my skin gets angry and that’s never really happened before. I’m definitely making an appointment with the dermatologist, but has anyone had anything like this before?? If you have, do you have any suggestions on how to calm it down? It seems like vanicream is the only thing keeping my skin somewhat at bay. ",

I don’t usually get active acne, but the texture and dullness make my skin look tired. Over time the pigmentation hasn’t faded much, and my skin often feels dry even after cleansing and moisturizing.\n\n**Current Skincare Routine:**  \nRight now my routine is very basic:  \n• Sunscreen every day (I don’t skip it)  \n• Derma Co’s Kojic Acid face wash  \n• Aloe vera gel as my moisturizer\n\nI use sunscreen consistently, but apart from that I don’t use any serums, exfoliants, or actives. I feel like my skin needs more than this, but I’m not sure what to start with or how to introduce new products without irritating my skin.\n\n**What I’m Looking For**  \nI’m hoping for suggestions on:  \n• Specific ingredients that can help with pigmentation and dark spots  \n• What can improve **texture** and dullness in dry skin  \n• Affordable product recommendations (preferably under ₹700) for serums or treatments\n\nAny insights is much appreciated! :)",

(pls ignore my lashes in the pics)\n\nI’ll get these tiny bumps on my forehead that are sometimes itchy but not very often. occasionally I’ll also get these really fat singular pimples that have white pus? in it (shown in pic). But most of the time it’s just bumps that make my forehead look really textured. the bumps are sometimes red when it’s bad, but also when it’s not as bad, the bumps are skin colored. within the past couple month I’ve noticed that my acne will leave dark red/brown spots, which has never happened before. I did research on my own and I’ve come to the conclusion that I have either fungal acne or closed comedones but I’m not sure which?\n\nright now I just bought the ordinary azelaic acid 10% for my hyperpigmentation spots and I’m hoping that it works (anyone else have results with this?). But what do I do for the bumps? I have an oily t zone. my usual routine is Just cleanser toner and moisturizer (all anua)\n\nany advice is greatly appreciated!!!",

What followed was a masterclass in poor customer service and shifting excuses:\n\nFirst, they said freebies were “temporarily unavailable.”\n\nThen they said freebies “cannot be added retrospectively.”\n\nThen they said the offer “was not active that day.”\n\nMeanwhile, the same freebies were still being shown on their website.\n\nWhen I asked for a simple solution — either send the promised items or take the order back and refund me — they clearly said:\n\nthey won’t provide the freebies\n\nthey won’t accept a return\n\nthey won’t issue a refund\n\nNo accountability. No concern. Just scripted apologies and contradictions (screenshots attached).\n\nThis is not about “free stuff.”\n\nThis is about false promises, misleading promotions, and zero responsibility after payment.\n\nIf a brand advertises something to push customers to spend more, and then refuses to honor it — that’s not a mistake, that’s deceptive practice.\n\nI’m now left with 3 products and zero trust in the brand.\n\nPosting this so others can decide if this is the kind of brand they want to support.\n\nTransparency matters.

      "content": "hello everyone, I actually never use Reddit but I seriously dont know what to do anymore. ive had acne on my forehead since like 12 and I’ve never been able to clear it. (pls ignore my lashes in the pics)\n\nI’ll get these tiny bumps on my forehead that are sometimes itchy but not very often. occasionally I’ll also get these really fat singular pimples that have white pus? in it (shown in pic). But most of the time it’s just bumps that make my forehead look really textured. the bumps are sometimes red when it’s bad, but also when it’s not as bad, the bumps are skin colored. within the past couple month I’ve noticed that my acne will leave dark red/brown spots, which has never happened before. I did research on my own and I’ve come to the conclusion that I have either fungal acne or closed comedones but I’m not sure which?\n\nright now I just bought the ordinary azelaic acid 10% for my hyperpigmentation spots and I’m hoping that it works (anyone else have results with this?). But what do I do for the bumps? I have an oily t zone. my usual routine is Just cleanser toner and moisturizer.\n\nany advice is greatly appreciated!!!",

      "content": "Hi everyone :-) \n\nI recently tried making homemade flaxseed gel (1/4 cup to 2 cups of water), and I wanted advice on how to use it in styling/a good routine? I have very long (not waist length but maybe half way down my back), thick and dry hair maybe a 2C/3A pattern but I struggle with my hair being a bit frizzy and some sections curling nicely with others being just frizz/strings.\n\nSo i was wondering how much flaxseed gel are you meant to use in styling if its homemade and is it better to use in combination with other products like a leave in conditioner or mousse? (and if yes, how much ballpark of those products should i be using?) - i also air dry my hair or very partially diffuse it mainly due to length/thickness diffusing takes alot of time for me!\n\nToday i trialled maybe a 1/4 cup of flaxseed gel, 2 golf ball sized pumps of a strong hold mousse and two pea sized pumps of a curl cream - results were okay but same issue with some areas being stringy/frizzy and my hair also feels a bit stiff/frizzy even after scruching with a silk scarf and oil. I also dont think this would hold over multiple days.\n\nAny and all advice would be greatly appreciated! TYIA",
