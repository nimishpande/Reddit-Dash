      "title": "I aggregated hundreds of hair loss experiences. Here’s what actually shows up.",
      "content": "So… I’ve been scraping and aggregating user experiences from hair loss subs and forums, mostly to see what patterns show up when you look at hundreds of reports.\n\nSome of this lines up with what everyone already says. Some of it honestly surprised me, especially timelines and side effect frequencies.\n\n**Stuff that, umm, actually seems to work:**\n\nFinasteride (oral) + minoxidil is still the base for most people. When I looked at long-term success stories (like 5–20+ years), this combo is everywhere. A lot of people just maintain. Some even say hair quality got darker or thicker over time.\n\nRU58841 shows up a lot in aggressive stacks and usually with good stabilization. That said… the vehicle debate is real. PG versions seem to cause way more irritation and nonstop shedding for some people. Glycerin seems gentler but maybe worse absorption. Kind of a tradeoff.\n\nMicroneedling at \\~1.5mm weekly is almost universal in regrowth stacks that actually worked. The “it helps topicals absorb better” thing seems legit when you zoom out.\n\nOral minoxidil gets called a game changer constantly. But yeah, the early shedding freaks people out. Around 1–1.5 months a lot of users see nothing or worse and quit. People who stick it out usually see results around months 4–6.\n\nDutasteride is very much the nuclear option when fin isn’t enough. Switching often causes a shed first, then big improvement later. Also weirdly common to see people say their DHT stayed high despite being on it.\n\nLLLT laser caps show up in long, multi-year protocols. People feel good about them… but constantly debate whether the price is worth whatever they’re actually contributing.\n\n**Side effects that don’t get talked about much individually, but show up at scale:**\n\nFin sexual sides. Yeah, controversial. Aggregated, around \\~2–3% report persistent issues. Plenty of people run it for years with zero sides. Both things are clearly happening.\n\nOral minoxidil systemic concerns. Tons of people love it, but there’s always background anxiety about heart or BP stuff, even when users personally feel fine.\n\nRU58841 is not forgiving. Miss doses or stop and some people report rapid loss. This isn’t like fin where you can be casual.\n\n**Stuff that surprised me:**\n\nThe pumpkin / flax / sesame seed “natural DHT blocker” thing. Evidence is weak, community is skeptical… but one anecdote reported insanely low daily shedding and visible improvement. Worth a mention, not a recommendation.\n\nFluridil seems kind of underused. Shows up as a low-risk, entry-level topical anti-androgen with stabilization over \\~3–6 months.\n\nIntermittent fasting potentially triggering hair loss. Some studies suggest it may suppress follicle regeneration, and that actually lines up with anecdotes. Which is… not what you’d expect.\n\n**Quick reality check:**\n\nDoes this match what you’ve seen?  \nAm I missing anything big?  \nDo these timelines sound right?\n\nI’m doing this because hair loss marketing is pretty predatory, and clinical data is limited and sanitized. Aggregated real experiences are messy and biased, but maybe still useful.\n\nI’ve turned this into a [dataset](https://modernrelay.com/davidjohn10/hair-loss-insights), but wanted community feedback before sharing it more widely.\n\nAnyway… what am I missing?",

Burns, cuts, pimples—you name it. It works quickly and soothes the skin really well. Apparently, it can also be consumed for digestive or internal issues, but I haven’t personally tried that.\n\n2.\tBoronil – Super effective for dry or irritated skin. I like to keep it on hand; it’s like an Ayurvedic moisturizer with healing properties. I use it for face lips and hands.\n\n3.\tTup Anjan (ghee-based eye balm) – This one’s underrated! I use it for dry or tired eyes, and surprisingly, it helps me sleep better too.\n\nWould love to hear if others have discovered lesser-known Ayurvedic or traditional remedies that actually work for everyday use.

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a 21-year-old female dealing with persistent skin issues and I’d really appreciate some guidance.\n\nI’ve had severe acne and pigmentation since I was around 14–15. I started seeing a dermatologist at 18, and while the acne has mostly been controlled, the pigmentation has never truly improved.\n\nWhat treatments I’ve tried\n\n\t•\tTopical creams prescribed by my dermatologist\n\n\t•\tChemical peels — they temporarily even out my skin for about 1–2 weeks, but the pigmentation always comes back\n\n\t•\tI’ve been prescribed Golite cream multiple times, but I honestly don’t see any noticeable improvement\n\nMy current routine (derm-prescribed)\n\n\t•\tAcne Moist moisturizer\n\n\t•\tGolite cream\n\n\t•\tEye cream for dark circles\n\nCurrent concerns\n\n\t•\tVery dull, oily skin (no glow or freshness)\n\n\t•\tDark circles (I know poor sleep contributes)\n\n\t•\tSignificant pigmentation, especially:\n\n\t•\tNeck (I was born with torticollis, which may have contributed)\n\n\t•\tFace (uneven pigmentation)\n\n\t•\tUnderarms\n\n\t•\tOverall tanning on my body\n\n\t•\tMy face looks aged and tired for my age\n\nSunscreen issues (major problem)\n\nAlmost every sunscreen I try pills or leaves a heavy white cast:\n\n\t•\tAcne UV — terrible white cast\n\n\t•\tAcne Wash sunscreen — same issue\n\n\t•\tMinimalist sunscreen — feels weird on my skin and doesn’t fully absorb\n\nBecause of this, I end up using far less than the recommended amount, which I know defeats the purpose.\n\nEven with moisturizer, my skin still looks flat, lifeless, and dull, not healthy or youthful.\n\nMy questions\n\n\t•\tIs repeated chemical peeling really the best approach for long-term pigmentation?\n\n\t•\tWhy might Golite not be working, even after consistent use?\n\n\t•\tWhat kind of treatment or routine actually helps with:\n\n\t•\tChronic pigmentation\n\n\t•\tDull, oily skin\n\n\t•\tEarly signs of aging\n\n\t•\tHow do I fix sunscreen pilling and absorption on oily skin?\n\n\t•\tShould I consider changing dermatologists or asking for different treatment options?\n\nI’m feeling quite stuck because I’ve been consistent and patient, but I don’t see real progress. I just want my skin to look healthy, fresh, and age-appropriate again.\n\nAny advice, experiences, or product/treatment suggestions would be really helpful.\n\nThank you in advance 🤍",

      "content": "My husband has been keenly watching stuff i use on a regular basis and was kind enough to restock these.\n\nok truth is he was just checking out a new quick comm app for skincare (he himself works for a bigger quick comm company) and was getting a hefty new use discount, but i am just proud he at least got my products right!\n\nQuick reviews:\n\n**1. La Roche-Posay Cicablast Baume B5+**\n\n**10/10 HG**\n\nI’ve been getting this product (incidentally, through a friend of my husband’s) for over a year now because I have very dry eczema prone skin. And I love this shit. my biggest gripe is that i run out of it so soon. It’s a thick THICK occlusive cream which I apply as the last step in my PM routine and wake up with “healthy” feeling skin.\n\n**2. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume**\n\n**8/10 Will always RP**\n\nThis one feels a lot more hydrating than LRP if that makes sense? So typically I use this in the mornings when I am not layering too many products and I need the same moisturiser to hydrate and seal\n\n**3. Skin1004 Centella Light Cleansing Oil**\n\n**8/10 Will always RP**\n\nSo I use this because my absolute holy grail Softymo Speedy is very hard to source in India. This one is lightweight though and smells really really good \n\n**4. numbuzin no. 2 protein creamy serum**\n\n**9/10 WRP**\n\nI am fairly new to this. But the texture of this has to be the best I have ever used and I have used a ton of milky toners. It’s actually thicker than milky toners/ usual serums, almost a body lotion texture if you will.  Thats why I love it so much for my DRY dry skin\n\nI am just not very sure if I absolutely need this in my routine given that I already use so many other barrier repair products all the time. But most likely will repurchase just to have it handy for extra dry days. \n\n**5. Skin1004 Centella Sunstick**\n\n**9/10 Will always RP**\n\nHeadsup: I don’t use it over makeup. I just reapply through the day when i am not wearing makeup using this because it feels like nothing on your skin. not sticky not heavy. Love it for that reason \n\nCiao✨",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

My hair is the first image, I took the second as a reference.\n\nI said I have a natural wave to my hair, nothing too crazy but enough to lose around 1/2 inches of visual length when I wear it natural. I want to keep the length but add a lot of layering because I feel like my hair falls very flat especially near the top. I don't want anything cut above cheek length because I do tuck my hair behind my ears and wear it up often but as long as I can do that I'm happy to have shorter layers to help with texture and volume. I understand my hair is fine and not thick so I don't expect it to look exactly like the reference image but I'd like what ever the version of that haircut for my hair is.\n\nEvery time I come out with this haircut. Different hairdressers, different salons. It's a beautiful haircut but I just don't feel it's the one I asked for. Am I asking the wrong way? Is this the closest version my hair can produce? Any advice would be appreciated! ☺️\n\nP.s please ignore my dirty mirror 🙈 😅 ",

      "content": "Hello! I have a question about using retinol.\n\nToday I went to buy some skincare and was given two samples of La Roche-Posay Retinol B3 Serum (5 ml each), so about 10 ml total. They were meant as testers, but retinol isn’t like a regular cream you can just try once. I know it’s a potent ingredient and that starting a retinol routine should be done carefully due to possible irritation.\n\nMy question is: is it worth trying such a small amount? If I use the samples for about a week and then decide not to continue and not repurchase, could that short exposure do more harm than good, or would it be fine to just stop?\n\nAlso, would retinol even do any good for me at this point? I’m 22 years old and I don’t have visible wrinkles yet. I do have some imperfections that bother me, like mild scarring from popping pimples during my teens and a yellowish discoloration around my nose and mouth area due to carotenemia. I’m wondering whether retinol would realistically help with these concerns, or if it’s unnecessary at my age.\n\nI’d love to hear your experiences or advice.",

My question, is it supposed to look like this or did I mess up the new hair routine. If so, is there any advice that you can give me for the future? Thanks.",

My hair is capable of lightening quite a bit in one session from my previous experience, I don’t know if we had a miscommunication about the color or if I’m just imagining things. ",
