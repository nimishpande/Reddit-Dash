I tried to pop it and it looks like this now. It hurt when I try to squeeze it like a normal pimple would. Neither of us have any stds. We've only been with each other and have both been tested. Idk how I got it. Maybe the friction and the bacteria in my saliva and his nut?  Any ideas on what it is or how to treat it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated ",

      "content": "I used Amlactin Lotion to treat my keratosis pilaris which was recommended by my dermatologist and I seemed to have had a horrible reaction to it, I know very little about exfoliation and skin care in general and I was just doing what I thought the doctor told me to do.\n\nThis happened after about 3 days of Amlactin application on my upper arms once a day. Initially my KP bumps got red at which point I stopped using the Amlactin, but the redness has gotten worse and I am developing a yellowish scabby crust where my KP was worst.\n\nIt's a bit terrifying, quite itchy, and painful like a sunburn. (However I do not believe this is sunburn as I spent basically no time in the sun during or after the days of application.\n\nI'm attaching an image of when I first stopped using it (left arm) and an image of it now (right arm). Is this adverse reaction something I should seek medical attention for? I think this is the worst reaction to Amlactin that I've seen. Any information would be much appreciated.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you straighten/curl your hair on certain occasions you're probably fine honestly, I choose not to just to play it safe.\n\nBesides that you probably already know most of the things. A silk bonnet or a silk pillow case is always a good idea, not dunking your hair in buckets of dirt and grease (or just using too much product) will also definitely help. Keep it tied back during physical activity in order to prevent knots and frizz.\n\n\n\n# Wash Routine\n\nA lot of my routine is based off of the Curly Girl Method (CGM). While CGM does take it a bit far in my opinion a lot of my routine is taken from it. If you are interested you can find a lot of guides on reddit, but be careful as it can cause product build up.\n\nWhat I have found works best for me is-\n\n1. Get hair DRENCHED as much as possible\n2. Detangling with a curl defining hair brush (skip this if you have fine hair or hair that easily tangles)\n3. Shampoo (2x a week, or if hair is greasy/dirty)\n4. Rinse thoroughly\n5. A LOT of conditioner, brush through with curl defining brush.\n6. Let conditioner sit for \\~3 minutes\n7. Rinse thoroughly \n8. While hair is still dripping wet use product, comb through or just scrunch in depending on product (skip if you feel like you are starting to get product buildup or if its just not needed)\n9. Scrunch extra water out with hands\n\nAfter that my hair is still \"wet\" by most standards but I normally go to sleep since I shower right before bed. There is probably a hundred reasons not to do that but when I wake up its always tangle free and I just need to scrunch/shake it out which is really nice in the mornings. I use a silk pillow case so I just \"whip\" my hair on to it before I sleep.\n\nThis is what I have found works for me, if you know something doesn't work for you personally just swap it out or skip it.\n\n# Products\n\nI say this with complete sincerity there is one product I would literally go to war for. [Lush Super Milk](https://www.lush.com/us/en_us/p/super-milk-conditioning-spray/100ml) is my absolute saving grace. I never skip using this, it prevents frizz and smells amazing. The only other product I use is [Function of Beauty Curl Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Function-Beauty-Curl-Cream-Curly/dp/B0CT2FY1S5), it helps to revive my hair but I don't use it every time.\n\nFor shampoo and conditioner I honestly use anything that says curly on it. However what I normally use when I can get my hands on it is the [Aussie Miracle Curls](https://www.amazon.com/Aussie-Miracle-Curls-Collection-Conditioner/dp/B0886XTJDN) line (the link has the full set but I recommend just getting the shampoo/conditioner).\n\n# Closing\n\nLike I said this is definitely not perfect for everyone but I find it works nicely for me. If anyone has any advice for me I would love to hear it. Improving a routine never hurts :)",

I’ve been using a little dandruff shampoo for about two weeks now, about 2 X a week. The redness hasn’t went away so far. I have extremely dryyyy and sensitive skin this winter. I tend to be dry and sensitive anyway but for some reason this winter has been the worst. I use vanicream in the tub or cerave lotion to moisturize my body and face. If I’m having a bad flare up I only cleanse with cerave hydrating cleanser and just moisturize. I’m eczema prone but this doesn’t feel/look like my typical eczema flare-ups at all. It’s not really itchy, it’s mainly raw and sore feeling if that makes sense? It seems like when I cleanse with my typical cleanser like cerave salicylic acid or Differin my skin gets angry and that’s never really happened before. I’m definitely making an appointment with the dermatologist, but has anyone had anything like this before?? If you have, do you have any suggestions on how to calm it down? It seems like vanicream is the only thing keeping my skin somewhat at bay. ",

Over time the pigmentation hasn’t faded much, and my skin often feels dry even after cleansing and moisturizing.\n\n**Current Skincare Routine:**  \nRight now my routine is very basic:  \n• Sunscreen every day (I don’t skip it)  \n• Derma Co’s Kojic Acid face wash  \n• Aloe vera gel as my moisturizer\n\nI use sunscreen consistently, but apart from that I don’t use any serums, exfoliants, or actives. I feel like my skin needs more than this, but I’m not sure what to start with or how to introduce new products without irritating my skin.\n\n**What I’m Looking For**  \nI’m hoping for suggestions on:  \n• Specific ingredients that can help with pigmentation and dark spots  \n• What can improve **texture** and dullness in dry skin  \n• Affordable product recommendations (preferably under ₹700) for serums or treatments\n\nAny insights is much appreciated! :)",

      "content": "Hi everyone :-) \n\nI recently tried making homemade flaxseed gel (1/4 cup to 2 cups of water), and I wanted advice on how to use it in styling/a good routine? I have very long (not waist length but maybe half way down my back), thick and dry hair maybe a 2C/3A pattern but I struggle with my hair being a bit frizzy and some sections curling nicely with others being just frizz/strings.\n\nSo i was wondering how much flaxseed gel are you meant to use in styling if its homemade and is it better to use in combination with other products like a leave in conditioner or mousse? (and if yes, how much ballpark of those products should i be using?) - i also air dry my hair or very partially diffuse it mainly due to length/thickness diffusing takes alot of time for me!\n\nToday i trialled maybe a 1/4 cup of flaxseed gel, 2 golf ball sized pumps of a strong hold mousse and two pea sized pumps of a curl cream - results were okay but same issue with some areas being stringy/frizzy and my hair also feels a bit stiff/frizzy even after scruching with a silk scarf and oil. I also dont think this would hold over multiple days.\n\nAny and all advice would be greatly appreciated! TYIA",

Any advice on how to get my roots and back of head to curl? Or is it just going to take way longer for the roots to start curling? Is it just my hair type or am I doing something wrong?\n\n\n\n🎀 HAIR ROUTINE 🎀\n\n   Ask for face framing long\n\n\\- \\[x\\] 1st Week: Hydration Week → Hydration Shampoo, Hydration Hair Masque, Hydration Conditioner (add Hydration Masque only once if washing more than once that week) Jan 27\n\n\\- \\[ \\] 2nd Week: Protein Week → Hydration Shampoo + bonding protein treatment. “Bond repair masque” green bottle \n\n\\- \\[ \\] 3rd Week: Hydration Week → Hydration Shampoo + Conditioner (Hydration Masque if dry) \n\n\\- \\[ \\] Clarify Week → Clarifying Shampoo (2 lathers) + Protein Masque\n\n⸻\n\n🧴 Wash Products\n\n1. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo\n\n\t•\tUse: Weekly (non-clarify weeks)\n\n\t•\tHow: Focus on scalp &amp; roots only. Massage with fingertips (not nails). Let suds run through lengths as you rinse.\n\n\t•\tRinse: Thoroughly with lukewarm water.\n\n2. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner\n\n\t•\tUse: Weekly (after Hydration Shampoo, except Clarify Week)\n\n\t•\tHow: Apply to mid-lengths &amp; ends (avoid roots to prevent heaviness). Use wide-tooth comb or fingers to detangle.\n\n\t•\tRinse: After 3–5 minutes, rinse lightly (leave a little slip if your hair likes it).\n\n3. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Masque\n\n\t•\tUse: Every 1–2 weeks (instead of conditioner).\n\n\t•\tHow: Apply generously mid-lengths → ends. Detangle with wide-tooth comb. Smooth with “praying hands.”\n\n\t•\tWait: 10–15 minutes (cover with cap for extra effect).\n\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n4. SheaMoisture Protein Masque\n\n\t•\tUse: Once a month (after Clarifying Shampoo).\n\n\t•\tHow: Section hair, apply mid-lengths → ends first, then lightly on roots if needed. Brush through for even coverage. Light scrunch to help curls.\n\n\t•\tWait: 10–15 minutes.\n\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n\t•\tConditioner: Skip (this masque replaces it).\n\n5. SheaMoisture Strengthen &amp; Restore Clarifying Shampoo\n\n\t•\tUse: Once a month (Clarify Week).\n\n\t•\tHow: Do 2 lathers — first lifts buildup, second deep cleans. Focus on scalp, let suds rinse through lengths.\n\n\t•\tFollow with: Protein Masque (not conditioner).\n\n6. SheaMoisture Bond Repair Masque (optional/alternate)\n\n\t•\tUse: Every 2–3 weeks or when hair feels weak/breaking.\n\n\t•\tHow: Same as Hydration Masque — mid-lengths → ends, detangle, smooth in.\n\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n⸻\n\n🌿 Leave-In &amp; Styling Products\n\n7. Curlsmith Frizz Rescue Curl Retainer\n\n\t•\tUse: After cream (daily).\n\n\t•\tHow: Scrunch into damp hair, focusing on mid-lengths &amp; ends.

What followed was a masterclass in poor customer service and shifting excuses:\n\nFirst, they said freebies were “temporarily unavailable.”\n\nThen they said freebies “cannot be added retrospectively.”\n\nThen they said the offer “was not active that day.”\n\nMeanwhile, the same freebies were still being shown on their website.\n\nWhen I asked for a simple solution — either send the promised items or take the order back and refund me — they clearly said:\n\nthey won’t provide the freebies\n\nthey won’t accept a return\n\nthey won’t issue a refund\n\nNo accountability. No concern. Just scripted apologies and contradictions (screenshots attached).\n\nThis is not about “free stuff.”\n\nThis is about false promises, misleading promotions, and zero responsibility after payment.\n\nIf a brand advertises something to push customers to spend more, and then refuses to honor it — that’s not a mistake, that’s deceptive practice.\n\nI’m now left with 3 products and zero trust in the brand.\n\nPosting this so others can decide if this is the kind of brand they want to support.\n\nTransparency matters. Trust matters. And Deconstruct failed badly here.",

The bumps are tiny, rough, and kind of feel like thorns or goosebumps. They’re not very inflamed but make the skin texture really uneven.\n\nWe were thinking of trying the Dove 1% Salicylic Acid body wash and wanted to know if it actually helps with this kind of back acne / clogged pores. Has anyone used it for similar issues?\n\nAlso, how long does it usually take to see results, and is it safe for regular use? Any advice or alternative suggestions would be really appreciated. Thanks! 😊",
