      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I need advice because everything I read online seems to say different things.\n\nfor some context, i am a 22 year old girl and I have fairly moderate to dry skin with occasional breakouts on my forehead and chin. I also get these weird little flesh colored bumps sometimes on my forehead and sometimes on my upper cheeks…might be fungal acne? Not sure. Anyway, recently I’ve been having more breakouts because I quit curology (my skin had become resistant to it) and I need to find a cure.\n\nmy routine:\n\nright now I use a gentle CeraVe cleanser, Paula’s Choice 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel, and Clinique gel moisturizer. I was researching and apparently benzoyl peroxide is pretty good for breakouts. I’ve been on this exact routine for about 2 1/2 months and I’ve noticed slight improvements. I also sometimes incorporate an anti-dandruff shampoo into my routine for what I assume is fungal acne because I heard it can help. I use it as a face wash on affected areas. I do this routine once every evening.\n\nmy concerns:\n\nwhile my skin definitely has started to clear up, I still have red spots on my forehead and chin from where my acne was. Additionally, I’m just not happy with the overall look of my skin…it’s not smooth and even. I’m wondering if I should find an exfoliator to use in order to decrease the occurrence of redness and acne “scars”. I’m also worried I might get more breakouts as I just developed a pimple on my cheek and I never get pimples there!\n\nnote:\n\nalso I would like to keep this routine as minimal as possible. I’m not trying to be high maintenance with like a 10 step routine. I just don’t have the time of money. But simple steps to improve or overall advice would be great. I just feel too old to still be having skin problems and I want them gone.\n\nthank you for reading this! please help a girl out",

      "content": "Hi everyone! Skincare noob here. I have a few questions related to my new skincare journey. \n\n1. Fellow glasses wearers how do you make sure you have all the product washed off your face when cleansing.\n\n2. How do you keep from getting the whole sink + yourself wet when rinsing cleansers.\n\nI put a towel down on the counter in front of the sink but I still get water running down my arms and neck. I am looking at those wrist bands but if there is something else I can be doing in the interim that would be great. I also feel like it ties into question one because I might be overdoing it with the water to make sure I really get off everything because I can’t see. \n\n3. Going to be traveling in a few weeks. First time traveling with a skincare routine. I also only travel carry on so everything has to be under 100mls. \n\nI use the Skin1004 Centella ampoule and the Round Lab birch cleanser which are both under the size limit but I also use the Haruharu Wonder black rice cleansing oil and the Round Lab Dokdo cleanser which are both over the limit. \n\nSo my questions are 1. What do I do with my cleansers. I’ve heard people talk about the cotton round hack so if people have tried it I’d love to know how it works. 2. How to safely travel with the Centella glass ampoule. Since it is glass and all. I have the 55ml one. \n\n4.Last question. Currently using the Neutragina ultra sheer dry touch sunscreen. I’ve been using it for years. I’m looking at getting into the Skin1004 Centella water sunscreen but \n\nI’m waiting for it to come back in stock on the website I use. So in the meantime is it ok to continue using the Neutragina one to use it up or is it going to totally screw up my new routine. \n\nI’m like six days into my first ever routine and leave on the 19th so I’ll still be pretty new with it and don’t want to ruin things right off the bat. \n\nThank you so much in advance for all the help and advice! I really appreciate it!",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

The first few photos of the darker hair is my hair today/recent between trying to figure out how to style it niceley, and the brighter blonde is 1 year ago when i didnt do much to it.\n\nIm gonna likley overexplain everything i know.\n\nMy routine i used for the first few photos was brushing my hair in the shower then scrunching the conditioner with water, then added Not Your Mothers definition cream and gel, then i went in 3 sections and (very badly and unsure i did it right) finger curled my entire head, i didnt know how to add volume whatsoever so i just used a claw clip then let it air dry then difused to break the gel cast and used ogx nourishing coconut milk anti breaking oil and a tiny pea drop of gisou oil on my hair.\n\nMy routine in my brighter blonde photo, i dont remember my routine but i know i used a bunch of gisou, and i did my curly hair routine every day (before i knew how to preserve curls) i think i used truesemme bouncy curl mousse, garnier curl sculpting cream, ganier gel, and garnier leave in conditioner (...?)\n\nProducts i used for my daily routine right now are not your mothers  (NYM for short) leave in, NYM curl defining cream, NYM curl mousse, NYM gel, and ogx coconut milk anti breaking serum oil, and sometimes next of us curl reactivating mist\n\nI really dont know if i have 2b hair or. 3a hair, i think its around that range though? my hair is thin and is damaged a bit from hair coloring and heat damage. i dont even know what purosity means, i dont know if my hair needs moisture. im clueless. I am at this point begging for help, my hair has been my biggest insecurity latley and ive tried so many routines and im not finding any help and its stressing me out so so so much.   \n  \nI dont know what i want my hair to look like, kinda like how it was last year with its shine, but maybe more definition? I dont know. I dont know anything about curls still and i keep comparing my hair to other peoples and its been making me struggle and getting extremely frustrated with my hair.

For the past 2/3-ish years, I have been using SLMD's Salicylic Acid Cleanser, Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer, Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Lotion, and Retinol Resurfacing Serum. I also use Thayer's Witch Hazel. These products have been holy grails for me, but I've only recently realized how oily my skin is after using them. I have tried many products, but SLMD has been the only product that has worked for me and clears any breakouts I have, very quickly. \n\n  \nWhen I don't use these products, especially the Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Lotion, my skin becomes super dry. I don't know what to do as these products work for me, but my skin being oily isn't an enjoyable feeling, and I think it contributes to my pores being clogged. I wash my face twice a day and only use the Retinol Serum at night. Should I use a different face wash to help with the oiliness? Or do I need to find completely different products? Any advice would be helpful! \n\n  \nIf it's of any use, here is the order of how I do my skincare:\n\nSalicylic Acid Cleanser -&gt; Let skin air dry -&gt; Thayer's Witch Hazel -&gt;Let skin air dry again -&gt;  Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Lotion -&gt;  Retinol Resurfacing Serum (only at night) -&gt; Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer.\n\n",

Typically I just brush it out and it turns into a frizzy poofy mess so I knew I had some sort of curls/waves. Or I let it dry in a braid so that way I have nice waves.\n\nI tried diffusing my hair for the first time. And well this is the result. I’m not sure what curl pattern I have exactly. I think it’s like 2b-2c but I could be wrong. However I do get some really defined curls every now and then through my head as well as near my neck.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips to help make it look better? Or just any advice\n\n-ROUTINE-\n\nWash hair and condition with Aussie Miracles Curl shampoo and conditioner\n\nBrush and Detangle hair\n\nScrunch to form clumps\n\nScrunch in Not Your Mothers Curl Talk Mousse\n\nScrunch in Not You Mothers Curl Talk Sculpting gel\n\nHover diffuse for 5ish mins\n\nScrunch and diffuse hair till dry",
