It doesn’t matter either way because my hair grows super fast. So the real question is, maintain this cut or grow it back out?",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Ive had curly hair since late elementary school, im currently in late highschool now, and ive never known how to do my curls, and latley its been bothering me alot. I don't know my hair type, texture, any of that, nobody in my family has curls, and ive had nothing but youtube tutorials. The first few photos of the darker hair is my hair today/recent between trying to figure out how to style it niceley, and the brighter blonde is 1 year ago when i didnt do much to it.\n\nIm gonna likley overexplain everything i know.\n\nMy routine i used for the first few photos was brushing my hair in the shower then scrunching the conditioner with water, then added Not Your Mothers definition cream and gel, then i went in 3 sections and (very badly and unsure i did it right) finger curled my entire head, i didnt know how to add volume whatsoever so i just used a claw clip then let it air dry then difused to break the gel cast and used ogx nourishing coconut milk anti breaking oil and a tiny pea drop of gisou oil on my hair.\n\nMy routine in my brighter blonde photo, i dont remember my routine but i know i used a bunch of gisou, and i did my curly hair routine every day (before i knew how to preserve curls) i think i used truesemme bouncy curl mousse, garnier curl sculpting cream, ganier gel, and garnier leave in conditioner (...?)\n\nProducts i used for my daily routine right now are not your mothers  (NYM for short) leave in, NYM curl defining cream, NYM curl mousse, NYM gel, and ogx coconut milk anti breaking serum oil, and sometimes next of us curl reactivating mist\n\nI really dont know if i have 2b hair or. 3a hair, i think its around that range though? my hair is thin and is damaged a bit from hair coloring and heat damage. i dont even know what purosity means, i dont know if my hair needs moisture. im clueless. I am at this point begging for help, my hair has been my biggest insecurity latley and ive tried so many routines and im not finding any help and its stressing me out so so so much.   \n  \nI dont know what i want my hair to look like, kinda like how it was last year with its shine, but maybe more definition? I dont know. I dont know anything about curls still and i keep comparing my hair to other peoples and its been making me struggle and getting extremely frustrated with my hair. I'd appreciate it so so so much and be so grateful if someone could pretty please help me in any way. ",

After about 3 months the hair actually looked extremely good but within the last 2 weeks lots of hair is falling out and looks shit. I think for some reason dutasteride is doing more bad than good.

They only make my hair super dry after wash and without styling and using the leave-in or cream, they became so frizzy, dry and almost looking like straws. My hair was never like that before, I know that because I used to be able to survive with just the Sheamoisture Deep Hydration shampoo (the manuka honey one) &amp; without conditioner my hair will still be wayyyyyy healthier looking than my current hair after using my current shampoo AND conditioner  \n\nDoes anyone have good recommendations for shampoo &amp; conditioner that won't dry your hair out, able to give the moisture that your hair needs, and not be too heavy? \n\nThe reason why I stopped using the Sheamoisture shampoo was I realized it couldn't deal with the build-up on my scalp and I wanted a shampoo that can clarify a little better \n\nI personally find that the Maui Moisture lightweight hydration conditioner make it worse and my hair tangles into knots more than ever nowadays 🥲 \n\nOh and any hair oils too that's not too thick and heavy for curly hair? I used to use 100% pure argan oil which worked amazing on my hair but can be quite smelly as it just smells like the oil 😂   the other hair oils I've tried are mostly drugstore brands and not specifically for curly hair and usually have silicones &amp; end up building up on my hair more \n\nThank you so much in advance 🙇🏻‍♀️\n\n",

Will a cleansing oil/balm get the albolene to emulsify?\n\n\nCurrently using a cleansing oil. It has a thinner texture and I like it but I would like something thicker and more cushy feeling for makeup removal. I don't really wear makeup out often but I like putting it on for fun so typically whenever I am removing makeup I'm removing a FULL beat.   \nI prefer a cushy feeling cleansing oil or balm for removing makeup because I my skin is super sensitive to rubbing so a thick cushy oil helps pad my skin. I don't want to buy another cleansing oil right now especially since I'm not regularly removing makeup. Albolene is cheap and I've heard mineral oil breaks down makeup really well so I figured it might be a good option for me right now. \n\n\nI can't wipe it off with a towel or cotton pad because that has a high chance of irritating my skin. I have yet to find large cotton pads that are soft enough. Recs for super soft cotton pads, makeup wipes, baby wipes, or disposable face towels that can be found at Walmart/target would be appreciated too. \n\n\nAlso any tips on adding some sort of emulsifier to albolene? Like which one and where to buy.\n\n\nThank you for reading &lt;3",

Is there a way to make my hair less wavy and have it more 1c-2a type waves, should I try to grow it out so the waves are more pulled down? Or get rid of the layers? I’m not sure what to do but I’m quite insecure about it, any tips would be greatly appreciated.",

I would like alternatives to the current ones that target pigmentation and help with skin brightening.\n\nOily-combination skin. Medium complexion. Slightly tanned from sports. Weather not too humid.\n\n1. Eucerin Pigment Control Spf 50+ - Protection seems great. Not sure if its water and sweat proof. Problem is it makes my skin look dull and tanned( lot of people asked me whether I’ve gotten tanned). Loved the product but unfortunately, may have to find a replacement coz of the dull, tanned look post application. WNRP.\n\n2. Reequil ultra matte dry touch gel- Good sunscreen but it doesn’t have any ingredients targeting skin brightening or pigmentation. I would prefer a sunscreen with the above mentioned. Works well for oily skin, no issues there. WRP if I just need protection but for daily use, would prefer a sunscreen with more functionality.\n\n3. Isntree hyaluronic acid sunscreen- Easy skip for oily skin. Face shines a lot post application. Had to discard the previous product so WNRP.\n\nI need help choosing a sunscreen that helps with pigmentation and skin brightening and also has adequate protection (spf50+). Oily-combo skin. Budget is not really a concern. Please suggest some that could be of help. Indian, European, Korean etc any of them(hopefully they work for me fingers crossed). Thanks for your time!\n\n",
