It’s super rich and actually repairs my barrier without that annoying stinging some lotions have, especially since it’s fragrance-free. It does leave a bit of a shiny, greasy film, so I usually save it for my PM routine or really cold days. You get a massive bottle for the price too, which is a huge win. Recommend if you are dry skin like me.",

      "content": "Ever since I entered college my skin just erupted in acne. No matter what I did, nothing worked. The most improvement I saw was using Dermatica’s 15% azelaic acid but it was slow and very minimal. Antibiotics also helped but once I finished one round I broke out again. I finally caved and went to go see a dermatologist and he prescribed me accountable (40mg). Within a month my skin improved. I did experience some dryness (esp my eye and scalp) but it was so worth it. I remember just touching my forehead in amazement because it’s been so long since it was just flat and smooth. Currently on my third month and I ended up going down to 20mg because of some joint pain in my ankles and let me tell you 20mg is the sweet spot. Less side effects if any and the same benefits as 40mg.\n\nIt pisses me off it took me four years to clear up my skin and all it took was a visit to the dermatologist.It feels like all of my previous efforts were for naught.  The visit to the derm was so quick too. He just asked if I wanted to try accutane after I mentioned that adapalene didn’t work. And that was that.\n\nSide note: I was prescribed accutane on the day of my 21st birthday. RIP to drinking for the next five-ish months.",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

YTTP superfood air-whip cream\n5. YTTP youthscreen (religiously. like i literally keep one in my bathroom and one in my bag so i always have it on me. i don’t play about spf…)\n   1. i do also have ultraviolette's velvet skin/velvet screen/whatever-- whichever the recalled one was lol, but it's very heavy and greasy feeling on me and much prefer youthscreen\n   2. sometimes, i skip the air-whip cream completely and just have youthscreen function as a moisturizer since it makes me a little oily. i've yet to find an SPF that doesn't make me so oily so quick..\n\nPM:\n\n1. ma:nyo pure cleansing oil\n2. youth to the people superfood gel cleanser OR YTTP superfruit gentle exfol… cleanser\n3. dermalogica daily microfoliant (every few days, dependent on how my skin feels)\n4. thayers HA hydrating milky toner\n5. VT reedle shot 100 (every other PM, not on the same day i use niacinamide in the AM)\n6. the ordinary 2% HA + B5\n7.

YTTP superfood air-whip cream\n9. rhode barrier butter or sacheu slick skin lipid serum (typically only after high-active routine or if i feel extra dry)\n10. and i sleep with a humidifier on high LOL. i live in utah where summers are dry and winters are even drier\n\ni do also have a small facial silicone scrubber i used to use daily with a cleanser throughout middle school and high school, but some time last year i’ve stopped using it daily, but not noticed a change. opinions on silicone scrubbers??\n\nonce a week i’ll switch between innisfree’s super volcanic pore clay mask, or paula’s choice 2% BHA liquid exfoliant, but never both in the same week. i’ll oil plane eevery so often as well, but not on a constant schedule. i also keep a bottle of inkeylist’s hydro-surge mist on me just to refresh throughout the day.. and i have a bottle of TO’s 2% granactive retinoid in squalane i’d really like to use but i’m too scared to use it LOL. it’s been sitting in the fridge for… many months at this point and highly likely exceeded its PAO and stale\n\nthoughts? critiques on my routine? i’ll gladly accept anything lol\n\nedit1: forgot some stuff",

      "title": "[Routine Help] Deep, painful pimples appearing after 4 months of a consistent routine — normal or a sign of overdoing it?",
      "content": "**Hi everyone!**\n\nI’ve noticed that after about **4 months of a consistent daily skincare routine**, I started getting **occasional deep, inflamed pimples**, and I’m trying to understand why this might be happening.\n\nI started skincare at the end of August. I built a basic routine myself after researching dermatologist recommendations. That’s how I ended up starting a **very simple CeraVe-based routine**. My main goal was **skin maintenance and “smart aging.”** (28 F)\n\nI built the routine slowly. During the **first month**, my routine looked like this:\n\n**AM:**  \n– CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  \n– CeraVe Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum  \n– CeraVe SPF 50 Facial Moisturizing Lotion\n\n**PM:**  \n– CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  \n– CeraVe Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum  \n– CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion\n\nMy skin really loved this routine. It cleared up, I got fewer breakouts, and my skin felt balanced.\n\nBecause of that, the next step was introducing exfoliation.  \nFrom the **second month**, I added **The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7%**, using it **once a week**. The results were even better: softer skin, fading marks, and a really smooth texture. The results were so noticeable that my husband also started skincare, and he had similarly positive results.\n\nIn **November**, we introduced **retinol** (CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum), **twice a week**, making sure that exfoliation and retinol were far apart from each other (for example:  \nTuesday night – exfoliation  \nThursday &amp; Saturday night – retinol).\n\nDuring the **first week of retinol**, we both experienced tiny, small, translucent bumps. They didn’t itch and couldn’t be popped. After researching, I found that this can happen at the beginning of retinol use. It went away quickly, and for a full month after that we only saw positive changes: more even skin tone and fewer “sharp” lines. I was watching closely for irritation, but everything looked calm and healthy. Because the breakouts appeared much later (after \\~6–8 weeks of retinol), I’m unsure whether this could still be considered purging, or if it’s more likely irritation or another trigger.\n\nThen, **around mid-December**, I noticed that out of nowhere I started getting **deep, under-the-skin pimples**. They were painful when pressed, but if I left them alone, they would calm down and disappear within **2–3 days**. Since then, I’ve had about **4–5 of these**. I managed to pop one of them, and **greenish-yellow pus** came out, which really surprised me — I’ve honestly never had this type of pimple before, not even as a teenager.\n\nThis is what confuses me: I’ve been following this routine consistently for **4 months**, without major changes. We **use separate towels for our faces** and change them roughly **every 2 days**. We use **about a pea-sized amount of everything**, we don’t over-apply, especially not retinol or exfoliants. There was one time when I overdid the glycolic acid and the tip of my nose started peeling slightly — that taught me very quickly that *less is often more*.  \n  \nHas anyone experienced something similar?  \nDo you think I might be doing something wrong — or is this kind of reaction actually normal?\n\nSince then, I haven’t had any new ones, and it almost feels like my skin has returned to its “well-behaved” state again. (lol — I even wondered if Christmas dehydration, irregular eating, or holiday habits could have played a role.)\n\n**Thanks so much in advance for any insight!**\n\n  \n**TL;DR:**  \n  \n**After \\~4 months of a consistent, gentle routine (CeraVe cleanser, HA serum AM/PM, moisturizer PM, SPF AM), weekly glycolic acid (7%), and retinol twice weekly, my skin improved a lot — until month 4, when I started getting occasional deep, painful, under-the-skin pimples that resolve in a few days if left alone. This didn’t happen earlier in the routine. Wondering if this is normal (delayed retinol purge? overhydration? random inflammation?) or if I’m unknowingly overdoing something despite being careful with amounts and frequency.**  \n\n\n[Photos for context only. Lighting and days are different. Overall my skin still looks healthy — my concern is the sudden appearance of deep, painful, under-the-skin pimples that come and go. The photo is meant as a kind of before–after comparison. The left photo was taken in August at the very beginning of my routine, and the right one was taken in December, about 3 months later. I’d also like to add that the August photo was taken in more natural light, while the December one has less natural light and more artificial lighting.](https://preview.redd.it/s1ify7vsiacg1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87ebc8037d57c529581d75b0fb188afa6fbdd19b)\n\n",

      "content": "I don’t really know what I’m looking for here. I just need to vent and put this out there because I’ve been carrying it for a long time.\n\nI started losing my hair in my early 20s. Even back then my scalp would get insanely itchy, to the point where I couldn’t sleep. In 2022 I finally started finasteride, hoping it would at least slow things down. I stayed on it for about a year and didn’t see any regrowth or noticeable stabilization.\n\nAfter that I added topical minoxidil. I keep my head shaved all the time, so I can’t really track shedding the way most people do. I’m not counting hairs in the sink. But when your head is shaved, you can clearly tell when you’re losing baseline, and that’s exactly what was happening.\n\nAfter about six or seven months on topical min, I stopped because it felt like I was only losing ground and hoping maybe it was just a shed that would recover. It never did.\n\nThat’s when I added dutasteride and oral minoxidil. I didn’t quit fin right away. For a few months I took both fin and dut, then switched to daily dut once I ran out of fin. That’s when things really started getting worse. People kept telling me it was just a shed, but shaved head or not, I knew I was losing ground.\n\nWhile on dut, I started getting this burning or itching sensation on my scalp. Some people call it DHT itch. What really messed with my head was how consistent it felt. The itch would start in areas that still had hair, and two or three weeks later that exact area would basically become where my hairline ended. That pattern repeated itself and didn’t feel random.\n\nI stayed on dut for about six months and then switched back to fin because it felt like dut was destroying whatever I had left. I’m still on fin and oral min now. The itch isn’t as intense as it was on dut, but it never fully went away. Whenever it comes back, it feels like a warning sign that I’m still losing hair.\n\nWhat really gets to me is that I’ve never recovered from any shed. Not once. Hair just fell out and never came back. I’ve had blood work done and everything came back normal.\n\nAt this point I honestly don’t know what to believe anymore. Sometimes it genuinely feels like this whole fin and min thing is just one long pipeline. You’re told to get on the meds early, then when things don’t work or stop working, you’re told to add more meds, increase doses, switch drugs, wait longer, trust the process. And when people finally lose hope, the next answer always seems to be a hair transplant, with the reminder that you’ll still need to stay on meds forever anyway.\n\nI’m not saying these drugs are a lie or that they don’t help anyone. Clearly they help a lot of people. But when you’re someone who keeps losing ground no matter what you do, it’s hard not to question the whole system and wonder if some of us are just stuck chasing something that was never going to work for us.\n\nI guess I just want to know if anyone else has felt this way or gone through something similar, especially people who never recovered from sheds or who had scalp burning or itching that seemed to line up with their hair loss.",
