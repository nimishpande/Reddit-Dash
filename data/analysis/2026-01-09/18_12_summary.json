      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have a question regarding my hands and fingers. And now that I’m in a relationship, this plays a particularly important role for me. I’m 30 years old, male, and I have very rough hands because of my job. I work as a firefighter, and due to my passions—sports and working on cars (mechanical work)—my hands are very rough. They are always clean. I place great importance on keeping my hands hygienic and clean. Especially with regard to my girlfriend, I make sure my fingernails are always trimmed and clean, just like my toenails.\n\nWhen I compare my hands and fingers to those of other men, I have the feeling that my fingers simply don’t look very nice. On the sides, both left and right, there is noticeable callus, which is sometimes also palpable, and I would really like to change that.\n\nNevertheless, my fingers simply don’t look very nice. I think about this a lot and wonder what causes it and how I could change it. I have very rough hands, and of course my girlfriend can feel that too when I touch her. Thank you very much.\n\nHave a great weekend",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nLooking for some experienced opinions here.\n\nI started topical minoxidil 5% in June 2024. The recommended dose was 6 sprays morning + evening, but for practicality I only applied it once daily in the evening. Over the first year, I honestly saw very limited results.\n\nIn June 2025, I added oral finasteride while continuing topical minoxidil. Since then, the results have been very noticeable and I’m genuinely happy with where my hair is at now.\n\nBecause of that, I’m wondering whether I could eventually come off topical minoxidil. I find it uncomfortable, it makes my hair look dirty, and it’s the part of the routine I dislike the most.\n\nIf I did stop, I would obviously taper it very gradually over several months, not cold turkey, to reduce the risk of a shed / effluvium.\n\nHas anyone here successfully stopped minoxidil while staying on fin?\n\t\nIs it reasonable to assume that fin is now doing most of the heavy lifting, given that results only really appeared after starting it?\n\nWould really appreciate hearing from people who’ve tried this or understand the mechanisms better.

I use it topically, but the problem is that it makes my hair greasy and impossible to style, especially since the wet, greasy look the next day makes my thinning hair even more noticeable.

Will it also make my eyebrows and chest/back hair grow? Thanks in advance.",

They said it was relax a bit over the first week. \n\nTwo questions -\n\nCould/should I wash it early to make the curls loosen a bit (the top/front ones)?\n\nAnd what's the deal with the flatter sections? I'm reading different things online, some say to get it wet and scrunch, some say don't you dare get it wet, and some say just wait til you wash and the curls will kind of reahape. Is this just super messed up or fine?\n\nAnd yes I know it's really dry and there's a lot of breakage 😟\n\nAny help or suggestions are much appreciated!!",

Now after reaching my twenties, I really wanted to get this done right. (Get pimples semi-easily, huge god damn pores). Saw a dermatologist a few weeks ago and after some chatting, left with retinol. I was told I need to pay attention to moisturizing and have been following all of their their advice thoroughly. Now after a few weeks of using it, I seem to be going through the \"purge\". I started to wonder if I could use anti-spot gel on the breakout spots, but dont know if it's ok to use while using retinol? The anti-spot gel I have is used for drying out the spots, but since retinol needs so much moisturizing, 1 am now afraid that the anti-spot gel will not be ok...Help!\n\nTLDR: Can I use anti-spot gel ((has alcohol, glycerin, polysorbate 20, propylene glycol, panthenol)) while using retinol? If not, any other way to fight breakouts while using retinol?",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

Apply the Garnier Fructis Curls Method Refreshing Curl Spray\n\nAfter that I just go to bed and when I wake up my hair is dry and nice. So my current routine seems to be working fine.

What other products should I add to my routine? Curl cream, gels, oils? \n\nI looked through lots of posts on this sub and watched a ton of tutorials on YT and I am kinda overwhelmed😅.
