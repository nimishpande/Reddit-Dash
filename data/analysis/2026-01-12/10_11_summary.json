      "content": "Hello. I am asking for help and advice. I'm 27F and my skin is incredibly oily. It is also sensitive, I have a lot of redness and really big pores everywhere, not just the T zone. \n\nI have tried La Roche Posay, Bioderma, Cera Ve, The Ordinary, Mixa and none of those helped. I tried niacinamide serums and pore minimizing serums and they didn't work. My routine is mostly just a cleansing gel and moisturizing cream in the morning and evening, when I was trying out serums, I layered them correctly. I wear makeup every day and not even primers work (mattifying or pore minimizing). I do not have acne but I get small white zits or some zits appear under skin (mostly cheeks and around the nose) almost every day. I have some blackheads but I don't have a lot and I can exctract them, they arent a problem. Please also note that I change my face towel regularly, always just dab my face, change my pillowcase regularly and so on. I really try with everything. I do my routine regularly, I am aware that consistency is key, but nothing has helped me so far. I hate it because I hate the feeling of oilyness on my face and it also affects my hair, it gets oily even faster bc of my face. I also cannot walk around with no foundation because I am insecure about the pores and redness, but also if I don't wear foundation, my face gets oilier even faster and even if I dab it or wash it with water, it gets oily again after an hour.\n\nAny suggestions on which products, routine would work for me? A friend suggested retinal, which I havent tried, what do you think?",

I have a chronic baby face that comes with cheeks that everybody wants to pinch, but that's not a major issue. What bothers me is that my side profile looks horrible. No jaw line at all. And I don't want smth super duper defined, I just want it to at least be there😭\n\nPlus I feel like I'm starting to develop a double chin... somehow? I've always had a tiny pouch there but it's slowly starting to grow more visible. I did some research and I might have a recessed/weak jaw. This is self diagnosis and guesses i didn't really ask a professional. (If it helps, I had braces for 2 years bc my teeth were messed up and my bottom jaw was recessed. Teeth fixed, jaw not not much) Also, the skin under my chin is a bit stretchy. I heard that this could play a role in the double chin appearance..\n\nI really don't know what to do abt it. It's my biggest insecurity. I heard that I should just get surgery to fix my jaw, but I don't have the money for it rn and even if I had I'm absolutely terrified. Some advice I saw was to drink more water to stop water retention and do a specific kind of massage. Would these actually work? Does anybody have other suggestions?🥲",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I’ve always put quite a bit of effort in taking care of myself (though a full time finance job has left me with less available time), and in my 20s I always felt super confident, well dressed, nice hair, etc. The past years, no matter how well I take care of myself, I always feel like I look like a mess. \nI wash my hair every 2-3 days and blow dry it but after 24h it just looks unkept and bad. Doesn’t help that I always feel like I’m rushing between home, public transport and work. \nMy makeup never lasts all day, my clothes look frumpy.. I don’t know what to do! \nI’ve stopped getting my nails done which may add to that feeling and will try to get them done regularly again. Do you have any other advice? I have struggled with confidence issues for a long time and I hate feeling this way, i feel like it is undermining my success in work a lot as I tend to make myself less visible since my confidence has plummeted.

I also tried the climate control shampoo/conditioner and it was great for frizz, but took most of the curl out of my hair.\n\nJust wondering if anyone with wavy/curly hair has tried the curl shaper shampoo/conditioner with any of the other ouidad styling products and found success that way. Like do I just need a leave in conditioner or cream after using the curl shaper in the shower? Would love to hear if anyone has experience with mixing their different products! TIA!\n\n\nRoutine\n1.

I also have pretty thick hair.. so when it doesn’t fall flat- I just look like I’ve been struck by lightning. Whenever I use hair oils it doesn’t help either, nothing really makes my hair look “shiny” or healthy. \n\nWhen I leave it to air dry it comes out wavy and straight, super frizzy and dry. \n\nWhen I blow dry it, it just falls flat but with lots of fluff. \n\nWhenever I get hair cuts I usually get layers since blunt cuts just look a bit flavourless, especially since my hair is voluminous (probably because it’s dry), it’s heavy and weights itself down. So I look odd with blunt cuts, but layers look way too messy as seen in the pic. \n\nI’ve tried tsubaki, hair glossing, eggs, cola, rice water, those hair supplement gummies. Whatever.
