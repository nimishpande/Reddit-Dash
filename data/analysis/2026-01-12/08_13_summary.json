Like 5-10 a month including period acne) I randomly landed up on reddit skincare pages n was basically scrolling through it. Heard from some how micellar has helped them with comedones and stuff. Decided to give it a try. And ngl, with 2 days I could see drastic changes in my skin. The comedones have drastically reduced on my forehead. Micellar also helped me with acne. If there's any acne flaring up, I just use micellar on it and the next day the acne is gone pretty much.\n\nI used Garnier pink cap.\n\nHow do I use it:\nNight: I clean my face with micellar water using cotton pads or any clean smooth cotton cloth. Then I wash my face with a cleanser. Then proceed with my night routine. (Which is basically just applying moisturizer. I use ponds super light moisturizer as I hv oily acne prone skin)\n\nMorning: I clean my face with micellar water (my face gets all super oily in the morning) and then I wash with a cleanser. Apply moisturizer and sunscreen (I use solasafe sunscreen)\n\nPs: I still hv some comedones on my skin. But micellar has made a huge difference.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Two days ago I went to a barbershop to cut my hair like the third image, instead of being honest and saying they couldn’t do it they butchered my hair and made it super short.\n\nI wasn’t super mad at the result, but the cut looked weird, like they didn’t know what they were doing. It was ok, with some styling, but I didn’t love it.\n\nSo today I impulsively went to a hair salon for them to “fix it” just to balance out the weirdness, and they kind of cut it even more and now I HATE it. I have been crying all day.\n\nNow I’m not sure what to do, i absolutely hate the cut and feel like it’s a weird bowl cut I can’t even style to feel better. I’m not sure if i should just let it be and wait a couple of weeks and see if it grows better, or if I should go back to the hair salon and try something shorter like the fourth image, which might make it longer for it to grow, but maybe I won’t hate it as much. \n\nOr maybe i will? It was the impulsiveness of going to fix it that made it go from ok to worse after all.\n",

I’ve always had wavy hair but my mom always made me get those rebonds that essentially ruined it. \n\nI shampoo twice and use conditioner, a hair mask once a week. I also have pretty thick hair.. so when it doesn’t fall flat- I just look like I’ve been struck by lightning. Whenever I use hair oils it doesn’t help either, nothing really makes my hair look “shiny” or healthy. \n\nWhen I leave it to air dry it comes out wavy and straight, super frizzy and dry. \n\nWhen I blow dry it, it just falls flat but with lots of fluff. \n\nWhenever I get hair cuts I usually get layers since blunt cuts just look a bit flavourless, especially since my hair is voluminous (probably because it’s dry), it’s heavy and weights itself down. So I look odd with blunt cuts, but layers look way too messy as seen in the pic. \n\nI’ve tried tsubaki, hair glossing, eggs, cola, rice water, those hair supplement gummies. Whatever. You name it. \n\nI just can’t seem to get healthy hair",

      "content": "I’ve been struggling with acne for a while now and I am at a point where I don’t know what to do anymore.\n\nOver the last few years I’ve tried so many things — both over-the-counter and prescription — and it feels like it has only done worse for my skin. Some treatments helped temporarily, others made things much worse, and a few left my skin feeling damaged and overly sensitive.\n\nCurrent dilemma:\n\nI’m really trying to get my life together and feel confident in my own skin. I’ve been focusing on self-improvement in other areas, but my acne is the one thing that keeps dragging my confidence down. I feel stuck because I’m terrified of choosing the wrong product and undoing whatever stability my skin has right now. After years of trial and error, I don’t trust my judgment anymore when it comes to skincare.\n\nI also can’t figure out what type of acne I actually have — hormonal, cystic, fungal, closed comedones, or some mix of everything. I get texture, breakouts that seem to come from under the skin, and lingering discoloration long after pimples heal. It’s overwhelming trying to diagnose myself while scrolling through endless advice that all contradicts each other. Also i think the acne on my cheeks is different from the one on my forehead cause sometimes a product improves the forehead and worsens the cheeks?\n\nSkin type + routine:\n\nI have combination skin — oily in some areas, dry and tight in others. My skin is very reactive and easily irritated, which is why my routine is extremely minimal. Right now, I’m only using a gentle cleanser and a basic moisturizer because i am trying to not use any actives to understand what may be actually going on.\n\nI feel like my skin needs more than this, but I’m scared to experiment. I don’t want another long setback from introducing the wrong active or product.\n\nI’m sorry for the long post — I’m just feeling really discouraged and could use some guidance. If anyone has been in a similar situation or has advice on where to start slowly and safely, I would truly appreciate it.",

I’ve had a mullet-esque cut for about four years now, and while I’ve liked it, I’m feeling stuck and want to switch things up... I just don’t know exactly what I want yet. I also don’t want to walk into a stylist appointment with zero direction, so I figured I’d ask here.\n\nI’m looking for more masculine or androgynous haircuts with an alternative or slightly punk vibe. My hair is naturally wavy with a few curls, and I’m totally open to a cut that needs regular or even daily styling. I’ve included photos of my current cut so you can see what I’m working with.\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated. Thanks, y’all! :)",
