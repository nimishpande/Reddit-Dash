Like 5-10 a month including period acne) I randomly landed up on reddit skincare pages n was basically scrolling through it. Heard from some how micellar has helped them with comedones and stuff. Decided to give it a try. And ngl, with 2 days I could see drastic changes in my skin. The comedones have drastically reduced on my forehead. Micellar also helped me with acne. If there's any acne flaring up, I just use micellar on it and the next day the acne is gone pretty much.\n\nI used Garnier pink cap.\n\nHow do I use it:\nNight: I clean my face with micellar water using cotton pads or any clean smooth cotton cloth. Then I wash my face with a cleanser. Then proceed with my night routine. (Which is basically just applying moisturizer. I use ponds super light moisturizer as I hv oily acne prone skin)\n\nMorning: I clean my face with micellar water (my face gets all super oily in the morning) and then I wash with a cleanser. Apply moisturizer and sunscreen (I use solasafe sunscreen)\n\nPs: I still hv some comedones on my skin. But micellar has made a huge difference.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I also tried the climate control shampoo/conditioner and it was great for frizz, but took most of the curl out of my hair.\n\nJust wondering if anyone with wavy/curly hair has tried the curl shaper shampoo/conditioner with any of the other ouidad styling products and found success that way. Like do I just need a leave in conditioner or cream after using the curl shaper in the shower? Would love to hear if anyone has experience with mixing their different products! TIA!\n\n\nRoutine\n1.

It was ok, with some styling, but I didn’t love it.\n\nSo today I impulsively went to a hair salon for them to “fix it” just to balance out the weirdness, and they kind of cut it even more and now I HATE it.

I’m not sure if i should just let it be and wait a couple of weeks and see if it grows better, or if I should go back to the hair salon and try something shorter like the fourth image, which might make it longer for it to grow, but maybe I won’t hate it as much. \n\nOr maybe i will?

I also don’t want to walk into a stylist appointment with zero direction, so I figured I’d ask here.\n\nI’m looking for more masculine or androgynous haircuts with an alternative or slightly punk vibe. My hair is naturally wavy with a few curls, and I’m totally open to a cut that needs regular or even daily styling.

      "content": "I feel like I’m buying all these products that aren’t working for my hair and I’m so sick of it, I just want products that bring out my curls. I live in Australia which makes it so hard since everyone online recommends American products and stylers. I went and got a curly cut from a hairdresser a few months back and they did a great job on it so I know it’s possible but I just can’t do it myself for some reason. It either gets way too frizzy or looks so flat and too defined if that makes sense like there’s so much product in my hair gluing it down. Or sometimes it looks nice but the minute I scrunch out the crunch it just goes frizzy and some bits of my hair just fall out and lose the curl they had. \n\nThis is my routine as of right now (btw this is the same routine the hairdresser I went to recommended). So I shampoo using Gaia baby shampoo and I wash my hair twice with that (I also detangle while the shampoos in my hair). Then I use Lohy conditioner wait about 5min and rinse it all out scrunching as it rinses out to encourage curl clumps. I then use the cruise control from Lohy as well and rake it through on dripping wet hair but don’t rinse it out. I then section my hair, firstly I just split my hair in half from my part and start on the left side first. I clip up the top bit of my hair near my part line and brush out the rest. I use the curl foam from Lohy too and just rake and scrunch. If I see frizzy bits I finger curl them and scrunch. Then I do the same thing to the hair I clipped up. I defuse the hair with the Remington hair diffuser and then start on the right side of my hair. The reason I diffuse separately is cause otherwise my hair starts to lose its curl pattern I scrunched into it and then one side of my hair is curler than the other, also if I leave my hair wet for too long even if it’s got product in it, it will frizz up. I then do the exact same thing I did on the left side to the right side of my hair. Once it’s all dry I use the tymo hair oil and scrunch out the cast.\n\n Sometimes when I do this routine it looks good for about 5min but then it starts to get frizzy and tangled and just looks messy overall. There was one time I did it a couple months back right around when I got my curly cut and it looked so good but for some reason I can’t seem to recreate that again. I’ve also noticed my hair when I scrunch it with product doesn’t hold the curl like it did a couple months ago. It all just seems to fall out and get frizzy. I recently heard that your supposed to clarify your hair so I’ve been doing that with the avveno apple cider vinegar clarifying shampoo but nothings changed. I so desperately wanna try not your mother’s curl talk and other brands I’ve heard about that work well but unfortunately it’s hard for me to get those brands since I don’t live in America. \n\nAlso I should mention I have no idea what number or curl pattern my hair is all I know is when I try to brush style it, it just goes straight. I actually think I most likely have wavy hair although some of my hair near my ears and stuff does go into ringlets. Another thing is I don’t know how to sleep on my hair I’ve tried the pineapple method and a satin bonnet but both don’t really change the fact that in the morning my hair is frizzy. I haven’t tried doing a refresh routine since my hair is probably too weighed down from the products I use and would end up not even holding a curl or wave. Also another thing to add quickly is that I can never get curl clumps, they always look stringy and that’s after I brush my hair but I have to brush my hair or else it sticks to my scalp and has no volume when it drys. I think that’s everything, I hope what I said makes sense:)",
