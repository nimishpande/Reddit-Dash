Its been 10 months since I started growing it. Discovered I have a pretty wavy/curly hair and started a curly hair routine. It was very difficult to maintain it and had to learn how to take care of it. I'm planning to grow it out for another 1-2 years and see how it goes. \n\nRoutine: Normal Shampoo, Dove Conditioner/Mask, Leave-in Conditioner while damp, Coconut Oil also to keep the make the hair weigh down. Otherwise it would get frizzy and reach for the ceiling lol.",

She doesn’t understand curly hair at ALL but she’s constantly making comments about my appearance. My hair being a point of contention whenever I visit.\n\nSo I was recently with family for my sisters graduation. While we’re waiting, a woman a few rows below us goes to sit down. My moms pokes me, leans over and says “wow! She has beautiful hair!” I stare at this woman’s hair (which is beautiful) and see all of the flaws my mom points out for my hair: dusts of halo frizz, wayward curls, etc… nothing wrong with it, but things people like my mother shame me over. Her hair type is JUST like mine, but her hair goes down mid back rather than my shoulder length. I say “Seriously? My hair is just like that and you insult it all the time!” She goes quiet for a moment, thinking, and then says “well, idk. It’s longer and it looks better on her.”\n\nJust can’t win.\n\nRoutine, since I still need to put one down I guess? Shampoo and conditioner is whatever, denman brush for styling, Aluram curl cream and air drying for finish.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

The lady who owns it is always there and does the nails and is really nice. I’ll possibly be the only hair client in there. I’ve been there for nails before.\n\nWhen the staff are talking out loud across the room about stuff that peaks my interest is it rude to join in? Am I joining in on a private convo or not? Sometimes I think they’re trying to include me but I’m not sure so I stay silent but then I worry that’s being rude. \n\nIm getting a cut and ombré balayage with a mixture of bright colours needing bleached so feel I’m gonna be there for a few hours and it’s stressing me out!\n\n \n\n\n",

Like ummm…. This is just not the reality for me and makes me feel like my hair is not represented in this community. I know this is sort of a me problem but i just never know what to do with my hair, i know that it’s taken a lot for curly hair to be seen as acceptable in the workplace and whatnot, but i fear that will never be possible for me. I literally look like a mess all the time even if i put it in a low ponytail all the different textures stick out. Even if i try to straighten it it just doesn’t work for some reason, idk if im dumb or something but i can run the straightener over it over and over until it fries but my hair won’t be straight (i haven’t actually fried my hair dw) \n\ni mean does anyone have hair like this? What do you do with this to look presentable? The only thing that has sorta worked for me is growing it out to my hips so that the curlier textures were like stretched out if that makes sense but it’s not that long anymore\n\nMy routine is wash my hair and cry about it idk (i had to put a routine to post)",

I grow it up and generally get a hair cut that cuts the sides very short and leaves the top fairly long. I also have a huge cowlick on my left side that I get cut shorter than the rest of my hair or else it becomes noticeable very quickly.  I currently use Native and Aussie interchangeably for shampoo and conditioner and wash my hair every 3ish days. I would love to elevate my hair care and have a few questions regarding how. Idk if this helps detail wise but I'm Ashkenazi but do not have enough curls for anything close to a \"Jewfro\" \n\n1. What products should I use/switch to (preferably non-animal tested) \n\n2. What are some hair styles I can try out that would maximize my hair's best qualities \n\n3. How can I bring out my curls more? \n\nAttached are some current hair photos. As you can see whatever curls I had in the past are not coming out right now. You can also see the cowlick being noticeable.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7tlx51zxqxcg1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71d1f1b034cb364203f6a2fb9d90ce074c7067ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v7mtpyyxqxcg1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a4529ad9a147abfa62e9c609e57d1dea3a378a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lwsfyyxqxcg1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=133d3f591109e0016c791ef725cbc4d9d55d156c\n\n",

Special ointment on my skin which has helped the irritations but I neither know what that was about. Please any info on what these can be will help. I believe the irritated patches on my skin was from build up of sweat or a fungus growing on my skin which has gone away because of the intensive care I’ve been giving it.  Constantly washing up. Wearing less layers of cloths. Nd using over the counter lotions and ointments. But now these bumps are popping up. Is there something wrong with my blood? Any info will help\n",
