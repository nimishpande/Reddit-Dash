      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I have a chronic baby face that comes with cheeks that everybody wants to pinch, but that's not a major issue. What bothers me is that my side profile looks horrible. No jaw line at all. And I don't want smth super duper defined, I just want it to at least be there😭\n\nPlus I feel like I'm starting to develop a double chin... somehow? I've always had a tiny pouch there but it's slowly starting to grow more visible. I did some research and I might have a recessed/weak jaw. This is self diagnosis and guesses i didn't really ask a professional. (If it helps, I had braces for 2 years bc my teeth were messed up and my bottom jaw was recessed. Teeth fixed, jaw not not much) Also, the skin under my chin is a bit stretchy. I heard that this could play a role in the double chin appearance..\n\nI really don't know what to do abt it. It's my biggest insecurity. I heard that I should just get surgery to fix my jaw, but I don't have the money for it rn and even if I had I'm absolutely terrified. Some advice I saw was to drink more water to stop water retention and do a specific kind of massage. Would these actually work? Does anybody have other suggestions?🥲",

It is also sensitive, I have a lot of redness and really big pores everywhere, not just the T zone. \n\nI have tried La Roche Posay, Bioderma, Cera Ve, The Ordinary, Mixa and none of those helped. I tried niacinamide serums and pore minimizing serums and they didn't work. My routine is mostly just a cleansing gel and moisturizing cream in the morning and evening, when I was trying out serums, I layered them correctly. I wear makeup every day and not even primers work (mattifying or pore minimizing). I do not have acne but I get small white zits or some zits appear under skin (mostly cheeks and around the nose) almost every day. I have some blackheads but I don't have a lot and I can exctract them, they arent a problem. Please also note that I change my face towel regularly, always just dab my face, change my pillowcase regularly and so on. I really try with everything. I do my routine regularly, I am aware that consistency is key, but nothing has helped me so far. I hate it because I hate the feeling of oilyness on my face and it also affects my hair, it gets oily even faster bc of my face. I also cannot walk around with no foundation because I am insecure about the pores and redness, but also if I don't wear foundation, my face gets oilier even faster and even if I dab it or wash it with water, it gets oily again after an hour.\n\nAny suggestions on which products, routine would work for me?

I wash and condition semi-daily, and fragrance is a big deal for me.

I just don’t feel feminine anymore and have been feeling very insecure ever since. \n\nI’ve never had hair this short before and I genuinely don’t feel like myself anymore. I don’t feel feminine, I feel super insecure, and I’ve even been avoiding leaving the house because suddenly even my favourite clothes don’t look good on me anymore. It’s too short to put into a ponytail, too short to slick back, too short to clip up. I just feel kind of stuck and ugly, honestly.\n\nI know it sounds dramatic but I’m really struggling with it mentally more than I expected.\n\nSo I’m begging for any tips at all:\n\n• How do you style a bob so it looks cute and girly and not just… blah?\n\n• How do you make short hair feel more feminine / flattering?\n\n• What helped you emotionally when you cut your hair too short and regretted it?\n\n• Is there anything that actually helps it grow faster?\n\n• Also dumb question but… am I supposed to condition it still or just shampoo?? I have no idea what I’m doing with short hair …\n\nI’d seriously appreciate any advice. Please tell me I’m not alone in this.\n\nThank you!",

Moisturising doesnt seem to do anything either.\n\nI tried talking to a GP, but they didnt seem concerned at all and just gave me generic advice like exfoliating that didnt help.\n\nMy main issue is that i have all of these little bumps that are making my arms rough and they just wont go away.\n\nI found some cheaper China made products ($10 and below) claiming to get rid of Keratosis Pilaris easily on sites like Shopee, but i have no idea if they actually work and nobody appears to have written articles about them.\n\nI live in Singapore btw, so i cant buy stuff available only in USA/EU.",
