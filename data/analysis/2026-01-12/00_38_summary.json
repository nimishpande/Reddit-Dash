I go in with the condish, then the cream and gel, then diffuse, then clap out with oil. \n\nI sleep in a satin bonnet, and haven't found a refresh routine yet that works. \n\nSituation:\n\nDuring covid, I watched too many tiktoks and decided to try bangs. It was a mistake. I am growing them out, but now I am super thick around my head and it gets noticeably thinner towards the ends. \n\nI am weirdly attached to the length. It is down past my waist. BUT, I think it might look better if I cut it maybe at the level I suggested in the pic. My hair is healthy to the ends. I just had a cut 3 weeks ago. \n\nMy husband just tells me it looks fine, but the more I look at it, the more I think this needs to happen. \n\nIf this were your hair, would you cut it? If so, around the same location I indicated?\n\nAlso please forgive the frizz. I'll figure that part out at some point, I hope. \n\nThank you for any/all advice!",

Hv approached many dermats as a kid n nothing helped. So I basically gave up on skincare n stuff. Only time has healed my skin. I still get acne. Like 5-10 a month including period acne) I randomly landed up on reddit skincare pages n was basically scrolling through it. Heard from some how micellar has helped them with comedones and stuff. Decided to give it a try. And ngl, with 2 days I could see drastic changes in my skin. The comedones have drastically reduced on my forehead. Micellar also helped me with acne. If there's any acne flaring up, I just use micellar on it and the next day the acne is gone pretty much.\n\nI used Garnier pink cap.\n\nHow do I use it:\nNight: I clean my face with micellar water using cotton pads or any clean smooth cotton cloth. Then I wash my face with a cleanser. Then proceed with my night routine. (Which is basically just applying moisturizer. I use ponds super light moisturizer as I hv oily acne prone skin)\n\nMorning: I clean my face with micellar water (my face gets all super oily in the morning) and then I wash with a cleanser. Apply moisturizer and sunscreen (I use solasafe sunscreen)\n\nPs: I still hv some comedones on my skin. But micellar has made a huge difference. Also it's been a week + since I started using it.\n\nI now hv to work on my skin texture too.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I try to be a thoughtful consumer, so I really hate to have all of these products just lying around, but I don’t know what to do with them! \n\nThe women in my family have near-identical skin and hair types to me, so I can’t pawn these products off to them; the men in my family are 12-in-1 guys (yikes), so no interest there. I just really don’t know what to do with all this crap. If anyone has any advice on how to reuse or repurpose unused/barely used beauty products, I would love to hear it! Thanks so much! 😊",

I was previously using prescription 0.025% tretinoin 3-4 times a week and had no issues.\n\nI have been looking into safer alternatives and Azelaic acid was recommended. I am very confused about what percentage to use and what form (gel vs cream). The main issues I want to target are hormonal acne which is mild to moderate (I tend to get this around my chin and lower neck area).\n\nI don’t have rosacea, severe hyperpigmentation and my skin leans towards dehydrated (oily cheeks and tzone but dry chin). I have stopped all actives such as tretinoin and salicylic acid which was also not recommended anymore by my doctor for conception. One of my biggest issues was my sebaceous filaments around the nose area which were not fixed by tretinoin and I had to use salicylic acid for that separately.\n\nI am considering to gently introduce it in my routine by getting prescription 10% Azelaic acid cream/lotion since it is more moisturizing than gels. Would love to hear your thoughts about your personal experience with Azelaic acid.",

I have fine hair, but a crap ton of it so frizz is always a problem, ESPECIALLY ON DAY 2. (Pics of of day2 hair) \n\nRight now my routine wash is Joico KPak deluxe shampoo and verb moisture conditioner. My clarifying day (1x/week) is Ouai clarifying shampoo, followed by Malibu hard water shampoo, followed by coco and Eve like a virgin hair mask. \n\nCurly hair routine:\n\nLeave sopping wet\n\nSection hair down the middle and detangle with leave in conditioner \n\nPut in Ouai curl cream and rake. \n\nGel (not your mothers medium hold curl gel) and rake \n\nBrush with a defining brush in small sections\n\nscrunch excess water with microfiber towel\n\nPut on mousse (OGX coconut curls)\n\nDry with a diffuser. \n\nScrunch out cast with Moroccan oil\n\nDo we think that my routine is weighing down my hair underneath causing it not curl as much? Or is it just lucky of the draw? Do you know of any routines that can help with this difference. And help with the frizz??\n\nTLDR: 2c hair on top, 2a hair underneath. Looking for routine/products to help with different curls and frizz",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm 19 years old, and I have shoulder blade length wavy/curly thick hair (I think 2B-2C ish?). Just about two years ago my hair basically took a turn for the worse and I started having to wash it every day / every other day. Before this I could go about a week without washing it. Now whenever I wash it it doesn't really feel totally clean, almost like it's still coated in something. It also gets oily incredibly fast at the roots. I usually wash with two different shampoos, just so it will feel clean enough. I also rinse for like 10 minutes very thoroughly, so I don't think buildup is the issue. It feels like I've tried everything: hair mask, hair oil, clarifying shampoos, washing in distilled water, using only one shampoo, conditioner only on the ends, no conditioner, scalp scrub, hard water shampoo, sulfate-free shampoo, shampoo with sulfates, etc.\n\nMy current hair wash routine is:\n\n**Wash first with Redken Color Extend Magnetics Shampoo (my hair has never been colored, just using this bc my hairdresser recommended it)**\n\n**2nd wash with Head and Shoulders Bare Shampoo**\n\n**Rinse for a looooong time**\n\n**Condition with NYM Conditioner (only on ends)**\n\n**Airdry (using microfiber towel)**\n\nCould it just be the water where I live? I live in a metropolitan area that's known for having hard water, but it doesn't affect anyone else in my family. I've heard of this issue a few times from people with wavy or textured hair, so it might have something to do with that?\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions AT ALL please let me know. This is something that's driving me bananas and has been a little upsetting, since my hair really feels too unclean to do any sort of fun hairstyle with. Thanks!",

I think my biggest problem is shrinkage and I love volume so my curls look shorter than they actually are and I hate that because I wish they were longer! I see a lot of curly girls I know with beautiful long curly hair and I don’t know why mine are so short despite me never cutting or trimming them. What should I do?\n\nMy routine:\n\n\\- drugstore clarifying shampoo\n\n\\- garnier hair food banana conditioner\n\n\\- drugstore curl cream or gel\n\n\\- pantene coconut oil\n\n\\- i diffuse my hair until 70% dry and then let it air dry\n\n\\- I wash my hair once/twice a week and I do protective styles like dutch braids or twists twice a week. I’ve been noticing a change in my hair growth since I started braiding it.",

      "content": "My mother, bless her heart, can't have scented products in the house. After trying it while staying at a friend's, I found that Sol De Janeiro's Body Badalada lotion really helped with the dry and cracked skin on my hands, better than any Eucerin or Gold Bond lotions I've used in the past. Unfortunately, it irritates her sinuses to the point of headaches within minutes. Comparing the ingredients, the one that stands out the most to me is the Brazil nut oil, but I'm not 100% sure if that is what's making the difference. \n\nDoes anyone happen to know of similar products that are unscented or perhaps less scented than SDJ's? (I hope this is the right place to post this!) \n\nThank you so much for your help.",
