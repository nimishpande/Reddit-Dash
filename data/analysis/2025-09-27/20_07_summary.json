I have oily skin. \n\nMorning:\nSebonia Serum → How effective is it for acne and oil control? Any side effects?\n\nSuncross Aqua Gel Sunscreen → Is it lightweight and non-comedogenic? Does it leave a white cast?\n\nNight:\nTretinoin Gel (0.012%) → I’ve been told to start with 10 minutes and wash off, then increase by 5 minutes daily up to a max of 2 hours. Is the “wash-off” method effective? Any tips for handling purging/irritation?\n\nMoistorex Hydra Moisturizer → Is it hydrating enough for people on tretinoin? Does it clog pores?\n\n\nIf you’ve used any of these products, I’d really appreciate hearing your experiences and any do’s/don’ts.\n\nThanks a lot! \n\n",
