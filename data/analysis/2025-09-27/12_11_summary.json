      "content": "Hi everyone,\nMy dermatologist recently prescribed me this acne routine. Since I’m new to most of these, I wanted to ask for advice or experiences with each product. I have oily skin. \n\nMorning:\nSebonia Serum → How effective is it for acne and oil control? Any side effects?\n\nSuncross Aqua Gel Sunscreen → Is it lightweight and non-comedogenic? Does it leave a white cast?\n\nNight:\nTretinoin Gel (0.012%) → I’ve been told to start with 10 minutes and wash off, then increase by 5 minutes daily up to a max of 2 hours. Is the “wash-off” method effective? Any tips for handling purging/irritation?\n\nMoistorex Hydra Moisturizer → Is it hydrating enough for people on tretinoin? Does it clog pores?\n\n\nIf you’ve used any of these products, I’d really appreciate hearing your experiences and any do’s/don’ts.\n\nThanks a lot! \n\n",

I’ve literally only ever used a basic face wash because up until a few months ago, my skin was really clear no pimples, no visible pores, nothing.\n\nBut recently I’ve started break out and noticing pores:\n\n* Forehead has small pimples + visible pores\n* Right beside my nose (Ig bcz I wear glasses?)\n* And now they’re even starting to show up on my cheeks\n\nI have no skincare routine and honestly no clue where to start. I don’t wanna go overboard, just need something simple that can help with pores + stop my skin from getting worse. Pls make it affordable and not a long routine..\n\n**Skin type:** My forehead and nose are oily, but after I wash with a face wash, my skin feels dry.\n\nWhat products or routine would you recommend for a complete beginner?",
