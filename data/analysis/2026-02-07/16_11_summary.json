None of them made a lot of difference. So last year, I actually sat down to do my research on different actives that target hyperpigmentation. \n\nSharing what worked for me as well as my routine in the photo. New products in my routine are the toner and three serums, which I started using a few months ago (introduced one at a time every week or two) and have seen approx. 30-40% reduction in my problem areas. \n\nNote: this routine is for various parts of my body. I don’t use Cicaplast on my face everyday. \n\nHope this helps some of you and just ask away if you  want more info! :)\n\n—— \n\nDISCLAIMER: Just because it worked for me does not mean it will work for everyone.

      "title": "How curls thought me to accept myself.♥️",
      "content": "Hi curly heads ♥️ I embraced my curls and started growing them out about a one and half year ago. I say \"embraced\" because I used to think I had just ugly hair that I had to straighten and it wasn't until I was 25, that I realize that it was just misunderstood, haha. After many years of straightening, it was difficult, not very pretty, and I was quite unhappy about it, but at the same time, I never felt more like myself. Those messy ringlets and occasional frizz defined me much more than my forcibly straightened, polished hair.So I started trying different techniques, products, etc. Trial and error. Not everything suits you, we all have different hair. Eventually, I found a technique and products that help me keep my curls in presentable condition so I don't look like Hagrid, and let's face it, there are days like that haha. Curls have a mind of their own, but I don't hold it against them, I've learned to accept them as they are, to accept myself. On good days and bad days. \n\nBelow, I share my routine and products. Hopefully, it will help some of you. And if you're just starting out or halfway through, don't give up—curls are a gift, they're fun, and they're like life. They twist in all directions, but once you understand them and learn to love them, they are absolutely beautiful♥️\n\n*Routine*🫶\n\nSince I have very dry hair, I apply a coconut oil mask the night before washing it. I massage it into the roots while watching series or something. It also promotes growth, which I think is mainly due to the massage! ♥️\n\n1. I use Giovanni shampoo 2x and conditioner—the line for damaged hair.\n\n2. Then I dry my hair with a cotton T-shirt, gently squeezing it but leaving it still quite damp.\n\n \n\n3. Now comes the fun part haha— \n\nFirst—Giovanni Leave-in Conditioner.\n\nAt this point, I comb my hair while leaning forward and at the end I give each strand a little \"wobble\" to make it wavy again, and then I continue with the products. \n\nSecond - Curl Keeper Original Liquid Styler (this is also great for refreshing and reducing frizz) \n\nThird - INNERSE Volumizing Foam at the roots \n\nFourth - Giovanni Styling Gel on the lengths.\n\n*TIP 1- Once every 2-3 months, when I feel that my hair is heavy, I wash it with Pretty Curly Hair Reset Shampoo. It helps remove all the products and makes my hair much lighter and airier. Just buy the smallest size, it will last.* 🙏\n\n5- Then comes the diffusing. I diffuse my hair while leaning forward from the roots and flip my hair from side to side to create volume. I do the ends last. At  the very end, clapping the curls to break up the gel. \n\nFinally, I add coconut oil again.\n\nThe whole process takes me about 35 to 40 minutes, including drying. I wash my hair once a week, usually in the morning on my first day off so that it stays nice haha. I usually refresh it after three or four days.\n\n*TIP 2- I think Length matters a lot—the third photo is about 7 months old, my hair is shorter here after a haircut, and you can see that the curls looked smoother and more defined. Since then, my hair has grown, and the curls are completely different—more airy, and because they are longer, they are heavier, so they are not as defined. It depends on what you like better. I've always wanted long hair, so I refuse cut it, but I thought it was worth mentioning.*😊♥️\n\nSleep\n\nI sleep with my hair in a high ponytail—a pineapple in a satin bonnet. The ponytail is very important; the bonnet alone is not enough. In the fourth  photo, I tried to show where it should be, really almost at the forehead. (A ponytail is enough for me, but if you have longer hair, I know that girls put it up in a loose bun.)\n\nThe point is that you don't lie on your curls and put pressure on them, so they don't flatten and get ruined. You'll look like Lord Farquaad at night, but in the morning you'll be princesses, haha.\n\nBecause of it the curls will stay nice for 3-4 days. Then I wear them in a high ponytail during the day, but they still look good, just less defined.\n\nOf course, I moisturize them every morning and add oil to damp hair throughout the week. \n\n*TIP 3- When I take off my bonnet and let my hair down, I gently separate each curl on both sides with my fingers. This aerates  hair and restores its volume. Then I dampen it and add Curl Keeper. After refreshing my hair like this, I no longer use gel, but instead use mousse to strengthen my curls while keeping them light.  I let it dry naturally.* \n\nIt may all seem complicated, but with practice, it takes me no longer than putting in my contact lenses. It's all about habit.\n\nSorry for the long text, but I wanted to write everything down, haha.\n\nI hope this helps someone. ♥️If you have any good products or tips, I'd love for you to share them too in comments♥️\n\nGood luck on your curly journey!♥️",

      "content": "Or does anybody have a secret tip that gets them to listen without just being a rude and scary customer? I've tried so many hairdressers in my city, price points anywhere between 20 and 120€ per cut, and none of them seem to listen to a single word I say.\n\n\"Would it be possible to cut my hair while it's dry? It really is a lot easier to get an even cut this way.\" \"That's not how it's done, cutting wet hair is always easier!\" Okay then. I stopped trying to convince them because not a single one ever listened, not even the ones who have cut my hair before and know how long it takes to fix the unevenness they create with a wet cut.\n\n\"I want a slightly longer pixie like in this photo, so my hair should cover my ears. My curls pull up a lot when drying, so since you're cutting them wet, they need to go slightly past my chin - right where I am pointing now.\" \"Got it! \\^\\_\\^\" and the very next second I feel how they cut my hair directly at earlobe level. I will clasp my wet hair between two fingers to pull it as straight as they do with the comb, and then use my other hand to point at the exact place where the scissors or the blade would need to go, but they still always manage to miss it by at least 3 cm. Do they forget? Or do they just ignore me because they think they know better? Even though simple geometry says that to connect points A and B, a curved line needs to be longer than a straight line? Telling them that I want a bob when I actually want a pixie doesn't work because while it fixes the length problem, the general shapes of these cuts are too different.\n\n\"Do you see those two spots where my hair is a lot more curly than anywhere else? These need to be left a bit longer. If everything is cut to the same length when wet, I will basically have two large missing chunks in my lengths when dry.\" \"Okay, if you say so!\" And a few minutes afterwards, when I notice that they get close to one of the spots, I repeat \"that's one of the really curly strands I pointed out earlier, so that one should be left longer.\" And they say \"yup I remember \\^\\_\\^\" and still cut it to the exact same wet-length as everything else.\n\nI already gave up on \"could you hold the hair dryer in one place when diffusing? It breaks up the strands and gives me frizz when you kind of comb my hair with the diffuser nozzles like you're doing right now\" (\"okay!\" \\*keeps combing\\*), or \"can we use a spray bottle to get the hair a bit wet again after cutting? It helps with getting the combed hair back into structured strands\" (\"no, they will tangle if they get wet after combing!\"). I just ask them if I could diffuse them myself and I carry my own spray bottle. So that's an easy communication issue to avoid. But the other stuff is a lot harder.\n\nHow do I get them to listen? Does anyone have tips? Do I just need to be, like, really really assertive? Or interrupt them at every single strand to ask \"can you show me where you're planning to cut? No, a bit lower, please\"? I hate being a Stressful Customer :( so if anybody has tips that don't involve me becoming rude and annoying as fuck, please let me know?\n\n(The sub wants my routine to let me post, I just cowash and style with the Balea Oil Repair line from a drugstore chain in my country, really happy with how that turns out, the hairdressers are the only challenge I have left in my hair journey lmao)",

An expert told me i should working the curly girl routine while put my hair to the sides (repeat that for every step and for both sides due to putting my hair with momentum from each side to the other) and not doing it head over in front of me like i did here again. But i have a really bad neck and so it is the only way. \n\nI also have always the problem that even when all is dry and the gel-cast is scrunched out and then try to put my hair to the back it looks good from the front but my back looks like a huge cowlick in the middle....i hate that. My hair flows so much better when i just wash it, maybe working some products and then already pull all back and brush it like a slick back and let it air dry. The curls are not so defined and nice then but it looks good from the back then. Any tips to avoid that giant cowlick effects while having nice curls?",

I’m not a professional at hair care, but I’ve tried basic things before like coconut oil and similar treatments. Unfortunately, the dryness never really improves and every strand seems to have a mind of its own.  \n\n\nI currently use a curl-defining cream, and it does help a bit, my hair looks better compared to nothing ,but it’s still far from what I want. On top of that, most curl creams make my scalp itchy, which is super annoying.\n\nSo I’m looking for alternative solution\n\nI’m open to:  \nHair care routine  \nProduct recommendations  \nTreatments  \nSemi-permanent solutions\n\nIf there’s anything that can last 1–3 weeks, that would honestly be amazing. Even if not, I’m still very open to solid care advice and product suggestions.\n\nThe closer I can get my hair to the style/texture shown below(in the replies), the happier I’ll be.\n\nThanks in advance, I’d really appreciate hearing your experiences and suggestions \n\n",

      "content": "Hi all, since I was 10 up until the age of 26 when I went on accutane I had moderate acne over my face and chest and severe acne on my back. I rarely show my chest or back so I’m not concerned about pie marks there but I have no idea how to fade the ones on my face? I finished accutane 2 years ago and it was the best thing I ever did, instead of waking up to several new breakouts everyday, I maybe get 1 very small breakout every couple of weeks. \n\nI have combination skin so a very oily noise and forehead but pretty dry everywhere else. I heard pie should usually fade within 6-12 months and in that initial 12 months the marks did fade slightly. But in the last 12 months they haven’t improved at all. \n\nI will admit that I don’t know a lot about skincare and I’ve only just started taking care of my skin properly in the last few weeks. I always used to wash my face and use moisturiser but in the past 3-4 weeks I’ve incorporated a hyaluronic acid serum and a vitamin c eye cream. \n\nWhat products can I use to help fade these marks further? I can’t use any products with fragrance as that always breaks me out. The brands I’ve tried so far that have worked for me are bubble and la roche posay. \n\nAny help is appreciated 😊",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nBit of a long one, sorry!\n\nI've had this ongoing infection for about 6 months and I don't even know if it started as folliculitis, I thought it was just acne. At some point I realised it was different to regular acne and the breakouts were relentless. It developed into compulsive squeezing and picking as well and my skin has become SO damaged that pretty much everything I put on it stings.\n\nI was given Lymecycline for nearly 3 months - didn't help, Flucloxacillin for 7 days - made it worse and spread to my chest and back, then Clarithromycin which also didn't help. I have had on and off swelling of lymph nodes alongside it too. I saw a Dermatologist who recommended Isotretinoin, but there's a wait until a Psychiatrist agrees to oversee treatment which could take months.\n\nI tried fungal treatments in case - clotrimazole cream seemed to help, but not meaningfully. I was given Ketoconazole shampoo and cream, but had a really bad reaction to it. The symptoms also don't match typical fungal folliculitis.\n\nSo I'm very stuck. The symptoms suggest a bacterial infection, but no antibiotics have helped. Doctors are clueless and meanwhile my skin gets more damaged and painful, the spots increase, my self esteem keeps plummeting and I feel absolutely hopeless. I can't bear leaving the house and only go out if I absolutely have to.\n\nIf anyone has been through this and found a solution, please share. I am absolutely desperate.\n\nTL;DR: Have had really bad folliculitis infection for months getting worse, and spreading. Antibiotics haven't helped, neither have antifungal creams. Has anyone had the same and able to cure it?",

I also get these tiny whiteheads mostly on my chin and around my nose.\n\nRight now I have stopped using all products on my face and I only wash my face with cold water and use Nivea soft to moistruize about once a day.

My biggest area problem are my cheeks, &amp; only a little on my forehead &amp; chin, but cheeks are the death of me, mind you they are not small they are very large in size. I have done the works, facials, micro-needling or whatever, extractions, AHA, BHA. Basically everything &amp; all of which did not work.\n\nSo a good skincare routine with added Adapalene, I know that’s it’s doing its job &amp; it needs to purge &amp; it’s surfacing all the gunk out but my god do I feel very ugly with so much breakout &amp; they are not small either. Mind you I have very little patience &amp; I just need some positive words of affirmation that this is going to work &amp; I can hang in there for a couple of months before it begins to work.\n\nSkincare routine :\n\nAM - Ordinary Glucoside Foaming Cleanser\n\n\\- Sunscreen (Non-comedogenic)\n\nPM - Ordinary Squalene Cleanser\n\n\\- Ordinary Glucoside Foaming Cleanser\n\n\\- Slight Micellar Water\n\n\\- Adapalene 0.1%\n\n\\- Dermalogica Aqua Jelly Moisturiser\n\nI really do love the Ordinary products that I currently have! &amp; the Dermalogica Moisturiser, I recently tried the Vanicream but it did not agree with my skin &amp; I hated the feeling of it, also made me sweat?\n\nOf course if you have advice on products I should change or anything to improve in my routine please say so.",
