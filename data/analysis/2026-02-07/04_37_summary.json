      "title": "Is anyone else beyond fed up with hairdressers never ever listening?",
      "content": "Or does anybody have a secret tip that gets them to listen without just being a rude and scary customer? I've tried so many hairdressers in my city, price points anywhere between 20 and 120€ per cut, and none of them seem to listen to a single word I say.\n\n\"Would it be possible to cut my hair while it's dry? It really is a lot easier to get an even cut this way.\" \"That's not how it's done, cutting wet hair is always easier!\" Okay then. I stopped trying to convince them because not a single one ever listened, not even the ones who have cut my hair before and know how long it takes to fix the unevenness they create with a wet cut.\n\n\"I want a slightly longer pixie like in this photo, so my hair should cover my ears. My curls pull up a lot when drying, so since you're cutting them wet, they need to go slightly past my chin - right where I am pointing now.\" \"Got it! \\^\\_\\^\" and the very next second I feel how they cut my hair directly at earlobe level. I will clasp my wet hair between two fingers to pull it as straight as they do with the comb, and then use my other hand to point at the exact place where the scissors or the blade would need to go, but they still always manage to miss it by at least 3 cm. Do they forget? Or do they just ignore me because they think they know better? Even though simple geometry says that to connect points A and B, a curved line needs to be longer than a straight line? Telling them that I want a bob when I actually want a pixie doesn't work because while it fixes the length problem, the general shapes of these cuts are too different.\n\n\"Do you see those two spots where my hair is a lot more curly than anywhere else? These need to be left a bit longer. If everything is cut to the same length when wet, I will basically have two large missing chunks in my lengths when dry.\" \"Okay, if you say so!\" And a few minutes afterwards, when I notice that they get close to one of the spots, I repeat \"that's one of the really curly strands I pointed out earlier, so that one should be left longer.\" And they say \"yup I remember \\^\\_\\^\" and still cut it to the exact same wet-length as everything else.\n\nI already gave up on \"could you hold the hair dryer in one place when diffusing? It breaks up the strands and gives me frizz when you kind of comb my hair with the diffuser nozzles like you're doing right now\" (\"okay!\" \\*keeps combing\\*), or \"can we use a spray bottle to get the hair a bit wet again after cutting? It helps with getting the combed hair back into structured strands\" (\"no, they will tangle if they get wet after combing!\"). I just ask them if I could diffuse them myself and I carry my own spray bottle. So that's an easy communication issue to avoid. But the other stuff is a lot harder.\n\nHow do I get them to listen? Does anyone have tips? Do I just need to be, like, really really assertive? Or interrupt them at every single strand to ask \"can you show me where you're planning to cut? No, a bit lower, please\"? I hate being a Stressful Customer :( so if anybody has tips that don't involve me becoming rude and annoying as fuck, please let me know?\n\n(The sub wants my routine to let me post, I just cowash and style with the Balea Oil Repair line from a drugstore chain in my country, really happy with how that turns out, the hairdressers are the only challenge I have left in my hair journey lmao)",

What do you think?, I’d appreciate some tips if you have some. \n\nHair routine\n\n\t1.\tAfter washing my hair, I apply curl activator and gel  to very wet hair to help define my curls. Cantú hydrating curl activator and Hydrating avocado gel\n\n\t2.\tI gently scrunch my hair with a T-shirt to remove excess water without disturbing the curl pattern.\n\n\t3.\tI let my hair air dry and allow a gel cast to form.\n\n\t4.\tOnce fully dry, I break the cast by gently scrunching to add softness and volume.\n\n\t5.\tOccasionally, I apply a very small drop of argan oil to my hands and lightly scrunch my hair to add shine and reduce stiffness.\n\nNote: every two weeks I use clarifying shampoo Alberto v05, after this, I also apply cantú shea butter coconut cream. \n\nFrequency:\n\nI follow this routine each time I style my hair after washing, and I only use argan oil occasionally when I want extra shine or softness.\n\nAs you can see, I use very cheap products to begin with.

I was scratching my scalp to get that result, so it is never actually that bad. I never have white stuff on my shoulders, but if I take a really close look in the mirror, there are little speckles of that white stuff.\n\nThe other concerning thing is that I have these red marks or scars as you can see in the second picture. I would say these are all over my head, not in centrally located clusters, but dispersed throughout. I’ve had these for years now. Even if I go months without picking at them they are there. They often form a yellow orange color like crystal that I pick off after a long time.\n\nMy scalp never particularly itches or gets irritated, but I don’t want to be gross. Not sure if anyone can tell me for sure what this is. My hair is fine and thin I think, you can see my scalp pretty easily if you manipulate my hair. Should I be following some kind of protocol for washing my hair? Thanks",

I had major acne problems on forehead and face and the marks stay, also bumps on face especially forehead are quite frequent. Also pigmentation on lips( I don't smoke) . I just want to work on the uneven skin tone and texture and the bumps on skin and tanning. Also I have combination skin type and I try to drink Coconut water a lot for skin issues but doesn't seem to help a lot.\n\nProducts: i went on the internet searching and got to know about a few creames , like \n1. Glycolic acid\n2. Tretinoin\n3. Azelaic acid\n4. Salicylic acid\n5. Kojic acid\n\nQuestions:\n1. Now I wanna know which of these should I use, how and if combining them in what way ?\n\n2. I also plan to use sunscreen, I use lakme rn, not very regular with it though, please suggest any for my skin type?\n\n3. Any other remedies to get rid of tanning and bumps and acne scar please? \n\nThanks in advance !\n",

I'm chalking it up mostly to the type of sunscreen I was using (i asked my bf who never ever burns if he could research and purchase a reef-safe sunscreen as we've been snorkeling in mexico, and he showed up with spf 30 😬), but i also used that on the rest of my body and only got a little pink. \n\nto be clear, im not really looking for advice on what I did wrong/to do differently, I am just concerned as we fly back to freezing cold nyc tomorrow and the slightest touch of fabric hurts like hell. whats up with this, is there anything I can do other than icing/ibuprofen/aloe to help, and do I need to see anyone about it?\n\nive attached some photos taken with/without flash comparing my normal skin tone with tiny patches of burn from spots I missed earlier and the abomination that is on my leg. unfortunately, it is redder in person!\n\nthank you so much and apologies for the extended description.",

I am wondering if anyone can explain to me scientifically the discussion and recommendation of not washing the hair until 48-72 hours after a color service due to the cuticle not being “completely closed”. I know cuticles dont work like blinds that just open and close. In my experience, washing 24 hours after color shouldn’t affect the longevity because the color doesn’t continue processing &amp; the conditioner seals with an acidic pH. I’m confusedddd",

If I apply lip balm on top it just makes it worse, I have to fully exfoliate off as much as I can with a dry tissue or paper towel and THEN go back in with the lip balm. Is there a way to prevent this? Would switching to lipstick help? Or do I just need to be exfoliating my lips multiple times a day... thanks in advance for any advice!! ",

      "content": "I need routine help. Freshman year of college I stopped taking doxycycline and using tretinoin because my face was always burning and I didn’t want to become reliant. That’s how I got most of my deep ice pick scarring, I had some very deep and inflamed under the skin cysts that would get popped and stay. Admittedly I do pick my skin when I’m stressed, which in college was a lot.\n\nWhen I found Paula’s choice BHA, that was the first time in a decade that I had clear skin. I would layer it with a tiny dot of benzoyl peroxide gel 10% and do this everyday (bp face washes never were as effective). At some point though, my breakouts around my jaw came back. I’ve tried a lot of things at this point, from differin to Tret and all sorts of acids. I really wish I took Accutane during Covid, but I heard too many horror stories and now it’s too late. I can’t really afford potential physical fatigue or avoiding the sun all the time. I’d prefer not to have to take anything I rely on.\n\nI’m getting very tired. There are periods where I think my skin is clearing up (see the photos where it looks like glass) before it explodes. As of late, it has that shine that makes me think my barrier is compromised, but it also doesn’t sting as much as it used to. I tried to get a facial several months ago and the lady said my barrier was compromised, but as of late I can put a face mask on and be ok, which wasn’t the case when I used BHA + BP everyday. When I try to take skincare breaks, I get under the skin pimples all over again. As of late, I went back to differin and azelaic acid but I think differin is too weak so I got Tret again. I thought this would be over by my late 20s, when will it end? Is there a routine that I can at least get semi-consistent results or is the only answer hormonal + cutting out every enjoyable food in life? I most likely will not be switching up my whole lifestyle just for clear skin, but any advice is welcome.",
