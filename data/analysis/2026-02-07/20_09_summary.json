Last 2 pics are after washing yesterday, and this morning)\n\nMy hair is usually so thick and juicy, light frizz comes naturally I don’t mind that. My problem is that these last couple of months, my hair has been so… stringy?? They’re not getting juicy anymore. And the curls are very lackluster, like waves. Then when I wake up the day after washing them a lot of the underneath is just straight. It’s almost as if my hair has changed texture, it’s looser and softer. \n\nAny advice to get my juicy thick curls back please comment! I have high porosity hair, I usually do use a bonnet.\n\nMy routine:\n\nI do my hair every 3-4 days. I shampoo with off brand head and shoulders every other time (I think this might be part of the issue, I know I need new shampoo. Recommendations would be helpful.) Then I use OGX coconut miracle oil conditioner every time. Usually use a little herbal essences mousse, then diffuse, then when It’s dry I oil it with jojoba. \n\nIn the past I never used mousse, &amp; was using shea moisture power green shampoo (seldomly) &amp; love beauty and planet conditioner but it has become too expensive for me.

      "title": "How curls thought me to accept myself.♥️",
      "content": "Hi curly heads ♥️ I embraced my curls and started growing them out about a one and half year ago. I say \"embraced\" because I used to think I had just ugly hair that I had to straighten and it wasn't until I was 25, that I realize that it was just misunderstood, haha. After many years of straightening, it was difficult, not very pretty, and I was quite unhappy about it, but at the same time, I never felt more like myself. Those messy ringlets and occasional frizz defined me much more than my forcibly straightened, polished hair.So I started trying different techniques, products, etc. Trial and error. Not everything suits you, we all have different hair. Eventually, I found a technique and products that help me keep my curls in presentable condition so I don't look like Hagrid, and let's face it, there are days like that haha. Curls have a mind of their own, but I don't hold it against them, I've learned to accept them as they are, to accept myself. On good days and bad days. \n\nBelow, I share my routine and products. Hopefully, it will help some of you. And if you're just starting out or halfway through, don't give up—curls are a gift, they're fun, and they're like life. They twist in all directions, but once you understand them and learn to love them, they are absolutely beautiful♥️\n\n*Routine*🫶\n\nSince I have very dry hair, I apply a coconut oil mask the night before washing it. I massage it into the roots while watching series or something. It also promotes growth, which I think is mainly due to the massage! ♥️\n\n1. I use Giovanni shampoo 2x and conditioner—the line for damaged hair.\n\n2. Then I dry my hair with a cotton T-shirt, gently squeezing it but leaving it still quite damp.\n\n \n\n3. Now comes the fun part haha— \n\nFirst—Giovanni Leave-in Conditioner.\n\nAt this point, I comb my hair while leaning forward and at the end I give each strand a little \"wobble\" to make it wavy again, and then I continue with the products. \n\nSecond - Curl Keeper Original Liquid Styler (this is also great for refreshing and reducing frizz) \n\nThird - INNERSE Volumizing Foam at the roots \n\nFourth - Giovanni Styling Gel on the lengths.\n\n*TIP 1- Once every 2-3 months, when I feel that my hair is heavy, I wash it with Pretty Curly Hair Reset Shampoo. It helps remove all the products and makes my hair much lighter and airier. Just buy the smallest size, it will last.* 🙏\n\n5- Then comes the diffusing. I diffuse my hair while leaning forward from the roots and flip my hair from side to side to create volume. I do the ends last. At  the very end, clapping the curls to break up the gel. \n\nFinally, I add coconut oil again.\n\nThe whole process takes me about 35 to 40 minutes, including drying. I wash my hair once a week, usually in the morning on my first day off so that it stays nice haha. I usually refresh it after three or four days.\n\n*TIP 2- I think Length matters a lot—the third photo is about 7 months old, my hair is shorter here after a haircut, and you can see that the curls looked smoother and more defined. Since then, my hair has grown, and the curls are completely different—more airy, and because they are longer, they are heavier, so they are not as defined. It depends on what you like better. I've always wanted long hair, so I refuse cut it, but I thought it was worth mentioning.*😊♥️\n\nSleep\n\nI sleep with my hair in a high ponytail—a pineapple in a satin bonnet. The ponytail is very important; the bonnet alone is not enough. In the fourth  photo, I tried to show where it should be, really almost at the forehead. (A ponytail is enough for me, but if you have longer hair, I know that girls put it up in a loose bun.)\n\nThe point is that you don't lie on your curls and put pressure on them, so they don't flatten and get ruined. You'll look like Lord Farquaad at night, but in the morning you'll be princesses, haha.\n\nBecause of it the curls will stay nice for 3-4 days. Then I wear them in a high ponytail during the day, but they still look good, just less defined.\n\nOf course, I moisturize them every morning and add oil to damp hair throughout the week. \n\n*TIP 3- When I take off my bonnet and let my hair down, I gently separate each curl on both sides with my fingers. This aerates  hair and restores its volume. Then I dampen it and add Curl Keeper. After refreshing my hair like this, I no longer use gel, but instead use mousse to strengthen my curls while keeping them light.  I let it dry naturally.* \n\nIt may all seem complicated, but with practice, it takes me no longer than putting in my contact lenses. It's all about habit.\n\nSorry for the long text, but I wanted to write everything down, haha.\n\nI hope this helps someone. ♥️If you have any good products or tips, I'd love for you to share them too in comments♥️\n\nGood luck on your curly journey!♥️",

The stylist was dismissive and, frankly, rude. I explained that I wanted natural highlights and tried to show her my reference photos, but she didn’t even want to look at them. She said she does natural highlights every day and didn’t need references. Looking back, that was the first red flag. It was probably stupid of me to stay, but the salon has great reviews and the stylist was recommended to me by a friend.\n\nShe didn’t brush or properly part my hair. She just started applying bleach and foils before I even really knew what was happening. She did one section on the left side by my face and then immediately stepped away to blow-dry another client’s hair. That was my second red flag, but at that point I felt like I was already in too deep.\n\nAfter about 7–10 minutes, I actually had to ask her to come back. She did, somewhat begrudgingly, applied another section, and then disappeared again. I have incredibly thick hair so it’s a big task to color, which I understand, but at this point she hadn’t even applied bleach to a third of it.\n\nEventually she came back and finished the application. She was quite rough throughout the entire process, but I tried to brush it off. By the time all the foils were finally in, 40–50 minutes had passed since the first section had been applied.\n\nI know my hair well. I maintained blonde hair for years, and only went back to my natural colour after having a baby because the upkeep became too much. My hair lightens quickly and damages easily. I very politely expressed concern that the first section had been processing far longer than the rest. She seemed irritated and insisted it was fine.\n\nI sat for another 20 minutes. During that time, she hadn’t checked a single foil. I gently asked her to please check how the lightening was going. Without checking, she said, “Come to the basin. I’m going to rinse out that front section so you can stop worrying about it.”\n\nWhen she removed the foils my hair was paper white. She quickly washed it out and then said, “Oh, it’s a good thing we got that off,” (????). She then decided to rinse out the other front section as well. Mind you, I was standing and leaning head-first over the basin with my head hovering above it while bleach-filled water poured down my face.\n\nShe left the remaining foils in for another ten minutes, then washed my entire head. She said, “I need to tone this,” and applied toner without discussing it with me at all. I didn’t even realise she was toning my hair, I assumed she would rinse the bleach and then talk to me about next steps.\n\nNeedless to say, the results are awful. I’ve had better highlights at 15 using pharmacy bleach applied by my stoned friend in a bathroom.\n\nOnly then did the stylist’s demeanour completely change. She was suddenly polite and said the results were “strange,” that she didn’t know why, and that she wanted to fix it. She insisted that I book another appointment the following week. \n\nI just thanked her a left, I should have said something but I was quite frankly in shock about the whole situation. \n\nI will obviously not be going back, but I am incredibly frustrated and wanted to share because I need validation that this entire experience was ridiculous. \n\nOH, and to top it all off, the receptionist came up to me with a card machine WHILE I STILL HAD FOILS IN to ask me to settle the bill. This was not a cheap salon, so the entire situation threw me for a loop. I feel like an idiot for just going along with the insanity that took place, but I tend to be a people pleaser and that side of me took over… someone make me feel better. Please. ",

An expert told me i should working the curly girl routine while put my hair to the sides (repeat that for every step and for both sides due to putting my hair with momentum from each side to the other) and not doing it head over in front of me like i did here again. But i have a really bad neck and so it is the only way. \n\nI also have always the problem that even when all is dry and the gel-cast is scrunched out and then try to put my hair to the back it looks good from the front but my back looks like a huge cowlick in the middle....i hate that. My hair flows so much better when i just wash it, maybe working some products and then already pull all back and brush it like a slick back and let it air dry. The curls are not so defined and nice then but it looks good from the back then. Any tips to avoid that giant cowlick effects while having nice curls?",

      "content": "Been on finasteride for 1 year with zero issues. Sleep was always fine. Then I added topical minoxidil foam and shortly after started waking up around 2am every night and can’t fall back asleep. No problem falling asleep initially. I’m out by 10:30pm, but after waking up, I get super light, fragmented sleep, or no sleep at all. Most nights I’m only getting 3–4 solid hours.\n\nThis has been going on 5 months now. I tried stopping topical minox for a week but the sleep issues didn’t change. Some nights when traveling or staying at friends’ places I sleep a bit better, but it’s still not normal, feels like my body just can’t sleep more than 6-7 hours anymore.\n\nA few months after this started, I added oral minoxidil and dutasteride, and honestly things seemed to get worse, which now has me super confused about what’s causing what. Currently on fin + dut + oral + topical minox.\n\nI’m otherwise very healthy — super physical job, sports/exercise, eat clean, no issues falling asleep, dark room, no phone before bed, same routine every night. Tried magnesium, supplements, minimizing liquids before bed, honey, kiwis, etc. Tested negative for sleep apnea and blood tests came back normal. No diabetes or infections. Don’t want to take sleep meds. Nothing helps.\n\nAlso worth noting: I’ve always woken up once at night to pee, even before all this — but before I could fall right back asleep. Now I can’t, and sometimes need to pee twice a night.\n\nAt this point I’m honestly at a loss and it’s really affecting my quality of life.\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this from fin or min? Or does this sound unrelated / something else entirely?\n\nWould really appreciate hearing others’ experiences.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I’m not a professional at hair care, but I’ve tried basic things before like coconut oil and similar treatments. Unfortunately, the dryness never really improves and every strand seems to have a mind of its own.  \n\n\nI currently use a curl-defining cream, and it does help a bit, my hair looks better compared to nothing ,but it’s still far from what I want. On top of that, most curl creams make my scalp itchy, which is super annoying.\n\nSo I’m looking for alternative solution\n\nI’m open to:  \nHair care routine  \nProduct recommendations  \nTreatments  \nSemi-permanent solutions\n\nIf there’s anything that can last 1–3 weeks, that would honestly be amazing. Even if not, I’m still very open to solid care advice and product suggestions.\n\nThe closer I can get my hair to the style/texture shown below(in the replies), the happier I’ll be.\n\nThanks in advance, I’d really appreciate hearing your experiences and suggestions \n\n",

      "content": "Hi, I was wondering if anyone has any tips for shine. My face is always shiny, even right after cleansing or, as in these photos, right after applying blotting paper. (The blotting paper does remove some oil — my face, later in the afternoon, does get pretty oily — but a lot of shininess still remains; the same happens when I cleanse.) I don’t think it’s just my face being especially reflective or something like that, bc it’s not like a dry-shiny but rather, as you can see, it’s more of a liquidy-shiny? I’m probably overreacting, but I’ve become really insecure about it. \n\nIs this just the way my skin is (e.g., it’s like a genetics thing) or is there something products-wise I could/should be doing? If it’s the former and there’s nothing I can do about it, I’m cool with going into love-myself mode and deciding to ignore it, but it’s hard to enter that mode when I don’t know whether actually it’s something tactical that I’m doing wrong or could be doing.\n\nAny help/advice would be much appreciated, thanks!\n\n(My skincare routine:  \n*Morning* \\-  \n\\- CeraVe’s Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser (but if I’m not leaving my apt, sometimes I’ll skip the cleanser and just wash with water)  \n\\- moisturizer: La Roche-Posay's Effaclar Mat  \n\\- sunscreen: Murad’s Oil and Pore Control Mattifier SPF 45  \n*Evening* \\-  \n\\- same cleanser  \n\\- moisturizer: Skinfix’s Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream.  \n  \nI’ve used different products before, which I could list out if that’s helpful, but my base shininess is always pretty much the same and has been for a long time. I also used to use Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant about 1-2x/week, but stopped once I started using Cabtreo on my chin (my dermatologist said not to use other actives during Cabtreo).  \n  \nThe shininess doesn’t always appear in photos (I think the camera lens flattens it out or something) and won’t always appear in mirrors, depending on the surrounding lighting; but then I’ll be out walking and catch my reflection in a glass building when the sun is out, or find myself before a certain mirror, and suddenly see all this shine in its full glory, lol.) ",

I've been struggling a lot with some different things in my life, and have been chronically  stressed and sleep deprived. Haven't gotten a good nightss sleep in like a year. I also had a phase for like 6-8 months where I was drinking heavily every night. I just stopped about a month ago.  \nMy face has changed. It looks puffy, filled out, unhealthy, dull, saggy... just bad. When I look at pics of myself from as recent as 2-2.5 years ago, it's upsetting to see how insanely different my face looks - lean, clear skin, cheekbones showing, just healthy looking. Can I fix some of this damage I've done to myself? I understand aging is a thing. But this just doesn't look natural.

I’ve seen that you all share a lot of tips here, so I wanted to ask for some advice.\nEver since I can remember, my elbows and knees have always been darker than the rest of my body (especially my elbows), but it never really bothered me.\nLately, though, it’s been making me really uncomfortable, so I started looking for ways to treat it. I ended up using Creamy’s mandelic acid because I already use it on small acne marks and it always worked well for me. I used it properly (at night, washed it off in the morning, moisturized, and always used sunscreen).\nThat said, I used it on my elbow for about a month and a half, and instead of getting better, it actually got worse. It kept getting darker and sometimes it would hurt and get really red, which honestly made me panic.\nAfter doing some research, I found out that darkening can be caused by friction (I had no idea this was even a thing). Since I’ve always had the habit of lying on my stomach and resting my elbows on beds or tables, I realized that’s probably the main reason.\nI found this out about three days ago, so I immediately stopped putting pressure on my elbows (I know, rookie mistake 😅), and now I’m moisturizing them a lot to help them recover.\nAfter a few weeks, would it be okay to start some kind of treatment, or use something that could help at least a bit? I’m not expecting overnight results — I know this took years to develop, so it won’t disappear in days. But I do have a really important event in December, and I’d love to feel confident and wear whatever I want without worrying about this.\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated!",

(loreal elvive for both) towel dry a bit and then air dry which usually takes around four hours. i do not use any styling products. i also dont do anything for my hair before sleeping, ive never looked into that part much. i suspect that my drying method is the biggest cause here, but im hesitant to try out a blow drier. i have intense noise sensitivity, but fancy lower-noise blow driers are quite pricey. i am willing to try it out despite this, i just wouldnt want to make that investment without being more sure it is going to be helpful! thank you for any input!",
