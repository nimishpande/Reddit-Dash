      "title": "Is anyone else beyond fed up with hairdressers never ever listening?",
      "content": "Or does anybody have a secret tip that gets them to listen without just being a rude and scary customer? I've tried so many hairdressers in my city, price points anywhere between 20 and 120€ per cut, and none of them seem to listen to a single word I say.\n\n\"Would it be possible to cut my hair while it's dry? It really is a lot easier to get an even cut this way.\" \"That's not how it's done, cutting wet hair is always easier!\" Okay then. I stopped trying to convince them because not a single one ever listened, not even the ones who have cut my hair before and know how long it takes to fix the unevenness they create with a wet cut.\n\n\"I want a slightly longer pixie like in this photo, so my hair should cover my ears. My curls pull up a lot when drying, so since you're cutting them wet, they need to go slightly past my chin - right where I am pointing now.\" \"Got it! \\^\\_\\^\" and the very next second I feel how they cut my hair directly at earlobe level. I will clasp my wet hair between two fingers to pull it as straight as they do with the comb, and then use my other hand to point at the exact place where the scissors or the blade would need to go, but they still always manage to miss it by at least 3 cm. Do they forget? Or do they just ignore me because they think they know better? Even though simple geometry says that to connect points A and B, a curved line needs to be longer than a straight line? Telling them that I want a bob when I actually want a pixie doesn't work because while it fixes the length problem, the general shapes of these cuts are too different.\n\n\"Do you see those two spots where my hair is a lot more curly than anywhere else? These need to be left a bit longer. If everything is cut to the same length when wet, I will basically have two large missing chunks in my lengths when dry.\" \"Okay, if you say so!\" And a few minutes afterwards, when I notice that they get close to one of the spots, I repeat \"that's one of the really curly strands I pointed out earlier, so that one should be left longer.\" And they say \"yup I remember \\^\\_\\^\" and still cut it to the exact same wet-length as everything else.\n\nI already gave up on \"could you hold the hair dryer in one place when diffusing? It breaks up the strands and gives me frizz when you kind of comb my hair with the diffuser nozzles like you're doing right now\" (\"okay!\" \\*keeps combing\\*), or \"can we use a spray bottle to get the hair a bit wet again after cutting? It helps with getting the combed hair back into structured strands\" (\"no, they will tangle if they get wet after combing!\"). I just ask them if I could diffuse them myself and I carry my own spray bottle. So that's an easy communication issue to avoid. But the other stuff is a lot harder.\n\nHow do I get them to listen? Does anyone have tips? Do I just need to be, like, really really assertive? Or interrupt them at every single strand to ask \"can you show me where you're planning to cut? No, a bit lower, please\"? I hate being a Stressful Customer :( so if anybody has tips that don't involve me becoming rude and annoying as fuck, please let me know?\n\n(The sub wants my routine to let me post, I just cowash and style with the Balea Oil Repair line from a drugstore chain in my country, really happy with how that turns out, the hairdressers are the only challenge I have left in my hair journey lmao)",

I had major acne problems on forehead and face and the marks stay, also bumps on face especially forehead are quite frequent. Also pigmentation on lips( I don't smoke) . I just want to work on the uneven skin tone and texture and the bumps on skin and tanning. Also I have combination skin type and I try to drink Coconut water a lot for skin issues but doesn't seem to help a lot.\n\nProducts: i went on the internet searching and got to know about a few creames , like \n1. Glycolic acid\n2. Tretinoin\n3. Azelaic acid\n4. Salicylic acid\n5. Kojic acid\n\nQuestions:\n1. Now I wanna know which of these should I use, how and if combining them in what way ?\n\n2. I also plan to use sunscreen, I use lakme rn, not very regular with it though, please suggest any for my skin type?\n\n3. Any other remedies to get rid of tanning and bumps and acne scar please? \n\nThanks in advance !\n",

      "content": "I need routine help. Freshman year of college I stopped taking doxycycline and using tretinoin because my face was always burning and I didn’t want to become reliant. That’s how I got most of my deep ice pick scarring, I had some very deep and inflamed under the skin cysts that would get popped and stay. Admittedly I do pick my skin when I’m stressed, which in college was a lot.\n\nWhen I found Paula’s choice BHA, that was the first time in a decade that I had clear skin. I would layer it with a tiny dot of benzoyl peroxide gel 10% and do this everyday (bp face washes never were as effective). At some point though, my breakouts around my jaw came back. I’ve tried a lot of things at this point, from differin to Tret and all sorts of acids. I really wish I took Accutane during Covid, but I heard too many horror stories and now it’s too late. I can’t really afford potential physical fatigue or avoiding the sun all the time. I’d prefer not to have to take anything I rely on.\n\nI’m getting very tired. There are periods where I think my skin is clearing up (see the photos where it looks like glass) before it explodes. As of late, it has that shine that makes me think my barrier is compromised, but it also doesn’t sting as much as it used to. I tried to get a facial several months ago and the lady said my barrier was compromised, but as of late I can put a face mask on and be ok, which wasn’t the case when I used BHA + BP everyday. When I try to take skincare breaks, I get under the skin pimples all over again. As of late, I went back to differin and azelaic acid but I think differin is too weak so I got Tret again. I thought this would be over by my late 20s, when will it end? Is there a routine that I can at least get semi-consistent results or is the only answer hormonal + cutting out every enjoyable food in life? I most likely will not be switching up my whole lifestyle just for clear skin, but any advice is welcome.",

I am wondering if anyone can explain to me scientifically the discussion and recommendation of not washing the hair until 48-72 hours after a color service due to the cuticle not being “completely closed”. I know cuticles dont work like blinds that just open and close. In my experience, washing 24 hours after color shouldn’t affect the longevity because the color doesn’t continue processing &amp; the conditioner seals with an acidic pH. I’m confusedddd",

On top of that my nose was still oily constantly and always had yellow-ish gunk stuck around my piercings.\n\nLong story short: I panicked and started looking at YouTube / Reels of dermatologists and influencers, that just listed “the best” products without knowing my skin type etc etc. Now I’m stuck with constantly irritated skin, and a bunch of what I think are closed comedones and I spent 100 bucks on skin care that probably doesn’t work for me.\n\nRoutine:\n\nAM:\n\nWash with water,\n\nGeek &amp; Gorgeous C-Glow,\n\nNeutrogena Hydro Boost Serum,\n\nBeauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum,\n\nBeauty of Joseon Relief Sun Aqua Fresh,\n\nLa Roche Posay Cicaplast\n\nPM:\n\n(If heavy Make-Up) = Garnier Micellar Water,\n\nMixsoon Cleansing Oil,\n\nJean &amp; Len Hydrating Liquid Toner (don’t know if this is more of an EU product, but it says 5,2% Panthenol &amp; 5,0% Niancinamid on the bottle.)\n\nThe Ordinary Hyaloronic Acid\n\nLa Roche Posay Cicaplast\n\nThings I’ve noticed:\n\n\\- I looks very shiny/oily all the time, which I do prefer compared to the shedding skin but still… very shiny\n\n\\- my make up sits beautifully on my skin though, that’s a plus!\n\n\\- more pimples around my nose and on my chin additionally to the closed comedones on my forehead\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? 🥲",
