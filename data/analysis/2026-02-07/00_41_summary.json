      "title": "Is anyone else beyond fed up with hairdressers never ever listening?",
      "content": "Or does anybody have a secret tip that gets them to listen without just being a rude and scary customer? I've tried so many hairdressers in my city, price points anywhere between 20 and 120€ per cut, and none of them seem to listen to a single word I say.\n\n\"Would it be possible to cut my hair while it's dry? It really is a lot easier to get an even cut this way.\" \"That's not how it's done, cutting wet hair is always easier!\" Okay then. I stopped trying to convince them because not a single one ever listened, not even the ones who have cut my hair before and know how long it takes to fix the unevenness they create with a wet cut.\n\n\"I want a slightly longer pixie like in this photo, so my hair should cover my ears. My curls pull up a lot when drying, so since you're cutting them wet, they need to go slightly past my chin - right where I am pointing now.\" \"Got it! \\^\\_\\^\" and the very next second I feel how they cut my hair directly at earlobe level. I will clasp my wet hair between two fingers to pull it as straight as they do with the comb, and then use my other hand to point at the exact place where the scissors or the blade would need to go, but they still always manage to miss it by at least 3 cm. Do they forget? Or do they just ignore me because they think they know better? Even though simple geometry says that to connect points A and B, a curved line needs to be longer than a straight line? Telling them that I want a bob when I actually want a pixie doesn't work because while it fixes the length problem, the general shapes of these cuts are too different.\n\n\"Do you see those two spots where my hair is a lot more curly than anywhere else? These need to be left a bit longer. If everything is cut to the same length when wet, I will basically have two large missing chunks in my lengths when dry.\" \"Okay, if you say so!\" And a few minutes afterwards, when I notice that they get close to one of the spots, I repeat \"that's one of the really curly strands I pointed out earlier, so that one should be left longer.\" And they say \"yup I remember \\^\\_\\^\" and still cut it to the exact same wet-length as everything else.\n\nI already gave up on \"could you hold the hair dryer in one place when diffusing? It breaks up the strands and gives me frizz when you kind of comb my hair with the diffuser nozzles like you're doing right now\" (\"okay!\" \\*keeps combing\\*), or \"can we use a spray bottle to get the hair a bit wet again after cutting? It helps with getting the combed hair back into structured strands\" (\"no, they will tangle if they get wet after combing!\"). I just ask them if I could diffuse them myself and I carry my own spray bottle. So that's an easy communication issue to avoid. But the other stuff is a lot harder.\n\nHow do I get them to listen? Does anyone have tips? Do I just need to be, like, really really assertive? Or interrupt them at every single strand to ask \"can you show me where you're planning to cut? No, a bit lower, please\"? I hate being a Stressful Customer :( so if anybody has tips that don't involve me becoming rude and annoying as fuck, please let me know?\n\n(The sub wants my routine to let me post, I just cowash and style with the Balea Oil Repair line from a drugstore chain in my country, really happy with how that turns out, the hairdressers are the only challenge I have left in my hair journey lmao)",

I also wake up with a mess even though I sleep with a silk scarf + silk bonnet. The first few photos are my hair with curl creams and gel. The ones at the end are my hair 6 years ago when it was super thick and long:( I just want to know what suits my hair and why it’s gotten so much more curly all of sudden, it was never like this when I was younger. And it’s always frizzy.

      "content": "I need routine help. Freshman year of college I stopped taking doxycycline and using tretinoin because my face was always burning and I didn’t want to become reliant. That’s how I got most of my deep ice pick scarring, I had some very deep and inflamed under the skin cysts that would get popped and stay. Admittedly I do pick my skin when I’m stressed, which in college was a lot.\n\nWhen I found Paula’s choice BHA, that was the first time in a decade that I had clear skin. I would layer it with a tiny dot of benzoyl peroxide gel 10% and do this everyday (bp face washes never were as effective). At some point though, my breakouts around my jaw came back. I’ve tried a lot of things at this point, from differin to Tret and all sorts of acids. I really wish I took Accutane during Covid, but I heard too many horror stories and now it’s too late. I can’t really afford potential physical fatigue or avoiding the sun all the time. I’d prefer not to have to take anything I rely on.\n\nI’m getting very tired. There are periods where I think my skin is clearing up (see the photos where it looks like glass) before it explodes. As of late, it has that shine that makes me think my barrier is compromised, but it also doesn’t sting as much as it used to. I tried to get a facial several months ago and the lady said my barrier was compromised, but as of late I can put a face mask on and be ok, which wasn’t the case when I used BHA + BP everyday. When I try to take skincare breaks, I get under the skin pimples all over again. As of late, I went back to differin and azelaic acid but I think differin is too weak so I got Tret again. I thought this would be over by my late 20s, when will it end? Is there a routine that I can at least get semi-consistent results or is the only answer hormonal + cutting out every enjoyable food in life? I most likely will not be switching up my whole lifestyle just for clear skin, but any advice is welcome.",

My usual hairstyles are a slick back or a messy top bun.\n\nI use a wide tooth comb in the shower when I have conditioner in the shower, and then when I feel my hair getting knotted during the week, I use the same comb to get knots out even if I’m not showering.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to keep my hair healthy? I have always had a problem with losing hair, and I don’t see any visual differences, but I would like to keep my thick hair healthy! I am worried for the day that I start to notice it, so I figured I’d try to get started now. Does rosemary oil work well? Should I change my shower routine or try to put product in more frequently?",

The first days were sore but i just assumed it was because I had never waxed before, but even after leaving my hair out to grow again the itch will NOT leave. I tried shaving again last week because it was getting quite long, no luck either. \n\nI have tried moisturiser, cleanser, stoping deodorant, changing it, nothing stops the itchiness. \n\nI cannot find out why, it just comes, even after a shower. I have no rashes or redness, and I usually never have problems after shaving. \n\nHas anyone ever been through this ? ",

I already experienced a shed when starting minoxidil and I’ve heard you shed when you get off it.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with finasteride alone increasing thickness and improving hairline? I know people say it’s a drug for prevention, but I’m hoping it can help restore since I won’t be using minoxidil\n\nPlease let me know if any of you have done the same thing as me.
