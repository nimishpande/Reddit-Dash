I don’t color my hair and usually do my own trims. \n\nI have medium/fine, low porosity, Irish curls- curlier underneath than on top. I think my grays are straighter than my other curls and they loosen up faster on day two.\n\nMy holy grail of products:\n\nShampoo &amp; Conditioner: Innersense Bright Balance (to keep grays from going yellow)\n\nProducts: A Curl Can Dream cream and gel- actually holds but is soft to the touch.\n\nRoutine: wash once or maybe twice a week. Apply a very small amount of the moisture definition cream throughout sopping wet hair. Flip head upside down, apply light hold gel to each section using a half pump of gel per section (really smoosh it in) and brush with Bounce curl define brush to the back of head starting at the base of the neck and doing several sections to the crown. Then head right side up, I do the tops and sides by sections, always brushing from the underside of the section, up and away from scalp. I let air dry about 50% and then finish with diffuser blow dryer. Sleep with silk bonnet and refresh each day with a continuous fine mister spray bottle and scrunch. Sometimes I’ll use a curling wand on the top layer to refresh flattened or wayward curls. I will use a heat protectant like Kenra Platinum Blow Dry Spray when I use the curling wand, but usually don’t when I blow dry bc I don’t use super high heat with the blow dryer.",

Have been using azelaic 20% in the morning only. I want to introduce tret at night but unsure about whether its application is best on clean dry skin or sandwich method with serum before and moisturiser after.\n\nI have been doing sandwich method with azelaic acid, I do not experience much tingling and burning. But I wonder if this is the most effective way to use it also. I started on AA at 10% on clean face and would feel stinging sensation.\n\nCan sandwiching ruin the efficacy of the active and cause more irritation?",

I never had acne before that and I only started tretinoin for anti-aging purposes and uneven skin tone.\n\nI used it for around 2 months and then stopped. Since then, I've been trying everything to get my original skin back but nothings working and it's getting worse. I keep getting new acne/whiteheads every now and then and have so much PIE/acne scars now. \n\nI am also on an antibiotic course (started with Doxycycline 100mg twice daily, then tapered down to once daily). \n\nMy routine is as follows: \n\nAM: \n- Cetaphil gentle cleanser \n- Garnier bright complete vitamin C booster serum \n- Physiogel moisturizer \n- Sunscreen \n\nPM: \n- Cetaphil gentle cleanser \n- Skinoren cream (Azlelic acid 20%)\n- LRP Cicaplast Baume B5+ \n- Physiogel moisturizer \n\nI also use silicon sheets on scars and Saniderm pimple patches on active pimples. \n\nThe pictures I've posted are from today morning right after washing. My skin looks much more angry than yesterday eventhough I haven't done anything different. \n\nWould adding differin to my routine help? What about AHA/BHA? Is there anything else you guys would suggest? Please I'm very desperate. Thankyou!",

Being a competitive swimmer left my hair damaged and broken. Long story short, I buzzed it and then grew it back out. \n\nFast forward to now: the first picture is my hair after oil and a diffuser (my sister who has VERY curly hair recommend I try the diffuser) and it worked! However, the second picture is after sleeping on a satin pillowcase and having it in a large claw clip all day (I work in food service so it has to be put up). My bangs are dried with a round brush. \n\nRoutine:\n\n1) Aussie miracle shampoo and conditioner (finger combing in the shower) \n\n2) scrunching with a towel and adding Aussie leave-in conditioner (not in this photo since i’m out of it), then Palmer’s amino binding complex hair oil, and lastly i tired Aussie (can you tell i like the way their products smell? xD) mousse. And lastly argon oil heat shield. \n\n3) I used a cheap diffuser from Amazon (hey, it had good reviews!) and dried my roots a bit before the rest if my hair flipped over the top of my head, then flipped on either side, then established a part standing straight. \n\nI basically want to know how to keep the curls looking curly if it’s possible with my lifestyle. I love the way they look, but they keep falling out. \n\nAlso, it’s hard to tell in the photos, but the bottom layer of my hair wants to be straight. Any advice on how to handle that with curlier top pieces? And if anyone could tell me what type of curls I have that would be appreciated! Because I have no idea. \n\nThanks for reading this far! ❤️",

I have 2c-3a wavy/curly hellscape hair. \n\nI have a few questions, because I am looking to revamp my very lazy hair routine\n\nwhat products do you guys recommend if I am absolutely allergic to the feeling of crunchy/sticky product in my hair? I get so uncomfortable and feel super dirty when I can feel that theres product in my hair. What are some good lightweight products?\n\nSecond, what are some volume boosting products/methods that similarly dont leave a lot of product at the scalp/feel sticky and gross? \n\nMy hair tends to be super flat at the top. I have tried going without a part, but it absolutely doesnt work for me at all. I currently try and switch up the part every other wash but it doesnt do much.\n\nFinally, what are some good refresh products/routines, if any? I struggle to make my hair stretch more than 2 days without a wash. I think I have to come to terms with ‘refreshing’ not being feasible for my hair type, but im willing to try. My curls gets very tangled very easily, it turns into a frizzy mat overnight. I have tried every bonnet/silk pillowcase method imaginable, its a no-go for me. \n\nLet me know! Thank you.\n\nCurrent Routine:\n\n1. Garnier spray leave in conditioner on soaking wet hair, brushed through wet\n\n2. Not your mothers activating mousse, praying-hands application and scrunched in.\n\nAnd I scrunch the excess water out with an old Tshirt. Then I let it air dry.",

These baby hairs are really short yet full and I think if I actually got them to grow out it could fix my hairline some and also lessen my forehead to around 4 fingers. Even if it's just a bit I would pefer it way more. So does anyone think that by using some hair growth care I could get this to grow out? I also have trichotillomania so honestly some hair growth products would be a great investment right now if it would help this much. Lmk! :)",
