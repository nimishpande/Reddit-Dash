I have had pretty dehydrated skin for years but always had a decent amount of oil production to compensate. Since hitting near 30 and moving to California, my skin just can’t catch up with moisture. Unfortunately I can’t use most creams because they break me out so I try to use gel moisturizers and top up with a teeny bit of well tolerated cream but they don’t seem to do very much. Because of the dehydration I also have tight pores and struggle with skin build up.\n\nSo what are your holy grail products for moisture without being overly heavy and that don’t break you out?!!!\n\n(Pic is me right after a facial and I was shocked at the difference in moisture levels and my facialist commented several times that my skin was really dehydrated)",

I’m trying to embrace my curls, but I’m really struggling with volume, fullness, and consistency. Some wash days look great, other days my hair looks flat or stringy. I also wake up with a mess even though I sleep with a silk scarf + silk bonnet. The first few photos are my hair with curl creams and gel. The ones at the end are my hair 6 years ago when it was super thick and long:( I just want to know what suits my hair and why it’s gotten so much more curly all of sudden, it was never like this when I was younger. And it’s always frizzy. I want big voluminous curls with volume.\n\nI think I might have low porosity hair (water sits on top, slow absorption), and I’m wondering if I’m using products that are too heavy or if my haircut is part of the issue.\n\nROUTINE\n\nShampoo\n\n\t•\tUmberto Giannini – Moisture drench Curl Shampoo\n\nMask / Treatment\n\n\t•\tFenty Hair Mask (used every shower because my hair is so dry, sometimes I use AMIKA soulfood hair mask instead.\n\nCURRENT styling products (used every wash day)\n\nApplied on very wet hair:\n\t•\tInnersense Quiet Calm Curl Control\n\t•\tInnersense Inner Peace Whipped Creme Texturizer\n\t•\tInnersense I Create Hold Gel\n\nOther products I own but am NOT currently using\n\n(I’ve tested these in the past)\n\t•\tMiss Jessie’s Curl Cream\n\t•\tFenty Curl Cream\n\t•\tPattern Curl Cream\n\t•\tOuidad Curl Cream\n\t•\tNot Your Mother’s Curl Cream\n- the doux pop lock curl forming glaze but not really sure if this is a gel, or curl cream?\nCake beauty as well and I’ve also tried mousse and gel but it makes my hair stringy.

If you have an OCD due to hair loss induced BDD, you probably are already taking hair loss medications. The truth is, many people are in denial and are unaware of their own internal issues. So, they blame fin, dut, and even min for their problems.\n\nFinasteride Use Does Not Lead to Depre$$ion or su!c!d@l: Insights From a Large-Scale Cohort Study and Mendelian Randomization Analysis\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.70579\n\nAssociation of 5α-Reductase Inhibitors with Depre$$ion and su!c!de: A Mini Systematic Review and Meta-analysis\n\nhttp://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405456924000622\n\nThese two studies conclusively demonstrate that finasteride and dutasteride are not correlated with higher su!c!d@l risk factors so we have to ask if those with PF S are dealing with an extreme BDD? I think the signal in the literature suggests this as there’s more proof against P FS and favoring other issues like BDD/OCD.",

I think I’ve got 2b waves, medium density, medium texture, low porosity.

I’ve been prone to it in the past but pre CG era I would’ve just grabbed some head and shoulders and I’m not sure that’s the right move. \n\nCurrent routine (products pictured):\n\n\\- Wash every 3-4 days with curl shampoo\n\n\\- Condition with the L’Oréal, rinse pretty thoroughly \n\n\\- Apply quarter size curl cream in shower while soaking wet, comb through\n\n\\- Apply quarter size gel out of shower, comb through then prayer hands and scrunch \n\n\\- Short plop with t shirt to remove some water\n\n\\- Low heat dry with bonnet attachment to hair dryer\n\n\\- Break cast once fully dry\n\n\\- Sleep with bonnet\n\n\\- Water refresh days 2-3 as needed\n\nI’m open to any product suggestions! I’m low on a few of these so can mix it up. I get easily overwhelmed by the master lists and researching this so this set has been haphazardly assembled. ",

Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

I already experienced a shed when starting minoxidil and I’ve heard you shed when you get off it.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with finasteride alone increasing thickness and improving hairline? I know people say it’s a drug for prevention, but I’m hoping it can help restore since I won’t be using minoxidil\n\nPlease let me know if any of you have done the same thing as me.

Every time I try to scrunch my hair upside down, when I put my head back upright, it looks really bad and gets tangled at the roots. So I need to run my finger through to put it back, and obviously your waves don't look good when you mess with them. \n \nBecause right now I need to wash my hair in cold water so I do it upside-down, but if I don't brush it with my head right, it looks messy. \n\nIs it because I have wavy hair ? Does it work better for curls maybe ? Or am I doing something wrong, or is there something I’m not understanding about this step ?\n\n\n\nMy routine is :\nShampoo with Timotei for oily hair but sometimes I use an old Function of beauty shampoo,\nI use Timotei conditioner, sometime Cantu avocado conditionner, sometime Shea moisture Strengthen and Restore.\nThen I use Timotei spray to untangle my hair and scrunch it with Eco olive oil gel.

      "content": "Hi! So, this might not be the Reddit for it but I wanna shoot my shot. *I need help understanding freeform hair and if my character‘s hair looks right!* **(skip to bold header to skip context)**\n\n  \nI am an artist who makes Original Characters for a story I am making, and I am trying to design this new character. But, I am struggling with their hair and I wanted to get advice from people who have experience with Freeform hair! \n\n  \n(images below) Basic info about this character, their name is Chance (they/them), and they (alongside some other characters) are an angel. They, along with their twin brother Chase, are twins, but they are quite different from each other. Chase is very rigid, formal, and knight-like, while Chance is a jokester. They never take anything seriously and they are quite eccentric. They tend to be a troublemaker and always gets on others nerves. They tend to be very superficial, but they have a great ability to always see things in new perspectives. Real teenage dirtbag energy.\n\n**What is their hair like?**  \nThe theme of Chances design is what I dub “consumerist clown core”. They are meant to look like a jester, but their outfit is made entirely of parts that look like fast fashion pieces. I wanted their hair to look like a three point Jesters hat in silhouette, with most of the hair directed into one of three parts, one being over their face. I also wanted little Bells attached to the ends of their locs (my characters are designed as if they would be in older teen, urban fantasy, animated show, so their designs are a bit more ‘out there’). When I colour them, I want to make the underside of their hair dyed orange. I referenced a bunch of free form hairstyles, but especially @ mayowasworld on instagram. However I am have a lot of trouble finding drawn references/non-AI images.\n\n\n\nI included a few sketches of my attempts to draw what I imagine their hair to look like. Although I like the look, I get the sense that it looks too ‘loose’, like it doesn’t look like the right texture. I included a photo of their twin brother Chase as the last photo as well in case that helps anyone. (please excuse any drawing inconsistencies or mistakes, I drew some of these either early in the design process or while extremely tired.)\n\n  \nPlease let me know what you think and where I can improve. My hair is pin-straight, so I have no idea about pretty much any hair texture other than my own. It’s really important to me that I get this right because every character is precious to me and I love all types of hair. Thank you all very much for reading and helping me out!",

This picture is day 2 curls when they started to look frizzy after 2 hours outdoors… it was looking defined before leaving the house…\n\nHow my current (and most successful so far) wash day routine looks like:\n\n1. Leave in (Shea moisture intensive hydration leave in); every two weeks or so I leave it on for 1-2 hours\n\n2. Shampoo (Shea moisture)\n\n3. Out of the shower\n\n4. Leave in again + Olaplex bonding oil (n. 7)\n\n5. Part hair, keep very wet, apply Umberto Giannini curl jelly and use curl styling brush.\n\n6. Diffuse fully (hover method)\n\n7. Once dry, gently crunch to avoid frizz \n\nTo sleep, I use a banana clip and silk bonnet and to refresh, I just apply a bit of cream or oil if needed to be (no water). I do apply rosemary oil on my scalp almost daily.\n\nLiving in a very humid (75-89% on avg.) and rainy country, the moment I got outside… my hair slowly but surely turns in what you see in the picture in a few hours. I see other curlies with defined and voluminous curls but I can’t tell how they do it!! What is your advice? Thanks in advance! 💛💛",

As you can see in the photos, they're really short because most are already broken.\n\nUsually, they split at the side and then snag on things, so I cut the snagging bits off but I dont often have acsess to scissors so they end up ripping off.\n\nI used to be a really bad nail biter, but I don't bite my nails anymore. I admit, I do have an issue with biting *around* my nails, but I don't bite the actual nail.\n\n  \nNot sure if this is relevant, but I am (probably) anemic and I also do have reynaurds (which is why my hands are a weird colour in the photos lol!)\n\n  \nI have tried hand creams and polish with strengthening and cuticle stuff in them but it hasn't seemed to work. I used to wear normal polish, but it didn't help. I clean my hands the regular amount and they aren't dry.\n\n  \nPlease let me know if you have any advice or need more advice!

After 4 months, the results were clear:  \n\n\nDensity: The combo group saw a +27.5 hairs/cm² increase (vs. +24 for Minoxidil alone).  \n\n\nDiameter: Significant hair thickening (+4.8 μm) was seen in the combo group, while the Minoxidil-only group saw no significant change.  \n\n\nSatisfaction: 95.9% of combo users were satisfied, compared to only 27.5% of those using just Minoxidil.  \nWhy it works: Minoxidil signals blood flow, while peptides like Procapil and Redensyl target follicle stem cells and \"anchor\" the hair into the scalp to stop shedding.",
