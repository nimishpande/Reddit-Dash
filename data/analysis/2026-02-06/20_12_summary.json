      "content": "My hair has turned salt and pepper! (48F) I have naturally dark brown hair. I get stopped on the street by strangers asking if I got my color done at the salon. I don’t color my hair and usually do my own trims. \n\nI have medium/fine, low porosity, Irish curls- curlier underneath than on top. I think my grays are straighter than my other curls and they loosen up faster on day two.\n\nMy holy grail of products:\n\nShampoo &amp; Conditioner: Innersense Bright Balance (to keep grays from going yellow)\n\nProducts: A Curl Can Dream cream and gel- actually holds but is soft to the touch.\n\nRoutine: wash once or maybe twice a week. Apply a very small amount of the moisture definition cream throughout sopping wet hair. Flip head upside down, apply light hold gel to each section using a half pump of gel per section (really smoosh it in) and brush with Bounce curl define brush to the back of head starting at the base of the neck and doing several sections to the crown. Then head right side up, I do the tops and sides by sections, always brushing from the underside of the section, up and away from scalp. I let air dry about 50% and then finish with diffuser blow dryer. Sleep with silk bonnet and refresh each day with a continuous fine mister spray bottle and scrunch. Sometimes I’ll use a curling wand on the top layer to refresh flattened or wayward curls. I will use a heat protectant like Kenra Platinum Blow Dry Spray when I use the curling wand, but usually don’t when I blow dry bc I don’t use super high heat with the blow dryer.",

I’m trying to embrace my curls, but I’m really struggling with volume, fullness, and consistency. Some wash days look great, other days my hair looks flat or stringy. I also wake up with a mess even though I sleep with a silk scarf + silk bonnet. The first few photos are my hair with curl creams and gel. The ones at the end are my hair 6 years ago when it was super thick and long:( I just want to know what suits my hair and why it’s gotten so much more curly all of sudden, it was never like this when I was younger. And it’s always frizzy. I want big voluminous curls with volume.\n\nI think I might have low porosity hair (water sits on top, slow absorption), and I’m wondering if I’m using products that are too heavy or if my haircut is part of the issue.\n\nROUTINE\n\nShampoo\n\n\t•\tUmberto Giannini – Moisture drench Curl Shampoo\n\nMask / Treatment\n\n\t•\tFenty Hair Mask (used every shower because my hair is so dry, sometimes I use AMIKA soulfood hair mask instead.\n\nCURRENT styling products (used every wash day)\n\nApplied on very wet hair:\n\t•\tInnersense Quiet Calm Curl Control\n\t•\tInnersense Inner Peace Whipped Creme Texturizer\n\t•\tInnersense I Create Hold Gel\n\nOther products I own but am NOT currently using\n\n(I’ve tested these in the past)\n\t•\tMiss Jessie’s Curl Cream\n\t•\tFenty Curl Cream\n\t•\tPattern Curl Cream\n\t•\tOuidad Curl Cream\n\t•\tNot Your Mother’s Curl Cream\n- the doux pop lock curl forming glaze but not really sure if this is a gel, or curl cream?\nCake beauty as well and I’ve also tried mousse and gel but it makes my hair stringy. The first photo was my hair today. And the fourth pic and after was my hair around 3 months ago\n\nApplication / Technique\n\n\t•\tI come out of the shower and re-wet my hair until it’s dripping\n\t•\tRake products through hair and then section my crown off my volume \n\t•\tBrush style each section with the Bounce Curl Volume Brush \n\t•\tFlip upside down\n\t•\tApply gel using praying hands, then scrunch\n\t•\tScrunch out excess water with a microfiber towel\n\nDrying\n\n\t•\tAir dry for ~20 minutes\n\t•\tThen diffuse\n\t•\tI usually don’t diffuse upside down because I dislike shrinkage and feel like it makes my hair look weird. I want my hair to look long.\n\nI just want fuller hair with nice big curls and much more volume but whenever I diffuse upside down my hair gets so frizzy. I also want to know how to maintain it better. Right now it takes me like 2-3 hours to do my hair and it’s just too long.\n\nI appreciate any help ❤️",

I have had pretty dehydrated skin for years but always had a decent amount of oil production to compensate. Since hitting near 30 and moving to California, my skin just can’t catch up with moisture. Unfortunately I can’t use most creams because they break me out so I try to use gel moisturizers and top up with a teeny bit of well tolerated cream but they don’t seem to do very much. Because of the dehydration I also have tight pores and struggle with skin build up.\n\nSo what are your holy grail products for moisture without being overly heavy and that don’t break you out?!!!\n\n(Pic is me right after a facial and I was shocked at the difference in moisture levels and my facialist commented several times that my skin was really dehydrated)",

If you have an OCD due to hair loss induced BDD, you probably are already taking hair loss medications. The truth is, many people are in denial and are unaware of their own internal issues. So, they blame fin, dut, and even min for their problems.\n\nFinasteride Use Does Not Lead to Depre$$ion or su!c!d@l: Insights From a Large-Scale Cohort Study and Mendelian Randomization Analysis\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.70579\n\nAssociation of 5α-Reductase Inhibitors with Depre$$ion and su!c!de: A Mini Systematic Review and Meta-analysis\n\nhttp://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405456924000622\n\nThese two studies conclusively demonstrate that finasteride and dutasteride are not correlated with higher su!c!d@l risk factors so we have to ask if those with PF S are dealing with an extreme BDD? I think the signal in the literature suggests this as there’s more proof against P FS and favoring other issues like BDD/OCD.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

I already experienced a shed when starting minoxidil and I’ve heard you shed when you get off it.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with finasteride alone increasing thickness and improving hairline? I know people say it’s a drug for prevention, but I’m hoping it can help restore since I won’t be using minoxidil\n\nPlease let me know if any of you have done the same thing as me.

Every time I try to scrunch my hair upside down, when I put my head back upright, it looks really bad and gets tangled at the roots. So I need to run my finger through to put it back, and obviously your waves don't look good when you mess with them. \n \nBecause right now I need to wash my hair in cold water so I do it upside-down, but if I don't brush it with my head right, it looks messy. \n\nIs it because I have wavy hair ? Does it work better for curls maybe ? Or am I doing something wrong, or is there something I’m not understanding about this step ?\n\n\n\nMy routine is :\nShampoo with Timotei for oily hair but sometimes I use an old Function of beauty shampoo,\nI use Timotei conditioner, sometime Cantu avocado conditionner, sometime Shea moisture Strengthen and Restore.\nThen I use Timotei spray to untangle my hair and scrunch it with Eco olive oil gel. Then I microplop during the time I put body cream and that's it, I let it air dry. I don't protect it while sleeping, and I'm usually too lazy to do refresh even if it looks good.",

Lately my skin on my forehead has been super dry and flakey and when i apply my makeup is sticks to my patches and my cheeks are on the dyer side too. Also with this routine my makeup comes off as i am blending. I thought to change my routine and purchased good molecules niacinamide and Vani cream facial moisturizer and keep using same cleanser and toner, however my face still feels dry and not moisturized. Any recommendations? Anything to add, keep, remove? PLEASE HELP",

I apply it to clean, dry skin and wait around 10 minutes before applying my moisturiser. I do experience itchiness after application, but it’s now reaching a point where it feels extremely itchy and uncomfortable.\n\nFor context, my skin has been quite reactive and problematic over the past four months, and this is currently the only active treatment I’m using.\n\nMy current skincare routine is:\n\n\\- Round Lab cleanser  \n\n\\- Tir Tir milky toner (I’m planning to stop this as I don’t think my skin tolerates it well)  \n\n\\- Gel moisturiser  \n\n\\- Sunscreen during the day only  \n\nI wanted to ask whether I should continue pushing through with this treatment or stop using it due to the irritation. I’d also really appreciate recommendations for alternative options to mainly target dark marks and hyperpigmentation, as my skin seems quite sensitive.\n\nThank you!!!",

I was in a pretty bad place the last few years due to alcoholism and am now 8 months sober and really trying to take care of myself and treat my body with the kindness it deserves!

I’ve definitely improved though.\n\nMy current routine is:\n\nAM\n\n\\- cetaphil face wash for dry sensitive skin\n\n\\- the ordinary hyaluronic acid\n\n\\- azaelic acid on red spots\n\n\\- vitamin c\n\n\\- vanicream sensitive skin\n\n\\- la Roche posh tinted SPF\n\nPM\n\n\\- cetaphil face wash for dry sensitive skin\n\n\\- hyaluronic acid the ordinary\n\n\\- tretinoin (3x a week)\n\n\\- vanicream sensitive skin\n\n\\- Squalene the ordinary\n\nI’m wondering if there’s anything I could do to make some of the scarring/red marks on my cheeks go away?
