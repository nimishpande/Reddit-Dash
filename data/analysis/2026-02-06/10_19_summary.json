My hair is naturally super super thin but frizzy, I have the same hair as my mom but she gets it straightened with keratin. \n\nSo for funsies I decided not to brush my hair after the shower and used a conditioner ( shea moisture)  and did the bowl method, followed by texturizing spray (bed head) and curl mouse (pattern) . I also “ plopped” my hair for a bit and then diffused it and it turned out like this ( will attach pics). My curly haired friend said that I don’t actually have wavy hair, that anyone with straight hair can use a few curling products and end up with the same hair. Do I actually have wavy hair? Or am I just gaslighting myself? If I do have wavy hair I can imagine i’ve damaged it quite a lot over the years by not taking care of it properly. Please help! \n\nRoutine: \n\n1.

I have 2c-3a wavy/curly hellscape hair. \n\nI have a few questions, because I am looking to revamp my very lazy hair routine\n\nwhat products do you guys recommend if I am absolutely allergic to the feeling of crunchy/sticky product in my hair? I get so uncomfortable and feel super dirty when I can feel that theres product in my hair. What are some good lightweight products?\n\nSecond, what are some volume boosting products/methods that similarly dont leave a lot of product at the scalp/feel sticky and gross? \n\nMy hair tends to be super flat at the top. I have tried going without a part, but it absolutely doesnt work for me at all. I currently try and switch up the part every other wash but it doesnt do much.\n\nFinally, what are some good refresh products/routines, if any? I struggle to make my hair stretch more than 2 days without a wash. I think I have to come to terms with ‘refreshing’ not being feasible for my hair type, but im willing to try. My curls gets very tangled very easily, it turns into a frizzy mat overnight. I have tried every bonnet/silk pillowcase method imaginable, its a no-go for me. \n\nLet me know! Thank you.\n\nCurrent Routine:\n\n1. Garnier spray leave in conditioner on soaking wet hair, brushed through wet\n\n2. Not your mothers activating mousse, praying-hands application and scrunched in.\n\nAnd I scrunch the excess water out with an old Tshirt. Then I let it air dry.",

Being a competitive swimmer left my hair damaged and broken. Long story short, I buzzed it and then grew it back out. \n\nFast forward to now: the first picture is my hair after oil and a diffuser (my sister who has VERY curly hair recommend I try the diffuser) and it worked! However, the second picture is after sleeping on a satin pillowcase and having it in a large claw clip all day (I work in food service so it has to be put up). My bangs are dried with a round brush. \n\nRoutine:\n\n1) Aussie miracle shampoo and conditioner (finger combing in the shower) \n\n2) scrunching with a towel and adding Aussie leave-in conditioner (not in this photo since i’m out of it), then Palmer’s amino binding complex hair oil, and lastly i tired Aussie (can you tell i like the way their products smell? xD) mousse. And lastly argon oil heat shield. \n\n3) I used a cheap diffuser from Amazon (hey, it had good reviews!) and dried my roots a bit before the rest if my hair flipped over the top of my head, then flipped on either side, then established a part standing straight. \n\nI basically want to know how to keep the curls looking curly if it’s possible with my lifestyle. I love the way they look, but they keep falling out. \n\nAlso, it’s hard to tell in the photos, but the bottom layer of my hair wants to be straight. Any advice on how to handle that with curlier top pieces? And if anyone could tell me what type of curls I have that would be appreciated! Because I have no idea. \n\nThanks for reading this far! ❤️",
