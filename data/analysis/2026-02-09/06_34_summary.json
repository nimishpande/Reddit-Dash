Recently switched to L’Oréal Ever Pure bond repair shampoo and conditioner. \n\n2. For styling I spray Aussie leave in conditioner then using detangling brush, next spray Not Your Mother’s- All eyes on me hair perfector and brush through. Next apply Kaleidoscope curl cream sorta using like praying hands to apply. Lastly use the bounce curl define brush and spray with Not Your Mother’s spray gel. (Used to use Miss Jessie’s gel and various ones through the years.) \n\n3. I just style and let it air dry because I’m usually rushing out the door.\n\n4. When I sleep I’m sure my hair goes through it so the next day for a refresh I just apply water and go. \n\nHowever in that first pic I did twist once and clip my hair up to try to keep the waves from yesterday and not have it fall near straight. It seemed to help. \n\nThe next few pics are to share what it looked like last night then 3 and 4 are initial bleach and dye. Last is from 2024, (didn’t take pics much last year), been on and off bleaching and coloring my bangs mostly. Those are my natural waves or sorta curls after years trying to figure out how to even do my hair. \n\nNow it feels like I’m starting over with repairing and minimizing breakage.\n\nIf you happen to have advice I’ll take it or different products to use. I think I may be using too many products after wash but not sure.\n\nThank you! ",

I started differin on 12/25/25 to get rid of some closed comedones on my chin. My acne has NEVER been as bad as it was during the purge. I had a few cystic pimples here and there but it was literally the worst it has ever been, a whole village on my chin. I have wanted to quit multiple times but trying to stay strong.   \n\nDespite the cystic acne clearing this week and looking better, the closed comedones are still here. I’m fearing it’s my beloved La Roche moisturizer with 30 spf. I don’t know what else to do. Am I still purging? Is something in my routine creating more comedones? Should I quit differin? I’ll put my very simple routine below.   \n\nAM  \n\n\\- Cleanse with CeraVe hydrating cleanser  \n\n\\- The ordinary azelaic acid (recent addition, like two uses)   - Vanicream daily moisturizer (on my eyes because they’re sensitive)  \n\n\\- La Roche moisturizer w 30 spf   \n\nPM   \n\n\\- Remove makeup on eyes with ponds, avoiding chin  \n\n\\- Micellar water for the rest of the face   \n\n\\- Cleanse with CeraVe gentle foaming   \n\nSandwich method for differin  \n\n\\- Cetaphil deep hydration moisturizer   \n\n\\- Differin (haven’t worked up to every night yet. Listening to my barrier. But almost to every night)   \n\n\\- Cetaphil again and vanicream after if I’m feeling really dry   \n\nMy skin is super dry, has never been oily, and not really acne prone. These closed comedones are recent (6-9 months) and I truly fear it’s the sunscreen. Any advice is greatly appreciated!! ",

      "content": "Hi all! Just posting a victory really. Yes I still bleach and dye my hair. As much as I love my curls, I love changing colours more. I’ve learnt how to do this without (completely) ruining my hair and I’m proud of myself for it. \n\nWhile my routine works, I would love some advice as I do wash my hair 3-4x a week, and I’d like to cut back on my wash days. I just feel my hair gets too greasy if I don’t. \n\nI usually wash twice a week with a clarifying shampoo, then a colour and/or curl protect shampoo. Any other wash day I just use my curl protect shampoo. Sometimes that’s Aussie, sometimes it’s the Loreal Elvive “Extraordinary oil”. The latter smells amazing!\n\nAfter washing these out, I use L’Oréal Elvive dream lengths or the extraordinary oil conditioner, sometimes I use both. I’ve never had my hair feel so nourished apart from this shampoo! I might also use a Garnier Hair Food mask if I’m gonna be in the shower for a long time. The cocoa butter “curl-restoring” is my fave.\n\nTo dry, I leave my hair soaking wet, section so that there’s a triangle at the front, and clip that up. I use one of those pronged curl brushes to brush through Umberto Giannini’s curl activating mousse, then massage that in, then use a tshirt to scrunch my hair. Once I’m happy with how my hair looks scrunched, I use Umberto Giannini’s Curl Jelly/scrunching jelly (pretty sure it’s the same thing as the normal one but I use the vanilla gelato scented one), then I diffuse my hair on high until bone dry. \n\nRepeat with the triangle section of the bangs.\n\nIf I want to save my curls for the next day, I sleep with my hair casted. I use Aussie’s “Work that Curl Oil” to break my cast. \n\nIt’s taken forever to find a method that works for my waves that I’m happy with! I’m still learning too, eg like cutting down my wash days, how to protect my wavy hair while sleeping (pineapple method is NOT working), and how to keep my curls fresh the next day. After I break my curl cast and sleep sometimes they lose 50% of their volume so I’m still learning how to fix that. However, I’m happy with my progress! ",

      "content": "We all know that hair loss leads to psychological and emotional distress. I've experienced it myself; started at 18 years old, and now I'm in my early 20s with a solid norwood 2-3. I've tried countless drugs to address the DHT angle (topical fin, dut, kx826/pyri, fluridil, RU), yet I've experienced either dry eyes or chest pains. I'm not giving up with the topical fin, still experimenting with lower doses.\n\nBut that's not the point of this post. The point is that you **shouldn't** let balding ruin or lower your quality of life. Be as optimistic as you could be. I do this by coping through several strategies.\n\n\\#1: Self improvement. I know you guys of tired of hearing the usual advice of get muscular or dress better, but I want to be the best version of myself I can be, so when a decent treatment comes out, getting my hair back will be the last piece of the puzzle, so to speak. \n\n\\#2: Make yourself busy. We are all at different stages of life, whether it be high school, college, or employment. When you're outside of school or work, indulge in your hobbies, spend quality time with your friends and/or your significant other. \n\n\\#3: Potential treatments coming soon. I know it's a common trope that the cure is always 5 years away, or that baldness has been cured in mice a million times. But we have Veradermics' VDPHL01, an extended release minoxidil; Cosmo pharmaceutical's Clascoterone, a topical androgen receptor inhibitor (potential alternative to 5-ARI's for those who can't tolerate them); and last but not least, PP405, with a novel mechanism of action. None of these are guaranteed to get FDA approval, but this is the most exciting time for AGA patients since the release of propecia 20 years ago.\n\n",

My current bottle is Aussie Miracle Curls. \n\nWhen I get out of the shower, I just flip my head and run my fingers through it, scrunch a bit, and let it dry. I don't use brushes (it just doesn't need them), blow dryers, or any leave in products. I used to henna my hair, but it's been natural for 5+ years now, so probably mostly virgin hair. It does grow very slow, though.\n\nI have a silk pillow case, but don't do anything special at night. I don't really style it, either. Sometimes I mist it with my plant sprayer (just water) to reactivate the curls, but that's about it. \n\nMy hair is ultra, ultra fine and gets weighed down very easily. The problem I've been having is if I use clarifying shampoo, it gets frizzy and tends to lose the curl, but is nice and fluffy. If I use more moisturizing products, it gets weighed down and greasy within 24 hours. I can't seem to find a happy middle ground that keeps both the moisture and volume. ",

      "title": "[Routine Help] Winlevi + Adapalene or go slow?",
      "content": "Hoping for some neutral, sanity-checking advice as I (33f) prepare to start the next phase of my skincare recovery journey.\n\nTLDR: My skin is a mess and after finally seeing a dermatologist, I’m questioning whether I should listen to her advice and use winlevi or just start with the adapalene 0.1 + benzoyl peroxide and go from there.\n\nHISTORY: \nLike many other posters, I had beautiful, nearly flawless skin that I took for granted all through my 20s. I have combination skin, with dryer, somewhat KP prone cheeks (which match the rest of my body). No history of oily skin elsewhere or body acne. I historically never had breakouts on my cheeks, only in the t-zone areas, and breakouts were predominately clusters of easy to extract blackheads or the occasional angry red pimple that would eventually come to a head and heal itself as long as I didn’t pick at it. Every few months I’d find a 1-2 flesh colored bumps on my cheeks or chin that would easily extract with a hard keratin plug or soft cheesy keratin coming out with light pressure after a shower or rinse off mask. I did find that my skin was sensitive and needed the right products – no generic body lotions or hotel lotions or even cerave for me, because I would break out, but as long as I had the right kind of cleanser that cleaned deeply without stripping, a good basic moisturizer (Sephora brand used to make some that worked well but they’ve been discontinued) and a gentle exfoliating toner (Ren Ready Steady Glow was HG, also now discontinued), my skin was great. \n\nI semi-regularly slept in my makeup (yuck), did not use SPF, and experimented with all kinds of products from Sephora, just using my own intuition, and my skin was very resilient.\n\nAround two years ago my skin started to deteriorate likely due to insufficient nutrition and stress, and about one year ago I had my mirena IUD replaced, and shortly after all hell broke loose and I have been experiencing persistent pustular and comedonal acne all over my face ever since.\n\nI’ve spent the last year scraping this sub and every other source of information and trying so many product combinations, supplements, plus lengthy barrier repair phases, but I am trapped in a perpetual cycle of dehydration, over-exfoliation, and congestion/oil over-production.\n\nTHE CYCLE: \n\nSTEP 1: Dryness\n\nI go easy on the hydrating products and get my skin to kind of dry out, the acne will subside and start healing. But, my skin isn’t exactly happy and healthy and it’s clear that it needs more moisture to continue healing and not get flaky and papery.\n\nSTEP 2: Congestion\n\nI’ve tried what feels like every moisturizer under the sun, serums, essences etc. from the ordinary to drugstore to SkinCeuticals to SK-II. While there are some that seem to do a better job than others, as soon as I start actually letting my skin settle into hydration or complete an eight week barrier repair with super gentle products, my skin is *nasty*. So congested, angry sebaceous filaments and keratin plugs everywhere, visibly oily, giant pores, and those once-occasional cheesy bumps on my cheeks are all over, all the time. \n\nSTEP 3: EXFOLIATION &amp; SENSITIVITY\n\nAfter noticing that nothing seemed to move the needle between steps, one and two, I accepted that exfoliation wasn’t optional for me. I’ve used the Cetaphil gentle scrub with some success, pixi glow tonic (which I accept is not a ‘good’ product, but settled on it as a less offensive, gentler AHA toner then most I had tried), panoxyl 2% salicylic acid, and very occasional use of the dennis gross alpha beta pads. I do not exfoliate daily, and mix in only one exfoliating step every few days. \n\nI have experimented with many different exfoliating routines and products and have found that this one works the ‘best’, but every few weeks inevitably still end up with sensitivity, perioral dermatitis around the nostrils and smile lines, and rebound acne from stressing out my barrier.\n\nTHE QUESTION\n\nI finally saw a dermatologist this week and she did did take a reasonably thorough history, but she seemed to generalize everything on my face as “acne” and \n“irritation” and didn’t seem troubled by the perioral dermatitis even when I drew her attention to it. Obviously, I’m not a doctor, so maybe I’m wrong, but that felt off to me. She said she felt confident that hormone imbalance was likely the culprit preventing my skin from finding equilibrium again after all of the stress and nutrition issues wrecked my barrier. \n\nShe prescribed me a combo gel of Adapalene 0.1% + benzoyl peroxide to use at night, and Winlevi cream to use morning and night. I was instructed to use gentle cleansers and otherwise stop everything else.\n\nShe had offered spironolactone, but I’m reluctant to take it because I’m on other medications, and similarly, I stopped taking birth control pills as a teenager because they made me feel ill.\n\nI just put Winlevi into Google to try to figure out how much it was going to cost, and was bombarded with lackluster and negative reviews about how it ruined peoples skin. The derm did not mention any of this to me, she only said that it was potentially less effective than oral medications, but it seems crazy to me that she wouldn’t mention that it could potentially make my skin way worse and also has a number of side effects.\n\nSo my question to you all is- what would you do if you were me?\n\nMy gut is telling me that I shouldn’t start both of these prescriptions at the same time, and if I haven’t had angry cystic acne up to this point, that it’s an unwise gamble to start winlevi after one quick consultation with a new doctor and zero testing of any other medical-grade treatments. Am I being foolish to second-guess her? She was highly rated and had good bedside manner, but I don’t know if I can handle the mental health aspect of developing even worse acne right now. \n\nAny other routine help, advice, support, wisdom etc welcome.",

I recently got a facial and the esthetician also said she didn’t see any issues.\n\nI just turned 30, and a lot of my friends are really into skincare now (Botox, tretinoin, retinol, etc.) and always taking about it, while I only use a basic routine: cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF. For context, I’m very melanin-rich.\n\nI think I’m feeling a little FOMO, but at the same time my skin is doing great, so I’m not sure if I should add anything just because everyone else is.\n\nCurious what you all think; should I keep it simple, or is there something worth incorporating preventatively?
