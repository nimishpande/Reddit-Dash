      "content": "Last few pics are from 2024. It was the exact day I thought, “Hm. Perhaps my hair isn’t straight.” 😂 And then I dived into the curly girl rabbit hole head first.\n\nMy hair was fighting for its life so the first thing I started doing was olaplex no.3 and curlsmith bond repair masks once a week. I alternated between the two.\n\nMy hair was also really thirsty from a lifetime of neglect so I did masks before I washed. This was usually a curlsmith mask. I’m obsessed with the double cream deep quencher. Smells incredible too. Now my hair is really soft so I do this once a month only. (Same with repair masks) I used to use curl cream too until recently. Not sure if I’m stopping completely yet - I’m going by hair feel on wash day.\n\nI tried lots of different routines for a while but one thing that was standard was always styling dripping WET and using a shit load of gel. Like a lot.\n\nCurrent 1x a week wash routine:\n\n•Tootilab shampoo and condish (detangle and brush here) - Clarifying shampoo around every 3 washes or so.\n\n•Tootilab gel. I probably use around a handful. Like a golf ball. I separate top and bottom half of my hair and comb gel through. I don’t usually brush style, I just make sure my hair is wet and smooth/seaweedy before a shake and scrunch. I go upside down, side to side, squish squish squish. You know how it goes. My fingers are pruned in winter.\n\n•Diffuse upside down!\n\n•When it’s around 70% dry - surprise! I add a tad more gel. Smooth it over and scrunch a bit more. Esp on the bottom layers which are a looser curl pattern.\n\n•I use a drop or 2 of olaplex oil for the crunch. Smooth over then shake shake shake.\n\n•I alternate sleeping with a … Bambon? I think it’s called. It’s like a cotton tube. And then I also have silk scarfs that I tie on. That usually works better.\n\n•Refresh is usually just wetting my hands and smoothing and scrunching again. Just to get that slight cast again. On the 3rd/4th day I use mousse and wet a lot more. On 5th/6th it’s cap or bun days with bangs styled.\n\nAny questions, shoot! It’s been a fun learning curve (:",

      "content": "My hair loss was something which affected me for more than 20 years. Hair transplant were not succesful 20 yrs back and I had Norwood Grade 7 at 25 yrs of age. Today I m nearing 45 yrs . \n\nI did a ton of research about hair transplant  in last 10 yrs and was with a hair patch for last 15 yrs. \n\nIt affected my confidence . In 2024 I finally decided to give hair transplant  a good chance and decided to use my scalp,  beard and chest .\n\n During my research in Patna , where I resided , I found my doctor through a google search. I was mentally prepared to go to Delhi. Seeing his past affiliation of doc , I decided to meet. \n\n He said \" you are my second patient in the city where I have newly moved in and we both have nothing to loose as you go back to the hair patch if the transplant fails , but if it is successful , it can be life changing. We will have a 3 to 4 Surgical  sitting  approach over next 1.5 yrs to protect donor aesthetics of scalp and body. We will use your beard in the hairline and crown over multiple sittings  and beard in the rest. He put his bet on my beard which is extremely good. I linked his multi step approach with a conservative hairline initially.\n\nSurgical procedure breakdown:\n\n• 1st procedure - total of 3300 grafts- 1300 from scalp ( very thin donor ), 2000 from beard ( He extracted beard below jawline and side locks ) . This covered my conservative hairline and mid scalp.\n\n• 2nd procedure-total of 2300 grafts- about 1500 from beard and about 800 chest( Further extraction from beard below jawline  and from cheek, 800 from chest 70% of which failed ) . This was used to construct my crown and back part of the head.\n\n• 3rd procedure-total of 2000 grafts- about 1000 from the scalp( these were finasteride dependent hair which thickened with 1 year of finasteride  and about 1000 from beard ( from neck, cheek ) \n\nTotal number of grafts so far = \\~7600 grafts\n\nA primary reason for this approach in regards to procedure was to manage the existing donor hair as well as achieve realistic density. \n\nExperience and recovery:\n\nMy 3 surgeries took 1 year and were placed 6 months apart. The approach was always conservative to slightly aggresive. There was risk of scarring on my cheek and practically after 3 times extraction from my cheek , sidelocks and below neck , there are virtually no visible scar, thanks to excellent post op care guided by the doc and executed my me.\n\n My final results is still 4 months away and last surgery was done in September 2025.\n\nResults (so far): \n\nI’m not trying to boast or claim that I have a “celebrity hairline”, but my observations indicate that hair growth is naturally improving, and I am beginning to feel comfortable again with my hairline as my confidence grows.\n\n I feel confident to go out without a hair fibres or a wig now. Doctor has suggested to go for scalp micropigmentation to further reduce the contrast and recommended use of chest hair to improve my mid scalp  if have he stamina to go for a 4th surgery from chest .\n\nMy advice to anyone considering an HT for extreme high grade baldness with poor donor : \n\n1. Find a doctor who is capable of scalp and body hair transplant.\n\n2. Find a doctor whose approach is conservative to aggresive , rather than vice-versa ( else a failed surgery can't be rectified ) . Even the best donors can fail to grow and worst donor hair can grow.\n\n \n\n3. Wait for your baldness to stablize before surgery and stick to medications like finasteride and minoxidil .\n\n4. People who have good body hair especially beard ( it gave me 80% of the density over 3 surgeries ) should get a good coverage .\n\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to ask I mainly posted this in hopes of providing some insight or motivation to people who have virtually no hair..",

The rest of my hair forms defined curls, but that back section stays almost straight or just slightly wavy. Has anyone else dealt with this? Could it be a natural texture difference, damage, or maybe the way I sleep or style it? I’d really appreciate any advice on how to encourage that section to curl more or blend better with the rest of my hair.\n\nMy routine:\n\n• I use a basic shampoo and conditioner.  \n\n• After washing, I comb my hair, bringing some to the front and some to the back, then apply products.  \n\n• I use Manetain leave-in conditioner, curly cream, and a small amount of hard-hold gel.  \n\n• I diffuse for some time and then let my hair air dry.  \n\n• I try to maintain my curls with these same products between washes.  \n\n• I sleep with a bonnet and use a silk pillowcase.",

I have really fine hair so what oil is good that doesn’t weigh it down?\n\nShould I buy mousse, cream and gel too?\n\nUpon doing more research, I read that I’m not supposed to brush it for 48 hours too and to avoid touching. I already brushed my hair before work and was playing with it all day. Any advice on how to salvage this? I do feel like the curls are a bit straighter already. I went to sleep 2 hours after getting it down cause it was sooooo late.\n\nThank you ",

      "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nI really need some advice here since I have been crossing the 12 months mark of taking Finasteride 1 mg ed recently.\n\nI have been diffusely thinning all over my head for many years now but was in denial for a long time due to the slow progression of the thinning.\n\nHowever, I feel like over the last months overall thinning and loss in volume, especially in the crown and frontal area has become more and more noticeable even though I have been taking Finasteride.\n\nSome things worth mentioning:\n\n\\- got diagnosed with Hashimoto's last year as an incidental finding (elevated TPO antibodies, all other thyroid parameters within normal range)\n\n\\- might be prediabetic; normal HbA1c, though elevated fasting glucose in blood tests\n\n\\- had severe Vit D deficiency (&lt; 6 ng/mL), still substituting; all my Vits are in check now, same with Iron, Zinc etc.\n\nIt feels like Finasteride hasn't done anything at all to my continuous diffuse thinning.\n\nPlus, it exacerbated my already dry eyes to such an extent that I have to use eye drops several times every day to deal with the symptoms. I never had issues like this before so I can pretty much link this to the usage of Finasteride.\n\nI don't really want to try Minoxidil topical because I just know I wouldn't be consistent with it and it would be kind of a hassle for me. At the same time, I don't really feel like risking all the side effects of oral Minoxidil.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts and thank you for your time!",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

My natural hair texture is curly, and although sometimes I wear my hair curly, for the most part, I have it blow dried straight. I usually rock a sleek beveled inward type of bob. Recently, I had my bangs cut hoping to get the French bob I’ve always wanted. I opted for a little longer than the inspo. I love the bangs, but I can’t figure out how to style it. I haven’t tried to let it air dry yet, trying that this weekend. I think my curl texture may be too strong for the wavy messy look I’m going for, so looking for some advice. Idk if something is off or it’s just the styling I’m struggling with. Here is a pic of my hair now, my hair curly (to give an idea of what my natural texture is) and some of my inspo pics. Appreciate any advice. 🤍",

I'm developing some brown sun spots on my nose/cheeks and wrinkles on my forehead. I currently just use cetaphil gentle face cleanser and vanicream face lotion. I've tried illyoon, dr kiehls, ​​olay, skin food fix, cereve, and quite a few other brands but nothing really helps my dryness and most irritate my skin, and any exfoliating other than a soft wash cloth leaves my skin red and stinging. After a ton of research and product reviews I think I need a routine with better/more products to help my aging skin. I have a full Amazon cart but want some advice before purchasing.. I will list them below and please tell me if I should add or remove anything! I am new to this and unsure if I have the right order lol..\n\nStep 1 - cleanser - Belif Jelly Hydrating Deep Cleanser\n\nStep 2 - toner - I'm From Rice Toner\n\nStep 3 - vitamin c serum - Truskin Vitamin C Super Serum\n\nStep 4 - serum - CORSRX Snail Mucin Repairing Serum 100ml\n\nStep 5 - cream - CORSRX Hyaluronic Acid Intensive Cream\n\nStep 6 - sunscreen - Mixsoon Bean Sunscreen\n\nDoes this sound like a good line up for my skin type? Is it too much or too little? I'm afraid of wasting my money or ruining my skin.. It's so confusing seeing all the conflicting advice online. I will be 33 in September and after having 2 kids back to back I'm feeling aged, just want to preserve my youth and look the best I can. Thank you for any advice!!",

I will attach a photo of my hair styled. \n\nFinally, I recently cut my hair, so any advice for curly bobs is also appreciated.\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. Use the praying hands method to apply not your mothers curl talk curl cream.\n2. Use the praying hands method to apply either not your mothers curl talk mousse OR mark anthony strictly curls styling foam.\n3. Scrunch garnier fructis curl gel or kinky curly curling custard in.\n\nAll of this is done while leaning forward with my hair hanging directly down, I don't section.\n\n4.

It's a couple inches long now, and since I have curly hair, it puffs up and pushes my longer hair around weirdly. Also the ends are obviously not gonna be in the best shape, some of them being brand new (where it was plucked at the root) and others being frayed (on strands that were broken higher up on the shaft). \n\nIs there anything I should try to help it lay nicer and blend more smoothly with my longer hair? Would trimming and point cutting the ends potentially help?",

      "content": "I have read that the mechanical exfoliation action of the razor can trigger temporary increased oil production because the top layer of the skin has been removed and this causes the skin to overcompensate at least for a little while which has been my exact experience for a very long time.\n\nI use a double edge razor a few times a week, and I almost have to plan when to shave because of the ensuing reaction of my skin.\n\nIt gets this tacky and oily texture which feels absolutely awful if it's just before bedtime or if I have to go out a few hours after shaving. This problem auto-resolves itself after about 24 hours after the skin has kind of calmed down and the oil production has slowed down.\n\nMy usual routine is to use a Salicylic Acid face wash for two minutes before shaving, then go ahead with the shave after that.\n\nPost shave, these are the things I have tried with limited success:\n\n1). Moisturizing with a light gel after rinsing with cool water. Feels good for maybe the first 15-20 minutes, then the oiliness slowly makes my skin texture go from matte, to oily and sticky and very uncomfortable. Doesn't really work.\n\n2). Pat skin dry and apply a couple of drops of The Ordinary's Niacinamide and Zinc. Supposed to keep oil production at bay but skin still feels a bit sticky. Better than using the moisturizer but still feels a bit uncomfortable.\n\n3). Salicylic Acid based moisturizer and/or cream. Burning and stinging, painful. Not doing much for the oiliness but the combined BHA face wash, close shave with a razor + BHA cream is just brutal on my skin.\n\n4). Electric instead of a double edge razor. Electric razors do not cut as close as other types of razor, therefore do not induce as much trauma on the skin, therefore less irritation, oil production, etc. Problem is my current electric razor kind of sucks to use and is time consuming.\n\nWhat I'm going to try next time:\n\nI'm going to switch from using a Salicylic Acid facewash before shaving, to a more gentle moisturizing face wash like the one from Simply. Maybe the Salicylic Acid, combined with the shave is too much for the skin and making things worse.\n\nI also want to try Witch Hazel toner after shaving. I know WH is considered controversial and the potential for contact dermatitis is there but I'm running out of ideas.\n\nIf anyone has a product suggestion or perhaps a modification of my routine which can help with this oiliness issue, it would be welcomed and greatly appreciated, thank you.",

      "content": "Heya! Im trying to find a hairstyle that helps hide my rather large forehead and browbone. I have very very curly hair and am looking for specific tips about that (ie not moderately wavy like all the \"curly hair\" tutorials on YouTube). I have found a routine that works if my hair decides to look pretty that day, and if it doesn't I'm kinda just screwed. But on days where it looks good, I really don't know how to style it to hide the bad parts of my face. Right now I leave it in a middle part simply because I don't know what else to do. Every photo you see online is altered or AI these days so looking on Pinterest is basically useless. Curly bangs are extremely high maintenance and given I need to be able to put my hair up to work, a high maintenance haircut like that doesn't really work for me. Also curly bangs on me will prolly come out really stringy and pathetic because my hair is so thin (thanks genetics). I also need the style to frame my face because I also need to hide my very sharp, aggressive, and masculine cheekbones and jawline. My hair is just over shoulder length and I'm in my early 20s if it matters. \n\nRoutine is as follows: Garnier Whole blends for shampoo and conditioner, detangle with wide tooth comb after i get out. With hair dripping wet, add Pantene curl gel and scrunch that in. Follow with Pantene curl mousse. Diffuse for a few mins just to make it not dripping wet, let it air dry. Once dry, scrunch out the cast and part. I'm not looking for product recommendations in this post, just styles or haircut ideas. Please attach photos of your ideas because all the ways ppl describe hairstyles over text make no sense to me, so a visual example is needed. Thanks!",
