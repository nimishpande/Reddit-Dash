      "content": "Last few pics are from 2024. It was the exact day I thought, “Hm. Perhaps my hair isn’t straight.” 😂 And then I dived into the curly girl rabbit hole head first.\n\nMy hair was fighting for its life so the first thing I started doing was olaplex no.3 and curlsmith bond repair masks once a week. I alternated between the two.\n\nMy hair was also really thirsty from a lifetime of neglect so I did masks before I washed. This was usually a curlsmith mask. I’m obsessed with the double cream deep quencher. Smells incredible too. Now my hair is really soft so I do this once a month only. (Same with repair masks) I used to use curl cream too until recently. Not sure if I’m stopping completely yet - I’m going by hair feel on wash day.\n\nI tried lots of different routines for a while but one thing that was standard was always styling dripping WET and using a shit load of gel. Like a lot.\n\nCurrent 1x a week wash routine:\n\n•Tootilab shampoo and condish (detangle and brush here) - Clarifying shampoo around every 3 washes or so.\n\n•Tootilab gel. I probably use around a handful. Like a golf ball. I separate top and bottom half of my hair and comb gel through. I don’t usually brush style, I just make sure my hair is wet and smooth/seaweedy before a shake and scrunch. I go upside down, side to side, squish squish squish. You know how it goes. My fingers are pruned in winter.\n\n•Diffuse upside down!\n\n•When it’s around 70% dry - surprise! I add a tad more gel. Smooth it over and scrunch a bit more. Esp on the bottom layers which are a looser curl pattern.\n\n•I use a drop or 2 of olaplex oil for the crunch. Smooth over then shake shake shake.\n\n•I alternate sleeping with a … Bambon? I think it’s called. It’s like a cotton tube. And then I also have silk scarfs that I tie on. That usually works better.\n\n•Refresh is usually just wetting my hands and smoothing and scrunching again. Just to get that slight cast again. On the 3rd/4th day I use mousse and wet a lot more. On 5th/6th it’s cap or bun days with bangs styled.\n\nAny questions, shoot! It’s been a fun learning curve (:",

Recently switched to L’Oréal Ever Pure bond repair shampoo and conditioner. \n\n2. For styling I spray Aussie leave in conditioner then using detangling brush, next spray Not Your Mother’s- All eyes on me hair perfector and brush through. Next apply Kaleidoscope curl cream sorta using like praying hands to apply. Lastly use the bounce curl define brush and spray with Not Your Mother’s spray gel. (Used to use Miss Jessie’s gel and various ones through the years.) \n\n3. I just style and let it air dry because I’m usually rushing out the door.\n\n4. When I sleep I’m sure my hair goes through it so the next day for a refresh I just apply water and go. \n\nHowever in that first pic I did twist once and clip my hair up to try to keep the waves from yesterday and not have it fall near straight. It seemed to help. \n\nThe next few pics are to share what it looked like last night then 3 and 4 are initial bleach and dye. Last is from 2024, (didn’t take pics much last year), been on and off bleaching and coloring my bangs mostly. Those are my natural waves or sorta curls after years trying to figure out how to even do my hair. \n\nNow it feels like I’m starting over with repairing and minimizing breakage.\n\nIf you happen to have advice I’ll take it or different products to use. I think I may be using too many products after wash but not sure.\n\nThank you! ",

      "content": "So, I'm 17M and might be balding. My hairline's gotten thin. Not receded, I think, but definitely thin. Norwood 1-2 (maybe 1.25?) if you look at the shape behind the hairline. Might be telogen effluvium (I spent most of last year eating 1000-1500 calories with zero protein, save for a few days where I tried to eat more but dropped it), but I dunno, I'm just mentally preparing for it to be MPB. Hairs are mostly unminiaturized, but some are definitely thinner than others. Might just be early miniaturization. Hair still looks pretty damn good and I find it easy to hide the hairline with my fringe, so I figure it'd be a good idea to catch it early and get on the drugs.\n\nMy parents aren't helping. My father keeps talking about how thin my hair looks, and thinks I should start rubbing coconut oil in. I get that, partially, since it's proven to be great for hair appearance, health, et cetera. But he thinks it'll cure baldness and shit, and I'm getting sick of it. That's the main reason I haven't addressed my concerns with my parents.\n\nI'm going to a derm in a week or two so we'll see. Til then I've tried fixing up my diet (only on day three of the fix, lol). I'm just exhausted and wanted to make a post on this since today was the day I explained the science behind why coconut oil may not work. And he basically just said that I should just stop using science and just listen to him blindly.\n\nUgh.\n\nDo *not* come at me with the 'they want what's best for you' shtick. I'm sure Hitler wanted what was best for Germany; doesn't mean what he did was good. And yes, it's an extreme comparison, but please, I'm tired.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm looking for affordable recommendations (ideally available on amazon uk and which have a uk plug) for diffusers where the diffuser attachment can withstand heat. There was babybliss diffuser (that I believe is now discontinued) that I used to borrow from someone with an attachment that withstood higher than \"low heat\" absolutely fine. I since have had a diffuser from the same brand so I could stop borrowing that one but it appears newer models come with attachments that can only be used with low heat (even melts with medium heat (yes I should read the instructions lol learning that is on me)) which isn't very effective for me so I think I'll buy a new one but I'm afraid it will have the same problem so does anyone have any recommendations for currently available (unchanged model) diffusers with an attachment that can withstand heat? Thank you!\n\nRoutine (basic but works well!):\n• shampoo with either garnier ultimate blends or umberto giannini shampoo\n• condition with garnier coconut oil and cocoa butter conditioner\n• cover(!) and finger curl each curl with cantu shea butter and argan oil leave-in conditioning repair cream \n• diffuse",

The underside has loose ringlet like curls the top is wavy and frizzy. I have very fine, thin hair. \n\nI have no idea how to care for it and everything I've tried has made it appear stringy and oily. (Photos 1-4) \n\nCurrently i brush my hair before showering, then I use  loreal elvive hyaluron + pure oily roots and scalp purifying shampoo and rehydrating conditioner. I then add a pump of Pantene miracle rescue bond building serum on each side. Then a little of sukin natural balance leave in conditioner (each side I spray once or twice in palms) scrunched in. Then I diffuse/air dry.  \n\nThe photos are my results. My roots are clearly clean and not oily but I feel like my hair looks wet and stringy.  If I finger brush it after (photos 5 &amp;6) it looses all definition and becomes straight in parts curly in others etc and still feels stringy. \n\nIs this just how it will always look? Is my current routine too heavy? Any advice is appreciated. ",
