Recently switched to L’Oréal Ever Pure bond repair shampoo and conditioner. \n\n2. For styling I spray Aussie leave in conditioner then using detangling brush, next spray Not Your Mother’s- All eyes on me hair perfector and brush through. Next apply Kaleidoscope curl cream sorta using like praying hands to apply. Lastly use the bounce curl define brush and spray with Not Your Mother’s spray gel. (Used to use Miss Jessie’s gel and various ones through the years.) \n\n3. I just style and let it air dry because I’m usually rushing out the door.\n\n4. When I sleep I’m sure my hair goes through it so the next day for a refresh I just apply water and go. \n\nHowever in that first pic I did twist once and clip my hair up to try to keep the waves from yesterday and not have it fall near straight. It seemed to help. \n\nThe next few pics are to share what it looked like last night then 3 and 4 are initial bleach and dye. Last is from 2024, (didn’t take pics much last year), been on and off bleaching and coloring my bangs mostly. Those are my natural waves or sorta curls after years trying to figure out how to even do my hair. \n\nNow it feels like I’m starting over with repairing and minimizing breakage.\n\nIf you happen to have advice I’ll take it or different products to use. I think I may be using too many products after wash but not sure.\n\nThank you! ",

      "content": "We all know that hair loss leads to psychological and emotional distress. I've experienced it myself; started at 18 years old, and now I'm in my early 20s with a solid norwood 2-3. I've tried countless drugs to address the DHT angle (topical fin, dut, kx826/pyri, fluridil, RU), yet I've experienced either dry eyes or chest pains. I'm not giving up with the topical fin, still experimenting with lower doses.\n\nBut that's not the point of this post. The point is that you **shouldn't** let balding ruin or lower your quality of life. Be as optimistic as you could be. I do this by coping through several strategies.\n\n\\#1: Self improvement. I know you guys of tired of hearing the usual advice of get muscular or dress better, but I want to be the best version of myself I can be, so when a decent treatment comes out, getting my hair back will be the last piece of the puzzle, so to speak. \n\n\\#2: Make yourself busy. We are all at different stages of life, whether it be high school, college, or employment. When you're outside of school or work, indulge in your hobbies, spend quality time with your friends and/or your significant other. \n\n\\#3: Potential treatments coming soon. I know it's a common trope that the cure is always 5 years away, or that baldness has been cured in mice a million times. But we have Veradermics' VDPHL01, an extended release minoxidil; Cosmo pharmaceutical's Clascoterone, a topical androgen receptor inhibitor (potential alternative to 5-ARI's for those who can't tolerate them); and last but not least, PP405, with a novel mechanism of action. None of these are guaranteed to get FDA approval, but this is the most exciting time for AGA patients since the release of propecia 20 years ago.\n\n",

Last week I shared to you all that for the past 3 years I've been struggling with redness across the face, bumps and dullness, which is weird given my family all has clear skin. \n\nI think I have very sensitive skin, judging by how when I put on anything it just goes red, though it never stings never hurts.. Since last post I took your advice on trying less invasive treatment, so I put aside my antifungals and just used lukewarm water and vaseline for a week. This is the result.\n\nI have all of these bumps on my forehead, not outright acne, but I can feel my forehead is visibly inflamed and red, my cheeks are much more bloated and inflamed than they ever were, which is also weird given I have a low salt high potassium diet. I have this persistent crepeyness to my skin which is beginning to form lines on my forehead, creases and scars. \n\nI'm just at odds, I tried everything from antifungals to steroids to calming balms to azaelic acid and the result is always the same, persistent redness. My GP claimed it was seborrheic dermatitis, and the treatment did nothing to help. It makes me look much more aged than I am (21) and it's beginning to impact my confidence severely. \n\nPic 1. Taken today \n- used cerave moisturiser \n\nPic 2. Taken a week ago\n- antifungal treatment, before cold turkey\n\nPic 3. Taken 2024\n- my skin on a good day\n\nPic 4. \n- the products I used prior to doing nothing",

I've gotten my compliments my entire life on how I have perfect skin, and people routinely think I'm 23-24. I get a pimple like once a year, maybeee.\n\nI stopped using soap when I was younger (maybe 15) because I have eczema, and I've noticed that my skin does better that way. I've also always somewhat thought that putting chemicals all over my body is probably not great for it and that the beauty / hygiene industry is a scam (mostly). I've never done my research though, so I'm not going to die on this hill. It's just my personal experience. I, of course, shower once or twice per day and really take care of my hygiene, just not with soap.\n\nAnyways, I've recently begun to dip my toes in the pool of hygiene products. I'm worried to try face wash because I don't want to break something that doesn't need fixing, but I'm wondering if it could maybe benefit me.\n\n\n\nI want to know:\n\n1. Do you think I should start using face wash? (and how often?)\n2. What kind of face wash product would you recommend? (be specific please if there's a brand)\n3. Any other tips / suggestions?",

The underside has loose ringlet like curls the top is wavy and frizzy. I have very fine, thin hair. \n\nI have no idea how to care for it and everything I've tried has made it appear stringy and oily. (Photos 1-4) \n\nCurrently i brush my hair before showering, then I use  loreal elvive hyaluron + pure oily roots and scalp purifying shampoo and rehydrating conditioner. I then add a pump of Pantene miracle rescue bond building serum on each side. Then a little of sukin natural balance leave in conditioner (each side I spray once or twice in palms) scrunched in. Then I diffuse/air dry.  \n\nThe photos are my results. My roots are clearly clean and not oily but I feel like my hair looks wet and stringy.  If I finger brush it after (photos 5 &amp;6) it looses all definition and becomes straight in parts curly in others etc and still feels stringy. \n\nIs this just how it will always look? Is my current routine too heavy? Any advice is appreciated. ",
