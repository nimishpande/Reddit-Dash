Recently switched to L’Oréal Ever Pure bond repair shampoo and conditioner. \n\n2. For styling I spray Aussie leave in conditioner then using detangling brush, next spray Not Your Mother’s- All eyes on me hair perfector and brush through. Next apply Kaleidoscope curl cream sorta using like praying hands to apply. Lastly use the bounce curl define brush and spray with Not Your Mother’s spray gel. (Used to use Miss Jessie’s gel and various ones through the years.) \n\n3. I just style and let it air dry because I’m usually rushing out the door.\n\n4. When I sleep I’m sure my hair goes through it so the next day for a refresh I just apply water and go. \n\nHowever in that first pic I did twist once and clip my hair up to try to keep the waves from yesterday and not have it fall near straight. It seemed to help. \n\nThe next few pics are to share what it looked like last night then 3 and 4 are initial bleach and dye. Last is from 2024, (didn’t take pics much last year), been on and off bleaching and coloring my bangs mostly. Those are my natural waves or sorta curls after years trying to figure out how to even do my hair. \n\nNow it feels like I’m starting over with repairing and minimizing breakage.\n\nIf you happen to have advice I’ll take it or different products to use. I think I may be using too many products after wash but not sure.\n\nThank you! ",

      "content": "First two photos: 12/25/25. Second two: 2/8/26 \n\nI know it’s only week 7 and I’m trying my best not to lose hope…and patience lol. I started differin on 12/25/25 to get rid of some closed comedones on my chin. My acne has NEVER been as bad as it was during the purge. I had a few cystic pimples here and there but it was literally the worst it has ever been, a whole village on my chin. I have wanted to quit multiple times but trying to stay strong.   \n\nDespite the cystic acne clearing this week and looking better, the closed comedones are still here. I’m fearing it’s my beloved La Roche moisturizer with 30 spf. I don’t know what else to do. Am I still purging? Is something in my routine creating more comedones? Should I quit differin? I’ll put my very simple routine below.   \n\nAM  \n\n\\- Cleanse with CeraVe hydrating cleanser  \n\n\\- The ordinary azelaic acid (recent addition, like two uses)   - Vanicream daily moisturizer (on my eyes because they’re sensitive)  \n\n\\- La Roche moisturizer w 30 spf   \n\nPM   \n\n\\- Remove makeup on eyes with ponds, avoiding chin  \n\n\\- Micellar water for the rest of the face   \n\n\\- Cleanse with CeraVe gentle foaming   \n\nSandwich method for differin  \n\n\\- Cetaphil deep hydration moisturizer   \n\n\\- Differin (haven’t worked up to every night yet. Listening to my barrier. But almost to every night)   \n\n\\- Cetaphil again and vanicream after if I’m feeling really dry   \n\nMy skin is super dry, has never been oily, and not really acne prone. These closed comedones are recent (6-9 months) and I truly fear it’s the sunscreen. Any advice is greatly appreciated!! ",

      "content": "We all know that hair loss leads to psychological and emotional distress. I've experienced it myself; started at 18 years old, and now I'm in my early 20s with a solid norwood 2-3. I've tried countless drugs to address the DHT angle (topical fin, dut, kx826/pyri, fluridil, RU), yet I've experienced either dry eyes or chest pains. I'm not giving up with the topical fin, still experimenting with lower doses.\n\nBut that's not the point of this post. The point is that you **shouldn't** let balding ruin or lower your quality of life. Be as optimistic as you could be. I do this by coping through several strategies.\n\n\\#1: Self improvement. I know you guys of tired of hearing the usual advice of get muscular or dress better, but I want to be the best version of myself I can be, so when a decent treatment comes out, getting my hair back will be the last piece of the puzzle, so to speak. \n\n\\#2: Make yourself busy. We are all at different stages of life, whether it be high school, college, or employment. When you're outside of school or work, indulge in your hobbies, spend quality time with your friends and/or your significant other. \n\n\\#3: Potential treatments coming soon. I know it's a common trope that the cure is always 5 years away, or that baldness has been cured in mice a million times. But we have Veradermics' VDPHL01, an extended release minoxidil; Cosmo pharmaceutical's Clascoterone, a topical androgen receptor inhibitor (potential alternative to 5-ARI's for those who can't tolerate them); and last but not least, PP405, with a novel mechanism of action. None of these are guaranteed to get FDA approval, but this is the most exciting time for AGA patients since the release of propecia 20 years ago.\n\n",

I have very fine, thin hair. \n\nI have no idea how to care for it and everything I've tried has made it appear stringy and oily. (Photos 1-4) \n\nCurrently i brush my hair before showering, then I use  loreal elvive hyaluron + pure oily roots and scalp purifying shampoo and rehydrating conditioner. I then add a pump of Pantene miracle rescue bond building serum on each side. Then a little of sukin natural balance leave in conditioner (each side I spray once or twice in palms) scrunched in. Then I diffuse/air dry.  \n\nThe photos are my results. My roots are clearly clean and not oily but I feel like my hair looks wet and stringy.  If I finger brush it after (photos 5 &amp;6) it looses all definition and becomes straight in parts curly in others etc and still feels stringy. \n\nIs this just how it will always look? Is my current routine too heavy? Any advice is appreciated. ",

I've gotten my compliments my entire life on how I have perfect skin, and people routinely think I'm 23-24. I get a pimple like once a year, maybeee.\n\nI stopped using soap when I was younger (maybe 15) because I have eczema, and I've noticed that my skin does better that way. I've also always somewhat thought that putting chemicals all over my body is probably not great for it and that the beauty / hygiene industry is a scam (mostly). I've never done my research though, so I'm not going to die on this hill. It's just my personal experience. I, of course, shower once or twice per day and really take care of my hygiene, just not with soap.\n\nAnyways, I've recently begun to dip my toes in the pool of hygiene products. I'm worried to try face wash because I don't want to break something that doesn't need fixing, but I'm wondering if it could maybe benefit me.\n\n\n\nI want to know:\n\n1. Do you think I should start using face wash? (and how often?)\n2. What kind of face wash product would you recommend? (be specific please if there's a brand)\n3. Any other tips / suggestions?",

Right now, a Korean brand called\"I am shampoo\" 😅\n\n I've tried a bunch of conditiners recently. I have a low budget. My current bottle is Aussie Miracle Curls. \n\nWhen I get out of the shower, I just flip my head and run my fingers through it, scrunch a bit, and let it dry. I don't use brushes (it just doesn't need them), blow dryers, or any leave in products. I used to henna my hair, but it's been natural for 5+ years now, so probably mostly virgin hair. It does grow very slow, though.\n\nI have a silk pillow case, but don't do anything special at night. I don't really style it, either. Sometimes I mist it with my plant sprayer (just water) to reactivate the curls, but that's about it. \n\nMy hair is ultra, ultra fine and gets weighed down very easily. The problem I've been having is if I use clarifying shampoo, it gets frizzy and tends to lose the curl, but is nice and fluffy. If I use more moisturizing products, it gets weighed down and greasy within 24 hours. I can't seem to find a happy middle ground that keeps both the moisture and volume. ",

I've been told in the past by my dermatologist that most of my acne seems to be hormonal, but the medication they had put me on for it was absolutely dreadful and made my skin dry painful and red to the point where it wasn't even worth it.
