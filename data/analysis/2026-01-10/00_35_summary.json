I added a Picture of my skincare products that i own (1st pic) and the ones i am using (2nd snd 3rd). Any suggestions what to change? My skin constantly look sort of inflamed-like (is that maybe fungal acne?)and i am experiencing mild breakouts time to time, not sure about the orgin of those😅.\n\nPs: i had been told i am dramatic and that my skin is fine but really its something i care about a lot and i dont want it to get worse. I am so scared to go back because i got so used to having nice skin during the treatment.\n\nMy rutine\n(Pm)\nHaruharu wonder 5.5 cleansing gel or anua cleanser\nIunik beta glucan serum\nClever soap or azelaic acid (2-3x a week)\nOr \nThe ordinary retinal (2x a week)\nPurito mighty bamboo creme\n\n(Am) \nHaruharu wonder 5.5 cleansing gel\nI'm from mugwort essense\nPurito oat in calming gel or mighty bamboo creme\nSkin1004 centella sunscreen\n \n\n\nI am very fund of haruharu cleanser, its currently the only cleanser that doesnt make it worse for me.\nThen the purito moisturizers i am going back and forth with, i feel like they are a safe option.\nThe only active ingredient i am satisfied with is the retinal as it does its job very well, no so sure about the azelaic acid from anua as it  has niaciamide and perhaps i do not handle that well...?\n\nI was thinking of trying paula's choice BHA, let me know your thought on that!\n",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "TLDR: does anyone have any experience or guidance for how best to deal with the type of physical scarring I have? I’ve done a lot of treatments in the past and at this point I just want to find the best route no matter how much it costs. Looks like ice pick, rolling and box scars. The PIH doesn’t bother me as much rn and isn’t as much of a priority.\n\n—————\nI (F29) have had hormonal acne since I was about 21-22. It’s ebbed and flowed in severity and was semi-managed through diet in the last year but has recently flared up again. I have PCOS so I think anything stress or hormone related seems to trigger it… I used to get the perfect derma peel pretty regularly to manage PIH/actives but decided to save money and try to build a skincare routine at home that manages both. It seemed to work for a bit but recently have had some stressors that have caused flare ups. Feels like no matter what I do, my skin is so sensitive that one tiny move in the wrong direction kills all my progress.\n\nIn the second half of this year, I developed a lot of small closed comedones after a chemical peel. Over the months, I was able to get rid of a lot of them through adapalene and some other actives but they seem to return regardless especially around my jawline.  I’ve been reading online about how physical acne scarring = uneven skin surface = more clogged pores = comedones, aka a never ending cycle?\n\nDoes anyone have any experience/expertise with treatments that work for the type of physical scarring I have? I’m not an expert lol but I think I have the big 3 - ice pick, rolling and box car.\n\nI don’t want to do subcision, but I don’t know what my best option is especially given that my skin doesn’t really go through “calm” phases that would lend itself to microneedling. I’ve read about the halo laser - I did it once many years ago but not sure if I saw a huge difference and really don’t wanna waste money and time on things that aren’t going to help",

I’ve used a sponge and brushes, and changed my base so many times yet it’s always ending up like this. Here’s some parts of my routine:\n\n•\t⁠I always used ceravee foaming cleanser, the ordinary glycolic toner, their niacinamide and a simple moisturiser. I’ve used the neutrogena water gel moisturiser before, as well as the ordinary moisturiser and still the same. I didn’t always use the niacinamide, however on days without same as above.\n•\t⁠I’ve used silicone primers, no primer, (today I tried no primer) and still the same outcome. Current primer I have is nyx shine killer, previously used a revlon primer, as well as the nyx pore filler, and a rimmel one (I can’t remember the name).\n•\t⁠I wait ages between moisturiser and primer if using.\n•\t⁠I drink a lot of water regardless\n•\t⁠I have an oily tzone and always use less product there\n•\t⁠I’ve tried loose and pressed powders, and only use a small amount\n•\t⁠I use urban decay setting spray, not always but today I did and same result as other days without\n\nAny advice would be needed! It’s so frustrating as when I was in my 20s I feel like this never happened! I’m really not sure what the issue is, I’ve done silicone primers, matte primers, and I check to make sure my primer is compatible with my foundation. I don’t like to be too matte, however couldn’t try glass skin or dewy as with it being oily it would be too shiny for me. I’ve tried using less foundation also. It just always seem to cake in smile lines, my chin, nose and sides of my mouth. I know the cold weather can be drying, however I spent Christmas on holiday and my makeup did the same in heat. ",

Am I doing something wrong or did I completely misinterpret the texture of my hair?\n\nMy routine: Suave clarifying shampoo once a week (oily scalp), the L’oréal Ever Pure volume shampoo, and the L’oréal Elvive Glycolic Gloss conditioner. For other products, I use the Aussie Sprunch mousse and the NYM curl cream. I plop for 15-20 minutes then air dry (since I don’t have a diffuser)and use a silk bonnet but I haven’t noticed any changes. \n\nPHOTOS IN ORDER: \n1) before shower \n\n2) A strand of hair 💀\n\n3) A super curly piece of hair next to me ear, right side.\n\n4) Post wash/plop\n\n5) Post wash/plop, underneath.\n",

It was fall of 2023 when the learned that I could use meditation to improve my hairline.\n\nEthnicity: South Asian, male, 37.\n\nFirst image: left picture is from January of 2024. Right picture is from September of 2024. I used the same camera, same location, same lighting, same hair length (3 days after trim).\n\nSecond picture (just one pic) was taken December of 2025. Location is different, lighting is different, I think it was about 5 days of trim.\n\nProduct: Hims 0.3% fin, 6% min. In 2024 I used derma pen once a week with 1.5 mm cartridge. In 2025, I rarely used it as I ran out of cartridges and got lazy. But towards the end of 2025, I started to use derma pen again once a week with 1.5 mm cartridge.\n\nAdditional products: in fall of 2025, I also added 0.3% of dut, hence why second picture has yellow tint on the scalp.\n\nProgress: As you can see the progress in 2024, not much of a progress from September of 2024 to December 2025. I think progress has been plateaued maybe with some hair getting thicker is some areas.\n\nFuture plans: should I try oral dut on top of topical fin/min? Or should I go HT route?\n\nThank you\n\n[First Picture](https://preview.redd.it/ewbgdjq1secg1.jpg?width=1924&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf4aae7498dbe3e112c0cbe99730b9ddda2eae7f)\n\n[Second Picture](https://preview.redd.it/qswd9mq1secg1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f70efba72b3f4c8fe58e370471db72bfc72c193)",

      "content": "\nHi guys, I’m really worried about changes in my eye area and would really appreciate insight from people who understand skincare more than I do.\n\nI used VT Mild Reedle Shot 50 and the VT Reedle Shot Cream for 2-3 months, and I did apply them directly to my under-eye area and eyelids (I know now that probably wasn’t a good idea and I regret it so much I wish I did more research about the products before using them).\n\nThe skin around my eyes has changed a lot, looks thinner and more crepey, less plump especially when smiling and more lines are visible, texture looks aged compared to before and this has made me so insecure.\n\nI’m 24F and I know this is the age where we usually start to lose collagen but I have a very plump face from genetics and this two products were the only thing I added to my routine these past few months.\n\nIn 2024 I bought the beauty of joseon retinal eye cream and used it only a few times and started to get dry eyes and stopped it immediately after reading online that we should never put retinol near eyes.And last year on August I bought the skin1004 matrixyl and volufiline ampoule shot and also used it on eye area because some said on tiktok that its very good for volume but I think that has also contributed to this, I havent used it constatly but I did pair it sometimes with the reedle shot serum and cream and now I just read that it has spicules and apparently thats also bad for eyes! :(\n\nPlease if anyone has any advice or if anyone has succeded in restoring volume and reversing damage in eye area from products like this I would really appreciate it, this is really taking a toll on my self eestem.\n\nThank you!",

      "title": "How to work around a traditional wet cut?",
      "content": "For some reason Reddit won't let me post to r/wavyhair , but it seems like it's a sister sub to this one anyway, so I hope y'all will forgive me if my hair is considered wavy rather than curly (idk, it seems like there's a lot of disagreement about curls similar to mine in curly spaces lately).\n\nThis might be a bit of a novel so apologies in advance, and I'll try to organize it as best I can.\n\nI'm looking for **tips on quick and easy ways to work with short hair** (men's cut short, I generally present more or less as a guy) that's been cut wet as if it were straight -- how can I easily style it so that the curl looks intentional and enhanced instead of like I'm trying and failing to subdue it?\n\nI currently have basically shorn back and sides (scissor taper), and then on top in the front, everything on the long side of my side part was cut as one forelock. The overall effect is sort of 40s/50s/neo-Edwardian, like something you might see on a guy from the 90s Jeeves &amp; Wooster TV show.\n\nI've been to a couple of curl specialists before but never felt like it was really worth paying 3x as much as a barber, especially because when my spouse (not a professional hairstylist) cut my hair I was usually happier with the look. My spouse doesn't currently have time to cut my hair (due to illness in our social circle), so I recently tried a new semi-traditional barber, and it seems... fine, but I think I just need to figure out how to work around the result.\n\nI'm also looking for **recommendations for all-in-one silicone-free styling products** with a matte finish, that could help my hair curl more and clump better with less frizz without weighing it down, ideally can be used on soaking wet hair in the shower, and also will last 3-4 days between washes and still look presentable enough for webcam meetings.\n\nJust to make clear that I'm not breaking rule 2, I am \\*not\\* looking for scalp condition help. I have that handled with my routine as described below.\n\nI have hair I always thought was 3a when properly cared for -- big loose curls the diameter of sidewalk chalk or a bit bigger, but the curl pattern isn't an S, it comes full circle -- but I'm also seeing a lot of curly hair discussion labeling hair that looks like mine, with visible full circles that are just big and loose, as \"actually just 2c at most\" so I'm not really sure what type exactly my hair is. Not looking to be typed, I just figure that info may be useful when determining what products to recommend.\n\nLast I tested, porosity, elasticity, and texture/thickness were all medium, and density seems like it might be medium lately too. It was high density when I was younger but I've been on testosterone about a decade now and I'm nearing my 40s, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's thinner.\n\nMy current routine is as follows:\n\n* The day before wash day, I spritz my scalp with Briogeo Scalp Revival to help remove dandruff buildup. I use this because it's the cheapest non-shampoo salicylic acid scalp product I could find where the application process doesn't bug me.\n* Wash day: 2 sulfate-free shampoos.\n* First I use Grandpa's Soap pine tar shampoo and either immediately rinse out per package directions or maybe let it sit 30 seconds while I wash my face.\n* Second I use Vanicream pyrithione zinc shampoo and let it sit a few minutes while I apply skincare and wash my body, and maybe also while I shave if I don't feel like I need conditioner.\n* In the winter, I apply a little bit of Innersense daily hydrating conditioner and let it sit a few minutes while I shave. In the warmer/less dry parts of the year I feel like this leaves my hair weighed down, but I foolishly bought the big bottle many years ago and I refuse to throw it out until I've used it all up.\n* I rinse everything out and scrunch in styling products. I have used Max Green Alchemy styling gel with a little bit of the matte paste on top, usually with maybe a tsp of added neutral protein filler, and that was fine, but it was too many bottles for my limited shower space. Currently using Uncle Funky's Daughter Curl Stimulator, which has protein in it already, but I don't love the shiny finish and I feel like my flyaways still kind of give middle aged STEM professor who's never heard of the CG method and wouldn't give a fuck if they did.\n* Last, I wrap it up with a floursack towel so it doesn't drip everywhere while I do the rest of my morning routine. If I have enough length to do so, I plop. It stays like that maybe 10 minutes until I'm getting dressed, and then I take it off to let my hair air dry the rest of the way.",

I struggled over the years but now have a decent routine that prevents breakouts overall. I’m 28 now btw. I live in the desert and struggle a lot with dryness and my cheeks often being very red still. My skin has come such a long way and this is honestly so good compared to where it once was, but I’ve dreamed for years of clear, beautiful skin, especially since I don’t love wearing makeup most of the time.\n\nI’m wondering if I should do chemical peels, microneedling, a different procedure, or add something into my routine to help with the scarring and with the redness?\n\nI currently use L’amarue clarify and control protocol (cleanser, toner, serum, moisturizer) as well as one of their facial oils, but admittedly I only do my routine once a day most of the time. It does help with the redness immediately after but comes back after a few hours.",
