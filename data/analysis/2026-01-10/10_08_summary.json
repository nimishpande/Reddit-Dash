On my regular days this sunscreen and Kay loose powder was all I used to look put together. But since this has raised doubts in me regarding the sun protection I sadly had to look for another option 🥲.\n\nBeauty of Joseon : This spreads beautifully and does not take time to blend like UV doux. No silicony texture which I miss. Cant say anything about sun protection as there was no prolonged exposure or harsh Sun in December. ",

Though, I have realized that I’m not a big fan of blonde and the contrast with my roots doesn’t look good to me. Think I want to have it dyed a shade or two lighter than my natural dark brown (maybe a chocolate brown). Also want to get a U-cut with face framing layers so there’s more volume in my hair but they’re SO expensive at curly girl salons. Would you guys recommend me just getting a cheaper cut at a cosmetology school or should I def go to a curly certified hair stylist?\n\nRoutine:\n\nFor shampoo and conditioner I use olaplex though I’ll probably try to find a budget product since it’s a little expensive. Also have been more consistent with deep conditioning these last few months and I feel that it’s helped my curls a lot! I use Rizos for curl cream and not your mothers for gel. I diffuse my hair. No bonnets to bed I feel they make my curls flat but I do use a satin pillowcase and tie my hair up in a pineapple bun.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

One is the Nivea moisturizer (it says on the pack that it can be applied on the face as well), and I’ve also tried Vaseline Deep Moisturiser Body Lotion (which I think is mainly for the body).\n\nWhenever I apply these on my face, my eyes start feeling heavy — not exactly sleepy, but like they want to close or feel slightly drowsy/uncomfortable. This only happens when I apply it on my face. If I apply the same products on my body, I feel completely fine.\n\nAny idea why it happens? or anyone with similar experiences?\n\nAlso, I have dry skin with a few pimples and some pigmentation patches on my face.\nCould you suggest:\n\t•\tA good moisturizer suitable for dry + slightly acne-prone/sensitive skin, and\n\t•\tAn additional product (serum/cream/etc.) that can help with pimples or pigmentation and works well along with the moisturizer?\n\nAny help or recommendations would be really appreciated.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

How do you manage your hair routine for morning swims?\n\n  \nI've always been an evening swimmer, but I'm looking into swimming in the mornings before my classes since my uni has a pool and I have more time in the mornings now (10am classes). I've never had to worry about styling and drying my hair at the pool, so I need advice!\n\n  \nI have super thick, long curly hair that is low-porosity, so it takes AGES to dry. I put a lot of gel in my hair for a good curl cast since thats the only way I can get my curls to last, but it also takes AGES to dry (my hair can still be damp after spending 30m diffusing and air drying overnight).\n\nI'm going to cut my hair shorter which will ideally decrease drying time, but i'm not sure what else to change. I can't bring a blow dryer to uni everyday, but I also can't walk around with wet hair all day esp in winter :( \n\n  \nI'll also mention I wear a swim cap, but my hair still gets very damp and humid underneath + my pool uses a LOT of chlorine so I always wash it after (plus my curls would get ruined under the cap anyway lol).\n\n  \nAny advice?

I used to be perscribed clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide 1/5% but after moving I couldn't get it for months, and when I did get a new prescription it didn't work nearly as well. (about 1.5 years since I had used it regularly) I was (still am though) at a complete loss until like an hour ago where this girl on tiktok posted a 10 minute video talking about Perioral Dermatitis. She talked about the symptoms, the irritants, and more. All of what she said had applied to my struggles!! And I know it's horrible to self diagnose, but I did do a lot of research into it and truly think it's what I'm dealing with. All that being said... my entire skincare routine is made up of triggers for perioral dermatitis. Currently, I use the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant, Clindamycin/Benzoyl Peroxide mix, and a bit of glycolic acid and witch hazel every so often. The Dermalogica cleanser used to work wonders for me, so I'm really upset about it potentially being bad for my skin. Does anyone else who has struggled with this have any ideas on where to start? I have sensitive, normal skin. Any advice is appreciated.",

After trimming my beard with a blade one day, when I already had blackheads, I started breaking out.\n\nMy main issue is that I have oily skin. I get blackheads and whiteheads, and they often turn into pus-filled acne.\n\nAfter the breakout, I stopped using everything and started using only Saslic DS and a toner twice a day. Even after that, my skin still gets very oily, especially during office hours, even when I haven’t applied anything. I’m also still breaking out.\n\nI’m confused and worried now. If I’m using Saslic DS twice a day and not applying any moisturizer, can that actually make my skin produce more oil and cause more acne?\n\nAt this point, I honestly don’t know what to follow. I feel lost when it comes to skincare and understanding which products are right for oily, acne-prone skin 😔.\n\nI currently have the following products with me:\n\n\t1.\tSaslic DS 2%\n\n\t2.\tJovees Tea Tree Face Wash (pH 5.5)\n\n\t3.\tJovees Cucumber Toner\n\n\t4.\tPlum Rice Water &amp; Niacinamide 2% Hybrid Sunscreen\n\n\t5.\tDot &amp; Key Cica Calming Oil-Free Moisturiser\n\n\t6.\tBenzoyl Peroxide 2.5%\n\nIf my current products aren’t suitable, please suggest better options and a simple routine. I’d really appreciate guidance on how to understand skincare and what actually helps.\n\nPS - i have been on isotretinoin med years ago and it worked very well but i stopped it as it is steroid.",

The issue is not so much the hair itself, it is more so that it is hard for me to style it in a way that frames my face. I have a larger forehead and small facial features, and often having a part in my hair (middle or off center) creates unflattering proportions with my face. I would like to loosen the curls however I can, in the least damaging way possible, so that I have more freedom with styling and cut. With how tight the curls are, bangs would be impractical as the hair floats more than it hangs down. Please let me know any recommendations for treatments, products, or styles to try. (For context, my routine includes the raw sugar moisture smoothie shampoo 1-2x/week, daily conditioner of the same brand, leave in conditioner (Matrix brand “A curl can dream,”) and gel (Not Your Mother’s coconut). I strictly air dry and occasionally oil the ends, as well as use a Hask brand keratin hair mask overnight. I use a bonnet overnight, and completely wet my hair everyday instead of a refresh routine).",

      "content": "Hi all, just looking for some advice on what to do about my scars from moles I had removed 14 months ago. The first photo is of a scar on my jaw, that mole was flat, but large and brown. The second photo is under my chin, that mole was the colour of my skin but prominent enough to see in photos of my side profile. Unfortunately I don't have any before photos.\n\nI had these removed by a derm using the burn method (his rec), and I'm unhappy with the results. There are still bumps on both sites which I thought would have smoothed out by now. I went back to the derm a couple times for follow ups and he did a touch up on my chin (more burning which I feel like did nothing) and injected what I think was a steroid into my jaw to reduce the bump. The bump flattened for about a week each time, then came back.\n\nThe derm said that's basically all he can do, that the bump on my chin is likely just because of hairs (still very much feels like the entire mole is there), and I can keep coming back for injections to try and flatten the bump on my jaw (I don't want to keep doing this because it's not permanent).\n\nAny advice on what to do? Should I be seeing a laser tech for scars or something? I'm not well versed in skincare so unsure of my options, Google hasn't been helpful. Should I go back to the derm yet again? Cosmetic surgeon for full extrication of the remainder of the moles?\n\nSuper grateful for any responses, thank you!",
