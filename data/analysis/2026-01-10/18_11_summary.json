It has a silicone texture which worked as a great base for me when doing whatever minimal makeup I was doing. On my regular days this sunscreen and Kay loose powder was all I used to look put together. But since this has raised doubts in me regarding the sun protection I sadly had to look for another option 🥲.\n\nBeauty of Joseon : This spreads beautifully and does not take time to blend like UV doux. No silicony texture which I miss. Cant say anything about sun protection as there was no prolonged exposure or harsh Sun in December. ",

Though, I have realized that I’m not a big fan of blonde and the contrast with my roots doesn’t look good to me. Think I want to have it dyed a shade or two lighter than my natural dark brown (maybe a chocolate brown). Also want to get a U-cut with face framing layers so there’s more volume in my hair but they’re SO expensive at curly girl salons. Would you guys recommend me just getting a cheaper cut at a cosmetology school or should I def go to a curly certified hair stylist?\n\nRoutine:\n\nFor shampoo and conditioner I use olaplex though I’ll probably try to find a budget product since it’s a little expensive. Also have been more consistent with deep conditioning these last few months and I feel that it’s helped my curls a lot! I use Rizos for curl cream and not your mothers for gel. I diffuse my hair. No bonnets to bed I feel they make my curls flat but I do use a satin pillowcase and tie my hair up in a pineapple bun.",

I have always known my hair was like a frizzy type of wavy but it has never looked remotely like this before.\n\nI sent a photo to my friend and she suggested I start a curly hair routine. Currently, I use Pantene rosewater shampoo and conditioner, and then scrunch it a bit and let it air dry. I wash with shampoo/conditioner every other day. My hair is dense and greases up easily, so I worry that heavy products like creams wouldn't work on it. Any recommendations from those with a similar hair type?\n\nThank you!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I've realised from many years of using skincare that the less I do the better it is for me, and so most of the days I only use a moisturizer and sunscreen after washing my face (during the day) and just moisturizer at night (with spot treatment if I have a pimple). I try to be very gentle with washing my face too and try not to strip my skin dry as that leads to my skin reddening and becoming sensitive over time.\n\nThis is my 5-6th tube of this moisturizer and in the box there's another tube and I will forever use it unless I find an identical replacement that costs me a little bit less (open to suggestions please tell me if you have any), it does it's job and calms my skin as a plus, that's all I apparently need from a moisturizer, most of my skin conditions are cause by hormonal conditions or how my skin reacts to humidity and dryness in the air, so topical stuff can only do so much. Most of the moisturizers I have had apart from this one have never worked for me and I'd rather not use one than use one that just clogs my pores.\n\nSo if you have sensitive skin this is probably a safe choice.\n\nWRP",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I've had a look through posts but I'm specifically lookinging for UK products and couldn't really find what I needed.\n\nThis year, my hair has become really brittle. I am fairly sure it is linked to hormones, but getting that sorted is proving to be quite the battle. \n\nMy hair is naturally thin and fine, curly/wavy/frizzy, but I've also started growing thick black and white hairs over the last couple of years, entirely different texture. It's my fine hair that is suffering though. The two things combined are giving me a \"permanently frazzled\" look since the shorter, thicker hairs stick up and I have whole little sections of short, broken, fine hair. \n\nI have straightened my hair maybe 3 times in the last year, and use an argan oil heat protection spray when I do. I don't use a hairdryer. I have dyed it once in that time with box dye, about 5 months ago. I also take collagen every day and a B complex, including biotin, every other day.\n\nIf I put it up in a ponytail, it seems to create more breakage, but my hair is so big and frizzy right now that it's the only way I can look anything like presentable, and not like an eccentric wild woman (not that I'm against that, it's just not a look I want all the time 😂). \n\nThe breakage is mainly the top layers, which makes sense since it gets all the exposure to changing weather, heating etc, but it all feels pretty brittle. I do sometimes get ringlets in the bottom layers. I currently use Aussie moisturising shampoo and Garnier ultimate blends honey hair remedy, and neither seem to have made an improvement. Please give me your best suggestions on helping my poor hair? I don't suit shorter hairstyles but it's so bad right now! ",

It’s exciting a new topical hairloss drug sounds amazing  but here’s the reality. It’s patented until 2036, which means there won’t be any cheap generics for a long time, and the estimated price is around €300 per month. Compare that to finasteride at €30/month, and you can see why most people won’t jump on it.\n\n300 x 12 = €3600 per year",

I really only use moisturizer and sunscreen on my face. In the mornings, I use La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer UV SPF 30, and at night I use Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer with Niacinamide. I’m also pretty prone to acne breakouts, so I’m extra careful about introducing anything new to my skin.\n\nI’ve tried looking online, but there are just so many options with really mixed reviews that it’s honestly overwhelming. I figured I’d reach out here to see if anyone has personal experience or if any skincare gurus could point me in the right direction, especially if you have sensitive or acne-prone skin too.\n\nI’d really appreciate any recommendations.
