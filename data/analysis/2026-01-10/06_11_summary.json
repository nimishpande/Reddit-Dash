      "content": "I’ve spent the last years in a long term, emotionally abusive relationship with tretinoin. I did the whole devoted partner routine. I introduced it slowly. I buffered. I sandwiched. I moisturized like my life depended on it. I babied my barrier. I listened to every motivational speech about “pushing through retinization” and “it gets better after the adjustment period,” as if my face was going to have a breakthrough and I would become a calm, enlightened adult. It never did. \n\nAnd it wasn’t for lack of trying other things. Niacinamide made my skin act like I’d insulted its mother. AHAs and BHAs gave me hot, reactive redness. Vitamin C had my face feeling like it was actively eating itself. And don’t even get me started on azelaic acid. My negative feelings towards it was largely because a few years ago I tried Naturium’s azelaic acid and that stuff had me convinced the ingredient was invented as a prank. It stung. It burned. It is one of those products that makes you stand in front of the mirror and reevaluate every choice you’ve ever made.\n\nThen azelaic acid re entered the story. \n\nI started it again and expected the same experience, because why wouldn’t I? I assumed it would be another short lived situationship where I convince myself the tingling is “normal” until I’m suddenly rinsing my face at 1 a.m. \n\nThree months later, my skin is almost unrecognizable. It’s supple. It’s smooth. My rosacea has calmed down significantly. My PIE has faded in a way I honestly did not think my skin was capable of. The overall redness is down. The texture is better. My face looks the best it has looked since I was in the womb. \n\nll also give credit where it’s due: spironolactone deserves its own mention because hormonal acne has always been part of the picture for me. I’ve been taking spiro since January 2025 and it definitely helped. But, I was also using tret, and for a long time it felt like I was stuck in that frustrating limbo where things were improved but never actually good. Once I stopped the tret and started azelaic acid is when my skin finally cleared up. \n\nSo yes, I am the person who used to slander azelaic acid based on one traumatic product experience and is now here, humbled, with skin that looks like it has been gently edited in real life.\n\nIf anyone else bounced off azelaic acid in the past because one formula felt like it was trying to cauterize you, consider this your reminder that it might not have been the ingredient. It might have been that specific product. Or your timing. Or your barrier. Or your skin just needed you to stop trying to force a relationship with tret that was never going to work.",

I have still managed to get a load of sunspots, a little bit of melasma, and probably some age spots of sorts. I have really uneven skin tone that’s dull and lifeless, enlarged pores on/around my nose and some on my cheeks next to my nose, and I have texture that are in the form of bumps without being pimples/acne. I think they’re keratin filled bumps or something? I really don’t know, I just read about it and I believe that’s what they might be. \n\nMy issues: \n\n1) I’m on a relatively tight budget (The Ordinary is the type of budget I can stick with)\n\n\n2) I need a  short and simple type of skincare routine. I have *horrendous* adhd and genuinely forget to do things or stick to a routine so having less steps in my skincare routine is my best bet. Other than washing my face, having things on my nightstand I can put on when I get in bed at night is ideal. \n\n\n3) I have semi-sensitive skin. Mainly around my T-zone and my cheekbones. If it’s of any help, I am able to handle The Ordinary’s Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Toner. \n\n\n4) I’m not wanting to use steroids or retinols since my skin is sensitive to it. \n\n5) I know it’s unlikely but I’d like to see improvement or at least some life brought back to my face for my sisters wedding I’m part of in April. \n\n\nI hope I covered everything…if I’m missing anything please let me know! Thank you in advance!!\n\n\n\n",

After trimming my beard with a blade one day, when I already had blackheads, I started breaking out.\n\nMy main issue is that I have oily skin. I get blackheads and whiteheads, and they often turn into pus-filled acne.\n\nAfter the breakout, I stopped using everything and started using only Saslic DS and a toner twice a day. Even after that, my skin still gets very oily, especially during office hours, even when I haven’t applied anything. I’m also still breaking out.\n\nI’m confused and worried now. If I’m using Saslic DS twice a day and not applying any moisturizer, can that actually make my skin produce more oil and cause more acne?\n\nAt this point, I honestly don’t know what to follow. I feel lost when it comes to skincare and understanding which products are right for oily, acne-prone skin 😔.\n\nI currently have the following products with me:\n\n\t1.\tSaslic DS 2%\n\n\t2.\tJovees Tea Tree Face Wash (pH 5.5)\n\n\t3.\tJovees Cucumber Toner\n\n\t4.\tPlum Rice Water &amp; Niacinamide 2% Hybrid Sunscreen\n\n\t5.\tDot &amp; Key Cica Calming Oil-Free Moisturiser\n\n\t6.\tBenzoyl Peroxide 2.5%\n\nIf my current products aren’t suitable, please suggest better options and a simple routine. I’d really appreciate guidance on how to understand skincare and what actually helps.\n\nPS - i have been on isotretinoin med years ago and it worked very well but i stopped it as it is steroid.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

I’ve been using the azelaic acid and retinal for a little while, but mostly alternating days or using AA in the morning and retinal at night. I’ve only recently added the peptide serum in and am not sure how/when to use all of these products for maximum efficacy. If anybody has any tips, I’d really appreciate it. I’m also curious about adding a vitamin c serum into the mix (timeless). Would that be a bad idea? TIA!",

This is how my hair looks after I’ve woken up, I just brushed it, nothing else. It doesn’t look soft and healthy so I sometimes put serum in it . I’m not sure how to deal with the style, so I end up tucking it behind my ears. I’ve been using heat protectant spray, then straighteners just to tame the top layer with all the bits that stick out. But what can I do around my face?  It’s easier if I’ve just washed it, then I use a sort of hair dryer thing that sucks up my hair and gives it waves. But it doesn’t work when my hair is dry. Can anyone give me even a small tip on how to style it?  I’m a busy mum, so I’m not gonna commit a lot of time to it, but I’d like to look a bit more put together than I currently do. ",
