I have dry skin but break out very easily from products and anything like oil cleansers or oil based products don't suit my skin well. I like lactic acid but wanted to find something for day time moisture. Hyaluronic acid toner at first was really helpful but now it doesn't do much, if anything I feel drier. I still apply it to a wet face, tap it in and then apply moisturizer. recently tried to add the serum and not much different. Wondering what I can do?? I get recommendations in skincare store (South Korea) and it will do nothing, e.g madecassoside serum or this serum, snail cream.. feels like I'm wasting money :( Anyone have similar issue and found something that helps??",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

It feels tight and even water makes it burn.\n\nI tried a few home remedies, some soothing oils, and kojic acid, but nothing has helped and I think I may have damaged my skin barrier.\n\nCan anyone recommend very gentle, healing products that helped calm irritation and repair the barrier?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated.

      "content": "Hi! The first photo is my hair right after finishing washing and styling from the shower. The second photo is 7 hours later. How can I maintain the definition of the first pic? My hair always seems to lose the wave over time, and I can never keep it overnight no matter what I try. \n\nMy wash routine today was:\n\n1. Shampoo twice with V&amp;Co Wavy Shampoo\n\n2. Condition once with V&amp;Co Wavy Conditioner and scrunch it in\n\n3. Spray NYM Curl Talk leave in conditioner to my ends\n\n4. Run a tiny amount of Prose curl cream (dime sized) through my hair\n\n5. Define sections using a bounce curl brush\n\n6. Ouai wave spray in each section and scrunch it in\n\n7. Run NYM curl talk level 3 gel through my hair and scrunch\n\n8. Scrunch out most of the water with a microfiber towel\n\n8. Plop for 5-10 minutes with a Kitsch microfiber towel\n\n9. Diffuse until mostly dry\n\n10. Once fully dry, scrunch out the (slight) crunch with a little bit of Olaplex #7 oil\n\nThis routine is just not sustainable for me. Between the length of time it takes and the fact that it leaves my hair looking stringy and feeling a bit product-y by the end of the day, it just isn’t suitable long term. My usual routine if I’m styling my hair is 1 (except I only shampoo once usually), 2, 3, 6, 9. Otherwise I air dry and don’t put product in besides the leave in. \n\nAny advice would be really appreciated, TIA!",

      "content": "Hello lovely curly hair subreddit. Not sure if you remember me but I posted a month ago with the most nightmarish knot in my hair that I had ever experienced in my life! I was convinced I would have to cut my hair down to a bob or shorter. \n\nHowever, luckily I didn’t have to. Thanks to you angels! Your advice on how to comb my hair and multiple product suggestions saved my hair. The many comments saying it was going to take awhile to undo the mess stood true but it helped. Before I posted I felt hopeless because I had already put in a day of slowly combing and working through the knot. I did not understand how long, it would actually take. Everyone who advised me to be patience with the process, THANK YOU! \n\nHowever, the experience did not come without a cost. I had to cut/trim 4-5 inches of length from my hair and lost a TON of original volume I had prior to this disaster. But, I am so grateful with the outcome I did receive, and have learned my lesson. I will never go to bed without wrapping my hair again and no matter how busy I am I will find the time to detangle my hair weekly. I vow to never let something like this happen again. \n\nHere is a picture when my hair freshly detangled. It was a mess no product in it. I will be taking these next months to focus on regrowth to bring it back to how I like it but I am so so so grateful for the hair I still have left on my head!\n\nThank you so much for your advice again. This community is amazing!!!\n\nMy Detangling Routine:\n\nI detangled my hair dry misting with water and warm coconut oil. When I got it wet in the shower it seemed to get worse.\n\nI enlisted the help of my boyfriend to help. We got comfortable on the couch and watched movies while he slowly picked away at with. Starting and mainly using a fine tooth thin comb but also a wide tooth comb to loosen things up when needed.\n\nWe used almost an entire bottle of native conditioner (it’s just what we had on hand).\n\nAlso used coconut oil in a spray bottle which I would warm up by setting in hot water for a bit. Also used Cowboy Magic Horse Detangler &amp; Shine. And also used water in a spray bottle just to dampen hair slightly before adding product. We didn’t really depend on wetting the hair to detangle.\n\nThe process so super slow and also painful! My scalp was red afterwards even though he was very gentle. I took Tylenol throughout the process and it definitely helped but the pain was still  present. Make sure to take lots of breaks throughout the process!",

      "content": "Hello everyone! I'm asking for some skincare routine help and critiques. I'm F25 and have been struggling with acne since I was about 8. I've never really known exactly what to do with my skin, but I've been experimenting since about 2020 trying to find the right combination of things and can't figure it out. I have acne on my face, neck, chest, upper stomach, and my shoulders and entire back (upper back only pictured but you get the idea). I've attached pictures to help get an idea of what we're working with. \n\nI have not been to a dermatologist (I would love to be able to go one day, but I've been poor all my life and lived in a very rural area with little miscellaneous medical access like that up until I was about 20) but I currently cannot afford the visit so I am trying to make due with what I can. Birth control and accutane is also not currently on the table for me (although I've always wanted to do accutane and just clear it all up). \n\nHere is my routine currently: \n\nShower 1x daily in the PM \n\n\\- CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser on face and neck \n\n\\- PanOxyl 10% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Treatment Bar on chest, shoulders, neck, and back \n\nAfter shower, with clean hands: \n\n\\- PanOxyl clarifying liquid exfoliant 2% SA, BHA on face and neck \n\n\\- PanOxyl Banishing Body Spray 2% SA, with niacinamide, vitamin c, witch hazel, aloe on chest, shoulders and back \n\n\\- Vitamin and Sea Beauty smoothing face serum, blue sea kale niacinamide on face, neck, chest, shoulders, upper back \n\n\\- Finally, CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion for normal skin\n\nAM routine: N/A\n\nI currently wear no makeup whatsoever unless it's an extremely special occasion (averaging maybe 10 times a year or less, total). Even then it's just spot concealer, blush, a little powder, and eye makeup. My extremely rough and bumpy skin texture is exasperated by foundation so I've stopped wearing any. \n\nMy skin feels simultaneously very dry (it's visibly flaky, comes off in scales, feels tight) and extremely oily (wake up to an oil field worthy of US invasion and continue to get oily throughout the day). I'm planning to switch the CeraVe SA shower cleanser to the moisturizing version for dry skin as soon as my current bottle runs out, but other than that I don't know what to do. \n\nI have a LOT of scarring and hyperpigmentation, and now I'm also beginning to develop ice-pick scars and pock marks in my cheeks and nose. I have a lot of black heads in my nose and chin and on my neck and chest. My skin is always vaguely itchy, especially on my cheeks, forehead and neck. \n\nI've drastically reduced sugary drink and milk consumption and live mostly on water and some Gatorade (baby steps). I don't eat a lot because of some crazy GI stuff so I wouldn't know what to change there because I exist on a handful of safe foods. \n\nI'm graduating undergrad in May and would like to clear up my skin enough to finally feel comfortable enough to maybe take some graduation pictures and wear a cute dress for my ceremony. I've never felt comfortable enough in my skin to wear a bikini or a tanktop or even a nice dress if it isn't a turtleneck. :( \n\nAny advice is very much appreciated! Thank you! ",
