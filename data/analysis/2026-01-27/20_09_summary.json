      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is Part 2 / update to my [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/1pn678r/i_emailed_indian_sunscreen_brands_asking_for_iso/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) where I mentioned reaching out to sunscreen brands to verify their SPF, UVA, and water-resistance claims.\n\nI waited over a month before posting this update so brands had sufficient time to respond. Below is a factual summary of what I asked and what I received.\n\n**What I requested (same from all brands):**  \nISO 24444: SPF in-vivo test report (with lab name &amp; accreditation)  \nISO 24442 or ISO 24443: UVA protection test report (with numerical UVA-PF / critical wavelength data)  \nWater resistance testing (WR40 / WR80), if applicable\n\n# Responses after ~1 month\n\n# 🟢 High transparency\n\n**Re’equil**\n\n→ Shared full ISO 24444 SPF report, UVA data, and water-resistance testing (WR40/WR80).\n\n→ Detailed documentation provided.\n\n# 🟡 Partial transparency\n\n**The Derma Co (Honasa)**\n\n→ Directed to a publicly available “Certificate of Sunscreen Efficacy Testing” on their product page.\n\n→ Certificate confirms: In-vivo SPF testing as per ISO 24444:2019 (SPF ≈ 50) In-vitro UVA assessment (critical wavelength ≈ 379 nm)\n\n→ Full test reports and water-resistance data were not shared.\n\n**Minimalist**\n\n→ Shared ISO 24444 in-vivo SPF report.\n\n→ When asked specifically for water-resistance testing (WR40/WR80 or ISO 16217/18861) to support their “80-minute water resistance” claim, the request was escalated but no documentation was shared even after 1+ month.\n\n**La Shield (Glenmark)**\n\n→ Shared numerical SPF/UVA values via email.\n\n→ No test date, full methodology, or lab accreditation details were shared\n\n# 🔴 No data shared (after 30+ days)\n\nThe following brands acknowledged the request, raised tickets, or said they would revert, but did not share any SPF/UVA/WR documentation even after 30+ days:\n\n* Aqualogica\n* Conscious Chemist\n* Brinton (UV Doux)\n* IPCA (Acne UV Gel)\n* Blynds\n* Photostable\n* Episoft\n\nFor this update, lack of response after 30+ days (despite tickets or acknowledgements) has been treated as an outcome, not a pending state.\n\n**Scope note:** Brands listed were selected based on products frequently mentioned on this sub and those I personally used or see recommended. This is not an exhaustive list of all Indian sunscreens.\n\n***Edit:*** *A few people suggested emailing additional brands. I won’t be expanding the scope further at this point, this update reflects only the brands I had already contacted and responses received within a fixed time window. I may revisit this in the future, but not right now.*",

It's getting closer, but I've been really struggling with curl definition and frizz (thanks, Texas humidity!), but I switched up my routine a bit on yesterday's wash day and I've got the best results so far! Any other tips for fighting frizz are welcome!\n\nRoutine:\n1. Wash with Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration (I clarified last week)\n2. Garnier Hair Filler + Bonding for 5 minutes (new)\n3. Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration conditioner and detangle\n4. While still in shower and hair is dripping wet, apply Aussie Sprunch mousse + leave-in conditioner \n5. Shake head so hair isn't dripping, but still really wet to get out of shower (new)\n6. Apply small amount of Lush Super Milk (not really enough to do anything, I just like the smell 😁)\n7. Section top of hair into two sections and apply Ouidad Advanced Climate Control strong hold gel generously \n8. Brush through and style with Denman brush\n9. Scrunch out excess water with microfiber towel\n10. Apply a light layer of watered down gel \n11. Spray EVA NYC Shapeshifter hair spray (newish- I've done this a few times)\n12. Hover diffuse on low speed and low heat until 60% dry, then air dry the rest of the way (new, as I had been diffusing until 100% dry, which I don't think my hair liked)\n13. Slept in satin bonnet then shook hair at the roots this morning and sprayed a little water and did a dry SOTC\n\nEdit: added step 11 that I forgot",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I don't cleanse in the morning, just water.\n\nBelow is my routine for AM and PM.\n\nI am thinking of adding BYOMA milky toner, as a couple people have suggested I try.\n\nAM\n\n* Wash my face with Water\n* COSRX The 6 Peptide Skin Booster Serum\n* TO Hyaluronic Acid\n* Tatcha Dewy Cream Moisturizer\n* Then later on, I will put on CeraVe SPF 30\n\n# \n\nPM ( It rotates)\n\n5 Nights a week I do...\n\n* Wash with Glow Recipe Avacado Cleanser\n* Estee Lauder ANR\n* TO Niacinamide\n* YTTP Superberry Hydrate + Glow Dream Night Cream\n\nThen 2 Nights a week I use TO 1% Retinol in Squlance and YTTP Night Cream\n\nMy Question is. What would adding the BYOMA Milky Toner to my morning routine help with? Or would it make much of a difference based on my current routine?\n\nI would thinking of taking out the TO Hyaluronic acid in the morning (there is already lots in the COSRC and TATCHA), and starting my morning routine with BYOMA Milky Toner.\n\nI would love to simplify things more, so I though it would be nice to just use the Milky Toner, then COSRCX, then Moisturize in the morning.\n\nThoughts? Advice?\n\nThanks so much!",

      "content": "Hello, I hope everyone is doing well.\n\nMy post is about the title. I am growing my hair out. To start giving you some context, I have low porosity, medium thickness, and medium to high density (please correct me if I'm wrong, haha). Finally, I have loose curls, meaning 3A (again, correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nAlso, sometimes I don't know how to style it, and sometimes it's curlier and other times it's not. There are times when my curls are very flat. I would like it to be curlier and, as I mentioned in the title, for the curls to stay.\n\nMy routine is as follows: first of all, I use Ponto's curly hair shampoo, and as a conditioner, I also use Ponto's 3-in-1 Hydration Treatment. For styling, I start by detangling my hair with a wide-tooth comb (obviously very wet). For products, I use Ponto's Wavy/Frizzy Hair Styling Cream, and I apply it using the hands-in-prayer method and then scrunch. Finally, I use the gel from the same brand, Ponto, called Recover your curls(I apply a very small amount of this).\n\nI usually air dry my hair. I have a diffuser, but due to time constraints, I only use it for 10 minutes at most. To protect my hair while I sleep, I don't really use anything, and I don't usually do a refresh routine. If you can recommend one, I'd appreciate it.\n\nWhat should I do? Try other products? I've heard that it's good to use a clarifying shampoo, but if you could confirm whether that's true, that would be great. I've never had layers cut either, so I don't know if I should try it. Someone also recommended curl foam instead of gel.\n\nI would really appreciate your help with my questions. Any advice would be welcome.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I also have buzzed twice between the years\n\nNothings changed much from my routine throughout the years, I’ve tried some light product but I don’t like how my hair sits with it, but if anybody knows general advice or a routine to get my hair to how it used to look, that’d be great, specifically I’d kill to have my hair look like this, it’s my ideal hair style:\n\n\n\n[https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSamrR8R2/](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSamrR8R2/)",

When I couldn’t handle it anymore and stopped using it my skin stayed clean ish until recent years. After that I cut all actives and started prioritizing my skin barrier (All I use is the La Roche Posay Toleriane dermo cleaner and the ATOBARRIER365 Cream Moisturizer) This works well for me keeping my skin moisturizer and clear elsewhere but the forehead bumps stay.\n\nA couple months ago I bought the Dermalogica Daily Milkfoliant because I read it could be from not exfoliating. I thought it was be gentle enough but it ended up breaking my skin barrier. Since the i’ve just been repairing my barrier and not sure where to go from here. Any suggestions would be appreciated! ",

      "content": "For context I have naturally dry/sensitive skin and I’m 22 y/o. I would like some product recommendations too but note I’m not willing to spend like 100 bucks on one cream and also I’m in Canada so I might not have the same access to some products. I’ve cut out chips, soda, really processed foods for a while now, and while I’d say my diet is not perfect it’s better than most people’s. My skin has definitely improved than how it was years ago.\n\nFor over 2 years now I’ve been putting CereVe Moisturizing cream on my face daily after I have my morning shower. I believe it’s helped me so far but there’s more I could do. I still get acne occasionally but it’s not that bad compared to others. I do have these bumps which could be acne(?)\n\nI honestly don’t know if these would be considered pimples cause I don’t really think you can pop them. They seem kinda baked in there if that makes any sense. It’s mostly on my forehead but it’s also a little bit to both sides of my nose.\n\nA while ago I tried CereVe’s hydrating cleanser but it actually dried out my skin to the point where it was red and painful, so I stopped and just stuck with the moisturizer.\n\nFor my body I’ve been putting no-scent Lubriderm for probably year or so and have only seen good results. I used to put the the same CereVe I’m using on my face for my body, but I noticed that was causing some acne on my arms and chest, so I switched to the Lubriderm and it went away.\n\nI’m looking for something to add to my routine or maybe a better product recommendation for addressing the bumps and dryness. I don’t have a night routine either even though I really should, so some recommendations for that would be a great help. Also kinda unrelated but if anyone has products that might address dark circles around the eyes that would be great too. I know sleep, sun and water consumption works best for that but if anyone’s tried anything that could help I’d like to know.\n\nThis stuff is so hard I just want nice clear skin plz lol.\n\nThanks :)",

It feels tight and even water makes it burn.\n\nI tried a few home remedies, some soothing oils, and kojic acid, but nothing has helped and I think I may have damaged my skin barrier.\n\nCan anyone recommend very gentle, healing products that helped calm irritation and repair the barrier?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated.

For those who've used or considered at-home IPL devices:\n\n1) How do you decide whether a tool is worth keeping long-term versus skipping? \n\n2) Do you treat hair removal tools as part of your beauty routine, or as something completely separate? \n\n3) Do you find consistency with basics (skincare, haircare, grooming) matters more than adding devices? Not looking for product links, buying advice, or promotions just interested in experience-based perspectives and how others evaluate tools versus keeping routines simple.",
