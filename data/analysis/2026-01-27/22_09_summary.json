      "title": "Update (Part 2): I emailed Indian sunscreen brands asking for ISO reports; outcomes after 30+ days",
      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is Part 2 / update to my [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/1pn678r/i_emailed_indian_sunscreen_brands_asking_for_iso/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) where I mentioned reaching out to sunscreen brands to verify their SPF, UVA, and water-resistance claims.\n\nI waited over a month before posting this update so brands had sufficient time to respond. Below is a factual summary of what I asked and what I received.\n\n**What I requested (same from all brands):**  \nISO 24444: SPF in-vivo test report (with lab name &amp; accreditation)  \nISO 24442 or ISO 24443: UVA protection test report (with numerical UVA-PF / critical wavelength data)  \nWater resistance testing (WR40 / WR80), if applicable\n\n# Responses after ~1 month\n\n# 🟢 High transparency\n\n**Re’equil**\n\n→ Shared full ISO 24444 SPF report, UVA data, and water-resistance testing (WR40/WR80).\n\n→ Detailed documentation provided.\n\n# 🟡 Partial transparency\n\n**The Derma Co (Honasa)**\n\n→ Directed to a publicly available “Certificate of Sunscreen Efficacy Testing” on their product page.\n\n→ Certificate confirms: In-vivo SPF testing as per ISO 24444:2019 (SPF ≈ 50) In-vitro UVA assessment (critical wavelength ≈ 379 nm)\n\n→ Full test reports and water-resistance data were not shared.\n\n**Minimalist**\n\n→ Shared ISO 24444 in-vivo SPF report.\n\n→ When asked specifically for water-resistance testing (WR40/WR80 or ISO 16217/18861) to support their “80-minute water resistance” claim, the request was escalated but no documentation was shared even after 1+ month.\n\n**La Shield (Glenmark)**\n\n→ Shared numerical SPF/UVA values via email.\n\n→ No test date, full methodology, or lab accreditation details were shared\n\n# 🔴 No data shared (after 30+ days)\n\nThe following brands acknowledged the request, raised tickets, or said they would revert, but did not share any SPF/UVA/WR documentation even after 30+ days:\n\n* Aqualogica\n* Conscious Chemist\n* Brinton (UV Doux)\n* IPCA (Acne UV Gel)\n* Blynds\n* Photostable\n* Episoft\n\nFor this update, lack of response after 30+ days (despite tickets or acknowledgements) has been treated as an outcome, not a pending state.\n\n**Scope note:** Brands listed were selected based on products frequently mentioned on this sub and those I personally used or see recommended. This is not an exhaustive list of all Indian sunscreens.\n\n***Edit:*** *A few people suggested emailing additional brands. I won’t be expanding the scope further at this point, this update reflects only the brands I had already contacted and responses received within a fixed time window. I may revisit this in the future, but not right now.*",

      "content": "After coming from a very short pixie cut, I decided to grow my hair into a longer pixie to embrace my curls. (Think Julia Garner in Weapons.) It's getting closer, but I've been really struggling with curl definition and frizz (thanks, Texas humidity!), but I switched up my routine a bit on yesterday's wash day and I've got the best results so far! Any other tips for fighting frizz are welcome!\n\nRoutine:\n1. Wash with Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration (I clarified last week)\n2. Garnier Hair Filler + Bonding for 5 minutes (new)\n3. Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration conditioner and detangle\n4. While still in shower and hair is dripping wet, apply Aussie Sprunch mousse + leave-in conditioner \n5. Shake head so hair isn't dripping, but still really wet to get out of shower (new)\n6. Apply small amount of Lush Super Milk (not really enough to do anything, I just like the smell 😁)\n7. Section top of hair into two sections and apply Ouidad Advanced Climate Control strong hold gel generously \n8. Brush through and style with Denman brush\n9. Scrunch out excess water with microfiber towel\n10. Apply a light layer of watered down gel \n11. Spray EVA NYC Shapeshifter hair spray (newish- I've done this a few times)\n12. Hover diffuse on low speed and low heat until 60% dry, then air dry the rest of the way (new, as I had been diffusing until 100% dry, which I don't think my hair liked)\n13. Slept in satin bonnet then shook hair at the roots this morning and sprayed a little water and did a dry SOTC\n\nEdit: added step 11 that I forgot",

My health was failing. I was deeply ashamed and terrified.\n\nThat’s when wearing the bandana became a constant, because I didnt recognize myself anymore.\n\nWhat many people don’t know is that my hair didn’t start improving until about a year and a half ago, when I finally began healing for real and started treatment with dutasteride and minoxidil.\n\nToday, for the first time, I’m ready to show you my hair regrowth progress 😄\n\nBut this goes so much deeper than hair.\n\nMy liver went from 40% function to normal.\n\nMy blood pressure is normal for the first time in 10 years.\n\nA body I thought was permanently damaged is healing.\n\nIf you’re struggling right now physically, mentally, or with addiction, please hear this.\n\n✨ Your body wants to heal. You are not broken. And you are not alone. ✨\n\nI am endlessly grateful to be alive, sober, and here with you today.\n\nI love you all so much, my friends.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Hi! I’m having a hard time figuring out how to manage my hair and would really appreciate some advice.\n\nMy curl pattern is really mixed. The underneath and lower back sections of my hair are around 2C/3A, but the top layer is more like 2B. After a few days, the top section falls flat and almost straight, while the bottom stays wavy/curly. It makes my hair look uneven — like it’s big and frizzy on top but curlier underneath — instead of defined and put together.  I'm not sure if its because it flattens when I sleep or if I need a bonnet, but i dont think my hair is curly enough to need that?\n\nAnother big issue is dryness. My hair always *feels* dry and kind of rough, even though I deep condition and use oils. It only feels properly moisturised when it’s soaking wet, and once it dries, or even gets damp, that dry/frizzy texture comes back.\n\nI’d love advice on things like:\n\n* how to style a mixed curl pattern, especially getting the top layer to hold waves/curls longer\n* how to stop the crown from going flat\n* why my hair still feels dry even after conditioning and oil\n* any product recommendations for moisture and frizz control (leave-ins, creams, gels, etc.)\n* Any styling tips for wavy hair, I can only really find stuff for curly hair and I'm not sure if it would still work for me?\n\nTysm! I feel like I’m constantly fighting my hair every wash day 😭😭😭\n\nRoutine:\n\n* Oil ends with coconut oil for an hour before shower\n* double cleanse with aussie curly shampoo\n* aussie curly deep conditioner\n* aussie curl hair oil\n* (I dont really style it too much, i just scrunch and air dry as i dont really know how)\n\nP.s. I'll be honest and say I'm still pretty new to this whole curly hair stuff and i can't really afford high end products, so any help at all would be appreciated, whether its styling sleep protection, products or just tips and tricks!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi everyone, i need your advice! I've been using Kiehl's \"Ultra Pure High-Potency Serum Hyaluronic Acid\" ([https://www.kiehls.at/gesicht/produkttyp/serum-gesichtsol/ultra-pure-high-potency-serum-1.5--hyaluronic-acid/WW0238KIE.html](https://www.kiehls.at/gesicht/produkttyp/serum-gesichtsol/ultra-pure-high-potency-serum-1.5--hyaluronic-acid/WW0238KIE.html)), because it was recomended to me in the store. I've been using it for ca 2-3 months, and it's starting to get empty. I like the product, and feel like it's helping a bit. I also just like the feel of applying it and doing my small \"skincare\" routine in the evening (i don't really use so much else, other than a BHA and moisturizer).\n\nIt's veeeery pricey, and I am looking into the possibilities of changing to another brand. I've been looking at The Ordinary and The Inkey List, but have been finding different opinions, and also people saying that it breaks them out or pills off. My skin isn't really very sensitive or acne-prone, but it would be nice to not add anything that would affect my skin negatively. Would anyone want to share their experiences with these brands, or recommend other brands that might go under the radar? Thank you so much!",

      "content": "Hello, I hope everyone is doing well.\n\nMy post is about the title. I am growing my hair out. To start giving you some context, I have low porosity, medium thickness, and medium to high density (please correct me if I'm wrong, haha). Finally, I have loose curls, meaning 3A (again, correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nAlso, sometimes I don't know how to style it, and sometimes it's curlier and other times it's not. There are times when my curls are very flat. I would like it to be curlier and, as I mentioned in the title, for the curls to stay.\n\nMy routine is as follows: first of all, I use Ponto's curly hair shampoo, and as a conditioner, I also use Ponto's 3-in-1 Hydration Treatment. For styling, I start by detangling my hair with a wide-tooth comb (obviously very wet). For products, I use Ponto's Wavy/Frizzy Hair Styling Cream, and I apply it using the hands-in-prayer method and then scrunch. Finally, I use the gel from the same brand, Ponto, called Recover your curls(I apply a very small amount of this).\n\nI usually air dry my hair. I have a diffuser, but due to time constraints, I only use it for 10 minutes at most. To protect my hair while I sleep, I don't really use anything, and I don't usually do a refresh routine. If you can recommend one, I'd appreciate it.\n\nWhat should I do? Try other products? I've heard that it's good to use a clarifying shampoo, but if you could confirm whether that's true, that would be great. I've never had layers cut either, so I don't know if I should try it. Someone also recommended curl foam instead of gel.\n\nI would really appreciate your help with my questions. Any advice would be welcome.",

      "content": "hi y'all! recently i purchased a new shampoo and i was wondering if it was safe to use regularly, if i should use it only sometimes or if i shouldn't use it at all. (picture of the shampoo ingredients included).\n\ni was thinking it might be clarifying as it has both sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate, but i also saw it contains dimethiconol... i'm unsure if this is similar to dimethicone? i purchased it to use regularly as i tend to put products on my hair (curl cream, hair gel, mousse + hair oil) and i don't want my hair to look greasy or weighed down and i want to get rid of product build up from the get go, but i'm afraid that by using it regularly i might be drying out my hair, causing frizz or damaging it.\n\npardon the frizzy (day 4) hair! i tried to refresh it and did it wrong lmao, it normally doesn't look this frizzy on day 4 but i'm planning on washing tomorrow as i recently purchased a new bonnet (the other one was too big for me... might use that one when i have more hair as i want to grow it out a lot more) and it's getting here tomorrow as well! i'm low porosity, and i believe medium to high density and medium texture.\n\nmy routine (sorry if some of the ingredients are in spanish, i'm not a chemist and idk how to translate the ingredients to english and could only find them in spanish):\n\n* i wait for all my hair to get wet, then i wash my scalp with the *herbal essences anti-frizz lavender &amp; almond oil shampoo* (ingredients on first picture), using only my fingers. i apply most product to the back of my scalp, some to the sides, and then the rest to the front. i then rinse it out, and i repeat this step twice.\n* i put the *herbal essences anti-frizz lavender &amp; almond oil conditioner* on my mids and ends and let it sit there for 5-15 minutes (i'm trying to squish-to-condish and i think i'm doing it right?), i detangle with the conditioner still on using a wet brush, starting from the ends and then moving up towards the roots, after i'm finished with detangling i rinse the conditioner out.\n   * **CONDITIONER INGREDIENTS:** Aqua, Stearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Parfum, Benzyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Disodium Edta, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citric Acid, Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool, Citronellol, Benzyl Salicylate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Citral, Lavandula Angustifolia Flower Extract, Benzyl Benzoate, Coumarin, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.\n* after finishing that, i make sure my hair is pretty wet to add more products. i section my hair and apply curl cream, specifically the *herbal essences defined curls &amp; anti-frizz curl cream*, and after i'm done putting it on my mids and ends (+ the bangs) via raking and using the praying hands method, then i scrunch.\n   * **CURL CREAM INGREDIENTS:** Agua, Dimethicone, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Quaternium-18, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sorbitan Caprylate, Benzyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Parfum, Peg-2m, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oleyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Citric Acid, Polysorbate 60, Hexyl Cinnamal, Zea Mays Silk Extract, Prunus Serotina Fruit Extract, Orchis Mascula Flower Extract.\n* i section my hair again, and i apply mousse on my roots and ends, scrunching it into my hair. i used the *aqua net perfect curls mousse*, but this next wash way i'm switching it up to the *herbal essences curly hair mousse* as i don't feel like the aqua net mousse makes my hair look as voluminous as i would like it to be... and back when i started on my curly hair journey i used the *herbal essences perfect waves mousse* and i felt like it made my hair look good, so i thought of switching back to their products but this time using one meant for curly hair.\n   * **CURRENT MOUSSE INGREDIENTS:** Aqua, Isobutane, Propane, Polyquaternium-4, Cetet 10, Copolímero de Octacrilamida / Acrilato / Butilaminoetil Metacrilato, DMDM Hidantoína, PEG-40 Aceite de Castor Hidrogenado, Dimethicone, Fragancia, Lauret-4, Aminometil Propanol, Ácido cítrico y Extracto de Cacao Theobroma.\n   * **FUTURE MOUSSE INGREDIENTS:** Aqua, Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Polyquaternium-11, Polyquaternium-4, Phenoxyethanol, Laureth-23, Isoceteth-20, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Peg/Ppg-18/18 Dimethicone, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal.\n* finally, i section for the final time, brush through my hair using an old brush that looks like a denman brush (unsure as to what brush it actually is, but it's pretty much a 9 row denman brush, picture attached as well). after brush styling it, i apply the *xtreme lady gel* using the praying hands method and then scrunching. i'm thinking of switching this up a little and applying the gel before i brush through because it might be easier for me? idk.\n   * **GEL INGREDIENTS:** Aqua (Water, Eau), Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylic Acid, Parfum (Fragance), Tetrasodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Chitosan Succinamide, Polyquatemium-10, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Geraniol, Methoxycinnamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Pantenol, Ext. Violet 2 (CI 60730), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice.\n* after ALL THAT, i diffuse my hair! i use medium heat and high speed because i just don't have the time to diffuse all my hair... it normally takes me TOO LONG if i diffuse on medium speed so... i hover diffuse my roots while switching up my head position (upside down, sides, leaning back...), then begin hover diffusing my ends and mids after my roots have dried up a little. after my roots are pretty dry i press the diffuser up to my roots and move it in a circular motion slightly to get more volume. when i feel a cast is at least somewhat formed i begin cup diffusing and scrunching my hair slightly. i keep doing that until my hair is all dry.\n* i don't usually break the cast, as i go to sleep with it on. i tie my hair up in a loose pineapple bun and i put on my bonnet (i use the *xl kitsch bonnet* but i'm switching it up to the *yanibest silk bonnet* in size large because the kitsch bonnet is currently too big for my hair).\n* when i wake up i use the *ogx renewing argan oil of morocco extra penetrating oil*, (i used to use the *kerashine silica pretherapy argan treatment*, but i switched two days ago as i felt it didn't do anything to tame the frizz and i had finally run out), i do the prayer hands method through the mids and ends of my hair, and then i fluff out my roots gently using my fingers!\n\ni believe that is everything... i don't usually refresh, as when i try i tend to do it wrong and haven't gotten the hang of how to refresh lmao.",

I’m not even sure if it’s closed comedones, fungal or something else?\n\nAround 2022 I was using the La Roche Posay Effaclar duo which did clear my forehead but left me my skin tight and flaky. When I couldn’t handle it anymore and stopped using it my skin stayed clean ish until recent years. After that I cut all actives and started prioritizing my skin barrier (All I use is the La Roche Posay Toleriane dermo cleaner and the ATOBARRIER365 Cream Moisturizer) This works well for me keeping my skin moisturizer and clear elsewhere but the forehead bumps stay.\n\nA couple months ago I bought the Dermalogica Daily Milkfoliant because I read it could be from not exfoliating. I thought it was be gentle enough but it ended up breaking my skin barrier. Since the i’ve just been repairing my barrier and not sure where to go from here. Any suggestions would be appreciated! ",

I've tried to figure out my curl type but every chart looks different to me and there are so many different products and routines and styles, it's just so much!\n\nPictured here is my hair when wet after just scrunching and standard non-curly product (regular tresemme shampoo and conditioner), which is my standard routine due to the time and money it saves. \n\n\nNo matter what I do, it'll look like this wet, but dry plain! I've tried a diffuser and that didn't seem to make a difference - and took AGES!! Most recently I've tried Being Haircare's defining shampoo and condition for \"all curl types\" with not much luck when it dries.
