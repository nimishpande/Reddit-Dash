      "content": "Hello lovely curly hair subreddit. Not sure if you remember me but I posted a month ago with the most nightmarish knot in my hair that I had ever experienced in my life! I was convinced I would have to cut my hair down to a bob or shorter. \n\nHowever, luckily I didn’t have to. Thanks to you angels! Your advice on how to comb my hair and multiple product suggestions saved my hair. The many comments saying it was going to take awhile to undo the mess stood true but it helped. Before I posted I felt hopeless because I had already put in a day of slowly combing and working through the knot. I did not understand how long, it would actually take. Everyone who advised me to be patience with the process, THANK YOU! \n\nHowever, the experience did not come without a cost. I had to cut/trim 4-5 inches of length from my hair and lost a TON of original volume I had prior to this disaster. But, I am so grateful with the outcome I did receive, and have learned my lesson. I will never go to bed without wrapping my hair again and no matter how busy I am I will find the time to detangle my hair weekly. I vow to never let something like this happen again. \n\nHere is a picture when my hair freshly detangled. It was a mess no product in it. I will be taking these next months to focus on regrowth to bring it back to how I like it but I am so so so grateful for the hair I still have left on my head!\n\nThank you so much for your advice again. This community is amazing!!!\n\nMy Detangling Routine:\n\nI detangled my hair dry misting with water and warm coconut oil. When I got it wet in the shower it seemed to get worse.\n\nI enlisted the help of my boyfriend to help. We got comfortable on the couch and watched movies while he slowly picked away at with. Starting and mainly using a fine tooth thin comb but also a wide tooth comb to loosen things up when needed.\n\nWe used almost an entire bottle of native conditioner (it’s just what we had on hand).\n\nAlso used coconut oil in a spray bottle which I would warm up by setting in hot water for a bit. Also used Cowboy Magic Horse Detangler &amp; Shine. And also used water in a spray bottle just to dampen hair slightly before adding product. We didn’t really depend on wetting the hair to detangle.\n\nThe process so super slow and also painful! My scalp was red afterwards even though he was very gentle. I took Tylenol throughout the process and it definitely helped but the pain was still  present. Make sure to take lots of breaks throughout the process!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

My skin is just so bad &amp; I really don’t know what to do. I cannot afford to see a derm either right now. I am on birth control (pill) as well &amp; believe I have sensitive skin.\n\nHere’s a little breakdown:\n\n\\- Past couple years, I’ve been getting sebaceous cysts behind/near my ears. I did see a derm for this and they said it just happens for some. My last one was almost two months ago &amp; there’s still a bump under my ear &amp; a red dot. I had one in October on my temple and it took 2 months to go down but there is a red dot now also\n\n\\- I only wash my face with water \n\n\\- I thought I had dry skin around my nose/eyebrows because for the past few months, I’ve been getting super flaky skin there so I’ve been using Cerave daily moisturizer after I shower for maybe a month now. I apply around my eyebrows, in between, nose, and sides of nose/cheeks, and chin &amp; honestly, I don’t see a whole difference.\n\n\\- I have so many bumps on my forehead from acne\n\n\\- I get a crazy amount of small pimples around my nostrils and lips\n\n\\- As I’m typing, the redness/acne around my nose is brand new &amp; it wasn’t like this earlier\n\nI’m feeling so bad about this right now, I want to cry. I never thought I’d be dealing with this in my 20s and I especially feel like I’m in my teens again with not knowing what to do about it. Any advice? Product suggestions? Routine suggestions? Anything is helpful right now.",

      "title": "[Routine Help] HELP! Forehead breakout :(",
      "content": "Hi everyone! I’ve been struggling with forehead breakouts that just will. not. go. away. and it’s honestly sending me spiraling because I’ve always had super clear skin. These aren’t poppable pimples either...they’re red, inflamed, and mostly under the skin, and they take days to go down. Sometimes I’ll throw a pimple patch on them, but it’s kind of a hit or miss whether it actually pulls anything out. They also sometimes show up in little clusters of 2–3 right next to each other. IDK, it’s so whacky and I’ve never experienced anything like this on my forehead before.\n\nQuick backstory for context: I was on birth control for basically forever, since high school and now that I’m in my early 30s, I decided to come off of it because I just didn’t feel great about being on it for that long (plus other reasons). I know BC helped a lot with hormonal acne, and now that I’ve been off of it for about 4 months, I’ve definitely noticed an uptick in breakouts, especially on my forehead.\n\nI’ve also been on spironolactone 50 mg since starting BC in high school, and because of these forehead breakouts, I went to my derm and asked about increasing my dose. They bumped me up to 100 mg and also prescribed tret to see if that would help, but so far I haven’t seen any improvement for my forehead at least. I know it can take a few months to see changes with an increased spiro dose, so I’m trying to be patient.\n\nThat said… I’m kind of reaching my breaking point lol. I know my hormones are probably still regulating after being on BC for so many years, but this is really testing me. I’ve attached some pictures of my forehead breakout for reference. Below is my current skincare routine — any insight, advice, or similar experiences would be super appreciated:\n\n**AM skincare routine:**\n\n1. Wash face with cold water\n2.

I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist so I'd love some honest opinions. \n\nI have blonde hair with lots of natural sun-made highlights already, so the stylist suggested we go with high-lift color instead of the traditional bleach/toner/etc. My hair is naturally super fine, tangly, dry and delicate, and i wanted a VERY natural result anyway so it sounded great to me. \n\nI'm actually happy with the amount of lift. It truly just looks like I came back from a 2 week vacation rather than a drastic change.. however I'm questioning the blending. In many spots it just looks like grown out chunky highlights to me, rather than the smooth ombre i expected from baleyage.\n\nThoughts? Is this just what getting baleyage looks like, or is asking for a complimentary fix warranted?",

I applied everything with prayer hands and scrunched it while soaking wet, upside down.\n\nWhen it’s wet and conditioned it has BEAUTIFUL wavy clumps and it overall looks better even now if I spray some water on it but I can’t keep that pretty hydrated look, it dries up, separates and frizzes up like in the photo.\n\nI am looking for any tips you might have to make the waves nicer/more “hydrated looking”. I am also open to an haircut if you guys think it would really help, as long as it can stay long.\n\nThank u &lt;3",

      "content": "Hi so I’m new here and I have a question. When I was a kid no one taught that I had to wash my face, so I never did unless I got something like dirt or some other gunk on it. I would just wet my face in the shower and dry with a clean towel and I had perfect skin. I barely ever had any pimples, maybe one every two weeks and sometimes I’d go a whole month without one. Even when I started puberty I never used any type of soap and it was still pretty close to perfect. I even did high intensity fighting a ports (wrestling, taekwondo, bjj) and on the days I had them I would just rub the water a little more into my face and I never had a problem. I would ( and still do) have slightly higher amount of pimples/acne during the time I did these sports, and during the summer, and anytime I was really stressed, but once again it was never noticeable and extremely manageable.\n\nThen when I was 16 I mentioned off handedly to my stepmom that I never use face-wash and she was appalled, because it was during the wrestling season and she was afraid I would get something from the mat (understandably, because skin infections are very common and spread like wildfire in wrestling). So she gave me her face wash (Cera-Ve for normal to dry skin) to wash with once a day. The first week it was great, I had no pimples and my skin was very soft. But then in the weeks following, I started getting way more pimples on my face; I’d say like 4-5 a week. Which isn’t a lot for many people but it is/was for me. I tried to stop using it after about two months but as soon as I wasn’t using my acne was SO much worse, like 2-3 new ones a day. I came to her with this and she gave me a moisturizer (also from Cera-Ve) to use along with my Face Wash so my skin wouldn’t be so dry. It worked enough to get my pimple frequency back down to maybe 3-4 a week, but it still isn’t how it used to be.\n\nI’m kind of at a loss for what to do because I am a picker so my pimples are always noticeable, and I just wish they would go away. I’ve tried different washing techniques and using different amounts of moisturizer but nothing seems to work. I was thinking of going back to just washing with water and a clean towel, but I still do high intensity fighting sports nearly every day and am afraid of one of getting one of the aforementioned skin infections.\n\nAny advice?",

The past year or so I’ve been having my hair become EXTREMELY greasy on day 3, which obviously isn’t awesome because it would usually last me until day 4-5. I’ve used clarifying shampoo in the past and it seems like it makes it worse, but i’m planning on trying a different brand. Since I’m changing my routine, does anyone have any suggestions for a lightweight shampoo/conditioner? (I also currently use redken heat protectant before each straighten) \n\nThank you in advance!! Also, I’d preferably like something that isn’t going to break the bank. ",

Went to the GP and got Doxycycline (50mg 2x a day). It worked really well, but I developed some gut issue (I also have a past of chronic yeast infection - so long term antibiotic is not ideal for me). \n\nThen I suddenly developed these small pimples on my forehead and temples. They are almost never white heads. Sometimes not even red but I can feel them under my skin. \n\nCould this be fungal? Or bacterial? Could this be hormonal ?\n\nWent back to GP and now I’m taking Akleaf (trifarotene) twice a week. I only started 2 weeks ago so no improvement yet. \n\nAlso should I consider going on accutane ? \n\nMy routine is \n\nAM rinse with water, skin2004 centella ampoule, the ordinary natural moisturizer, beauty of joseon sun screen. \n\nPM the ordinary squalene cleanser, centella ampoule OR akleaf, the ordinary natural moisturizer \n\nThank you for any help/suggestion !!",
