Let’s pray this keeps working!🙏🏽 hair is super thin and see thru when wet but but hair in follicles are showing up! I changed diet as well and supplements.   Never would have known I needed DUT without genetics done.  I did my entire genome.  Really good to see why I have this.  (Older sister does too) feel for all you guys out there.  It’s easier to hide this with a few tape ins and fibers having longer hair.  🥹🙂 hair is naturally gray so I typically dye it every 6 weeks or so, part on the side to cover middle.  I use hair fibers and some color spray when getting ready.  Pics do not have any fibers or spray.   ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hello lovely curly hair subreddit. Not sure if you remember me but I posted a month ago with the most nightmarish knot in my hair that I had ever experienced in my life! I was convinced I would have to cut my hair down to a bob or shorter. \n\nHowever, luckily I didn’t have to. Thanks to you angels! Your advice on how to comb my hair and multiple product suggestions saved my hair. The many comments saying it was going to take awhile to undo the mess stood true but it helped. Before I posted I felt hopeless because I had already put in a day of slowly combing and working through the knot. I did not understand how long, it would actually take. Everyone who advised me to be patience with the process, THANK YOU! \n\nHowever, the experience did not come without a cost. I had to cut/trim 4-5 inches of length from my hair and lost a TON of original volume I had prior to this disaster. But, I am so grateful with the outcome I did receive, and have learned my lesson. I will never go to bed without wrapping my hair again and no matter how busy I am I will find the time to detangle my hair weekly. I vow to never let something like this happen again. \n\nHere is a picture when my hair freshly detangled. It was a mess no product in it. I will be taking these next months to focus on regrowth to bring it back to how I like it but I am so so so grateful for the hair I still have left on my head!\n\nThank you so much for your advice again. This community is amazing!!!\n\nMy Detangling Routine:\n\nI detangled my hair dry misting with water and warm coconut oil. When I got it wet in the shower it seemed to get worse.\n\nI enlisted the help of my boyfriend to help. We got comfortable on the couch and watched movies while he slowly picked away at with. Starting and mainly using a fine tooth thin comb but also a wide tooth comb to loosen things up when needed.\n\nWe used almost an entire bottle of native conditioner (it’s just what we had on hand).\n\nAlso used coconut oil in a spray bottle which I would warm up by setting in hot water for a bit. Also used Cowboy Magic Horse Detangler &amp; Shine. And also used water in a spray bottle just to dampen hair slightly before adding product. We didn’t really depend on wetting the hair to detangle.\n\nThe process so super slow and also painful! My scalp was red afterwards even though he was very gentle. I took Tylenol throughout the process and it definitely helped but the pain was still  present. Make sure to take lots of breaks throughout the process!",

      "content": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI’m pretty new to skincare and the first product I used was the effaclar line from La Roche Posay and the trinamexic acid from Naturium. Now, I don’t have the driest skin and some areas like my forehead and cheeks don’t get too dry so I assumed I had combination skin. Anyway, I used this line for a little over a month and I was seeing some improvements in my skin complexion and it was smoother and I got less acne (though I don’t get much to begin with).\n\nThen I got the glycolic acid from the Ordinary because I wanted to shave and I’ve heard good things about it as an exfoliating toner. I got the big bottle, for a about a week or two I wasn’t paid on time and I ran out of the toner the time before I got paid and went to go get my normal skin care I used the glycolic acid as a substitute (I normally put my toner with my hands). So when I got everything I needed plus buying the glycolic acid again, I started using them both at the same time, which in hindsight was not the best idea and after searching I found out it was pretty harsh and is not meant to be a daily things (in addition to that, I was using cotton balls to put it on) and as I did that I noticed slight burning so I stopped.\n\nNow I just use the effaclar line and I use my hands to put the toner on (it doesn’t burn when I do this) but when I put my moisturiser on it has that same sensation and I don’t know what it might be. Did I mess up too badly? Do I need to switch products? If I do does anyone have any recommendations for more hydrating products which is safe for sensitive skin? I would really appreciate some advice!",

I figured this would be the best group to ask, and apologies if the answers are already out there, but my brain is fried from being sick.\n\nI have had a cold for five days and in an effort to control the dryness of constant tissues and a house with low humidity during a winter storm, I've been applying castor oil, chapstick, and Nakery body butter almost constantly. Staying hydrated even more than usual. Hands and arms are doing great. Face is the Sahara. The castor oil really helped heal my nose from getting rubbed raw, but my face is so dry.\n\nAm I overdoing the lotion? Is there anything I can do? My eyes are watering and every time a tear hits my cheek it burns. I just tried coconut oil after a shower and everything is fine except my face. It burned a bit but not terribly. Thank you for listening.",
