      "title": "Update (Part 2): I emailed Indian sunscreen brands asking for ISO reports; outcomes after 30+ days",
      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is Part 2 / update to my [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/1pn678r/i_emailed_indian_sunscreen_brands_asking_for_iso/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) where I mentioned reaching out to sunscreen brands to verify their SPF, UVA, and water-resistance claims.\n\nI waited over a month before posting this update so brands had sufficient time to respond. Below is a factual summary of what I asked and what I received.\n\n**What I requested (same from all brands):**  \nISO 24444: SPF in-vivo test report (with lab name &amp; accreditation)  \nISO 24442 or ISO 24443: UVA protection test report (with numerical UVA-PF / critical wavelength data)  \nWater resistance testing (WR40 / WR80), if applicable\n\n# Responses after ~1 month\n\n# 🟢 High transparency\n\n**Re’equil**\n\n→ Shared full ISO 24444 SPF report, UVA data, and water-resistance testing (WR40/WR80).\n\n→ Detailed documentation provided.\n\n# 🟡 Partial transparency\n\n**The Derma Co (Honasa)**\n\n→ Directed to a publicly available “Certificate of Sunscreen Efficacy Testing” on their product page.\n\n→ Certificate confirms: In-vivo SPF testing as per ISO 24444:2019 (SPF ≈ 50) In-vitro UVA assessment (critical wavelength ≈ 379 nm)\n\n→ Full test reports and water-resistance data were not shared.\n\n**Minimalist**\n\n→ Shared ISO 24444 in-vivo SPF report.\n\n→ When asked specifically for water-resistance testing (WR40/WR80 or ISO 16217/18861) to support their “80-minute water resistance” claim, the request was escalated but no documentation was shared even after 1+ month.\n\n**La Shield (Glenmark)**\n\n→ Shared numerical SPF/UVA values via email.\n\n→ No test date, full methodology, or lab accreditation details were shared\n\n# 🔴 No data shared (after 30+ days)\n\nThe following brands acknowledged the request, raised tickets, or said they would revert, but did not share any SPF/UVA/WR documentation even after 30+ days:\n\n* Aqualogica\n* Conscious Chemist\n* Brinton (UV Doux)\n* IPCA (Acne UV Gel)\n* Blynds\n* Photostable\n* Episoft\n\nFor this update, lack of response after 30+ days (despite tickets or acknowledgements) has been treated as an outcome, not a pending state.\n\n**Scope note:** Brands listed were selected based on products frequently mentioned on this sub and those I personally used or see recommended. This is not an exhaustive list of all Indian sunscreens.\n\n***Edit:*** *A few people suggested emailing additional brands. I won’t be expanding the scope further at this point, this update reflects only the brands I had already contacted and responses received within a fixed time window. I may revisit this in the future, but not right now.*",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I'm 20FTM who has been on hormones for 8 months, and am struggling with mild to moderate cystic acne that just won't go away without draining (but derms are way too expensive and I don't really have that option). I was prescribed 1% clindamycin phosphate lotion but it didn't really help with existing acne, although it slowed down the number of new cysts. I read that benzoyl peroxide was a good option to treat cystic acne and is also recommended to be used together with clindamycin. I just bought Panoxyl 4% face wash and this is the routine I want to try out:\n\nAM:\n\nRound Lab 1025 Dokdo Cleanser\n\nRED Blemish Clear Soothing Cream\n\nInnisfree Green Tea Hyaluronic Sun Serum\n\nPM:\n\nPanoxyl 4% Acne Creamy Wash\n\n1% Clindamycin Phosphate Lotion\n\nRED Blemish Clear Soothing Cream\n\nIs this ok/too much/inappropriate?

      "content": "Hii everyone, I’m seeking help on this sub reddit because I would like to help my boyfriend with his curls and gift him products to take care of them. \n\nI personally have really straight hair so I don’t know anything about how to take care of his hair and by posting on here I hope you guys could help. \n\nSo I would say his hair corresponds to the 3b ? curly pattern, his hair takes a long time absorbing water and it dries very quickly. He currently uses my shampoo that seems to really work with his curls (from the inecto brand the coconut one if I remember correctly) , his hair is really dry but it is because I need to get him to apply conditioner.\n\nAbout the hair routine based on him I think it needs to be a low effort one, nothing about finger coiling or anything, and I know he does not like the “wet effect” like when hair seems soaked.\n\nI do not think he will do a refresh routine or anything he lets his hair air dry since it takes very little time.\n\nIf I missed anything please let me know so I can provide more information, I just would like product recommendations I know it’s a bit innacurate since there is not picture but I want to keep it as a surprise so I cannot ask him to post anything sorry about that ! \n\nThank you for all the people that may help me I’m very grateful!!",

My hair always seems to lose the wave over time, and I can never keep it overnight no matter what I try. \n\nMy wash routine today was:\n\n1. Shampoo twice with V&amp;Co Wavy Shampoo\n\n2. Condition once with V&amp;Co Wavy Conditioner and scrunch it in\n\n3. Spray NYM Curl Talk leave in conditioner to my ends\n\n4. Run a tiny amount of Prose curl cream (dime sized) through my hair\n\n5. Define sections using a bounce curl brush\n\n6. Ouai wave spray in each section and scrunch it in\n\n7. Run NYM curl talk level 3 gel through my hair and scrunch\n\n8. Scrunch out most of the water with a microfiber towel\n\n8. Plop for 5-10 minutes with a Kitsch microfiber towel\n\n9. Diffuse until mostly dry\n\n10. Once fully dry, scrunch out the (slight) crunch with a little bit of Olaplex #7 oil\n\nThis routine is just not sustainable for me. Between the length of time it takes and the fact that it leaves my hair looking stringy and feeling a bit product-y by the end of the day, it just isn’t suitable long term. My usual routine if I’m styling my hair is 1 (except I only shampoo once usually), 2, 3, 6, 9. Otherwise I air dry and don’t put product in besides the leave in. \n\nAny advice would be really appreciated, TIA!",
