If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

He currently uses my shampoo that seems to really work with his curls (from the inecto brand the coconut one if I remember correctly) , his hair is really dry but it is because I need to get him to apply conditioner.\n\nAbout the hair routine based on him I think it needs to be a low effort one, nothing about finger coiling or anything, and I know he does not like the “wet effect” like when hair seems soaked.\n\nI do not think he will do a refresh routine or anything he lets his hair air dry since it takes very little time.\n\nIf I missed anything please let me know so I can provide more information, I just would like product recommendations I know it’s a bit innacurate since there is not picture but I want to keep it as a surprise so I cannot ask him to post anything sorry about that ! \n\nThank you for all the people that may help me I’m very grateful!!",

Below is a factual summary of what I asked and what I received.\n\n**What I requested (same from all brands):**  \nISO 24444: SPF in-vivo test report (with lab name &amp; accreditation)   \nISO 24442 or ISO 24443: UVA protection test report (with numerical UVA-PF / critical wavelength data)   \nWater resistance testing (WR40 / WR80), if applicable\n\n# Responses after ~1 month\n\n# 🟢 High transparency\n\n**Re’equil**\n\n→ Shared full ISO 24444 SPF report, UVA data, and water-resistance testing (WR40/WR80).\n\n→ Detailed documentation provided.\n\n# 🟡 Partial transparency\n\n**The Derma Co (Honasa)**\n\n→ Directed to a publicly available “Certificate of Sunscreen Efficacy Testing” on their product page.\n\n→ Certificate confirms: In-vivo SPF testing as per ISO 24444:2019 (SPF ≈ 50) In-vitro UVA assessment (critical wavelength ≈ 379 nm)\n\n→ Full test reports and water-resistance data were not shared.\n\n**Minimalist**\n\n→ Shared ISO 24444 in-vivo SPF report.\n\n→ When asked specifically for water-resistance testing (WR40/WR80 or ISO 16217/18861) to support their “80-minute water resistance” claim, the request was escalated but no documentation was shared even after 1+ month.\n\n**La Shield (Glenmark)**\n\n→ Shared numerical SPF/UVA values via email.\n\n→ No test date, full methodology, or lab accreditation details were shared\n\n# 🔴 No data shared (after 30+ days)\n\nThe following brands acknowledged the request, raised tickets, or said they would revert, but did not share any SPF/UVA/WR documentation even after 30+ days:\n\n* Aqualogica\n* Conscious Chemist\n* Brinton (UV Doux)\n* IPCA (Acne UV Gel)\n* Blynds\n* Photostable\n* Episoft\n\nFor this update, lack of response after 30+ days (despite tickets or acknowledgements) has been treated as an outcome, not a pending state.\n\n**Scope note:** Brands listed were selected based on products frequently mentioned on this sub and those I personally used or see recommended. This is not an exhaustive list of all Indian sunscreens.",

My hair always seems to lose the wave over time, and I can never keep it overnight no matter what I try. \n\nMy wash routine today was:\n\n1. Shampoo twice with V&amp;Co Wavy Shampoo\n\n2. Condition once with V&amp;Co Wavy Conditioner and scrunch it in\n\n3. Spray NYM Curl Talk leave in conditioner to my ends\n\n4. Run a tiny amount of Prose curl cream (dime sized) through my hair\n\n5. Define sections using a bounce curl brush\n\n6. Ouai wave spray in each section and scrunch it in\n\n7. Run NYM curl talk level 3 gel through my hair and scrunch\n\n8. Scrunch out most of the water with a microfiber towel\n\n8. Plop for 5-10 minutes with a Kitsch microfiber towel\n\n9. Diffuse until mostly dry\n\n10. Once fully dry, scrunch out the (slight) crunch with a little bit of Olaplex #7 oil\n\nThis routine is just not sustainable for me. Between the length of time it takes and the fact that it leaves my hair looking stringy and feeling a bit product-y by the end of the day, it just isn’t suitable long term. My usual routine if I’m styling my hair is 1 (except I only shampoo once usually), 2, 3, 6, 9. Otherwise I air dry and don’t put product in besides the leave in. \n\nAny advice would be really appreciated, TIA!",
