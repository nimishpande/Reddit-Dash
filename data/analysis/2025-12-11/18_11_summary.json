      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

It is always interesting to see how differently skin can behave based on genetics, environment, age, and lifestyle.\n\nA detailed routine can make sense when each step has a purpose. A minimal routine can make sense when the skin prefers fewer changes. The key is choosing products that support specific concerns instead of grabbing something only because it looked good online or worked well for someone else.\n\nBoth approaches can be valid. The fun part is figuring out what the skin responds to over time.\n\nDrop your routine + results so we can see the difference in preference/what works best for you! ",

Somehow also manages to be frizzy and dry too. Even when i just try to wet it and let it air dry again it gets frizzy unless i get it fully soaked. I got cantu revitalize curls next day spray which i think might help(it was cheap lol). Also diffusing just makes my hair stringy or the curls get crazy, which i think is user error. \n\nAny suggestions? i have to wash my hair so often even when its not greasy because of how ugly it looks but that just makes my hair drier ☹️my hair is pretty fine i wish it would just look presentable i feel like i have a frizzy broom on my head",

      "content": "I’ve been using the Minimalist Salicylic Acid 2% serum for exactly a month now and I honestly think it deserves the hype it gets. Since I have combination acne-prone skin and have used chemical exfoliants before, I wasn't too worried about the purging phase, but I did notice a few tiny bumps surfacing in the first week which cleared up surprisingly fast. The texture is definitely a bit tacky which is something people always complain about, but if you layer it correctly it really isn't a dealbreaker for me. I use it every alternate night and it has controlled my T-zone oiliness so well without making my cheeks feel dry or stretched, plus it definitely calmed down those annoying active pimples way faster than my usual spot treatments. Overall I love this serum. ",

      "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI’m kind of a newbie to skincare. I have a minimal routine, which I’ll share, but it took me a long time to settle on a product line that doesn’t irritate my skin. I have rosacea and dry, very sensitive skin. \n\nProducts: La Roche Posay gentle foaming moisturizing wash, LRP double repair moisturizer, LRP triple repair cream (if I’m feeling extra dry) , Good Molecules hyaluronic acid serum, Elta MD UV Skin Recovery SPF 50\n\nMorning: cleanse, moisturize, sunscreen \n\nNight: cleanse, serum, moisturizer \n\nOnce a month or so I dermaplane, followed by a hydrating mask, serum, and moisturizer. \n\nOk, now on to the purpose of this post. On a whim this week I booked for a professional hydrafacial and dermaplaning appointment. \n\nShe dermaplaned first, and I immediately noticed that my skin felt much better than when I do it at home. Probably because she had some lightweight oil and better tools, but I did like it. \n\nThe hydrafacial felt…gimmicky? It was kind of just a slathering of products that left my face feeling sticky for hours and I washed off in the evening. My face was really burning during the facial too, but she said to expect that since she just dermaplaned. The next day (today) my skin does feel bouncy and smooth though. \n\nSo my question is- what’s the consensus on paying for these professional services? My gut is leaning towards dermaplaning only, because I do really feel like that was a better and safer process than when I do it at home. It’s leaning away from regular hydrafacials, but maybe 1-2x a year just because I did enjoy the process. If hydrafacials aren’t worth it, do y’all have something else you recommend for my skin type?",

I was hoping you guys might be able to clue me in on good products for sensitive combo skin? My current routine is just Round Labs Dokdo cleanser &amp; ilyoon ceramide moisturizer. \n\nI’ve tried using sunscreen daily before but I always end up having clogged pores &amp; I hate the way they feel oily &amp; pill up on my skin.. As for oil cleansers for double cleansing, I’ve only ever tried Anua oil cleanser &amp; although it left my skin soft I think it also caused breakouts.\n\nFor sunscreen, I’ve heard good things about SKIN1004 sunscreen, but they have so many options I’m a bit lost. I’ve added pics of my skin is that helps! \n\nI’m super clueless about oil cleansers but I’d like soemthing light &amp; ideally unscented for my sensitive skin. \n\nThank you guys for any recommendations you might have!! :)",

      "title": "I can't figure out what my hair needs - help!",
      "content": "I have done research on reddit and elsewhere and I still cannot figure out what my hair needs to look and feel better. \n\nI have a mix of 2c, 3a and 3b curls (it is usually more around 3a-3b but bleaching has caused damage to my curls and their patterns), and I think (based on the quiz and information on this sub) I have medium porosity, medium density, medium texture (apologies if I am using the wrong terminology, I am trying to keep it all straight, no pun intended!). \n\nBUT, I think I am probably wrong on some of the above and I can't figure out how best to categorize my hair so I can get the products to make it feel and look better. \n\n5-6 weeks ago, I had a stylist trash my hair. Terrible haircut, terribly highlights -- it looks and feels awful. I have used olaplex no 3, k18, deep conditioning masks, etc. etc., and it still feels dry as a bone and I can barely get a wide tooth comb through it even when it's sopping wet and full of conditioner. \n\nThe weird thing it is doing now that it has never done before, and I have gotten highlights for so many years and it never did this until now is -- it is almost not absorbing water. I can be in the shower for 10 minutes and get out and it almost looks partially dry directly out of the shower (I don't towel dry it or use heat styling ever)?? Nothing I am using makes it feel at all conditioned and it is frizzy and rough and poofy and dry as the desert. \n\nFrom everything online, I am getting more and more confused on what my hair needs to look and feel better. I understand the only true fix is to cut it off and start over, but I have done that so many times and I want to keep growing it so hopefully there is something I can do to make it look and feel at least a little better.\n\nDoes anyone out there have any recommendations or understand what is going on with my hair? It also takes hours upon hours to air dry (I only ever air dry it), but that is not new, only the it doesn't feel like it gets properly saturated is new this awful go round at the salon.\n\nAny and all help is much appreciated! \n\nMy routine is: \n\n1. Cowash in shower, and very sporadically use a chelating shampoo (we have awful city water). Then I use curlsmith or similar conditioner in the shower and comb it through and let it sit until the shower is done and then rinse it out. \n\n2. Leave in conditioner - both cream and spray (it's a 10 and whatever else I am experimenting with). \n\n3. Every couple of days since being bleached, I alternate olaplex and k18 or a deep conditioning treatment. \n\n3. Then I put in curl cream/gel/and or mousse (not your mother's line) when my hair is sopping wet, and plop with a tshirt and let air dry. \n\n4. Once it is fully dry, I fluff it out with some oil at the ends and that's that! ",

Before I came to school, my hair was so healthy, shiny, long, and I had never even seen a split end before. About a month ago I noticed that when I brush my hair, little tiny strands and pieces would break off, and upon inspection I could see strands splitting in to two. I frantically got a haircut and cut off 1-2 inches over thanksgiving when I was home. Within a week of returning, the split ends were back. I apply a leave in conditioner (not your mother’s “way to grow”) after each shower (every 1-2 days) and I sleep with my hair in two braids every night. When I put my hair in braids to sleep I apply Olaplex no 7 bonding oil. \n\nWhy is this happening and what can I do to stop it? ",

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
