      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Since I have combination acne-prone skin and have used chemical exfoliants before, I wasn't too worried about the purging phase, but I did notice a few tiny bumps surfacing in the first week which cleared up surprisingly fast. The texture is definitely a bit tacky which is something people always complain about, but if you layer it correctly it really isn't a dealbreaker for me. I use it every alternate night and it has controlled my T-zone oiliness so well without making my cheeks feel dry or stretched, plus it definitely calmed down those annoying active pimples way faster than my usual spot treatments. Overall I love this serum. ",

      "content": "I am at a loss with what to do with my skin. After years of on and off adult acne, I’m like 99% sure my acne is because of a bad moisture barrier. When my skin feels smooth and hydrated all day, it doesn’t break out much, but when it feels dry and tight I have little zits that crop up everywhere. About every two-three weeks I’ll be like alright, it’s finally healing, but then I’ll take a shower that’s too hot or skip my morning routine for one measly day and I’m back to square one.\n\nI’ve dealt with acne on and off for the last 3 years but had it good and healed for a better part of a year in there. Looking back I would 10000% attribute it to a damaged moisture barrier. I’m pretty sure I ruined my barrier again about 5 months ago trying to clear a couple of little comedones with shampoo for fungal acne (don’t do it, not worth it).\n\nMy routine currently is: \n\nAM:\n- Splash with water\n- Vanicream daily moisturizer\n- CeraVe moisturizing cream\n\nPM:\n- Clean and Clear daily cream cleanser (don’t laugh, it’s super gentle and it works! I wear very minimal makeup if any at all)\n- Vanicream daily moisturizer\n- CeraVe moisturizing cream\n- thin layer of Vaseline because I’m desperate\n\n(Also plz don’t yell at me about SPF hahaha. I have been housebound recovering from a surgery and literally am not going outside due to fall risk on ice, and won’t for at least another month. I live in the very northern U.S. where we have insane cloud cover and hardly any sun, also my windows are only 2 years old and rated for a fair bit of UV protection. I am aware of the risks of UV and do not think my issues are because I’m not wearing SPF indoors!!) I am trying to get my moisture barrier sorted out before I figure out SPF.\n\nAlso not relevant to my post but just to rant this out into the void, Neutrogena can f all the way off with the constant phasing out of products that WORK. I used an older face wash and moisturizer (with SPF!) that worked for me for so LONG and my entire adult acne nightmare has been because I am trying to replace those two staples in my routine.\n\nAnyways, if anyone has products they swear by or any suggestions, I’d appreciate it. I don’t want to overcomplicate my routine but I’m open to adding a few things if it might help. Thanks!!!",

I was hoping you guys might be able to clue me in on good products for sensitive combo skin? My current routine is just Round Labs Dokdo cleanser &amp; ilyoon ceramide moisturizer. \n\nI’ve tried using sunscreen daily before but I always end up having clogged pores &amp; I hate the way they feel oily &amp; pill up on my skin.. As for oil cleansers for double cleansing, I’ve only ever tried Anua oil cleanser &amp; although it left my skin soft I think it also caused breakouts.\n\nFor sunscreen, I’ve heard good things about SKIN1004 sunscreen, but they have so many options I’m a bit lost. I’ve added pics of my skin is that helps! \n\nI’m super clueless about oil cleansers but I’d like soemthing light &amp; ideally unscented for my sensitive skin. \n\nThank you guys for any recommendations you might have!! :)",

I’ve dealt with this for a while, but recently it has started flaring up again on my back, shoulders, and arms. I’m not sure what the root cause is. For context, I live in a very cold climate where winter temperatures can drop between -20 to -40, which might be contributing to the problem as my skin tends to dry up during this time. \n\nI currently use CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion and Cetaphil PRO RestoraDerm Body Wash, which help manage the symptoms, but don’t fully solve it.\n\nI’ve seen multiple doctors and 1 dermatoligist, and while they’ve assured me it’s nothing serious, they haven’t been able to give me a clear diagnosis. One mentioned it might be a fungal issue, but the explanation didn’t feel very accurate, which is why I’m reaching out here for suggestions.\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would be appreciated. \n\nThank you.  \n",

I am not sure if it’s possible to have a shag but have the shortest layer still be able to go in a ponytail while also being short enough to get more definition.

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
