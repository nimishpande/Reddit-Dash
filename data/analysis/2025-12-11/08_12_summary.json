      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

She'll wash her face with some cheap drugstore cleanser on most days, but that's it - no toner, no serum, nothing. She told me that she uses moisturizer a few times a week, but only when she remembers to use it. So sometimes she'll go 3-4  days without moisturizing at all.\n\nEven though she's only 24, she already has a lot of forehead wrinkles when she raises her eyebrows, and she also has crows feet when she smiles. On top of that, she has dry/flaky cheeks during the winter. I don't think there's anything wrong with showing signs of aging, and I find her beautiful regardless, but I also don't think I'm being  unreasonable to be concerned about her skincare or lack thereof. Even as a guy, I have a much more detailed skincare routine than she does, which I don't think is normal.\n\nI want to encourage her to moisturize more often, and perhaps also start incorporating serums and other products into her routine, but I'm afraid that I'll offend her or make her feel insecure if I bring this up. Should I say something, or just leave her be?",

In the past two years or so I’ve realized my hair actually is wavy and I’ve been looking into caring for my hair more. I have dyed my hair often since I was 16 (~10 years) but I am trying to grow out my natural hair, recently cutting 5 inches off, and seeing how I feel about my natural color since I haven’t barely seen it in a decade as well as trying to let my hair get healthier. \n\nMy current routine is CHI Luxary black seed oil shampoo and unwash conditioner but these were for vivid hair color care. Are either of theses still okay to use? I used a moisturizing cream for like two months which did help but it was super expensive for very little product. I then dry with a cotton towel and wrap it as I dry off then free my hair and let it air dry. I would love any advice anyone has for me. \n\nI have read through the beginner guide but do have some thoughts and questions. For example, I live at a very high altitude (~8500 ft) and it is super dry up here. Does anyone have any advice to keep moisture in my hair? I am also autistic and the thought of the crunchy gel sounds awful to me sensory wise. Is it needed or can I use just stay in cream or something else? \n\nThere was a brief few months where my hairdresser gave me a moisturizer that is not recommended here but that is some of the best waves I have had. Just any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\nPhotos:\n1) me at 12\n2) natural hair 3 years ago (only shampoo and conditioner)\n3 + 4) my hair with the same shampoo, conditioner, and a moisturizing leave in cream",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
