      "content": "hi all!\n\nI need y’all’s help!! I’ve had curly hair my whole life (duh), but I RARELY wear my hair down (I’m talking like once every two months). My hairline is receding :( it is noticeable to literally no one but me (and secretly I think my husband but he’s too kind to say anything), and I have a lot of hair, so when I mention it to people they always roll their eyes. Regardless, I can tell a difference. Presumably, it’s because I pull my hair up. I do like my hair and think it’s very pretty. I even think I look better when it’s down. I cut my hair (waist length to chin length) in January with hopes that it would encourage me to wear it down more often and take better care of it. I’ve realized I hate it in my face though, and thats why I’ve always pulled it up. \n\nThe thing I’ve liked the most is wearing it down with sunglasses pushing it back. I think a regular headband makes me look like an egg, but the way sunglasses push my hair back is flattering. I did that a lot this summer, but harder to get away with when it’s cloudy and winter lol. Also! Whenever I wear my hair down by the end of the day, even when it was at its shortest, the underside is almost matted. Idk if I just need to be combing the underside throughout the day or what, but it’s crazy tangled at night. \n\nI don’t want my hairline to disappear, so please teach me how you wear your hair down everyday without going crazy. Will I eventually desensitize myself to it touching my face? Should I shave my head?? I need any and all advice pleaseeeeeeeee\n\n\nmy routine: (also I’ve included a pic of my hair if that helps) \n\nwash days (once a week-ish)\n-dove bonding shampoo and conditioner like normal (if my hair is really dirty I’ll do a round of head and shoulders first)\n-dove bonding mask for 5-10 minutes\n-cantu cream if I’m wearing it down  (prayer hands and scrunched) OR literally whatever gel my husband has on hand (same application)\n-air dry \n\nother days\n-bio silk in the mornings if it looks dry \n-rosemary oil at front of scalp usually 3x a week\n-just started viviscal  ",

      "content": "Edit: please don’t dm me weird stuff im not interested i came here to ask for help with my skin! 😢\n\nI’ve had clear skin for most of my life (I’m 16) but June this year I began to get acne a week before my period. It was disappointing but manageable I guess, they were just tiny whiteheads that wouldn’t leave a mark. I used 10% panoxyl and it worked really well. \n\nIn October the pimples began to get really huge. Not painful. But just really big fat noticeable pimples that left dark spots that take ages to fade. It’s still happening now. The pimples take weeks to go and the dark spots take even longer. I can’t even get the pimples to go before my next period comes and the new ones grow. I had to use panoxyl day and night or I’d wake up with a new big one. One day last month I only applied it in the morning and went to sleep early, skipping the night one. I woke up with three huge pimples that hadn’t been there that night. I still have the dark spots from those.\n\n1. Does anyone have any product recommendations or anything that worked for them? \n2. Is there an explanation for why they suddenly got bigger and more difficult to fix? Could have I done something? Is that normal?\n3. Does panoxyl really help people with hormonal acne or is another product better \n4. Does it last a super long time??\n\nMy acne isn’t awful but I just miss my skin from this year. I never noticed I had clear skin until this year since people would comment on it. The very moment I realized what a blessing I had and started appreciating it, I began to get acne which is crazy.. Sorry for ranting, I’m really just not sure what to do. I’m panicking because why am I suddenly getting acne now after all these years? I know it can persist into 20s-40s but it still feels so strange and weird.. I have no idea how to navigate my own skin. I have no idea why this started and how to fix it. I’m scared it won’t go away and I really miss when I didn’t have to worry about all of this. Anyways sorry again for ranting I really appreciate you for reading all of this and I’d appreciate and love any advice. Please don’t be mean to me!! 🥲🩷",

I’ve tried niacinamide and adapalene but feel like it doesn’t get better! I’m also struggling with dry skin (very different from my pre-accutane skin, which used to be oily and combination). On a normal day, it doesn’t look too bad but if I get too hot or rub my face in any way or literally just step outside all those red marks get 10x worse and it looks like I have rosacea?!

In the past two years or so I’ve realized my hair actually is wavy and I’ve been looking into caring for my hair more. I have dyed my hair often since I was 16 (~10 years) but I am trying to grow out my natural hair, recently cutting 5 inches off, and seeing how I feel about my natural color since I haven’t barely seen it in a decade as well as trying to let my hair get healthier. \n\nMy current routine is CHI Luxary black seed oil shampoo and unwash conditioner but these were for vivid hair color care. Are either of theses still okay to use? I used a moisturizing cream for like two months which did help but it was super expensive for very little product. I then dry with a cotton towel and wrap it as I dry off then free my hair and let it air dry. I would love any advice anyone has for me. \n\nI have read through the beginner guide but do have some thoughts and questions. For example, I live at a very high altitude (~8500 ft) and it is super dry up here. Does anyone have any advice to keep moisture in my hair? I am also autistic and the thought of the crunchy gel sounds awful to me sensory wise. Is it needed or can I use just stay in cream or something else? \n\nThere was a brief few months where my hairdresser gave me a moisturizer that is not recommended here but that is some of the best waves I have had. Just any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\nPhotos:\n1) me at 12\n2) natural hair 3 years ago (only shampoo and conditioner)\n3 + 4) my hair with the same shampoo, conditioner, and a moisturizing leave in cream",

      "content": "Ever since I graduated highschool I've been getting horrible break outs. I have no idea how I was able to pass that stage during highschool... And it seemed like I took it for granted.\n\nI came across this brand called Skalli Essentials. I found their content convincing and bought their acne bundle which included: Sulfur soap, rosewater, and black seed orange blossom moisturizer. At first my acne cleared up a bit due to finally cleaning my face. Now I keep getting breakouts randomly.\n\nI went to Sephora for a makeup appointment. The artist asked what I used for skincare and I told her my routine. She said the sufur soap is too drying and then recommended products $30-50 dollars each. I can't really afford those atm. Some of those were Exfoliants which I had ordered from Yesstyle for cheaper and had yet to come.\n\nI looked on Google and it said sulfur soaps don't cause acne? I'm a bit puzzled. I really want clear skin... Tbh the reason why I'm getting into makeup is part due to my acne insecurity. Any insight would be appreciated. I also use Cyperus Rotundus oil to prevent hair growth on my chin and neck, Green Tea and Rice PDRN serum, and Retinol every 3 days+ Cetaphil SPF 50 (tbh it does make my skin a bit oily) everyday. I use a clean skin club towel to wash the cleanser off.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
