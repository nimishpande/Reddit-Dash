Then it started happening to me in my early 20s, and my perspective completely changed.\nYou start checking mirrors differently without even realizing it. You become aware of lighting everywhere you go. You avoid overhead lights. You wear caps even when it feels awkward, even during workouts. You keep telling yourself it is not that bad while knowing deep down that the density is slowly disappearing.\nWhat really gets to you is not the hair itself. It is the constant mental noise. The awareness never shuts off, and it quietly starts dictating how you move through daily life.\nWhat eventually helped me was not a miracle product or some overnight fix. It was learning what actually makes things worse and what is just noise on the internet that keeps you stuck and anxious.\nI am curious how many people here went through the same mental cycle before things finally started to make sense.\n\n",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I’ve developed a habit that I’m starting to wonder if I’m overthinking.\n\nBasically, I’m terrified that my body/hair towels have bacteria on them which can transfer to my hands while I wipe my body/hair (even though I hang them by a window to dry). I also only tissue on my face. Because of this:\n\n1. I’m scared that if I touch my towel and then touch my face, I'll get acne or make my SebDerm worse.\n2. Lately, my skin has been feeling really \"rough\" and tight, and I’m wondering if the alcohol vapors or the \"flash drying\" is the culprit.\n\nAm I overthinking the \"towel germs\"? And for those with sensitive skin/SebDerm, did you find that stopping the hand sanitizer/alcohol helped your skin texture?\n\nDo you think just a standard hand wash after the towel is enough to kill the body/hair germs? Or would it even be better to just go straight to skincare after the towel and skip the hand wash entirely?",

      "content": "Your skin doesn’t understand the concept of “indoors.”  \nIt only responds to radiation exposure.\n\nFrom a biological standpoint na, the skin’s pigment cells and collagen fibres react to UVA radiation, not to whether you’re sitting at a beach or like under office AC. Unlike UVB (which causes visible sunburn), UVA rays remain constant throughout the day and penetrate glass effortlessly. This means your skin can be triggering melanin production and collagen degradation even when the temperature is cool and the light feels harmless. What makes this exposure deceptive is its low intensity but high frequency. A few minutes near a window, daily commuting, or repeated indirect sunlight doesn’t cause immediate damage but research shows it leads to photoaging, pigmentation irregularities, and barrier weakening over time. Ik Ik big concepts but then yeah they exist. This is why sunscreen isn’t positioned as an outdoor only product in dermatology. It functions as a biological filter, reducing the amount of radiation that reaches deeper skin layers regardless of whether that radiation comes from a beach or behind a glass panel.\n\nIn other words, office AC doesn’t neutralize UV exposure. It just makes it easier to ignore. I’ve made plenty of skincare mistakes over the years, learnt a lot through trial, error, and listening to people who know better and I’m still learning. Sharing this so it helps you make a more informed choice, not because there’s only one “right\" way. ",

Went through surgery, and birth control pills were stopped and I was given a Mirena implant. Now, few months later, my acne is back and worse than before. From my research, Mirena releases a hormone that can cause acne, hairfall etc, plus the inflammation from endo and insulin resistance too. I am at my wits end. Has anyone been through this?

They were bouncy and voluminous and they clumped really nicely.

My skin looks uneven and dull, especially on my cheeks and jaw, while my nose area looks comparatively smoother. Winters me skin dry ho jaati hai and summers me T-zone thoda oily ho jata hai. I’ve tried being consistent with skincare, mostly using Minimalist products, but I didn’t really see noticeable improvement. The sunscreen feels heavy on my skin, the cleanser didn’t feel very effective, Vitamin C didn’t make much difference, and even after using AHA BHA PHA carefully, I didn’t see results. sometimes my skin actually felt dull for 1–2 days after exfoliating. Right now I have Deconstruct salicylic acid face wash, Nivea Soft moisturizer, Minimalist SPF 50 sunscreen, and the AHA BHA PHA exfoliant. I’m confused whether I’m over-exfoliating, under-hydrating, or just using the wrong products. Since I’m young, this affects my confidence a lot, and I really want to fix my skin in a healthy, long-term way. Any advice or routine suggestions would genuinely mean a lot.",

I started seeing a dermatologist at 18, and while the acne has mostly been controlled, the pigmentation has never truly improved.\n\nWhat treatments I’ve tried\n\n\t•\tTopical creams prescribed by my dermatologist\n\n\t•\tChemical peels — they temporarily even out my skin for about 1–2 weeks, but the pigmentation always comes back\n\n\t•\tI’ve been prescribed Golite cream multiple times, but I honestly don’t see any noticeable improvement\n\nMy current routine (derm-prescribed)\n\n\t•\tAcne Moist moisturizer\n\n\t•\tGolite cream\n\n\t•\tEye cream for dark circles\n\nCurrent concerns\n\n\t•\tVery dull, oily skin (no glow or freshness)\n\n\t•\tDark circles (I know poor sleep contributes)\n\n\t•\tSignificant pigmentation, especially:\n\n\t•\tNeck (I was born with torticollis, which may have contributed)\n\n\t•\tFace (uneven pigmentation)\n\n\t•\tUnderarms\n\n\t•\tOverall tanning on my body\n\n\t•\tMy face looks aged and tired for my age\n\nSunscreen issues (major problem)\n\nAlmost every sunscreen I try pills or leaves a heavy white cast:\n\n\t•\tAcne UV — terrible white cast\n\n\t•\tAcne Wash sunscreen — same issue\n\n\t•\tMinimalist sunscreen — feels weird on my skin and doesn’t fully absorb\n\nBecause of this, I end up using far less than the recommended amount, which I know defeats the purpose.\n\nEven with moisturizer, my skin still looks flat, lifeless, and dull, not healthy or youthful.\n\nMy questions\n\n\t•\tIs repeated chemical peeling really the best approach for long-term pigmentation?\n\n\t•\tWhy might Golite not be working, even after consistent use?\n\n\t•\tWhat kind of treatment or routine actually helps with:\n\n\t•\tChronic pigmentation\n\n\t•\tDull, oily skin\n\n\t•\tEarly signs of aging\n\n\t•\tHow do I fix sunscreen pilling and absorption on oily skin?\n\n\t•\tShould I consider changing dermatologists or asking for different treatment options?\n\nI’m feeling quite stuck because I’ve been consistent and patient, but I don’t see real progress. I just want my skin to look healthy, fresh, and age-appropriate again.\n\nAny advice, experiences, or product/treatment suggestions would be really helpful.\n\nThank you in advance 🤍",

However, due to how fine my hair is, there is always a lot of leftover space in my bonnet, and I end up sleeping on my curls and crushing them. When I use a scrunchie under the bonnet, then the hair stays on top of my head but the curls around the scrunchie get squished and never look the same. I’ve been trying to find a bonnet that keeps my hair all the way off the back of my head and piled on top instead, but haven’t had much luck. I even tricked myself into thinking I could just add more product to my hair and that would keep it nice even if I slept on it, but obviously that didn’t work (my normal routine is just mousse applied to damp hair, diffused and finished with hairspray, because adding much else really weighs my hair down!). \n\nFrom what I can tell, an ideal bonnet for me would be small, have a wide band, and have most of its space up on top of my head (if there’s a bonnet with ruching at the nape of the neck, I think that might help?), but honestly I’m willing to try anything!

I have a layered haircut and everything, but I just don't like how curls fall. I have good volume at the roots, but no matter what the sides are always wider and make my head look wide too. I'm short as well, so the big, fluffy head of hair makes me look like a bobblehead imo.\n\nAnd even when the curls are defined, they still look so much messier than straight hair. I like looking neat but it's impossible with my hair down, it just goes everywhere. It looks decent when I tie it back or put it in a claw clip, but what even is the point anymore if I do that...? Why bother with the whole routine?\n\nI'm seriously considering just straightening it at this point. Does anyone have any advice?",

My topical was .025% finasteride and I was applying about 1 ml, by my calculations that’s about .25 mg applied. \n\nI have heard about the birth defects caused from pregnant women exposed to finasteride, and am worried sick I have accidentally harmed my child. \n\nI would apply it at my job in the parking lot around 6:30-7 am, I’d then wash my hands after applying it. I’d also wear a hard hat  so maybe that rubbed off some of the topical throughout the day.\n\nI’d return home at around 3:30-4:15 pm depending on the day. I would not shower immediately when I got home and would hug my wife and even lay down in bed with her, I’m worried the residue got on the pillows and sheets and she might have been exposed that way or maybe by touching my hair (although I always have told her not to touch my crown and temples before I’d shower around 7 pm) \n\nThe positives are she hasn’t been in my car since she was pregnant and hasn’t been in the same room of where I’d apply my topical. Does anyone have a similar story? How’d it turn out? Our first OB appointment is in a week and I will make them aware of this, but in the meantime I am worried sick about this ",
