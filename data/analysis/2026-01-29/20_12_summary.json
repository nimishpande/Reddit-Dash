What is this haircut called and do you think 3a-3b curly hair could suit it? \n\nIn my routine, I use Mixed Chicks Leave-in Conditioner, Narobi moisturizing hair lotion, and PATTERN curl gel. My hair rn is mid-back length but I’m getting tired of the neck pain that comes with diffusing for 2-3 hours and I’m ready for a change.

The awareness never shuts off, and it quietly starts dictating how you move through daily life.\nWhat eventually helped me was not a miracle product or some overnight fix.

I'm not entirely sure how I achieved the waves in the photo, but here is what I have tried. I'v studied this reddit extensively, and am in need to some advice!\n\nHere are my issues (that I think are) impeding my waves. Any and all advice would be helpful\n\n**1. I can never get my hair wet enough to achieve the 'seaweed' texture that people talk about. I feel like my hair does not absorb water in a normal way, but it still takes (literally!) 12+ hours to airdry and at least an hour with a diffuser on medium heat**\n\n**2. I can not get my hair to form a cast! My hair is always super soft and no matter how much or how little product I try, a cast does not show up!**\n\nAny tips or tricks are appreciated. I don't mind spending $ on product but really would love to get back to my 1x a week wash schedule with bouncy waves!\n\nCurrent Routine:\n\n1. Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Conditioner and MorrocanOil Curl Shampoo, with \\~biweekly Malibu Undo Goo clarifying and Ouai Curl Creme and Neuma NEU Styling Mousse - this was working when I had longer hair (1x a week wash) and if I finger curled and then slept in it, but now that it's a bit shorter, it just weighs it down.\n2.

Most of it forms waves/curls okay, but the very front pieces near my face don’t curl very well no matter what I do (these photos are probably the best i ca get from the front to curl ). Im always tucking either all my hair or at least the very front pieces on each side behind my ears because I don’t like the front pieces and end up hiding them . Often they’re so matte / straight to my face when everything else has wave or curl to it. Scrunching or finger coiling doesn’t really work and they fall flat quickly or just look weird. They were cut a bit shorter than the rest of my hair to frame my face , but are still actually very long . \n\nRoutine : I use Prose hair care, shampoo, conditioner , brush with a bounce curl brush sometimes or otherwise just a wet hair brush , then scrunch curl cream first and then gel in my wet hair. I’ve tried a million creams and gels and the prose gel seems to do the best, however lately I also haven’t been able to get a good cast. I mostly air dry. I was side parting for awhile but have been middle parting lately / my last hair cut was with middle parting. \n\nI’m hoping for help with:\n\n\t•\tWhat curl/wave pattern this looks like overall? \n\n\t•\tProduct recommendations for definition without weighing it down?\n\n\t•\tHow to cut or style the front so it blends better (face-framing? layers? different styling approach, part??)",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

      "content": "Your skin doesn’t understand the concept of “indoors.”  \nIt only responds to radiation exposure.\n\nFrom a biological standpoint na, the skin’s pigment cells and collagen fibres react to UVA radiation, not to whether you’re sitting at a beach or like under office AC. Unlike UVB (which causes visible sunburn), UVA rays remain constant throughout the day and penetrate glass effortlessly. This means your skin can be triggering melanin production and collagen degradation even when the temperature is cool and the light feels harmless. What makes this exposure deceptive is its low intensity but high frequency. A few minutes near a window, daily commuting, or repeated indirect sunlight doesn’t cause immediate damage but research shows it leads to photoaging, pigmentation irregularities, and barrier weakening over time. Ik Ik big concepts but then yeah they exist. This is why sunscreen isn’t positioned as an outdoor only product in dermatology. It functions as a biological filter, reducing the amount of radiation that reaches deeper skin layers regardless of whether that radiation comes from a beach or behind a glass panel.\n\nIn other words, office AC doesn’t neutralize UV exposure. It just makes it easier to ignore. I’ve made plenty of skincare mistakes over the years, learnt a lot through trial, error, and listening to people who know better and I’m still learning. Sharing this so it helps you make a more informed choice, not because there’s only one “right\" way. ",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "I was thinking recently about foundations I wore in the past. As a teenager, for special occasions, I sometimes wore Dermablend. It was extremely full coverage, probably as close as you can get to turning a face into a blank canvas. I remember it feeling very thick and heavy on the skin, definitely not something I would have wanted to wear day to day, but it photographed beautifully. People say it could cover tattoos remarkably well, so it was clearly a very potent product.\n\nWhat strikes me now is that I almost never see Dermablend discussed anymore. It still exists and is still being sold, so people must be buying it, but it seems to have vanished from mainstream beauty conversations. I also have not seen it on physical store shelves in years. That makes me wonder who the brand is actually for now. Is it still being used primarily for tattoo coverage and high-coverage corrective makeup? Has it become a niche product rather than something aimed at everyday consumers?\n\nIt makes me think of brands like Kryolan, which are well known within professional or specialist circles but largely absent from influencer-driven beauty culture. Dermablend feels like it might occupy a similar space now, but I am not within those circles so I was wondering what other people thought of it, and if they encountered it.",

Laser? Peels? I am mostly looking for one-and-done things. I know botox is an option but I worry about the maintenance especially if the answer here really is a full face lift. I am not trying to remove all signs of aging. Crows feet and laugh lines are beautiful! But I have some very deep lines that really aren’t consistent with my age so I would love to do something about that if possible. I’d like to keep products reasonably priced especially since I don’t know if they will work for me.\n\nThanks for reading my novel 😭",

I feel my skin is rather dull.\n\nSo first I bought some ph5 cleaner, then I got suckered and ended up buying a set from Prose with cleanser, serum and moisturizer. I have CeraVe AM, trader Joe's ultra hydrating gel moisturizer, nopalera's sugar scrub, and CeraVe from the tub and I just bought tretinoin, the ordinary AHA 30%+BHA 2%, Azelaic acid suspension 10%, and ilso Super Melting Sebum Softener.\n\n  \nI am now overwhelmed. \n\nWhat should I do in the morning? Which should I do first? Which should I let dry and then layer, which should I layer immediately? What should I do everyday? How often should I do everything else?

Over the years, I tried multiple ayurvedic and herbal products, but none of them gave lasting results.\n\nAround 2020, I started experiencing noticeable hair loss. In 2024, I decided to consult Oliva Clinic and since then I’ve been following the treatment plan suggested by them. This includes:\n\nDaily use of minoxidil\n\nOral medication prescribed by the clinic\n\nProducts suggested by Oliva\n\nShampooing around 4 days a week\n\n While the dandruff is somewhat manageable now, the hair growth has been quite slow and the overall density hasn’t improved as much as I had hoped.\n\nAt this point, I’m confused about whether I should continue with the same routine or explore other options. I’d really appreciate advice from people who’ve dealt with long-term dandruff and hair loss.\n\nWhat worked for you?\n\nShould I tweak my routine, get a second opinion, or just be more patient?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I want to feel better about myself, maybe liking how I look more could help, so I would love some tips!\n\nAbout me:\n\n1. I have sensitive, dry skin. Especially fragrances cause flare ups in my skin inflammation. Not much acne issues at all though.\n2. I would like to be minimalistic with products.\n3. I have started using a curl gel for my hair, which is super helpful for making my hair not frizzy and looking nice. Would love little things like this which could help me.\n4. I don't like wearing revealing or super expensive clothes. I would like to spend moderately on nice clothes that make me feel confident and comfortable. Having trouble maintaining my closet though, as I feel I don't buy clothes often enough. Currently, I mostly shop from Old Navy, as it's well within my budget, but I'm open to spending a tad more.\n5. I wear unpadded, no underwire bras. I am wondering if wearing normal bras would make me look better?\n6. I am relatively skinny, leaning towards athletic, and I will be working out more in future.\n7. I have skin type 3 olive skin, black hair, brown eyes, and I wear glasses. Would contacts help?\n\nPlease let me know if more information is needed or if this belongs better in a different subreddit.

      "content": "I've been using the same face cream for about two years and while it's fine I feel like my skin could look better. I'm dark skinned with combination skin that gets oily in my T-zone but dry on my cheeks.  \n\n\nMy current is okay, It's just that I need a change. I've been seeing people talk about Donkey Milk Cream, and didn't even know there was something like it, until a little research. I'm just curious if it's worth trying or just another gimmick. I don't know if it's good for particularly darker skin tone and it's said to be hydrating and gentle, I guess.\n\n  \nI'm more concerned about keeping my skin moisturized without looking too greasy and something to help the dullness I've noticed recently. I don't have any critical skin issues, just something that will make my skin healthier and more radiant.\n\nI started looking into different brands, scrolling through different sites, Amazon, Jumia, even Alibaba and the price range is all over the place. Some are like $75 for a small jar, others are way cheaper. But I'm still wondering about the actual quality differences between expensive and budget options.\n\n  \nHas anyone with darker skin tried donkey milk products? Did you notice a real difference or is it overhyped? And are there specific brands you'd actually recommend that are worth the money?",
