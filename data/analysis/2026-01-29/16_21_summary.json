Then it started happening to me in my early 20s, and my perspective completely changed.\nYou start checking mirrors differently without even realizing it. You become aware of lighting everywhere you go. You avoid overhead lights. You wear caps even when it feels awkward, even during workouts. You keep telling yourself it is not that bad while knowing deep down that the density is slowly disappearing.\nWhat really gets to you is not the hair itself. It is the constant mental noise. The awareness never shuts off, and it quietly starts dictating how you move through daily life.\nWhat eventually helped me was not a miracle product or some overnight fix. It was learning what actually makes things worse and what is just noise on the internet that keeps you stuck and anxious.\nI am curious how many people here went through the same mental cycle before things finally started to make sense.\n\n",

      "content": "Your skin doesn’t understand the concept of “indoors.”  \nIt only responds to radiation exposure.\n\nFrom a biological standpoint na, the skin’s pigment cells and collagen fibres react to UVA radiation, not to whether you’re sitting at a beach or like under office AC. Unlike UVB (which causes visible sunburn), UVA rays remain constant throughout the day and penetrate glass effortlessly. This means your skin can be triggering melanin production and collagen degradation even when the temperature is cool and the light feels harmless. What makes this exposure deceptive is its low intensity but high frequency. A few minutes near a window, daily commuting, or repeated indirect sunlight doesn’t cause immediate damage but research shows it leads to photoaging, pigmentation irregularities, and barrier weakening over time. Ik Ik big concepts but then yeah they exist. This is why sunscreen isn’t positioned as an outdoor only product in dermatology. It functions as a biological filter, reducing the amount of radiation that reaches deeper skin layers regardless of whether that radiation comes from a beach or behind a glass panel.\n\nIn other words, office AC doesn’t neutralize UV exposure. It just makes it easier to ignore. I’ve made plenty of skincare mistakes over the years, learnt a lot through trial, error, and listening to people who know better and I’m still learning. Sharing this so it helps you make a more informed choice, not because there’s only one “right\" way. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I decided to not use my niacinamide serum  becaused I thought it was the cause.\n\nAfter a few days, I stopped using my cica gel moisturizer too. So im only using my face wash and sunscreen now. Today, I realized that my skin is peeling. I thought my face felt weird with this grainy paper like peeling so I took a pic and saw what is attached in this post now.\n\n  \nI am assuming this occured due to the products I'm using (the same products I've been using for 2 months) so I am planning to deconstruct my routine and make a new one... my main problems are nodular acnes, blackheads and acne scars/marks. I like sticking to simple routines. Please do recommend share your simple routines that never failed!\n\n  \nTia!",

Over the years, I tried multiple ayurvedic and herbal products, but none of them gave lasting results.\n\nAround 2020, I started experiencing noticeable hair loss. In 2024, I decided to consult Oliva Clinic and since then I’ve been following the treatment plan suggested by them. This includes:\n\nDaily use of minoxidil\n\nOral medication prescribed by the clinic\n\nProducts suggested by Oliva\n\nShampooing around 4 days a week\n\n While the dandruff is somewhat manageable now, the hair growth has been quite slow and the overall density hasn’t improved as much as I had hoped.\n\nAt this point, I’m confused about whether I should continue with the same routine or explore other options. I’d really appreciate advice from people who’ve dealt with long-term dandruff and hair loss.\n\nWhat worked for you?\n\nShould I tweak my routine, get a second opinion, or just be more patient?\n\nThanks in advance.",

They were bouncy and voluminous and they clumped really nicely. The only problem was that they looked dry as hell.\n\nA couple of hours later I wet it again and used more lightweight products (The INKEY List Inkey Chia Seed Curl Defining Hair Cream + Umberto Giannini foam + Umberto Giannini curl serum) and brush-styled it then diffused it.

I reacted to aquaphor on my lips which led me down the rabbit hole of what else lanolin is in. (Maybe worth noting that Benadryl helped a lot which adds to my suspicion of allergy) Apparently it’s in a lot of stuff, it's the source of vitamin D3 in fortified foods and in supplements unless specifically stated otherwise. Guess what vitamin l've been taking daily for years. D3! So I stopped, but I'm confused how I didn't notice a reaction to that previously. I've had many other skin reactions, usually on my lips “randomly” without explanation but the D3 was consistent &amp; daily so idk. I only stopped yesterday so I'm not sure if I should be looking for changes in my skin, mood, overall health or something? Ofc I will discuss with the allergist.\n\nBut I have other health issues including struggling with acne that now I'm thinking could be connected, so **I'm wondering if anybody knows about what lanolin can do to you if ingested/used for a long time when allergic, or has experience with this**?\n\nI'm nervous and impatient waiting for this appointment &amp; highkey afraid I'm NOT allergic and it's just some other mysterious health issue that I'II never have an explanation for. Any insight appreciated! If this isn't the right place for this I understand I just figured y'all would know stuff about lanolin :) thank you!",

My topical was .025% finasteride and I was applying about 1 ml, by my calculations that’s about .25 mg applied. \n\nI have heard about the birth defects caused from pregnant women exposed to finasteride, and am worried sick I have accidentally harmed my child. \n\nI would apply it at my job in the parking lot around 6:30-7 am, I’d then wash my hands after applying it. I’d also wear a hard hat  so maybe that rubbed off some of the topical throughout the day.\n\nI’d return home at around 3:30-4:15 pm depending on the day. I would not shower immediately when I got home and would hug my wife and even lay down in bed with her, I’m worried the residue got on the pillows and sheets and she might have been exposed that way or maybe by touching my hair (although I always have told her not to touch my crown and temples before I’d shower around 7 pm) \n\nThe positives are she hasn’t been in my car since she was pregnant and hasn’t been in the same room of where I’d apply my topical. Does anyone have a similar story? How’d it turn out? Our first OB appointment is in a week and I will make them aware of this, but in the meantime I am worried sick about this ",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a 21-year-old female dealing with persistent skin issues and I’d really appreciate some guidance.\n\nI’ve had severe acne and pigmentation since I was around 14–15. I started seeing a dermatologist at 18, and while the acne has mostly been controlled, the pigmentation has never truly improved.\n\nWhat treatments I’ve tried\n\n\t•\tTopical creams prescribed by my dermatologist\n\n\t•\tChemical peels — they temporarily even out my skin for about 1–2 weeks, but the pigmentation always comes back\n\n\t•\tI’ve been prescribed Golite cream multiple times, but I honestly don’t see any noticeable improvement\n\nMy current routine (derm-prescribed)\n\n\t•\tAcne Moist moisturizer\n\n\t•\tGolite cream\n\n\t•\tEye cream for dark circles\n\nCurrent concerns\n\n\t•\tVery dull, oily skin (no glow or freshness)\n\n\t•\tDark circles (I know poor sleep contributes)\n\n\t•\tSignificant pigmentation, especially:\n\n\t•\tNeck (I was born with torticollis, which may have contributed)\n\n\t•\tFace (uneven pigmentation)\n\n\t•\tUnderarms\n\n\t•\tOverall tanning on my body\n\n\t•\tMy face looks aged and tired for my age\n\nSunscreen issues (major problem)\n\nAlmost every sunscreen I try pills or leaves a heavy white cast:\n\n\t•\tAcne UV — terrible white cast\n\n\t•\tAcne Wash sunscreen — same issue\n\n\t•\tMinimalist sunscreen — feels weird on my skin and doesn’t fully absorb\n\nBecause of this, I end up using far less than the recommended amount, which I know defeats the purpose.\n\nEven with moisturizer, my skin still looks flat, lifeless, and dull, not healthy or youthful.\n\nMy questions\n\n\t•\tIs repeated chemical peeling really the best approach for long-term pigmentation?\n\n\t•\tWhy might Golite not be working, even after consistent use?\n\n\t•\tWhat kind of treatment or routine actually helps with:\n\n\t•\tChronic pigmentation\n\n\t•\tDull, oily skin\n\n\t•\tEarly signs of aging\n\n\t•\tHow do I fix sunscreen pilling and absorption on oily skin?\n\n\t•\tShould I consider changing dermatologists or asking for different treatment options?\n\nI’m feeling quite stuck because I’ve been consistent and patient, but I don’t see real progress. I just want my skin to look healthy, fresh, and age-appropriate again.\n\nAny advice, experiences, or product/treatment suggestions would be really helpful.\n\nThank you in advance 🤍",

However, due to how fine my hair is, there is always a lot of leftover space in my bonnet, and I end up sleeping on my curls and crushing them.

I’ve been trying to find a bonnet that keeps my hair all the way off the back of my head and piled on top instead, but haven’t had much luck. I even tricked myself into thinking I could just add more product to my hair and that would keep it nice even if I slept on it, but obviously that didn’t work (my normal routine is just mousse applied to damp hair, diffused and finished with hairspray, because adding much else really weighs my hair down!). \n\nFrom what I can tell, an ideal bonnet for me would be small, have a wide band, and have most of its space up on top of my head (if there’s a bonnet with ruching at the nape of the neck, I think that might help?), but honestly I’m willing to try anything!
