I thought it was just part of the driving tan that I've been trying to get rid of (yes, I use sunscreen) but I think it's more than that. \n\nI use lotion constantly for various things, gold bond firming lotion for face and neck, gold bond for hands almost every time I wash my hands, oil of olay shimmer lotion for lower legs and feet at night and occasionally I remember to use my Get Dreamy body whip. I have various small tubes of lotion in my car, purse etc.\n\nCan anyone recommend specific products for discoloration?\n\nAre there products for firming the skin on our hands? I've lost about 50# and even before that my wedding rings started spinning and falling off, my ring size on my left hand went from 8.5 to 6.5 even before losing the weight. ",

You become aware of lighting everywhere you go. You avoid overhead lights. You wear caps even when it feels awkward, even during workouts. You keep telling yourself it is not that bad while knowing deep down that the density is slowly disappearing.\nWhat really gets to you is not the hair itself. It is the constant mental noise. The awareness never shuts off, and it quietly starts dictating how you move through daily life.\nWhat eventually helped me was not a miracle product or some overnight fix.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I have been wanting to embrace my curls, but whenever I try, it seems like my hair is weighed down with product and gets greasy. I'm not entirely sure how I achieved the waves in the photo, but here is what I have tried. I'v studied this reddit extensively, and am in need to some advice!\n\nHere are my issues (that I think are) impeding my waves. Any and all advice would be helpful\n\n**1. I can never get my hair wet enough to achieve the 'seaweed' texture that people talk about. I feel like my hair does not absorb water in a normal way, but it still takes (literally!) 12+ hours to airdry and at least an hour with a diffuser on medium heat**\n\n**2. I can not get my hair to form a cast! My hair is always super soft and no matter how much or how little product I try, a cast does not show up!**\n\nAny tips or tricks are appreciated. I don't mind spending $ on product but really would love to get back to my 1x a week wash schedule with bouncy waves!\n\nCurrent Routine:\n\n1. Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Conditioner and MorrocanOil Curl Shampoo, with \\~biweekly Malibu Undo Goo clarifying and Ouai Curl Creme and Neuma NEU Styling Mousse - this was working when I had longer hair (1x a week wash) and if I finger curled and then slept in it, but now that it's a bit shorter, it just weighs it down.\n2.

      "content": "Your skin doesn’t understand the concept of “indoors.”  \nIt only responds to radiation exposure.\n\nFrom a biological standpoint na, the skin’s pigment cells and collagen fibres react to UVA radiation, not to whether you’re sitting at a beach or like under office AC. Unlike UVB (which causes visible sunburn), UVA rays remain constant throughout the day and penetrate glass effortlessly. This means your skin can be triggering melanin production and collagen degradation even when the temperature is cool and the light feels harmless. What makes this exposure deceptive is its low intensity but high frequency. A few minutes near a window, daily commuting, or repeated indirect sunlight doesn’t cause immediate damage but research shows it leads to photoaging, pigmentation irregularities, and barrier weakening over time. Ik Ik big concepts but then yeah they exist. This is why sunscreen isn’t positioned as an outdoor only product in dermatology. It functions as a biological filter, reducing the amount of radiation that reaches deeper skin layers regardless of whether that radiation comes from a beach or behind a glass panel.\n\nIn other words, office AC doesn’t neutralize UV exposure. It just makes it easier to ignore. I’ve made plenty of skincare mistakes over the years, learnt a lot through trial, error, and listening to people who know better and I’m still learning. Sharing this so it helps you make a more informed choice, not because there’s only one “right\" way. ",

My friend recently told me to try a little scoop of Shea Moisturize + water in a spray bottle and the WOW xtra large volumizer mousse to see if it will do something (she has 4b hair, never dealt with my type of hair). It made my hair wavy ish (pic 3) but it dries stringy and pattern is all over the place when its dried after plopping + diffusing (pics 4-8). What am I doing wrong/not doing for my type of hair? Or am I just delulu &amp; forcing my hair to be something it isnt? \n\nContext: Ive been dying my hair blonde for 8 years, temp dyed it red for a few months now with a tinted hair mask.

I want to feel better about myself, maybe liking how I look more could help, so I would love some tips!\n\nAbout me:\n\n1. I have sensitive, dry skin. Especially fragrances cause flare ups in my skin inflammation. Not much acne issues at all though.\n2. I would like to be minimalistic with products.\n3. I have started using a curl gel for my hair, which is super helpful for making my hair not frizzy and looking nice. Would love little things like this which could help me.\n4. I don't like wearing revealing or super expensive clothes. I would like to spend moderately on nice clothes that make me feel confident and comfortable. Having trouble maintaining my closet though, as I feel I don't buy clothes often enough. Currently, I mostly shop from Old Navy, as it's well within my budget, but I'm open to spending a tad more.\n5. I wear unpadded, no underwire bras. I am wondering if wearing normal bras would make me look better?\n6. I am relatively skinny, leaning towards athletic, and I will be working out more in future.\n7. I have skin type 3 olive skin, black hair, brown eyes, and I wear glasses. Would contacts help?\n\nPlease let me know if more information is needed or if this belongs better in a different subreddit.
