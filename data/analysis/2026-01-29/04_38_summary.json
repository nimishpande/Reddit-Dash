      "content": "So… I’ve been scraping and aggregating user experiences from hair loss subs and forums, mostly to see what patterns show up when you look at hundreds of reports.\n\nSome of this lines up with what everyone already says. Some of it honestly surprised me, especially timelines and side effect frequencies.\n\n**Stuff that, umm, actually seems to work:**\n\nFinasteride (oral) + minoxidil is still the base for most people. When I looked at long-term success stories (like 5–20+ years), this combo is everywhere. A lot of people just maintain. Some even say hair quality got darker or thicker over time.\n\nRU58841 shows up a lot in aggressive stacks and usually with good stabilization. That said… the vehicle debate is real. PG versions seem to cause way more irritation and nonstop shedding for some people. Glycerin seems gentler but maybe worse absorption. Kind of a tradeoff.\n\nMicroneedling at \\~1.5mm weekly is almost universal in regrowth stacks that actually worked. The “it helps topicals absorb better” thing seems legit when you zoom out.\n\nOral minoxidil gets called a game changer constantly. But yeah, the early shedding freaks people out. Around 1–1.5 months a lot of users see nothing or worse and quit. People who stick it out usually see results around months 4–6.\n\nDutasteride is very much the nuclear option when fin isn’t enough. Switching often causes a shed first, then big improvement later. Also weirdly common to see people say their DHT stayed high despite being on it.\n\nLLLT laser caps show up in long, multi-year protocols. People feel good about them… but constantly debate whether the price is worth whatever they’re actually contributing.\n\n**Side effects that don’t get talked about much individually, but show up at scale:**\n\nFin sexual sides. Yeah, controversial. Aggregated, around \\~2–3% report persistent issues. Plenty of people run it for years with zero sides. Both things are clearly happening.\n\nOral minoxidil systemic concerns. Tons of people love it, but there’s always background anxiety about heart or BP stuff, even when users personally feel fine.\n\nRU58841 is not forgiving. Miss doses or stop and some people report rapid loss. This isn’t like fin where you can be casual.\n\n**Stuff that surprised me:**\n\nThe pumpkin / flax / sesame seed “natural DHT blocker” thing. Evidence is weak, community is skeptical… but one anecdote reported insanely low daily shedding and visible improvement. Worth a mention, not a recommendation.\n\nFluridil seems kind of underused. Shows up as a low-risk, entry-level topical anti-androgen with stabilization over \\~3–6 months.\n\nIntermittent fasting potentially triggering hair loss. Some studies suggest it may suppress follicle regeneration, and that actually lines up with anecdotes. Which is… not what you’d expect.\n\n**Quick reality check:**\n\nDoes this match what you’ve seen?  \nAm I missing anything big?  \nDo these timelines sound right?\n\nI’m doing this because hair loss marketing is pretty predatory, and clinical data is limited and sanitized. Aggregated real experiences are messy and biased, but maybe still useful.\n\nI’ve turned this into a [dataset](https://modernrelay.com/davidjohn10/hair-loss-insights), but wanted community feedback before sharing it more widely.\n\nAnyway… what am I missing?",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Burns, cuts, pimples—you name it. It works quickly and soothes the skin really well. Apparently, it can also be consumed for digestive or internal issues, but I haven’t personally tried that.\n\n2.\tBoronil – Super effective for dry or irritated skin. I like to keep it on hand; it’s like an Ayurvedic moisturizer with healing properties. I use it for face lips and hands.\n\n3.\tTup Anjan (ghee-based eye balm) – This one’s underrated! I use it for dry or tired eyes, and surprisingly, it helps me sleep better too.\n\nWould love to hear if others have discovered lesser-known Ayurvedic or traditional remedies that actually work for everyday use.

Usually I can manage to get into my wheelchair and tip my head under the shower but that’s not working for me currently.\n\nI usually use fresh caps, which are just rinse free shampoo caps, but from my experience, they just aren’t good for curly hair. Every time I try looking this up I get advice on old people in care homes and how to wash their hair, which isn’t what I need, like at all. All of those methods rely on someone being there to help, but I don’t have anyone to help me.\n\nLike I said, shot in the dark, but if anyone has any ideas please lmk",

I started seeing a dermatologist at 18, and while the acne has mostly been controlled, the pigmentation has never truly improved.\n\nWhat treatments I’ve tried\n\n\t•\tTopical creams prescribed by my dermatologist\n\n\t•\tChemical peels — they temporarily even out my skin for about 1–2 weeks, but the pigmentation always comes back\n\n\t•\tI’ve been prescribed Golite cream multiple times, but I honestly don’t see any noticeable improvement\n\nMy current routine (derm-prescribed)\n\n\t•\tAcne Moist moisturizer\n\n\t•\tGolite cream\n\n\t•\tEye cream for dark circles\n\nCurrent concerns\n\n\t•\tVery dull, oily skin (no glow or freshness)\n\n\t•\tDark circles (I know poor sleep contributes)\n\n\t•\tSignificant pigmentation, especially:\n\n\t•\tNeck (I was born with torticollis, which may have contributed)\n\n\t•\tFace (uneven pigmentation)\n\n\t•\tUnderarms\n\n\t•\tOverall tanning on my body\n\n\t•\tMy face looks aged and tired for my age\n\nSunscreen issues (major problem)\n\nAlmost every sunscreen I try pills or leaves a heavy white cast:\n\n\t•\tAcne UV — terrible white cast\n\n\t•\tAcne Wash sunscreen — same issue\n\n\t•\tMinimalist sunscreen — feels weird on my skin and doesn’t fully absorb\n\nBecause of this, I end up using far less than the recommended amount, which I know defeats the purpose.\n\nEven with moisturizer, my skin still looks flat, lifeless, and dull, not healthy or youthful.\n\nMy questions\n\n\t•\tIs repeated chemical peeling really the best approach for long-term pigmentation?\n\n\t•\tWhy might Golite not be working, even after consistent use?\n\n\t•\tWhat kind of treatment or routine actually helps with:\n\n\t•\tChronic pigmentation\n\n\t•\tDull, oily skin\n\n\t•\tEarly signs of aging\n\n\t•\tHow do I fix sunscreen pilling and absorption on oily skin?\n\n\t•\tShould I consider changing dermatologists or asking for different treatment options?\n\nI’m feeling quite stuck because I’ve been consistent and patient, but I don’t see real progress. I just want my skin to look healthy, fresh, and age-appropriate again.\n\nAny advice, experiences, or product/treatment suggestions would be really helpful.\n\nThank you in advance 🤍",

La Roche-Posay Cicablast Baume B5+**\n\n**10/10 HG**\n\nI’ve been getting this product (incidentally, through a friend of my husband’s) for over a year now because I have very dry eczema prone skin. And I love this shit. my biggest gripe is that i run out of it so soon. It’s a thick THICK occlusive cream which I apply as the last step in my PM routine and wake up with “healthy” feeling skin.\n\n**2. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume**\n\n**8/10 Will always RP**\n\nThis one feels a lot more hydrating than LRP if that makes sense? So typically I use this in the mornings when I am not layering too many products and I need the same moisturiser to hydrate and seal\n\n**3. Skin1004 Centella Light Cleansing Oil**\n\n**8/10 Will always RP**\n\nSo I use this because my absolute holy grail Softymo Speedy is very hard to source in India. This one is lightweight though and smells really really good \n\n**4. numbuzin no. 2 protein creamy serum**\n\n**9/10 WRP**\n\nI am fairly new to this. But the texture of this has to be the best I have ever used and I have used a ton of milky toners. It’s actually thicker than milky toners/ usual serums, almost a body lotion texture if you will.  Thats why I love it so much for my DRY dry skin\n\nI am just not very sure if I absolutely need this in my routine given that I already use so many other barrier repair products all the time. But most likely will repurchase just to have it handy for extra dry days. \n\n**5. Skin1004 Centella Sunstick**\n\n**9/10 Will always RP**\n\nHeadsup: I don’t use it over makeup. I just reapply through the day when i am not wearing makeup using this because it feels like nothing on your skin. not sticky not heavy. Love it for that reason \n\nCiao✨",

So it just comes and goes but is constantly there somehow. At first, I thought it was the bedsheets but I wash them and change it every week, I even stayed away from my home for almost 2 months(stayed at different hotels, my boyfriend's apartment, my friend's apartment) and the acne on my sideburns are still growing after clearing it over and over again. So it's definitely not the bedsheets.\n\nThen I suspected it could be my gaming headset since it has a fabric material around the ears area, so I bought myself a new and better gaming headset and prayed that was it. But no, the acnes are still growing every 4-5 days and then disappear and reappear again. Now I'm left with so many pigmentated acne scars and feelings the bumps on my sideburns. I'm feeling very insecure and I don't know what to do, I never have this issue before and it has been 5 months now. My skin have always been so clear and okayish(also thanks to my asian ancestors I guess).\n\nProducts that I use: Beauty of Joseon(eyecream, sunscreen, redbean mask, ground rice mask), Anua (cleansing oil and foam, niacinamide 10% serum), I'm from rice toner, Dr. Althea Vitamin C serum, La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ cream and Mediheal lipbalm.\n\nIs there anything wrong with that products that I use or what can I change? Any suggestions what might cause my acne only on the area around sideburn? Any advices please, I'm so insecure! 🙏🏼😭\n\nAlso, apologies for my horrendous English. I can barely understand myself as well, I'm so sorry. 💕",

I use a gly/sal cleanser every morning and usually clean with water pat-dry use micellar water pat-dry again and then use BPO gel 10%. PM I use a salicylic acid wipe, rinse with micellar water. then moisturize with an oil free moisturize, and seal with petroleum jelly for an hour. before I go to bed I rinse with m water and use 1-2 salicylic acid wipes. On particularly large/ inflamed pimples I put on cosrx patches before bed. I’ve been struggling with this for years so if anyone could let me know what products they recommend I’d be greatful Im thinking abt Adapalene but I’m no expert.

      "content": "hello everyone! please ignore my greasy hair haha. a few months ago i dermaplaned my face pretty frequently for a couple weeks. i started getting these very small, colourless bumps on my chin, so i decided to start using several different actives every day (glycolic acid, azelaic acid, and salicylic acid) and my skin continued to get more red, irritated, and bumpy. i was also very stressed during this time, and was frequently picking at my skin. it only got worse, so for some reason i thought the best idea was to scrub my face with a harsh washcloth DAILY. i realize i dug myself into a hole by continuing to damage my barrier, i have NO idea why i thought being harsher to my skin would improve it. \n\ncurrent routine: life brand gentle skin cleanser, nécessaire the body serum (i know it’s for your body but it works well on my skin) and benzagel after care moisturizing lotion. i do the same thing morning and night, but in the morning i use neutrogena hydro boost with spf; on more irritated days i use aloe gel on my chin as well. \n\nplease reccomend any products that could help with this, and also anything in my routine that may be exacerbating it. thank you all :)",

I finish off with the SPF.\n\nFor the night, I just use the moisturizer and cream.\n\nTwice a week I use an azelaic acid from the ordinary, and once a week a salicylic acid also from the ordinary.\n\nI don’t understand why my nose is so oily, am I using too much cream or too little? Should I moisturize more or less? Are there any other products I should use that maybe are better han these ones?",

My son is only 18 months but his hair is very different from mine so I just want to make sure I’m taking good care of it and not under or overusing product, etc.!\n\nThe back of his hair has some coils and the top of his hair is more a mix of both lose and tighter curls, I think because he had straight hair as a newborn and we’ve never cut it, so some of it is still up there.\n\nRight now:\n\n1. I wash his hair only once a week with Not Your Mothers Kids Curly Care Shampoo and Conditioner. I then spray it with So Cozy Kids Detangler and Leave in Conditioner and comb through it with wide tooth comb.\n2. Every other night I just get it wet in the bath and use the detangler/leave in conditioner and comb it.\n3. In the mornings, I just get it wet, use the same detangler and comb through it with my fingers/separate the curls\n4. It always air dries.\n\nShould I be using less detangler, combing less, or using a refresher/curl oil in the morning? Any tips/product suggestions would help! I have very fine and straight hair so just looking for guidance on our routine. Thank you so much!\n\nEdit: I have been also looking at curl type charts and the top of his head LOOKS 3A and the back LOOKS 4A/B. I’m not actually sure and I’m sure it’ll change as he gets older, as it already has so much, but just want to start it off healthy. Thank you again so much for helping this Mama out!",
