      "title": "I aggregated hundreds of hair loss experiences. Here’s what actually shows up.",
      "content": "So… I’ve been scraping and aggregating user experiences from hair loss subs and forums, mostly to see what patterns show up when you look at hundreds of reports.\n\nSome of this lines up with what everyone already says. Some of it honestly surprised me, especially timelines and side effect frequencies.\n\n**Stuff that, umm, actually seems to work:**\n\nFinasteride (oral) + minoxidil is still the base for most people. When I looked at long-term success stories (like 5–20+ years), this combo is everywhere. A lot of people just maintain. Some even say hair quality got darker or thicker over time.\n\nRU58841 shows up a lot in aggressive stacks and usually with good stabilization. That said… the vehicle debate is real. PG versions seem to cause way more irritation and nonstop shedding for some people. Glycerin seems gentler but maybe worse absorption. Kind of a tradeoff.\n\nMicroneedling at \\~1.5mm weekly is almost universal in regrowth stacks that actually worked. The “it helps topicals absorb better” thing seems legit when you zoom out.\n\nOral minoxidil gets called a game changer constantly. But yeah, the early shedding freaks people out. Around 1–1.5 months a lot of users see nothing or worse and quit. People who stick it out usually see results around months 4–6.\n\nDutasteride is very much the nuclear option when fin isn’t enough. Switching often causes a shed first, then big improvement later. Also weirdly common to see people say their DHT stayed high despite being on it.\n\nLLLT laser caps show up in long, multi-year protocols. People feel good about them… but constantly debate whether the price is worth whatever they’re actually contributing.\n\n**Side effects that don’t get talked about much individually, but show up at scale:**\n\nFin sexual sides. Yeah, controversial. Aggregated, around \\~2–3% report persistent issues. Plenty of people run it for years with zero sides. Both things are clearly happening.\n\nOral minoxidil systemic concerns. Tons of people love it, but there’s always background anxiety about heart or BP stuff, even when users personally feel fine.\n\nRU58841 is not forgiving. Miss doses or stop and some people report rapid loss. This isn’t like fin where you can be casual.\n\n**Stuff that surprised me:**\n\nThe pumpkin / flax / sesame seed “natural DHT blocker” thing. Evidence is weak, community is skeptical… but one anecdote reported insanely low daily shedding and visible improvement. Worth a mention, not a recommendation.\n\nFluridil seems kind of underused. Shows up as a low-risk, entry-level topical anti-androgen with stabilization over \\~3–6 months.\n\nIntermittent fasting potentially triggering hair loss. Some studies suggest it may suppress follicle regeneration, and that actually lines up with anecdotes. Which is… not what you’d expect.\n\n**Quick reality check:**\n\nDoes this match what you’ve seen?  \nAm I missing anything big?  \nDo these timelines sound right?\n\nI’m doing this because hair loss marketing is pretty predatory, and clinical data is limited and sanitized. Aggregated real experiences are messy and biased, but maybe still useful.\n\nI’ve turned this into a [dataset](https://modernrelay.com/davidjohn10/hair-loss-insights), but wanted community feedback before sharing it more widely.\n\nAnyway… what am I missing?",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Burns, cuts, pimples—you name it. It works quickly and soothes the skin really well. Apparently, it can also be consumed for digestive or internal issues, but I haven’t personally tried that.\n\n2.\tBoronil – Super effective for dry or irritated skin. I like to keep it on hand; it’s like an Ayurvedic moisturizer with healing properties. I use it for face lips and hands.\n\n3.\tTup Anjan (ghee-based eye balm) – This one’s underrated! I use it for dry or tired eyes, and surprisingly, it helps me sleep better too.\n\nWould love to hear if others have discovered lesser-known Ayurvedic or traditional remedies that actually work for everyday use.

I mean truly hellacious amounts of it, my skin soaks it all up.\n\nI work outside at a barn in the morning for a few hours and all day with my hands stocking at a grocery store. My hands are probably a lost cause tbh with how often I thrust them into cardboard boxes, but I would love some tips for my face.

      "content": "Hi everyone - I’m at my wits end with my acne and am finally turning to Reddit for some advice. I apologize in advance for the length and am super appreciative of any advice you have to offer!!\n\nI have been on an acne journey for the last 15 years. I struggled heavily with hormonal acne in high school. I started with birth control pills which helped my chest/back but didn’t help my face. My parents didn’t want me to jump straight to Accutane so I tried literally every topical and pill first - clyndamyacin, doxycycline, tretinoin, minocycline (pill &amp; topical), benzoyl peroxide, etc. I even went to an Amish doctor that prescribed a bunch of herbal supplements which - shocker - didn’t work. I finally went on Accutane and my skin was perfectly clear for about a year and a half and then it came back, although not as intense. I tried doxycycline again bc they said acne can become less resistant to medicines after a round of Accutane but it was still persistent. A few years after, I tried Accutane for a second time but had the same result - clear skin for 18 months only for it to come back with a vengeance. I started Spironolactone shortly after and it helped but I was still dealing with small breakouts every week. After a few years of this, and losing faith in dermatologists that would only suggest a third round of Accutane and offer no other solutions, I finally decided to cut off dermatologists and go to an esthetician. I got chemical peels for 5-6 months in a row and finally felt like I had my hormonal acne somewhat under control. About 6 months after this, I relocated to a different part of the country and faced a new issue: fungal acne. I was diagnosed by an esthetician who basically said I had to scrap my whole skincare routine for FA safe, which I did, and my FA cleared. Of course right after this, my hormonal acne came back. \n\nAnd now I’m truly at a loss for what to do next. I’ve been considering TCM/acupuncture as a next step, but also wondering if I should just invest in a hormonal balancing supplement (do these even work!)? or do I bite the bullet and go back on Accutane (6 years since my last round)?? \n\nI wash my pillowcases 1/week and flip my pillows every night. I’ve tried cutting dairy but that didn’t help. My current skincare is Malezia cleanser, moisturizer, and benzoyl peroxide and I exfoliate a couple times a week w Paula’s Choice BHA. \n\nTLDR; i have a mix of persistent hormonal and fungal acne. I’ve tried Accutane twice and multiple topical and oral medications over the years. What do I do next??",

Face cleared up significantly but still some breakouts.\n* Late autumn - winter of 2025: Increased breakouts, usually around my mouth, along with redness and tingling. I suspected a damaged skin barrier from the cleanser, so end of winter, I switched to using only a gentle foaming cleanser and moisturizer. I think it did help as my face was clear for a week or two.\n\n**Fast forward to this week:** Over the weekend, I had a whole colony of pimples suddenly pop up around my mouth and chin area and on my lip. Because it’s a sudden and pretty bad breakout, I've been trying to narrow down the cause for this and hopefully also address the constant small breakouts around my mouth/chin.\n\n* **Dirt**: I did a more thorough clean of my rabbit's area earlier in the day before I discovered the pimple colony later that night. Can a reaction like pimples happen that fast from dirt/dust?\n* **Sugar**: At one point last year, I did lessen the amount of sugar I ate, and I suppose it helped with the spiro, given the hormonal acne? Unfortunately in late 2025, I couldn't resist the temptation and reverted back to eating more sugar, so maybe this is the price I'm paying haha. But can sugar cause a sudden explosion of pimples? I'm cutting my sugar intake regardless.\n* I saw some similar posts mentioning **perioral dermatitis**? But I don’t use topical steroid, my toothpaste is SLS free.\n* Should I go back to using benzyl peroxide cleanser to clean it up? Or continue with my gentle foam cleanser? Hesitant to use stronger products since I believe I did damage my skin barrier last year.\n\nCurious if anyone else had a situation like this. I'd appreciate insight on what might be causing this sudden explosion of acne or advice on how to tackle this.",

      "content": "My husband has been keenly watching stuff i use on a regular basis and was kind enough to restock these.\n\nok truth is he was just checking out a new quick comm app for skincare (he himself works for a bigger quick comm company) and was getting a hefty new use discount, but i am just proud he at least got my products right!\n\nQuick reviews:\n\n**1. La Roche-Posay Cicablast Baume B5+**\n\n**10/10 HG**\n\nI’ve been getting this product (incidentally, through a friend of my husband’s) for over a year now because I have very dry eczema prone skin. And I love this shit. my biggest gripe is that i run out of it so soon. It’s a thick THICK occlusive cream which I apply as the last step in my PM routine and wake up with “healthy” feeling skin.\n\n**2. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume**\n\n**8/10 Will always RP**\n\nThis one feels a lot more hydrating than LRP if that makes sense? So typically I use this in the mornings when I am not layering too many products and I need the same moisturiser to hydrate and seal\n\n**3. Skin1004 Centella Light Cleansing Oil**\n\n**8/10 Will always RP**\n\nSo I use this because my absolute holy grail Softymo Speedy is very hard to source in India. This one is lightweight though and smells really really good \n\n**4. numbuzin no. 2 protein creamy serum**\n\n**9/10 WRP**\n\nI am fairly new to this. But the texture of this has to be the best I have ever used and I have used a ton of milky toners. It’s actually thicker than milky toners/ usual serums, almost a body lotion texture if you will.  Thats why I love it so much for my DRY dry skin\n\nI am just not very sure if I absolutely need this in my routine given that I already use so many other barrier repair products all the time. But most likely will repurchase just to have it handy for extra dry days. \n\n**5. Skin1004 Centella Sunstick**\n\n**9/10 Will always RP**\n\nHeadsup: I don’t use it over makeup. I just reapply through the day when i am not wearing makeup using this because it feels like nothing on your skin. not sticky not heavy. Love it for that reason \n\nCiao✨",

I started seeing a dermatologist at 18, and while the acne has mostly been controlled, the pigmentation has never truly improved.\n\nWhat treatments I’ve tried\n\n\t•\tTopical creams prescribed by my dermatologist\n\n\t•\tChemical peels — they temporarily even out my skin for about 1–2 weeks, but the pigmentation always comes back\n\n\t•\tI’ve been prescribed Golite cream multiple times, but I honestly don’t see any noticeable improvement\n\nMy current routine (derm-prescribed)\n\n\t•\tAcne Moist moisturizer\n\n\t•\tGolite cream\n\n\t•\tEye cream for dark circles\n\nCurrent concerns\n\n\t•\tVery dull, oily skin (no glow or freshness)\n\n\t•\tDark circles (I know poor sleep contributes)\n\n\t•\tSignificant pigmentation, especially:\n\n\t•\tNeck (I was born with torticollis, which may have contributed)\n\n\t•\tFace (uneven pigmentation)\n\n\t•\tUnderarms\n\n\t•\tOverall tanning on my body\n\n\t•\tMy face looks aged and tired for my age\n\nSunscreen issues (major problem)\n\nAlmost every sunscreen I try pills or leaves a heavy white cast:\n\n\t•\tAcne UV — terrible white cast\n\n\t•\tAcne Wash sunscreen — same issue\n\n\t•\tMinimalist sunscreen — feels weird on my skin and doesn’t fully absorb\n\nBecause of this, I end up using far less than the recommended amount, which I know defeats the purpose.\n\nEven with moisturizer, my skin still looks flat, lifeless, and dull, not healthy or youthful.\n\nMy questions\n\n\t•\tIs repeated chemical peeling really the best approach for long-term pigmentation?\n\n\t•\tWhy might Golite not be working, even after consistent use?\n\n\t•\tWhat kind of treatment or routine actually helps with:\n\n\t•\tChronic pigmentation\n\n\t•\tDull, oily skin\n\n\t•\tEarly signs of aging\n\n\t•\tHow do I fix sunscreen pilling and absorption on oily skin?\n\n\t•\tShould I consider changing dermatologists or asking for different treatment options?\n\nI’m feeling quite stuck because I’ve been consistent and patient, but I don’t see real progress. I just want my skin to look healthy, fresh, and age-appropriate again.\n\nAny advice, experiences, or product/treatment suggestions would be really helpful.\n\nThank you in advance 🤍",

However, due to how fine my hair is, there is always a lot of leftover space in my bonnet, and I end up sleeping on my curls and crushing them.

I’ve been trying to find a bonnet that keeps my hair all the way off the back of my head and piled on top instead, but haven’t had much luck. I even tricked myself into thinking I could just add more product to my hair and that would keep it nice even if I slept on it, but obviously that didn’t work (my normal routine is just mousse applied to damp hair, diffused and finished with hairspray, because adding much else really weighs my hair down!). \n\nFrom what I can tell, an ideal bonnet for me would be small, have a wide band, and have most of its space up on top of my head (if there’s a bonnet with ruching at the nape of the neck, I think that might help?), but honestly I’m willing to try anything!

TLDR: I’m (25f) in need of some advice and product recommendations (more on the affordable side) that will hydrate and plump my skin similar to the Byoma phyto-mucin glow serum as it’s giving me closed comedones.\n\nI started using the Byoma phyto-mucin glow serum a few weeks ago and my skin seemed to LOVE it at first.  I have combo to dry skin and it really does help plump and hydrate my skin but now my face is not happy and I have little bumps on my cheeks and forehead. I’ve been super lucky and never had issues with acne or texture on my skin of any sort other than a few blemishes around my cycle and I’m definitely not trying to start now.\n\nAnother issue is I’m not sure if it is an ingredient in the product or just the product as a whole that has caused this. I’m pretty new to skincare and haven’t experimented a lot.\n\nFull disclosure - I’m lazy when it comes to my skincare. I don’t wear daily makeup other mascara and I wash my face usually every other day, just in the evenings and it’s always worked for me. My routine is simple, usually is just:\n\n1.\t⁠Tula cult classic cleanser\n\n2.\t⁠Byoma phyto-mucin glow (going to stop this now)\n\n3.\t⁠Cocokind electrolyte cream\n\nI was using The Ordinary Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner (I stopped this because I thought it was the issue even though I used it for 2 months no issue, issues started with Byoma and have continued/gotten worse). I’m on the fence on whether it’s worth resuming this.\n\nThe reason I tried introducing this into my routine (or lack of lol) was I feel like my skin is so thirsty and was just looking dull and noticeably dehydrated. I’m also hoping to stay relatively affordable which is part of the reason I tried the Byoma serum in the first place.\n\nThanks in advance!!",

I even alternate between methods like blow drying, revlon brush, or flat iron. I usually use a heat protectant since I’m doing it so often like the Tresemme one, and sometimes I put a little argan oil after. \n\nWhen I go outside, water/ humidity is my worst enemy, but my hair stays straight for the most part. Now for the title, I really want bangs but I’m scared it’ll be way more upkeep than I can handle or they’d look hideous. Are there any tips on how to keep them set in place and not need to wash or straighten them often? I hair shower about 2-3 times a week. \n\nI been thinking about it for a long time and any tips would be helpful if you’re in a similar situation! Thank you:)",

Lately a friend of mine is making me notice that my nose is rather shiny; I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong in my skin care, mind you I’m a man and I’m not that much informed on the matter :,)\n\nIn the morning I wash my face with water, gently tap around with a towel, then I use the moisturizer on the middle of the picture and wash my face again.\n\nAfter that I apply a little bit of volufiline on my under eye area and cheekbones, I wait a little and I use the cream on the left. I finish off with the SPF.\n\nFor the night, I just use the moisturizer and cream.\n\nTwice a week I use an azelaic acid from the ordinary, and once a week a salicylic acid also from the ordinary.\n\nI don’t understand why my nose is so oily, am I using too much cream or too little? Should I moisturize more or less? Are there any other products I should use that maybe are better han these ones?",
