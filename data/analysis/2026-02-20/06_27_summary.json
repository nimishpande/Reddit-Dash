I have severely senstive acne prone skin. \n\nAM: Just water on a clean skin club towel (I've tried wash cloths and they dry me out. \n\nVanicream daily facial moisturizer \n\nBubble solarmate mineral sunscreen (the yellow tube)\n\nPM: LA Roche Posay toleriane gentle hydrating cleanser \n\nVanicream daily facial moisturizer \n\nIf I'm wearing makeup I use a clean skin club towel and the blue garnier micellar water to remove it. \n\nI've struggled with this type of acne since I was 16. It lead to awful skin picking. I was miserable and couldn't find out what the issues was. I finally found it was my skincare causing it after I stopped all products and my skin cleared up.\n\n The first picture is from 2015, the 2nd from 2022, and the last is from today. It took me so long to find products that didn' t break me out. I realized I had severely senstive skin and have found a laundry list of ingredients and products I can't use. I've struggled with brands reformulating and not being able to use things I once could and having to start all over again.\n\nWhile my skin is very sensitive it is combination as well. It gets dried out very easily but if I use anything slightly too heavy it becomes very oily and gets severe acne. \n\nI still struggle with redness and the occasional break out. I'm also turning 30 soon and am not sure how exploring anti-aging is going to go since I have such sensitive skin. Right now I am so happy with where my skin is. It is such a relief to not finally have a routine that doesn't do more harm than good. \n\nI also want to add I do not have on any filters or makeup. The sunscreen gives a nice soft glowy finish while not being tinted.  \n\nIf anyone wants a list of products that didn't work for me I have a list I would be glad to share! ",

      "content": "Hello skincare addicts, sharing my journey with skin, expectations, and a bit of self-realization.\nI’m 38M. For most of my life, skincare simply wasn’t something I thought about. No proper routine, no sunscreen, and very little attention to skin health overall.\nMy work later required long hours outdoors, often sunrise to night, several days a week, for a few years. Constant sun exposure, dust, and heat gradually took a toll on my skin and hair. At the time, I didn’t really notice because it was just part of the job.\nIn 2022, a small incident made me pause and look at myself more closely. I happened to really observe my skin in the mirror for the first time in years and realized how much sun damage, tanning, and uneven pigmentation had built up over time. That was the moment I started thinking seriously about skincare.\nAround 2024, I began following skincare discussions on Reddit and social media. Seeing people’s progress motivated me to improve my own skin.\nBut enthusiasm quickly turned into overdoing things.\nI started buying almost every product people recommended, serums, creams, actives without fully understanding what suited my skin. I ended up with more products than I could realistically finish, and mixing things randomly actually irritated my skin instead of helping.\nI did consult a dermatologist and was given a basic routine, but I kept getting distracted by new recommendations instead of sticking to consistency.\nRecently, after learning more about skincare fundamentals and setting realistic expectations,\nI accepted a few important things:\nSkincare takes time and consistency matters more than product quantity.\nYears of sun exposure won’t reverse quickly.\nGenetics determine baseline skin tone, chasing fairness isn’t realistic.\nHealthy, comfortable skin should be the goal, not lighter skin.\nThat realization simplified things for me mentally.\nNow I follow a minimal routine: cleansing, moisturizing, sunscreen, and patience. No product hoarding, no rushing, just steady care. Honestly, this approach feels much better both physically and mentally.\nStill learning and open to advice, I’d genuinely appreciate constructive feedback or shared experiences.\n\nAlso, these are the products I currently have not including the ones already in use or the ones I’ve finished.\n\nTL;DR\nIgnored skincare for years → sun damage → product overload → irritated skin → reality check. Now keeping it simple and focusing on healthy skin, not fairness.",

Routine is shea moisture shampoo (around once every 3 days though I've tried doing more often AND tries less often and neither have really changed much), NYM conditioner, NYM sea salt spray + Garnier leave in conditioner. Whether I use a diffuser or not doesn't change the result at all for me :(( I think I have a 2c hair type? Though my hair is so straight sometimes you'd think it went to a conversion camp :/ Any advice is appreciated.

Their hair grows. It’s called science. You didn’t invent evolution.\n\nLet’s talk about your lack of common sense - you aren’t even a brand that specializes in children. What was the reason you used an infant in an advertisement, in order to have parents feel that their child is growing at an unacceptable rate?\n\nThis isn’t marketing, it’s desperation and to do so using an innocent infant.\n\nShould you, instead of using infants to gain emotional sympathy, focus your time on developing a solid product for adults?

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

It’s very cheap and gives you so much more control than regular spray bottles. I’ve found that my hair absorbs products better and maximizes volume more on damp hair rather than soaking wet hair, which is how I used to apply my products.\n\nI also ordered microfiber towels from Amazon and stopped using regular shower towels. Lately I’ve been dealing with a lot of frizz. Normally I don’t mind frizz at all and think it adds character, but it’s been excessive, so I’ve been finger coiling more and it definitely helps tame everything better.\n\nOverall, this routine has made a noticeable difference in how my curls look and feel, especially with volume and frizz control. I’m still tweaking things, but I’ve been really happy with the results so far and wanted to share in case it helps anyone else.",

Its mainly a cosmetic issue (colour/texture change).\n\nI have been to three different dermatologists and got different opinions:\n\n* One diagnosed it as lichen amyloidosis\n* Another said its chronic inflammation\n* Another said its something that can’t really be “fixed” and is cosmetic\n\nI have been using prescribed creams and moisturisers, but I am not sure if its helping much.
