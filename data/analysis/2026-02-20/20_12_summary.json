I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

That's where the pictures begin. After struggling to get a good hair cut, I finally found my curly cut girl in a friend who had just finished an intensive course on curly hair (pic 8).\n\nBy convincing me to go back to short, she saved me and I have felt gorgeous and cool af since. I'm growing it out now, I want a short bob as shown in pic 5 (you can't tell the back was a hot mess) just because I think it really highlights the beautiful silver of my hair and shows off I have ridic telephone cord curls. Honestly, I know I'll cut it short again, probably before it gets long enough to call a bob lol!\n\nIt took too long, but I am so glad I finally got fed up with trying to mimic white beauty standards when I'm a proud Puerto Rican. I feel like me 100% and I see a beautiful, whole person who owns herself when I look in the mirror. I look like my mom again and that is so comforting. I feel sexy and I must be because I get beau coups of attention now, when before my unnatural hair just didn't suit me (I see that now). I am so happy.\n\nMy mom always tells me to not get so emotional over my hair, but it's been a source of pain my whole life. I have been harassed, touched against my will, had my hair yanked, had many people make racist comments, the list goes on. I am reclaiming my beauty now. No one can tell me anything other than \"you have beautiful curls!\" and \"your silver is amazing!!\" or I'll Miss Piggy karate chop them—hiiiiii-yah!!!!! I am so proud of myself for removing what was a huge thorn in my side.\n\nRoutine: I use the tgin rosewater collection. Shampoo, conditioner, leave-in mixed with a little castor oil, then hair lotion. I twist then scrunch, then let air dry and scrunch/fluff it again for body.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

      "content": "Hi everyone, I'm in need of some advice or product recommendations; primarily conditioner and 1-2 styling products. For the last 3 years I have been on an exhausting journey to find truly fragrance free products that make my curls look, at the very least, decent-ish. I have very fine hair that is prone to frizz and without products with a lot of slip, my hair looks like an absolute mess. For a long time I was using Innersense I Create Volume and it gave me the most gorgeous, smooth, shiny, well-defined curls of my life. Sadly, due to contact allergies I had to stop using it. I have tried so many products and have switched back and forth because the reviews were so positive, but my experience with them was very much lacking.\n\n  \nCurrently, I don't have a very set routine as I have been cycling in and out of products, but this is what I am currently using:\n\n1. Shampoo 1x a week (more or less as needed) with SEEN shampoo.\n\n2. Condition daily with Ouidad Unbreakable Bonds Fragrance-Free conditioner (pretty sure I'm allergic to this and will be removing it from my routine)\n\n3. Apply SEEN Curly Cream and Color WOW Dream Coat for Curly Hair. \n\n4. Scrunch out excess water and plop in hair towel before air drying. \n\n  \nThis routine is kind of meh and only about 50% of the overall satisfaction I'm looking for, but its the best I've come up with so far. As far as other products I've used, its as follows:\n\n  \n\\* VaniCream/Free &amp; Clear Shampoo and Conditioner -- Shampoo completely stripped my hair and I had to use an enormous amount of the conditioner to keep my hair soft.\n\n\\*VaniCream/Free &amp; Clear Styling Gel -- Way too heavy even in small amounts. Left my hair limp and crunchy even after scrunching all day. \n\n\\* Innersense Clarity Shampoo and Conditioner -- Worked really well but ended up being allergic to it. \n\n\\* LOVE UR CURLS 3-in-1 Styling product -- Too sticky and left my hair frizzy and limp. \n\n\\* Curlsmith Fragrance Free Conditioner -- Definitely NOT fragrance free. Contained allergens. \n\n\\* SEEN Conditioner -- Again, had to use a bunch of it to achieve a desirable effect. \n\n\\* SEEN Hair Serum -- Even one drop mixed in with other products left my hair greasy. \n\n\\* Color WOW Dream Coat -- Truly fragrance free and helped with frizz, but it left my hair a bit shapeless on its own. \n\n\n\nWhat I have recently tried but have yet to fully incorporate into my routine:\n\n\\* The Ordinary Behentrimonium Chloride 2% Conditioner -- Read a lot of revies about how it was very high slip and made curls look great. However, my experience has been that it is NOT high slip and didn't leave my hair very soft. \n\n\\*FRAGFRE Styling Gel -- Read that it was a very strong hold and to water it down. Tried it straight and cut with other products. Either way the application of it left my hair limp and very... poofy? \n\n\n\nPlease help. ",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I have seen Torriden Dive In smoothing cream , Celinax Dual Barrier Cream or Avene mentioned on here a lot.\n\nIs one better than the other? Should I look into a different moisturizer? Is a moisturizer a good idea to layer over the other two products or should I use a different method?\n\nI’m afraid of breaking out again or the bumps coming back.\n\nAny feedback using either or recommendations for moisturizer for barrier damaged skin?\n\nI appreciate the feedback!",
