I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

I miss my hair and l am so devastated. Any experts can please give me any suggestions or timelines, or someone who have gone through a similar experience who can guide me to tell me when will it start feeling better again? Or the shelf will drop.\n\nI had a very long classic one length hair, no layers at all and I ended up with this mushroom like haircut.\n\nMy routine: shampoo, conditioner, a hydrating mask from garnier hair food. Then curly cream from Shia moister and mousse from Shia moister. I use a styling brush to separate the curls. I air dry it and use a silk Bonnet to sleep. I oil it once a week with Jojoba and I use flax seed gel Mask. I refresh once.",

Second picture is the before, third pic is compared to my hair back in October (a haircut I didn’t hate). \n\nI asked for layers to solve the problem I had with my “before” pic. The ends were so dead that the long layers that had grown out gathered at my shoulders and all the scraggly dead pieces just hung at the ends. I wanted some layers to lift everything and fix the triangle shape that was growing in. I asked her not to cut the face framing pieces too much but she ended up cutting nearly 4 inches. \n\nThe side-by-side pic looks similar but still I can’t quite put my finger on why the new haircut looks so bad to me. Is it just too round? Are the face framing pieces too chunky? I can’t figure out why I dislike this new haircut so much. All I see are poodle ears by my eyes. Any help or insight is appreciated!!!\n\nRoutine: Scrunch with mousse and gel after washing. Air and some light blow drying. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I'm in need of some advice or product recommendations; primarily conditioner and 1-2 styling products. For the last 3 years I have been on an exhausting journey to find truly fragrance free products that make my curls look, at the very least, decent-ish. I have very fine hair that is prone to frizz and without products with a lot of slip, my hair looks like an absolute mess. For a long time I was using Innersense I Create Volume and it gave me the most gorgeous, smooth, shiny, well-defined curls of my life. Sadly, due to contact allergies I had to stop using it. I have tried so many products and have switched back and forth because the reviews were so positive, but my experience with them was very much lacking.\n\n  \nCurrently, I don't have a very set routine as I have been cycling in and out of products, but this is what I am currently using:\n\n1. Shampoo 1x a week (more or less as needed) with SEEN shampoo.\n\n2. Condition daily with Ouidad Unbreakable Bonds Fragrance-Free conditioner (pretty sure I'm allergic to this and will be removing it from my routine)\n\n3. Apply SEEN Curly Cream and Color WOW Dream Coat for Curly Hair. \n\n4. Scrunch out excess water and plop in hair towel before air drying. \n\n  \nThis routine is kind of meh and only about 50% of the overall satisfaction I'm looking for, but its the best I've come up with so far. As far as other products I've used, its as follows:\n\n  \n\\* VaniCream/Free &amp; Clear Shampoo and Conditioner -- Shampoo completely stripped my hair and I had to use an enormous amount of the conditioner to keep my hair soft.\n\n\\*VaniCream/Free &amp; Clear Styling Gel -- Way too heavy even in small amounts. Left my hair limp and crunchy even after scrunching all day. \n\n\\* Innersense Clarity Shampoo and Conditioner -- Worked really well but ended up being allergic to it. \n\n\\* LOVE UR CURLS 3-in-1 Styling product -- Too sticky and left my hair frizzy and limp. \n\n\\* Curlsmith Fragrance Free Conditioner -- Definitely NOT fragrance free. Contained allergens. \n\n\\* SEEN Conditioner -- Again, had to use a bunch of it to achieve a desirable effect. \n\n\\* SEEN Hair Serum -- Even one drop mixed in with other products left my hair greasy. \n\n\\* Color WOW Dream Coat -- Truly fragrance free and helped with frizz, but it left my hair a bit shapeless on its own. \n\n\n\nWhat I have recently tried but have yet to fully incorporate into my routine:\n\n\\* The Ordinary Behentrimonium Chloride 2% Conditioner -- Read a lot of revies about how it was very high slip and made curls look great. However, my experience has been that it is NOT high slip and didn't leave my hair very soft. \n\n\\*FRAGFRE Styling Gel -- Read that it was a very strong hold and to water it down. Tried it straight and cut with other products. Either way the application of it left my hair limp and very... poofy? \n\n\n\nPlease help. ",

I understand that diet is important for general skin health but my diet has been quite alright and basically the same since the last 3-4 years, no major changes.\n\nI have been struggling with acne , although mild but recently flared up quite badly, and i am really looking for a scientific based routine that is shown effective to treat acne, i am tired of experimenting with otc products all the time with little to no improvement.\n\nNow i wonder if it is even worth it to consider another dermatologist or just give up on my acne ever clearing. Are dermatologists in india like this ?? Or is it just my luck with these specific ones. I’m really feeling hopeless and need advice about this, should i find a different dermatologist??\n\nI’m 21F, had acne since 14–15.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I’ve been experimenting recently with different hairdressers, I usually go for a cut/blowdry or a bit of colour, nothing major. But each one has told me my hair has a curl to it so it’s made me naturally curious. So some background. My mum is Jamaican and my dad is asian. My mum has really curly African Caribbean hair. I did some research and I don’t believe my hair is curly as such but may have a slight wave to it. I got some weightless products (I’ve got fine hair) and trialled it this evening. Honest opinions and advice please. My hair is dry but looks wet which I don’t like, and I’m only a beginner. Is it true the more you style it natural then my waves will become more visible? Also I’ve noticed the inside of my hair is way wavier than the outside. Thanks!\n\nMy routine was just a curly gel and mouse post shower, I scrunched it whilst it was wet and added some serum once dried. ",

      "content": "I have fine hair but a lot of it. It’s dirty blonde so it sometimes looks thinner around my hair line. I can’t tell if it’s 1C, 2A, or 2B. It doesn’t hold full curls well but it gives me effortless loose beach waves if I brush my hair while it’s wet and then I don’t touch it. Straightens fast with blow dryer and round brush. My ends are still a bit bleach damaged from previous dye but I’m slowly cutting it away with trims. I just asked for another trim so I’m waiting for a reply. I have to keep my hair longer for my friend’s wedding in May. I am VERY bad at braiding my hair as I can’t keep my hands above my head long enough for me to braid it without losing feeling in my hands (health issues I cope well with in every other way except that) and the design of the hard hat and vest combo is destroying my hair. My old hard hat I could put in a bun in my hard hat. This one I can’t. My polyester vest is also knotting my hair at the base of my neck. Also I have hard water that recently has gotten worse and started ruining the hardware in the house. I am not in a position to just up and get a water softener yet but that’s up to my family if we want to pay to get in installed soon.\n\nNon negotiable in advice: \n\n\\-I shower everyday and sometimes sadly twice a day. I get acne BAD if I skip a day and I work in construction. Daily hair wash is a must. I have to get off construction dirt and I sweat in my sleep pretty bad no matter what I do. I cannot skip days for hair washing. \n\n\\-I have to use the blow dryer on my hair in the morning. This week when I left the house at 4:30AM it was 37° with ice on my windshield. We start outside early in the morning. I will end up with frozen hair and breaking hair from the cold.  \n\n\\-I am in a professional role (safety) so wearing protective styles you’d see commonly with welders and such doesn’t work as well for attending meetings and such. Sadly. \n\nAdvice I am looking for: \n\n\\-Affordable products if possible but I’m willing to buy some pro level stuff that help with keeping hair silky and not broken.\n\n\\-Hair styling/braiding tips that actually are easy to do early in the morning on blow dried clean hair and fast too.\n\n\\-overall advice for hair care\n\nThings I’ve tried and like but maybe haven’t figured out the right way to do it:\n\n\\-Silicone based hair “oil” in wet hair then blow dry. (The best results so far. I just ran out of mine so I am trying a different one I have #projectpan)\n\n\\-Tried the wonder water once recently, advice welcome on how to use it best. I liked the results but it’s new to me. \n\nI am trying to find a way to do the Abby young method but I’m a bit lost on it since it’s all so short form and a lot of scrolling and hunting info and questions. \n\nI understand this is a complicated request. I’ve been experimenting for months now. I know it’s a pain. I know I won’t get a perfect answer. I am willing to accept and try most things. I am just trying to minimize the mess. Putting my hair in a bun or pony tail is causing hair pulling and scalp tension in this new safety helmet and letting my hair down is causing knots and serious damage. I just want to stop so much breakage. I hate that I can’t do typical protective things (plus it gets hot with this hard hat and the extra layers end up too hot on my head). ",

My mother (age 45) is facing this type of face dullness, or what is it called in dermat no idea?\n\nI'm thinking of going to a dermatologist, but there isn't one in my city. Maybe there is one, but her reviews were very bad. So I decided to ask here. I understand people here have more knowledge compared to normal dermat 🙂\n\nOne more thing she never had skincare routine. I think she never cared for​ it. (Maybe she was only using fair &amp; lovely). But this time the condition getting worse.\n\nSo experienced ppls please help and suggest good skincare routine along with product suggestions... ",

After going to the Barber a year ago, i used to use a curly hair mousse that helped me shape my hair to a visible curly style. The problem: They had a certain sheen since it also supported the hair being shiny and it was a little sticky and the foam reeked after half a year of using (the leftover foam in the bottle).\n\nSince then i have 1. started cutting my own hair, only cutting the edges a little and using new products.\n\nI have tested a lot between Bali curls Hydrating cream, curl defining gel and curlz volume mousse, up to John Frieda Frizz Ease, Yunsey Curly method Conditioner, gliss kur arganoil, Nivea hairmilk and pantene pro v style mousse fix.\n\nMy general routine:\n\n1.\t⁠Washing hair (either with cantu shea butter cleansing shampoo for curls and waves or only with water.\n\n2.\t⁠Use a towel to dry hair with smooth scrunching\n\n3.\t⁠Apply conditioner and follow the rules (its between Bali curls curlz volume mousse or Yunsey Curly method conditioner.\n\n4.\t⁠Let the Hair either dry by air if i have time or use a diffuser if im tight on time\n\n5.\t⁠Either use the pantene pro v style mousse fix or the hydrating cream from bali curls.\n\nIf i wash my hair, use a towel to carefully crunch/dry them and then use conditioner with the crunchy method, letting them dry slowly on fresh air, only my curls on the front fall really well, while the rest looks like chaos or goes into a mix of curly and straight. The top of the head being completely straight (no curls).\n\nWhen i dry them and use the mousse fix, they go very soft and light but more into an open chaos than defined curls.\n\nBasically: my curls do not stay natural and fall flat. And i hope to find out why or how to manage them properly?",
