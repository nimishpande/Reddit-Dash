It’s very cheap and gives you so much more control than regular spray bottles. I’ve found that my hair absorbs products better and maximizes volume more on damp hair rather than soaking wet hair, which is how I used to apply my products.\n\nI also ordered microfiber towels from Amazon and stopped using regular shower towels. Lately I’ve been dealing with a lot of frizz. Normally I don’t mind frizz at all and think it adds character, but it’s been excessive, so I’ve been finger coiling more and it definitely helps tame everything better.\n\nOverall, this routine has made a noticeable difference in how my curls look and feel, especially with volume and frizz control. I’m still tweaking things, but I’ve been really happy with the results so far and wanted to share in case it helps anyone else.",

      "content": "Okay so I have thick 3C curls that go past my shoulders. Wash day used to be an actual nightmare that I'd put off until my hair was basically one giant knot.\n\nThe biggest problem for me is sectioning. I'd try to apply the product evenly but without proper clips, half my hair would just fall back down while I was working on another part. Some pieces ended up drenched in leave-in conditioner while others barely got touched. The end result was always this frizzy, uneven mess that made me want to cry.\n\nI tried using whatever I had around the house. Those big claw clips were too weak, they'd slip right out. The smaller ones were too tight and left these awful dents that ruined my curl pattern. Bobby pins were a complete joke. They'd just disappear into my hair like they never existed.\n\nThen I saw this girl on Instagram with her wash day routine and she had these perfect little sections all clipped up neatly. I commented asking what she used and she told me they're just basic sectioning clips that actually grip without creasing.\n\nShe mentioned she got a big pack online for cheap, like 24 clips for around $12 from some wholesale beauty supplier.\n\nI found a similar set on Alibaba and went for it. My hair actually stayed where I put it. I could see what I was doing for the first time ever. The product went on evenly. My curls dried with actual definition instead of that half-done look I'd gotten used to.\n\nWash day went from this two-hour frustrating ordeal to one focused hour where I actually felt in control. My curls have never looked this good and I'm kind of mad nobody told me about this sooner.\n\nIf you've been struggling with managing your hair during wash day, I'm begging you, get proper clips. It's such a small thing but it makes the biggest difference.",

      "content": "So I've been struggling with closed comedones for a while now. I used to have a basic routine of just cleansing with a gentle cleanser and applying macadamia oil, I had closed comedones before too but not as severe, obviously the macadamia oil worsened them, but it wasnt that big of a concern. I switched from macadamia oil to balea med ultra sensitive moisturizer, started oil cleansing along with gentle water cleanser and added 2%BHA into my routine. The BHA didnt seem to help at all so i ditched it and started using 0.1% adapalene gel. 3 months in and I am not seeing any progress with the adapalene, I've switched moisturizers plenty of times thinking that they might be clogging my pores. Nothing has really helped and I'm genuenley desparate to get rid of them because I've spent a lot of money trying to find products that agree with my skin. I jave slightly dry skin, sensitive to fragrances, and loads of CCs around my cheekd and chin.\n\nMy current routine:\n\nAM: I dont cleanse since I find it dries my skin out too much, wash with cold water, apply Balea hydrating toner and balea med ultra sensitive spf50\n\nPM: Cleanse eith balea cleansing oil, followed up with balea med ultra sensitive gel cleanser, I apply adapalene to dry skin every other night and follow up with simple kind to skin vital vitamin night cream\n\nI'm really bad at noticing whats good for my skin and whats not, I know the cerave moisturizing cream definetley didnt work out probably because of the fatty alchohols. \n\nCurrently I'm contemplating ditching my oil cleanser for a micellar water to see if the oil cleanser is the culprit. \n\nAs you can probably tell I like Balea products since they are very affordable and I'm a student in Europe and I don't have that much money to spend on experimenting with skin care.\n\nAgain after 3 months of adapalene I've seen almost no results, so now I'm suspicous of all the other products in my routine. Is it the oil cleanser, is it the moisturizer, is it the sunscreen?? I have no clue what I'm doing wrong so that's why I'm here looking for advice\n\nThe 2 products that I know were for sure clogging my pores were cerave moisturizing cream and altruist dermatologist spf50",

      "content": "Hello skincare addicts, sharing my journey with skin, expectations, and a bit of self-realization.\nI’m 38M. For most of my life, skincare simply wasn’t something I thought about. No proper routine, no sunscreen, and very little attention to skin health overall.\nMy work later required long hours outdoors, often sunrise to night, several days a week, for a few years. Constant sun exposure, dust, and heat gradually took a toll on my skin and hair. At the time, I didn’t really notice because it was just part of the job.\nIn 2022, a small incident made me pause and look at myself more closely. I happened to really observe my skin in the mirror for the first time in years and realized how much sun damage, tanning, and uneven pigmentation had built up over time. That was the moment I started thinking seriously about skincare.\nAround 2024, I began following skincare discussions on Reddit and social media. Seeing people’s progress motivated me to improve my own skin.\nBut enthusiasm quickly turned into overdoing things.\nI started buying almost every product people recommended, serums, creams, actives without fully understanding what suited my skin. I ended up with more products than I could realistically finish, and mixing things randomly actually irritated my skin instead of helping.\nI did consult a dermatologist and was given a basic routine, but I kept getting distracted by new recommendations instead of sticking to consistency.\nRecently, after learning more about skincare fundamentals and setting realistic expectations,\nI accepted a few important things:\nSkincare takes time and consistency matters more than product quantity.\nYears of sun exposure won’t reverse quickly.\nGenetics determine baseline skin tone, chasing fairness isn’t realistic.\nHealthy, comfortable skin should be the goal, not lighter skin.\nThat realization simplified things for me mentally.\nNow I follow a minimal routine: cleansing, moisturizing, sunscreen, and patience. No product hoarding, no rushing, just steady care. Honestly, this approach feels much better both physically and mentally.\nStill learning and open to advice, I’d genuinely appreciate constructive feedback or shared experiences.\n\nAlso, these are the products I currently have not including the ones already in use or the ones I’ve finished.\n\nTL;DR\nIgnored skincare for years → sun damage → product overload → irritated skin → reality check. Now keeping it simple and focusing on healthy skin, not fairness.",

Their hair grows. It’s called science. You didn’t invent evolution.\n\nLet’s talk about your lack of common sense - you aren’t even a brand that specializes in children. What was the reason you used an infant in an advertisement, in order to have parents feel that their child is growing at an unacceptable rate?\n\nThis isn’t marketing, it’s desperation and to do so using an innocent infant.\n\nShould you, instead of using infants to gain emotional sympathy, focus your time on developing a solid product for adults? You already have a damaged reputation.\n\nSome brands really will stoop to any level to sell.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I live in Berlin and my skin gets quite dry when I’m outside, especially because of the weather.\n\nI’d really like to keep things minimalist and simple. There are so many products and opinions out there that I feel overwhelmed and confused. I care about clean ingredients and I don’t want to overload my skin with too many actives.\n\nMy skin type is normal, but it can feel dehydrated in colder or windy weather. I currently massage my face with jojoba oil, which I enjoy, and I’d like to keep that if possible.\n\nI don’t want to start retinol immediately. I feel like I should first focus on building a solid base with proper moisturising, daily SPF, and possibly vitamin C before introducing stronger actives.\n\nMy goal is prevention (fine lines, overall skin health) and maintaining a strong skin barrier long term.\n\nWhat would you recommend as a simple but effective routine?\n\nThank you 🤍",

If this makes a difference I use a comb not a brush. I have low porosity 2c wavy hair. I do not do a refresh routine and I let my hair air dry.

I've had straight hair my entire life. I'm so confused on how to handle this newly curly hair. How do I style it? Products to use? I use a bar shampoo and conditioner now from Humby Organics. I wash it twice a week. I have tried to blow dry it which turns into a disaster of friz. I've moved from a brush to a wide toothed comb. I let it air dry and that's how it is in these pictures. Thanks for any help. I don't have much of a routine for now as it feels like everything I try just ends in a poofy mess. ",

I’m mainly interested in real experiences: did IPL noticeably slow regrowth long-term, make maintenance easier, or come with downsides people didn’t expect?\n\nNot looking for medical advice, just personal experiences.",

Been using it about three nights a week for two weeks and honestly? The texture smoothing is real. My foundation has been going on so much better and I'm kind of obsessed.\n\nBUT the last few days I've noticed some flaking around my nose which is new for me. I can't tell if I should back off and use it less, layer more moisturizer, or if this is just a normal adjustment thing that passes.\n\nAlso I keep seeing conflicting info about layering glycolic with niacinamide some people say they cancel each other out, some say that's totally a myth. My niacinamide serum is a core part of my routine and I really don't want to give it up, so I'd love to know what actually holds up in practice.\n\nHas anyone been through the adjustment phase with a glycolic and come out the other side? And is niacinamide layering actually a problem or am I worrying for nothing?\n\nDrop your experience below  I'll take all the advice I can get. 🙏",
