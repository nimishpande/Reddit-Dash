Lately I’ve been dealing with a lot of frizz. Normally I don’t mind frizz at all and think it adds character, but it’s been excessive, so I’ve been finger coiling more and it definitely helps tame everything better.\n\nOverall, this routine has made a noticeable difference in how my curls look and feel, especially with volume and frizz control. I’m still tweaking things, but I’ve been really happy with the results so far and wanted to share in case it helps anyone else.",

Now all the layers of my hair below the first layer have returned somewhat to being less frizzy but I cannot figure out why the top of my hair is so frizzy.

I live in Berlin and my skin gets quite dry when I’m outside, especially because of the weather.\n\nI’d really like to keep things minimalist and simple. There are so many products and opinions out there that I feel overwhelmed and confused. I care about clean ingredients and I don’t want to overload my skin with too many actives.\n\nMy skin type is normal, but it can feel dehydrated in colder or windy weather. I currently massage my face with jojoba oil, which I enjoy, and I’d like to keep that if possible.\n\nI don’t want to start retinol immediately. I feel like I should first focus on building a solid base with proper moisturising, daily SPF, and possibly vitamin C before introducing stronger actives.\n\nMy goal is prevention (fine lines, overall skin health) and maintaining a strong skin barrier long term.\n\nWhat would you recommend as a simple but effective routine?\n\nThank you 🤍",

      "content": "So I've been struggling with closed comedones for a while now. I used to have a basic routine of just cleansing with a gentle cleanser and applying macadamia oil, I had closed comedones before too but not as severe, obviously the macadamia oil worsened them, but it wasnt that big of a concern. I switched from macadamia oil to balea med ultra sensitive moisturizer, started oil cleansing along with gentle water cleanser and added 2%BHA into my routine. The BHA didnt seem to help at all so i ditched it and started using 0.1% adapalene gel. 3 months in and I am not seeing any progress with the adapalene, I've switched moisturizers plenty of times thinking that they might be clogging my pores. Nothing has really helped and I'm genuenley desparate to get rid of them because I've spent a lot of money trying to find products that agree with my skin. I jave slightly dry skin, sensitive to fragrances, and loads of CCs around my cheekd and chin.\n\nMy current routine:\n\nAM: I dont cleanse since I find it dries my skin out too much, wash with cold water, apply Balea hydrating toner and balea med ultra sensitive spf50\n\nPM: Cleanse eith balea cleansing oil, followed up with balea med ultra sensitive gel cleanser, I apply adapalene to dry skin every other night and follow up with simple kind to skin vital vitamin night cream\n\nI'm really bad at noticing whats good for my skin and whats not, I know the cerave moisturizing cream definetley didnt work out probably because of the fatty alchohols. \n\nCurrently I'm contemplating ditching my oil cleanser for a micellar water to see if the oil cleanser is the culprit. \n\nAs you can probably tell I like Balea products since they are very affordable and I'm a student in Europe and I don't have that much money to spend on experimenting with skin care.\n\nAgain after 3 months of adapalene I've seen almost no results, so now I'm suspicous of all the other products in my routine. Is it the oil cleanser, is it the moisturizer, is it the sunscreen?? I have no clue what I'm doing wrong so that's why I'm here looking for advice\n\nThe 2 products that I know were for sure clogging my pores were cerave moisturizing cream and altruist dermatologist spf50",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

After going to the Barber a year ago, i used to use a curly hair mousse that helped me shape my hair to a visible curly style. The problem: They had a certain sheen since it also supported the hair being shiny and it was a little sticky and the foam reeked after half a year of using (the leftover foam in the bottle).\n\nSince then i have 1. started cutting my own hair, only cutting the edges a little and using new products.\n\nI have tested a lot between Bali curls Hydrating cream, curl defining gel and curlz volume mousse, up to John Frieda Frizz Ease, Yunsey Curly method Conditioner, gliss kur arganoil, Nivea hairmilk and pantene pro v style mousse fix.\n\nMy general routine:\n\n1.\t⁠Washing hair (either with cantu shea butter cleansing shampoo for curls and waves or only with water.\n\n2.\t⁠Use a towel to dry hair with smooth scrunching\n\n3.\t⁠Apply conditioner and follow the rules (its between Bali curls curlz volume mousse or Yunsey Curly method conditioner.\n\n4.\t⁠Let the Hair either dry by air if i have time or use a diffuser if im tight on time\n\n5.\t⁠Either use the pantene pro v style mousse fix or the hydrating cream from bali curls.\n\nIf i wash my hair, use a towel to carefully crunch/dry them and then use conditioner with the crunchy method, letting them dry slowly on fresh air, only my curls on the front fall really well, while the rest looks like chaos or goes into a mix of curly and straight. The top of the head being completely straight (no curls).\n\nWhen i dry them and use the mousse fix, they go very soft and light but more into an open chaos than defined curls.\n\nBasically: my curls do not stay natural and fall flat. And i hope to find out why or how to manage them properly?",

I understand that diet is important for general skin health but my diet has been quite alright and basically the same since the last 3-4 years, no major changes.\n\nI have been struggling with acne , although mild but recently flared up quite badly, and i am really looking for a scientific based routine that is shown effective to treat acne, i am tired of experimenting with otc products all the time with little to no improvement.\n\nNow i wonder if it is even worth it to consider another dermatologist or just give up on my acne ever clearing. Are dermatologists in india like this ?? Or is it just my luck with these specific ones. I’m really feeling hopeless and need advice about this, should i find a different dermatologist??\n\nI’m 21F, had acne since 14–15.",

I'm thinking there has to be something I can do to fix it. Any recommendations? I really need to upgrade my routine. The only products I use are the Aussie Miracle Waves Shampoo and Conditioner every 3 days as well as the occasional spritz of Not Your Mother's Beach Babe sea salt spray. If this makes a difference I use a comb not a brush. I have low porosity 2c wavy hair. I do not do a refresh routine and I let my hair air dry. I also don't really do anything to protect my hair when I'm sleeping. I don't even own a silk pillowcase.",

I've had straight hair my entire life. I'm so confused on how to handle this newly curly hair. How do I style it? Products to use? I use a bar shampoo and conditioner now from Humby Organics. I wash it twice a week. I have tried to blow dry it which turns into a disaster of friz. I've moved from a brush to a wide toothed comb. I let it air dry and that's how it is in these pictures. Thanks for any help. I don't have much of a routine for now as it feels like everything I try just ends in a poofy mess. ",

I used to dress in a way that gave off an “aunty” vibe, both in my clothing and my attitude,kind of old-school.\n\nI don’t want to be like that anymore. I’m currently trying to lose weight as well. Could you please give me some tips on how to develop my own style and look effortlessly beautiful and put together?\n\n I mostly wear churidar and kurtas, but I feel like I look much older than I actually am. Deep down, I know I can pull it off. I just need a little help.\n\nPlease be kind. 💛",
