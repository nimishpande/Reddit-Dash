If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Do you have some advice for taking care of hair like this, to make it curly all the time (even fuzzy curly)? Or, why is his hair perfect 360 degree ribbon on the bottom and slight flat beach wave at the top? \n\nCurrent routine: \n\n1. Shampoo, conditioner and mask he uses are from so!flow Let’s twist a hair series, used as said on the packaging. \n\n2. Mousse and curl activator were Anwen - Pina Lokada, but he doesn’t use them anymore since they need a lot of work, used as said on the packaging. \n\n3. He uses simple hair dryer but we just bought a dryer with a diffuser online. \n\n4. No bonnets, special pillowcases etc., just a physiotherapy memory foam pillow with a cotton pillowcase. ",

I went to a walk-in clinic for a derm referral, but they said it wasn’t severe enough and instead prescribed 3 months of apo-minocycline (I’m starting my 3rd month now).

I used to use salicylic acid, but it low key caused chemical burns, so I was told to stop by a derm/cosmetologist. I was also on topical clindamycin, but my walk-in doctor discontinued it when starting minocycline.\n\nAny feedback or suggestions to the routine would be appreciated, I'm way out of my depth.",

It wasn’t until early-mid quarantine that my hair started to curl, and even then, it was only after I shaved it. \n\nSome days my hair is straight and poofy, and other days my hair holds curls. Whenever I try and follow a wavy hair routine, the products make my hair straighter than if I just shampoo/condition and air dry. \n\nRight now I use Moroccanoil shampoo and Keune Care Karatin conditioner, sometimes a Keune hair mask if it feels dry. \n\nI’ve been dying my hair since 4th grade, which could definitely play a big part in the bipolar process. I’ve bleached my hair numerous times, but I end up with waves around a week or so after the initial bleaching. \n\nI’m not sure of my hair type or texture, but I do know that I have to knead water into my hair when I shower, otherwise it’ll drip off. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!!!

      "content": "i feel like my skin type is so impossible and i’m so frustrated!\n\ni’m 19F and began getting what i suspect is hormonal acne (upcoming doctors appointment about this, looking for root cause) around 2 years ago. it gets better and worse in a constant loop and is currently flaring up again. i get the acne mostly on my chin, and also sometimes around my lips and on my jawline. it’s a mixture of whiteheads and deeper, red cystic acne. it tends to scar very stubbornly even though i don’t ever pop them, and can be really painful. the scarring is PIE rather than PIH, and i’m super pale so it’s very noticeable! i also get mild blackheads on my nose but at present im much less concerned with that than the other acne.\n\nto make matters worse, i have incredibly dry skin, often getting flaky. in the last couple of months i started getting dry forehead bumps again which i haven’t had in years, i think it’s fungal acne but i’m not 100% sure if it’s fungal or closed comedones. it popped up shortly after antibiotics for tonsillitis so fungal acne makes sense. in the last few days, ive started getting redness and bumpiness on the right side around my nose and it’s making makeup sit horribly no matter how much i moisturise.\n\ncurrent routine\n\nAM • skin1004 centella-hyalu cica water-fit sun serum SPF50 • round lab birch juice moisturising cream\n\nPM • haruharu wonder fragrance free black rice moisture 5.5 soft cleansing gel • skin1004 centella ampoule • round lab birch juice moisturising cream\n\ni’ve stripped it back to absolute bare minimum with products i’ve been using for a while. they probably aren’t optimal, but they aren’t obviously problematic like most things i’ve tried so i’m just going with it for now until i feel sure about what else to do. \n\nlast summer i was prescribed epiduo 0.1%/2.25% and lymecycline. i used them for around 3-4 months, beginning the epiduo slowly and working up to every other day using the sandwich method. i didn’t take enough pictures to really be able to tell which was silly but it didn’t do a huge amount. i purged, but not crazyyy bad, and it made my skin dry. there might have been some improvement but it was minor and very underwhelming.\n\ni’m going to raise it with the doctor and see what they suggest - i’m in the UK so accutane isn’t an option. i’m a student so also can’t afford to see a private dermatologist unfortunately. i was wondering about prescription strength 20% azelaic acid as my skin responded pretty well to 10% used to help scarring - i found other common ingredients for this like niacinamide didn’t do much.\n\nsorry for the long post, any help at all would be super appreciated. i’m so frustrated and want to get out of the cycle of trying stuff that makes it worse or does nothing.",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

Even in summer, if I don’t moisturize, my cheeks can feel dry while still having a layer of oil on top, which makes actives feel a bit tricky to navigate.\n\nI don’t have a major acne issue. I do get breakouts, but they’re mostly hormonal and show up around my period, and they’re fairly manageable with diet and a simple routine. What I’m more interested in improving is texture\\*,\\* enlarged pores on my cheeks and sebaceous filaments on my nose and chin; and thinking about retinoids from a maintenance or prevention perspective.\n\nFor those whose main concern wasn’t acne:\n\n* Did you start with cosmetic retinol night creams (like Olay or Neutrogena) and feel they were sufficient long-term?\n* Did you go straight to adapalene, even without significant acne?\n* If you’ve tried both, what factors made you choose one path over the other?\n\nI’m less interested in strict recommendations and more in how people frame the decision, strength vs tolerance, prevention vs treatment, and whether a gentler but consistent approach ever feels like “enough.”",

I have tried so many different things over the years in order to make the redness on my face calm down whether it’s light exfoliation, trying different razors, lotions, etc.. I still cannot figure out how to get it to calm down. Right now I use Cremo sensitive shave cream and gillette sensitive skin razors for shaving. I use cera ve hydrating face wash twice a day and cera ve nightly exfoliant cream once a week for exfoliating. I normally just use la roche posay toleriane rosaliac AR to cover up my redness during the day. I’m getting so sick and tired of it. I don’t know what to do anymore and hopefully someone here can help me!!",
