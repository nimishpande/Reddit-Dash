      "content": "hey guys! i’m from sri lanka 🇱🇰 and 2024 September I discovered a 3rd-party seller who brings indian skincare here… and yeah, my skin AND bank account have not recovered since lol\n\nbefore that, i suddenly started getting major breakouts (pic 1). this was super frustrating because i had clear skin my entire life. so like many people here, i decided to self-prescribe 🙃\n\ni started tret 0.025% (cream only available here) and imported:\n\n* simple moisturiser cream\n* plum niacinamide toner\n* dot &amp; key sunscreen\n* TO niacinamide 10%\n\nfollowed this routine for 7-8 months with absolutely no improvement. tret irritated my skin SO badly but i kept telling myself to “trust the process” 😭  \n*(pics 2–3 are from this phase)*\n\neventually i gave up and saw a derm(in 2025 May). i was prescribed:\n\n* deriva-c gel (adapalene + clindamycin) – pm\n* aknix face wash\n* clindamycin gel – am\n* azithromycin 500 mg (3x/week)\n\ni swapped the face wash for minimalist SA cleanser because aknix was crazy expensive (\\~₹2400). this routine helped calm down my inflamed, angry acne (pic 4/5), but i was left with a face FULL of closed comedones and Acne marks.\n\nhonestly? i was just relieved. i accepted the bumpy texture because it was WAY better than the war zone i had before💀. so I sticked to that routine for about 5 months.\n\nthen i came across a post here about tazarotene and decided to give it a shot. amazon india only had 0.1%, so i went all in. I started taz in late October.\n\nand listen… this stuff is MAGICAL.  \ndespite being the *strongest retinoid* i’ve ever used, it has never irritated my skin. no burning, no peeling, nothing. within 1.5 months, i had the smoothest skin of my life. i still can’t believe how gentle yet effective it is for me.\n\ncurrent routine:\n\nam:\n\n* Minimalist SA cleanser\n* isntree green tea fresh toner\n* cosrx snail mucin\n* aquasoft ac moisturiser\n* Picspot gel\n* sundrink sunscreen\n\npm:\n\n* garnier micellar water\n* joy pH 5.5 face wash\n\ntaz days (mon/tue/wed/fri/sun):\n\n* aestura lotion *or* minimalist b12 cream\n* taz\n\nthursday (barrier day):\n\n* aestura lotion\n* b4 nappi cream\n\nsaturday:\n\n* formularx lactic acid\n* aquasoft ac\n\ntaz literally did what tret never could for me. if you’re struggling with closed comedones, texture, or tret intolerance, this might be worth looking into.",

      "content": "I'm almost 32.   \n  \nI'm lazy, I will be honest. I wake up in the morning with just enough time to get dressed and pee before work. I shower at night, so my hair doesn't have to dry in the morning. I make sure my leggings and yoga pants are ALWAYS the first thing washed, so I can just jump into those and a sweatshirt. \n\nHowever, I am very aware that most of the time I look very low effort. My hair will look a little bumpy/off due to sleeping on it half wet. When I want to look cute for a night out at the bar, I realize I look like I didn't have clean clothes ready so I had to opt for leggings/a hoodie. I look in the mirror and just don't feel good. \n\nI know I am a good looking woman, and I have the ability to dress cute, style myself well, etc etc. But I just.. don't have the drive to. \n\n*Examples of things I am TRYING to do to feel a little better that doesn't require me doing something 24/7 (if that makes sense):*  \nI recently lost 20 pounds (160 to 140) and am working to lose 10 more. I'm starting to buy clothing again that I wore in my 20's. (However, I get excited shopping, but NOT excited when it comes to wearing it, so I opt for frumpy/comfy/baggy) \n\nI am ordering a lash lift/tint kit because my eyelashes are gorgeous with mascara, but almost non-existent without, so eyes usually look small and disappear into my face without mascara (which I don't always want to wear). \n\nI bought a blowout brush/dryer so that I can dry my hair into a more styled look before sleeping on it. \n\nI hope I was able to express myself okay in this post. I've seen tiktok ideas where people say something along the lines of \"things I do to remain low maintenance\" or whatever and that's kind of what I am looking for.\n\n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I’m hoping that y’all can give some at-home budget-friendly recommendations for treatment. I just bought a Clotrimazole cream this morning and have it on right now to see if it helps at all.\n\nHere’s a list of reasons I suspect it to be fungal:\n\n- It started at the edge of my hairline, then my eyebrows, and has stayed mostly in that area.\n\n- The bumps are very small, with maybe only 2-3 of them being whiteheads, and stay in clusters.\n\n- My antibacterial regiment has made it worse. I did not notice at first, but it’s been about two weeks and my entire forehead is now completely broken out.\n\nHowever, there seems to be no itch that I’ve noticed, but I’ve read that it’s not always present?\n\nThank you!",

Same when I eat or make facial expressions.\n\nAlso, if I bend my head down just slightly for even just a couple of seconds, when I lift my head, my face looks burning red! This has been my biggest insecurity.\n\nI moisturize every single day, wear sunscreen, and use adapalene every night (redness was still a problem before adapalene). My skin is very smooth and soft, but this redness thing never went away.\n\nWhen I see pics of rosacea, the redness seems to be on the surface for many people. But for me, my face just looks red from the inside (idk how to explain this..).\n\nAre there any procedures I can get to mitigate this problem? I ALWAYS need to apply green corrector if I go outside. This doesn't even look cute because I just have a huge red area in my face, and it's not concentrated just on my cheeks. \n\n  \nWhy is this, and how can I stop these things from happening? Are there any procedures such as laser treatments that can tackle this?\n\nThanks for any advice!",

      "content": "I am 36F, so i always had tiny pimples here there all my life and sometimes some bad phases with multiple pimples at the same time but would clear in few weeks. thats how human skin behaves unless u use filter to show ur face to the world through social media and never leave the house. \n\nthen came a phase in my life where i got influenced by the over bombardment of skin care routine contents on youtube and insta. and oh the aesthetics the ASMR. and then started the self destruction of my skin. i started using all kinds of serums started finding small issues with my skin i am quite light skinned so small marks show and till 4years back people were not criticising the filters or may be i was living under a rock. n i did not realise that its filter and human skin has marks and pores and lines n they all play their biological role (i wasnt enlightened enough i guess)\n\nn then the problems started the deep pimples that wont go away for months, leaving black dots on my face which was never a problem before, dehydrated skin (i am blessed with a supple full skin thanks to my mother who is 65 barely looks 55) but i felt my skin stripped off all of that then larger pores and then more defined lines. AND NOT ONCE I QUESTIONED MY \"ROUTINES\". \n\nthe desperate phase: i tried everything wasting money time and mental peace. my BF lives in US i visit him sometimes and even bought products and serums not available in India just to fix my skin. nothing helped. i even went to docs and did two courses of tretonin (helped for few months but problems recurred) i have lived in north and south india switching jobs and no amount of \"environment change\" fixed my skin suffered for 4 straight years. \n\nthen i just stopped and thats why i am sharing this may be it will help someone. i just stopped all products. i started reading more about skin barrier and how serums exfoliate and over exfoliation destroys skin barrier. i just stopped everything and only started applying basic moisturiser but with extreme dedication applied sunscreen. \n\ni invested in good sunscreens. i had never applied sunscreens so much. always found them greasy would apply only when i am going to office. and never reapplied after few hours even when i am out in blazing sun. but then i started ordering sunscreens korean and others wasted money used the ones i didnt like on my body but finally landed on a a good one. \n\nand man oh man did it work. i religiously apply the sunscreen twice in a day, use most basic moisturiser and use most gentle face wash. its only been 2 months but my skin is so much clearer my marks r fading i am having less and less of acne (barely any) i can feel the hydration returning to my face. and i am so happy. \n\nskin care companies just bombard us with their products thanks to unregulated social media giving us \"advice\" how to live our own lives and cloud our own judgement and intution. skin care routine type content is a cult. we dont need much at all. i completely destroyed my god given healthy skin. \n\ni never post on reddit but i understand the feeling of seeing new pimples and having lots on ur face and the stress of nothing working. i hope someone reads this and it helps someone. \n\nPS since Reddit sells its content to AI companies now i can help train the AI models to stop prescribing acids after acids and just prescribe basic skin hygiene and care routines lol",

      "content": "Hi, I’m looking for some advice, and if there’s a better subreddit for this please let me know.\n\n**Context:** I’m 21F and I’ve been bleaching and dyeing my hair since I was about 16. Over the years I’ve done black, dark brown, auburn, bleached blonde (which required cutting my hair to a pixie), pink/light pink, blonde with extensions, light red, deep red, and then a more natural red with extensions.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I decided to give my hair a break. I stopped using extensions, focused on growing out my natural roots, and prioritized overall hair health.\n\n**Current situation:** Around two months ago, I got tired of the contrast between my blonde roots and red lengths. It wasn’t blending well and started to look thinning at the root, so I went to a local salon for a color correction with the intention of toning everything closer to my natural color so it could grow out more seamlessly.\n\nThe stylist was very nice and did a good job maintaining the integrity of my hair, but he lightened it significantly more than I had asked for.\n\nNow my roots are growing in and they match reasonably well, but I would like to tone the lighter lengths so they blend better with my natural color as it continues to grow out.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n* For those who have gone back to their natural color, what did that process look like for you?\n* Is it realistic to match previously bleached hair to a natural color long-term?\n* Or is it better to stop trying to match and focus on growing the lightened hair out gradually?\n\nMy hair is medium/long (mid-back length) and in decent condition. I don’t want to do a big chop, but I’m frustrated that it was lightened more than intended.\n\nPhotos: First photo, is my hair once done - in warm lighting to the blonde looks warm, that to show the length/\"health\" second photo is recently showing how light it actually is, and the last photo is from last weekend showing my roots.\n\nAny advice or personal experiences would be appreciated. Thank you!",

Don’t use a towel to put my hair above my head, just gently dried with a micro fiber towel before styling. \n\nFor styling used shea moisture leave in conditioner, super milk hair primer and bb curl anti humidity gel oil. \n\nI have really thin hair so thats a thing.

      "content": "I just started the CG regimen about a week ago and my hair is responding well. In fact, I don't ever remember knowing how to take care of my hair to get my curls looking this glorious. It's really making a difference. I have long medium color treated high porosity hair that is curly, not wavy. Pic is after 1st CG wash, still wet. I had much better curl definition once my hair was dry.\n\nMy first CG wash was:\n\n1. Fructis Pure Clean shampoo\n2. A ton of Nexus Humectress conditioner until it was super slippery, then carefully combed through with a bounce brush, left on for 5-10 min then rinsed well but left some in\n3. Applied Not Your Mother's Curl Talk gel liberally to dripping wet hair, carefully combed through\n4. Wrapped in a clean cotton tshirt, then carefully patted dry\n5. Scrunched\n6. Scrunched out the crunch when it was mostly air dried\n\nMy hair looked great with just a touch of frizz but 100% improvement over any routine I've done before. It looked great with just a finger combing the next day. I dampened thoroughly with distilled water to refresh on day 3 and it still looked pretty great. I've got incredible definition and just a little bit of frizz. It's still amazing how curly it is after I've spent over a decade brushing the curl out of it daily and looking like a frizzed out old lady.\n\nSo yesterday on day 4:\n\n1. Co-washed with Nexus Humectress using fingers to scrub scalp. Rinsed thoroughly.\n2. Used Not Your Mother's Curl Talk conditioner. Applied generously until slippery, combed through. Left in 10 minutes. Rinsed most but not completely.\n3. NYM Curl Talk gel applied generously to wet hair, combed through.\n4. Wrapped in clean dry cotton tshirt, patted gently.\n5. Scrunched, air dried, scrunched.\n\nMy hair looks good today but feels a little heavy. I think I need to wash every 4 days because I feel like a ciwash with conditioner is not cleansing enough or maybe the Curl Talk is heavier than the Nexus conditioner. It's also possible it needed to rinse it better yesterday and left too much in. My hair does feel soft but a tiny bit sticky.\n\nI definitely do not want to use the Fructis for every wash. So I've got these items in my shopping cart and this is my plan:\n\n1. Wet hair, apply Curlsmith repair salve, leave on for 15-20 min. Rinse thoroughly.\n2. Co-wash with Curlsmith Cleansing Conditioner. Comb through, don't rinse completely.\n3. Apply Curlsmith Defining Strong Hold Gel Souffle to wet hair. Comb through gently.\n4. Wrap with clean cotton tshirt, pat dry, scrunch, then air dry.\n5. Scrunch out the crunch.\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I really need some curly hair advice.\nI have naturally curly hair. First, I was using Arata hair cream, and whenever I applied hair gel on top, my curls became defined but felt sticky and my volume completely disappeared.\nThinking it might be a product issue, I switched to Bare Anatomy. I started using their shampoo, hair mask, leave-in conditioner, and curl cream. But again, the moment I apply hair gel, I face the same problem — my curls look defined but feel heavy, sticky, and flat with no volume.\nI even tried diluting the gel with water before applying, but it didn’t help. I also tried curl mousse hoping it would improve volume, but I still didn’t see much difference.\nWithout gel, my hair feels lighter and has more volume, but my curls aren’t as defined. With gel, I get definition but lose all volume.\nIs my hair type not suitable for gel?\nAm I over-moisturizing or layering too many products?\nWhat kind of routine or lightweight products would you suggest for soft, defined curls with volume?\nAny advice would really help. Thank you!",
