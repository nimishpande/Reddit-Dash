My routine for this is that I washed my hair with tea tree shampoo twice, then used small amount of tea tree conditioner. After I added small amount of lite leave in by its a miracle and then added lotta body coconut mousse. I finally did it with the diffuser upside down. It was actually more curlier when I finished the process and started to become wavy as they day went on. Haven’t done it since really cause I’m lazy. Also I washed my hair everyday and put a silk bonnet on at night.",

Do you have some advice for taking care of hair like this, to make it curly all the time (even fuzzy curly)? Or, why is his hair perfect 360 degree ribbon on the bottom and slight flat beach wave at the top? \n\nCurrent routine: \n\n1. Shampoo, conditioner and mask he uses are from so!flow Let’s twist a hair series, used as said on the packaging. \n\n2. Mousse and curl activator were Anwen - Pina Lokada, but he doesn’t use them anymore since they need a lot of work, used as said on the packaging. \n\n3. He uses simple hair dryer but we just bought a dryer with a diffuser online. \n\n4. No bonnets, special pillowcases etc., just a physiotherapy memory foam pillow with a cotton pillowcase. ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

My new manager is a woman, and she is very well dressed and does a full beat daily. She often makes comments about how important it is to “represent the business” or be “the face of the business” &amp;etc.  \n\nSoooooo I would like to start wearing more makeup to work again— but I cannot figure out how to wear mascara anymore 😅\n\nI feel like whenever I put on mascara, my eyes look droopy? Idk if it’s maybe because my eyelashes are too weak, and so they drop down despite curling them? Or if this is just an issue with my eye shape? Or maybe I need to try different mascara applicators? or formulas? Or abandon the mascara altogether and do something else to lift the eye?\n\nSoo If anyone has any mascara tips for weak lashes, be it product recommendations or application step recommendations— PLEASE help me out 😭😭\n\nMascaras I have tried:\n\n•Volume de chanel (waterproof and normal)\n\n•Maybelline great lash waterproof (actually not that bad looking but I would like more drama/volume)\n\n•Maybelline lash sensation \n\n•Maybelline scandal eyes (formula too wet for me)\n\n•Wet n wild mega lash waterproof \n\n•Diorshow (not enough drama but a surprisingly good formula if anyone is curious hehe)\n\n\\*\\*I have attached pictures of my eyes with Volume De Chanel waterproof Black. I feel like my eyelashes become droopy despite curling before AND after application. I feel like it’s especially noticeable when my face is resting (pic2) ☹️\n\nAny advice welcome 🤗 ",

      "content": "Writing this to share my story\n\nIn 2023 I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and was prescribed a self administered medicine to mitigate the effects of my disease. This medicine made me break out in acne all over my back, and I was then prescribed accutane to help with the acne. The accutane made this so much worse and I actually began to break out in acne all over my body. Most of my body cleared over a few months but my chest specifically was left with nasty scars. I never had acne my whole life and I never had any scars that effected me negatively but these were different. Most were hypertrophic so I needed medical intervention, I did a series of laser and steroid injections that made them virtually disappear. It was a long process and I became so depressed and hyper fixated that even though people couldn’t see them anymore it wasn’t enough because I could. I underwent surgical scar revision for scars all over my chest and it made it much worse. I am now 1 year and 2 months post surgical revision and have just started the same laser and steroid injection protocol I did previously.\n\nThus new year makes it 4 years since I last took my shirt off comfortably. It has effected my relationship with my significant other, it has effected my relationship with friends and family. I don’t go in pools anymore, no ocean, no boats. I am madly depressed and have begun to think that I may never be okay and things may never return to the way they were before.\n\nI’m really wondering are these scars that bad? Will people register them/care when they are healed? I know redness is bad right now but the laser should take it away like it did previously. Please let me know what you think it the comments. I just want to move on and feel attractive and comfortable in my body like I once did.",

My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

It seems my hair will curl but then it seems extra fluffy at the bottom and I would rather have more volume towards the front of my face and I top and how do I get the back of my head to curl more like the front?? Also - how in thr world do people get their hair to last longer than a day without loads of hairspray??? I resisted the urge and did NOT use hairspray today but the last two photo are now hair after only 8 hours and I was forced to pull up the front cause it was losing volume at the frontz\n\n\nMy routine: I use a suave shampoo and conditioner. This was a morning wash and I used the suave clarifying shampoo and basic suave conditioner. Then I put it up with a cotton tshirt for a few minutes. Then I put in tresemme extra strength (number 6) gel. I did it section by section and then brushed it with a wide tooth comb. I diffused it upside down, on the roots, moved the diffuser. I diffused it till about 80-90 dry and let the rest air dry and then I did SOTC with a bit of oil in my hands. The front looks decent, though usually by mid day I feel the back will be extra frizzy or fluffy and lose some curl- it def doesn’t stay for days like some people.\n\nSo my question is - how do I get more volume and/or face shaping to my hair and the back so it actually looks curly all around? Do I need layers? What kind of cut? Change my routine any??  How do I make my back not too boxy?",

Should I use a different cream, or am I doing something wrong? I watched a lot of videos and tried to imitate finger coiling and all that, but it doesn't work. ",

      "content": "Recently cleaned out my beauty collection and got rid of a bunch of products that I either didn’t like or were expired/damaged. I want to clean them all out and recycle them but I wanted to know if there were any rewards based recycling programs I could give them to. I plan to start collecting my empty products every month to recycle those too!\n\nI know I should recycle them even without the incentive but I’m not going to lie, it would still be nice. I plan to recycle them anyway even if I don’t find anything.\n\nThis is what I have found so far (just so people don’t suggest things I already found)\n\n• Pact - has a lot of locations, accepts a wide range of stuff, and seems reputable, but no rewards. (I think I will recycle here if I can’t find anything else)\n\n• Terracycle - Originally wanted to recycle with them because they said you can earn points towards charity which I really liked (I would rather donate to charity than get the points myself) BUT I heard it’s really scammy and does a lot of greenwashing\n\n• Credo - gives you store points for any empties but I don’t shop at Credo so that would be useless lol\n\n• Lush - only accepts lush products for points/a free mask I think? But I don’t shop at Lush either lol\n\n• Literally any store that only accepts their own products for points or rewards. - I don’t buy enough of one single brand to justify it\n\n• Boots - This seems like the kind of program I am looking for. They accept a wide range of empties for points BUT they’re UK based. I also found similar companies in Australia but nothing like this in the US.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Like I said, I’m still recycling them regardless, I just want to see if there’s any nice programs out there first.",

      "content": "So, I’ve had really straight hair for years. I never straightened it, just combed it wet and it dried pin straight (photo 2). Anyway, I took a long hot shower with my bangs down one day and they ended up like photo 1 so I played around to see if I had an underlying pattern I’ve been oblivious to my entire life. Turns out I do. I’m not sure exactly what it is though.  \n\nPhoto 3: my second curly attempt ever. Looking back I am seeing the progress now. (I also chopped 4 inches of those scraggly ends not long after this)\n\nPhoto 4: they start out even more coiled than this, but after several weeks of a curl routine, my clumps went from ribbon waves to full on spirals. \n\nPhoto 5 is how photo 4 ended up (today)\n\nRoutine: regular biotin shampoo/kristen ess chelating shampoo every 3-4 washes (I used it for the second time ever today). Follow with Verb Ghost or Briogio superfoods conditioner. I think I’m dropping the briogio, i believe it’s too heavy for my hair. \n\nScrunch with not your mother’s foam (I tried shae moistures mousse once and my clumps disintegrated). Plop/scrunch with tshirt or microfiber towel a bunch of times, gel and diffuse. Today I used not your mothers gel instead of my usual Flexi Jelly\n\nLooking at photos I’m seeing now that I’ve made way more progress than I thought. I discovered two weeks ago I’ve been washing my hair with hard water for TEN YEARS. Add in thick conditioners and all kinds of oils; my hair was functionally low porosity but I don’t think it truly is. I’m seeing more spirals since chelating. My hair was forming a handful of massive clumps but they’re starting to separate more now, I’m not sure if that’s good or bad.  \n\nMy hair is having hard time holding shape. It’s extremely finicky and so easy to mess up leaving it mostly flat.  I know the length is a factor, but are there things that I am maybe missing or could/should be doing differently? Will it just take time and consistency? Can I achieve more defined curls with this length? \n\nAny and all advice welcome! ",

      "title": "[Acne] Long post ahead – Benzoyl Peroxide 10% (short contact therapy) + hormonal acne / Mirena IUD",
      "content": "This is going to be long, but I’ll try to include as many details as possible because I know how helpful that can be when you’re desperate for answers.\n\nI’ve struggled with hormonal acne for years, ever since I started using the Mirena IUD at 22 (I’m 29 now). I know worsening acne is a known side effect, and for a long time I accepted it and tried to manage it with different skincare products. Over the years, my skin went through phases: sometimes extremely inflamed, sometimes completely clear. I had never seen a dermatologist specifically for acne.\n\nIn mid-2025, my skin got REALLY bad—the worst it’s ever been. I started researching treatments, read a lot about benzoyl peroxide, and decided to try it. My plan was: if this didn’t work, I would finally see a doctor and possibly change my IUD.\n\n**Product**\n\nI bought BENZAKNEN 10% Gel and started using it in September. I know most people recommend starting with 2% or 5%, but honestly, I was desperate and wanted to start with the strongest option.\n\nAt first, I applied it overnight: first the benzoyl peroxide gel, waited ten minutes for it to dry, and then applied a moisturizer (I use a very simple one, Vanicream). I did this for two days and absolutely hated it. My skin became EXTREMELY dry, and my pillowcase was completely ruined and stained. So I looked for alternative ways to apply the product and learned about short-contact therapy, which is what I’ve been doing ever since.\n\nWhen I get home from work, I cleanse my face and apply the benzoyl peroxide to the U-zone (cheeks, jawline, and chin—where hormonal acne usually appears). I leave it on for at least 30 minutes, but sometimes longer—one, two, or even three hours. Then I wash it off and apply moisturizer. I do this every single day.\n\n**The purge / timeline**\n\nI won’t lie: it was rough. For about two months, my acne got significantly worse. It was very inflamed and painful, and I seriously considered giving up many times. Trusting the process is extremely hard when your face looks worse every day. I knew it could get worse before getting better—but honestly, it got *really* bad.\n\nStill, I kept going. Around mid-November, I finally started seeing improvement. Since then, my skin has been getting better every day. For me, it took about 2.5 months to see real progress.\n\n**Doctor visit / spironolactone**\n\nIn early December, I went to my gynecologist. She noticed the hyperpigmentation on my face and asked about my acne. I explained my benzoyl peroxide routine, and she said it was a great treatment.\n\nShe also prescribed 100 mg of spironolactone per day for hormonal acne. I’ve been on it for about a month now, and since it takes longer to work, I won’t go into detail yet—maybe in another post or an update. Just leaving it here so you know that this exists (I didn't know) and it's also and option.\n\n**Results so far**\n\nGoing back to benzoyl peroxide: my experience with it has been absolutely positive. It takes time, and the journey is tough, but it’s worth it. My self-esteem was at its lowest point. I felt ashamed of how my face looked, and now I can finally look in the mirror again and feel good. I know no one *needs* to feel that way and that we’re all beautiful with or without acne—but unfortunately, it’s not that simple, especially with adult hormonal acne.\n\nI still use benzoyl peroxide every day, now combined with spironolactone. My skin is not completely clear yet. I still get acne sometimes, especially before my period, and I have some stubborn spots that always appear in the same place or very deep pimples that take a long time to heal. But I feel like I’m almost there, and I wanted to share my experience with benzoyl peroxide after four full months of use.\n\nAs for my skincare routine, I keep it very simple now. I only use sunscreen, benzoyl peroxide, moisturizer, and a cleansing gel. That’s it—no acids, no retinol, nothing else. I also don’t wear makeup.\n\n**Photos**\n\nI was taking weekly progress photos but stopped at some point, so I don’t have pictures from November and December. Still, I think what I have shows the progress clearly.\n\nFirst photo: September 8th 2025 (first day of BP)  \nLast photo: today, January 13th 2026\n\nI still have a lot of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (not treating it specifically right now), but almost no inflamed acne.\n\nI also attached a photo of the exact benzoyl peroxide product I use. I live in Germany and bought it on Amazon.\n\nThat’s it, I’m sorry for the massive post—I really wanted to include all the details I wish I had found when I was researching this months ago. Happy to answer any questions, I’m originally from Brazil, so feel free to ask in Portuguese if that’s easier.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x5xlpi2qv6dg1.jpg?width=2160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20039a29a66a8fa5cad7e405dcf4660517db3fe7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5b12x3frv6dg1.jpg?width=2160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5633a8bb4092c620a6bf785f17ae310b9688517f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0fwelebsv6dg1.jpg?width=1364&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a736213f90541808be6ead7d3efc4d3feb84434\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j37nx1usv6dg1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4599d601a782eea5152f7ad9b0ac018121abcaf9\n\n  \n",
