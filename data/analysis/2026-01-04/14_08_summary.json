I decided to splash out and treat myself to some skin peels to help.\n\nThese skin peels are very expensive. I don't know why as they take like 15 minutes. This was my third one at this place. The practitioner said to me 'oh wow your skin is bad' and then continues to go on about it. Like I know it's not perfect, that is why I am here?? Spending lots of money?? It's not even that bad at the moment.\n\nI would say it's down to the person but this has been a regular occurrence for me and I have tried different places but people always seem to comment on how bad my skin is. For reference I currently have three active spots and some redness on my chin from previous spots.\n\nWhy do they do this? What do I do when they make comments like this and it upsets me? My urge is to get out pictures of my skin a year ago to prove it's better lol. \n",

I've had pretty severe facial acne (mainly on me cheeks, I have a few spots and scars on my forehead but they're minimal and not super noticeable. I no longer have chest and back acne after some treatments) for a few years now. I've tried different things to get rid of it/manage it. I went to a private dermatologist and she gave me a skincare routine with her recommended face wash and moisturising cream. On top of that she gave me oral antibiotics along with two prescription creams (Finacea which had Azelaic acid, and Treclin which is a Vitamin A gel). The combination of those things seemed to work for a little, but when I stopped the course of antibiotics the acne just came back; the creams only helped reduce the severity of acne. Now that I've run out of the creams the acne has come back just as severe as before, if not worse. \nI've also tried some other things, like Norse Organics which I heard worked for some people (did nothing for me) and going vegan for a while (only made me lose weight). I feel like the only other treatment option for me is to get Roacutane, but that has some very bad potential side affects so I would like to try other things before I get on that. \nDoes anyone have any tips on how to get rid of my acne?

I used the 4-clip towards the bottom, another 4-clip just above it, and two 2-clips on each side on the front, about two fingers from my hairline. Thet set also comes with two 3-clips.\n\nThe set was about $160 on sale from $200. The extensions are really lovely and fantastic quality. However, as much as I love the extensions, Bebonia gets a fail on convenience. I tried a different color initially and exchanged them for another. They charged me $30 to return! It's really hard to match your color on the first try, so that's kinda BS because it could take more tries. \n\nFor my routine, I use suave daily clarifying shampoo, 2 pumps each half of my head of aunt jackie frizz patrol mousse, generic bounce brush, and dyson dryer to set the curls. \n",

I live in the Midwest where it is currently very cold, and traditional diffusing before work tends to result in bad frizz and a bad hair day overall. My curls do not like this cold winter weather because I prefer to air dry, but there is not enough time in the mornings. I cannot wash the night before because my hair gets mis-shapen  and smooshed down from my CPAP that I wear at night. I do wear a silk cap under the CPAP.

Some of the bumps become painful, inflamed, and when they come to a head they fill with pus. Sometimes they hurt so much that I end up popping them just to relieve the pressure.\n\nI’ve tried everything:\n\t•\tSalicylic acid\n\t•\tLa Roche-Posay, Eucerin (basically every pharmacy brand available to me)\n\t•\tKorean skincare as well (sadly, it didn’t help and sometimes made things worse)\n\t•\tI’m currently using Skinoren (azelaic acid – Greek version) and a zinc oxide cream\n\t•\tI cleanse with a product containing activated charcoal\n\nMy skin type is normal to oily.\n\nAll my hormonal blood tests are normal, yet the acne keeps coming back and never fully clears.\n\nI also want to mention that I live in the Balkans, so I don’t have easy access to all cosmetic or prescription products that are commonly recommended in the US or Western Europe.\n\nThis is not severe acne, but it’s chronic, painful, and exhausting, and nothing seems to truly calm my skin.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with cheek-focused, painful acne with normal hormones, I’d really appreciate your advice.\nThank you.\n",

      "content": "I have long, 3B, low-porosity, graying hair, and my \"holy grail\" for years has been 100% Kinky Curly.  I use the Come Clean shampoo, Knot Today conditioner (I use this as a co-wash between shampoos and also as a rinse-out/leave-in), and the Curling Custard gel.  I love this routine because it is free of proteins and heavy butters and oils, and because it is very simple - only three, CG-friendly, natural and versatile products, all from the same brand.  I also love that none of the products has a strong fragrance.\n\nI now live in Spain and will soon run out of the Kinky Curly products that I brought from the U.S.  Can anyone recommend a similar product line that is available in Spain?  Bonus points for products available in stores like Primor or Druni, but I will order online if necessary.  I need a strong hold gel because I live on the coast where it can get very humid (my KCCC works great if I use a lot of it and then diffuse after).  Thank you!",

      "content": "I'm 18 years old (F), but I think I started losing hair when I was almost 16. It might've been due to stress from school and competitions, but I don't think it was severe enough for me to lose over half of my hair. I suspect I might have androgenic alopecia and telogen effluvium, but I can't get any bloodwork done. Please help me, I can't even bear to go outside anymore with my hair like this. I spend hours staring at my scalp, and most of the time I don't even want to look at myself.\n\nI've used the Ordinary hair serum for density for like 2 months during summer and then stopped. Then starting around September I used it again but not consistently until December. I saw some baby hair, but it was still so little. My shedding never stopped, and I think my hair is miniaturizing because sometimes when I massage my scalp, baby hair or short hairs fall out. In desperation, I bought Some By Mi Cica Peptide Anti Hair Loss Tonic, Avalon Organics Biotin B-Complex Thickening Shampoo, and Avalon Organics Rosemary Volumizing Shampoo for fine hair from Healthy Options (I've only used them twice so far and no irritation, although the shampoos caused some dryness). Prior to that, I've been using the Tsubaki Volume &amp; Repair shampoo. I am still using Lavojoy Hold Me Tight Pro Anti-Hair Loss Conditioner and Luxe Organix Clarifying Shampoo that contains biotin and sea salt. I take NutriXpert Multivitamins (Vit A, C, D, E + Zinc) and Sangobion iron capsules. I also use a round brush hair dryer and tried to fix my lifestyle (more sleep &amp; food).\n\nI have thin, coarse hair (wavy to curly) that used to be SUPER thick and live in the Philippines. Stuff like Nizoral shampoo or derma rollers isn't available here, and I live in a strict household that doesn't allow online orders. I was only able to get the ordinary hair serum from a friend. I feel like I've tried everything from homemade remedies to seriously expensive serums that don't work at all (seapuri). As much as possible, I need affordable products that don't need to be washed out or can fit into busy schedules that's why I mostly bought shampoo. I'd still appreciate products that make my hair look thick even if isn't. I spend hours styling my hair everyday to make it look thick and even changed to a side part.\n\n I just got a keratin treatment a few days ago to make my hair straight. I feel like all the frizz and tangles made me lose more hair. And I was able to see I actually had a lot of baby hair but only on the crown (but my parting is still more visible than I'd like). My sides and the back of my head are really thin and seem to have no progress at all, like zero baby hairs. Absolutely cannot use minoxidil because of the side effects + I have pets.\n\nCan someone tell me why this is happening? And if my products are any good?",

After a haircut in September, where my hair was sadly straightened,my curls started looking a lot looser and were not as nice looking. They started falling flat and limp, were frizzy and just looked way different than they used to. When they were straightened a heat protectant was used, however, I don’t know which one. I started using Rizos Curls Products after that haircut, which basically has no Protein as far as I know. So basically my hair wasn’t getting protein for almost 3 months straight. My hair dries different now and also feels different. I have no idea how to get them back.\n\nMy routine consisted of:\n\n\\- Shampoo and Conditioner by Jean&amp;Len\n\n\\- As I Am leave in classic\n\n\\- Rizos Curls Curl Defining Mousse\n\n\\- Rizos Curls Strong Hold gel\n\nI started with the leave in and raked that throughout my hair with my hands, just a quarter size. Then 3 pumps mousse, sometimes raked in sometimes scrunched. Then the gel, just a little bit also scrunched. After that I diffused and always slept with a bonnet.\n\nWhen I started researching why my hair was like this, I heard a lot about Protein, so I got the Rehab Salve from Curlsmith. I used this like 2 times now but it just looked better right after that but not long term. I’ve been trying for a month now to find the problem but I am clueless. I don’t know what to do and how to fix it and it’s really messing me up because I love my hair :(\n\nThe first two pics is my hair over a year ago where I was only using As I Am Long&amp;Luxe Curl Enhancing Smoothie.\n\nThe 3rd and 4th pic is before the haircut, after that my hair was straightened and I wasn’t using any protein products. The other pics is my hair now using the same styling method, however, my curls look much looser now in my opinion.\n\nCould it be dead ends now that they grown out more? Is it the lack of protein over 3 months? Is it something else entirely? If you have any ideas please tell me!\n\nThank you!",

I applied heat while waiting for 15 min (blow drier )\n\n\\- I noticed that my hair needed moisture for some reason . It was still uh not very soft after deep conditioning so after I rinced I also applied the conditioner for 3 min .\n\n\\- After that I applied (Mineral water + garnier papaye leave in . To dilute it and idk if I have hard water so better using mineral water to rewet at least)\n\n\\- I used shea moisture coconut and hibiscus soufflé as a gel to lock in my curls . I did section them and brush style making sure to create some tension while  brushing to make the curls bounce\n\n\\- I blow dried on low heat with my diffuser\n\nPlanning to add argan oil Morocco from ogx (when my hair is 100% dry)",
