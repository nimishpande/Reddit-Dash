I use Aussie detangler and shampoo when needed but most showers I just only use conditioner. \n\nI usually let it air dry and will put in some Not Your Mother's Curl leave in conditioner on occasions. I have a wide tooth comb I use, and a regular comb I will use to fix my part in the middle. I also sleep with satin pillow cases and also use a bonnet if I don't feel like wetting my hair the next day. \n\nI really want to keep growing it out, although how long it's taking is a tad frustrating some times. But do you think I should try a new style? Or should I just invest in one of those bounce brushes or try finger coiling? Any feedback and thoughts are appreciated thanks!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

First picture is in a dryer climate and last in a very humid climate. \n\nRoutine: I use cantu conditioner and leave in conditioner from kinky curly knot today on soaking wet hair + hair foam. I wash 2-3 times a week and I usually do no poo unless there’s a lot of build up. I also only aid dry. I sleep with my hair pineapple style but just normal pillow and don’t have a refresh routine since my hair takes too long to get wet. \n\nHope these pics aren’t too creepy btw but I’m a bit nervous about posting online. \n\nThank you so much everyone :))",

I used the 4-clip towards the bottom, another 4-clip just above it, and two 2-clips on each side on the front, about two fingers from my hairline. Thet set also comes with two 3-clips.\n\nThe set was about $160 on sale from $200. The extensions are really lovely and fantastic quality. However, as much as I love the extensions, Bebonia gets a fail on convenience. I tried a different color initially and exchanged them for another. They charged me $30 to return! It's really hard to match your color on the first try, so that's kinda BS because it could take more tries. \n\nFor my routine, I use suave daily clarifying shampoo, 2 pumps each half of my head of aunt jackie frizz patrol mousse, generic bounce brush, and dyson dryer to set the curls. \n",

But when I moved the bay area, (my home area is more humid and chilly) the area around my cheeks became mlre dry while my now and T area still produce a good amount of oil, even with moisturizers and sunscreen, my cheeks still feel dry with skin sometime flaking up a tiny bit, hardly noticable but I can see if I get close enough to the mirror and feel it too. It also has been breaking out more on my cheeks when it gets really dry like that. Does anyone know of any products or routine that would help with this, especially living in a more humid environment with combination skin? Any advice is highly appreciated. Thank you all.\n(Extra info: In case this information is needed, I use cerave moisturizing cream, cerave acne foaming clean cleanser. Im very new to skincare and only use a cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen for now)",

There used to be a lot of pus and even bleeding, which made me extremely self-conscious. Because of that, I avoided posting pictures or talking about it online.\n\nNow the active acne is mostly gone, but I’m left with a lot of acne scars, bumps, and uneven skin tone. Honestly, I feel stuck and don’t see a clear solution anymore.\n\nI joined Reddit specifically to ask for skincare advice from people who have experience or knowledge in this area. I genuinely want to improve my skin and understand what options I have.\n\nI’m 21 years old, and it feels like time is slipping by. I’d really appreciate any honest advice, guidance, or personal experiences that could help me move forward.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to help.",
