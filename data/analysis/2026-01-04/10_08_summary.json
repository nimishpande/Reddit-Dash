      "content": "HI!\n\nSo Ive gotten buzzcuts my whole life, never had a haircut to style it. My hair has only recently gotten to a length that it feels even remotely feminine to me. So Im terrified of getting a haircut, but my hair is a mess and needs it.\n\nIm working with a few issues here, name 1) My hairline is fucked, especially at the temples. Luckily my hair is dense everywhere else. 2) My hair is curly and I still havent figured out how to manage it yet.\n\nThe first 2 pics are unedited pics of my hair, but the last 2 are with the Zoom background blur, and I lowkey love how much nicer it makes my hair look.\n\nI'm going to a queer friendly hair salon, so I expect they wont fuck me over with a masc cut. But IDK what to ask for. I dont want to lose length, but Im sick of my hair being a poofy, frizzy mess.\n\nI feel like curtain bangs are the obvious answer for the hairline issue, but I think they can be hit or miss for me. Sometimes my bangs form locks, and I feel like that would ruin the curtain bang effect.  What other things could I ask for to help get a more fem appearance?\n\nI grew my hair out longer than this, once when I was younger, but I had a Highschool Musical Corbin Bleu Fro and it doesnt read particular fem for me.\n\nAs far as my haircare goes, I shampoo 3x a week (scalp only) and conditioner 6-7x week. I always apply a castor oil/jojoba  oil blend onto my hair while its still damp, and then let it air dry. I have a shower filter which seemed to help with the dryness, and satin pillow cases which seemed to reduce my hair turning into a complete birds nest. I have a sensitive scalp, so I just use Cerave gentle shampoo/ conditioner, which my scalp is most happy with. Any curly hair products I tried aggravated my scalp so badly.\n\nLast thing, I feel like Ive just started getting past the \"awkward\" phase where it was extra poofy, and Im scared any cuts will just send me back to the \"awkward\" phase. Am I better just not cutting it until it grows a bit longer?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated :) ",

I'm on the verge of giving up, but I thought I'd try extensions as a final effort and I love them! \n\nThese are Bebonia, curly (not coily) 2b-3b, in the color dark ash brown, 14 in. I used the 4-clip towards the bottom, another 4-clip just above it, and two 2-clips on each side on the front, about two fingers from my hairline. Thet set also comes with two 3-clips.\n\nThe set was about $160 on sale from $200. The extensions are really lovely and fantastic quality. However, as much as I love the extensions, Bebonia gets a fail on convenience. I tried a different color initially and exchanged them for another. They charged me $30 to return! It's really hard to match your color on the first try, so that's kinda BS because it could take more tries. \n\nFor my routine, I use suave daily clarifying shampoo, 2 pumps each half of my head of aunt jackie frizz patrol mousse, generic bounce brush, and dyson dryer to set the curls. \n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Hi guys, I feel like I’m at my wits end trying to figure out how to address this acne that’s appearing all over my face.\n\nI think it started back at the end of October when I might have over exfoliated my face. After using cosrx’s bha blackhead power liquid and anua’s azaleic acid (would use one of them every three days and alternate for the next time), I developed colorless bumps on my cheeks. I’ve always struggled with texture in the center of my face but never like this. I stopped using these products very quickly.\n\nI went on vacation in November and during that time, I did get some pimples but I think that it was from starting garnier’s waterproof micellar water as most disappeared when I stopped using it.\n\nSince I came home in December, it has just gotten so much worse. As of right now, I am using cetaphil cleanser and lotion. I alternate between regular garnier micellar water and dhc cleansing oil to remove makeup. For sunscreen, I alternate between elta md and round lab.\n\nI feel like I have tried literally every product at some point in my life and most things don’t work for my dry, sensitive skin. I know for a fact my skin does not like vanicream or toners. I’m sticking with cetaphil right now bc it reduced a stubborn redness in the center of my face and did not trigger any reaction before all this. I also do not think there has a been a major shift in my diet nor stress.\n\nBased on all this information, I would really appreciate any suggestions or advice anyone can offer! I would especially love to know if anyone thinks I should reintroduce actives again or just focus on my barrier :)",

      "content": "I've combed this sub for previous posts and comments on advice for leave ins, focusing on the ones that reference their porosity and curl pattern for context, and have narrowed it down to Innersense and Ecoslay's leave ins sounding best for my hair (waist length easily dried out, low porosity, mixed 2c/3a with mostly 3a, used to be quite thick but due to thyroid issues and other health problems the last few years it's gotten thinner and more easily weigh down than I've been used to throughout my life, but not quite full on \"thin\" caregory). \n\nMy question to you guys is, for those of you have used the rice pudding leave in, is protein overload ever an issue for you? Any cons to either leave in that I should keep in mind while using to avoid problems? My biggest goals with it are just to hopefully find something that isn't too heavy that it weighs my hair down, but also something that helps moisturize my hair and prevent split ends.\n\nFor context, my routine is:\n\nI wash my hair twice a week at the most, and do a once a month bentonite clay apple cider vinegar clarifying treatment followed by a deep conditioner treatment. Sometimes shea moisture (manuka honey or sea kelp masks) or miracle repair. I do the Elizavecca CER-100 treatment every 2 or 3 weeks, if I've just done a deep condition treatment within 2 weeks though I wait at least 2 weeks to do a CER-100. To style I use Innersense I create definition scrunched out with hair oil on wash days, and have been using Tre luxe 4 in 1 hydrating curl cream before applying the innersense, but it's a bit heavy for me and looking to try something else. \n\n\nThanks for anyone sharing their experience with these two products, or things to look out for based on their ingredients! Appreciate you guys and have learned a lot here : )",

      "content": "**22-year-old male with a strong family history of baldness on both my paternal and maternal sides. (Dad started balding in his early 30s)**\n\n**I first started noticing my hair loss in April 2024**. Unfortunately, I convinced myself it was probably just a mature hairline, so I didn’t do much about it. At first it didn’t bother me at all, but as time went on, I started thinking about it more and more.\n\n**In March 2025, I started using Rogaine Foam once a day** at 8:00 PM. I honestly didn’t notice any shedding, either in the shower or around me. I also didn’t notice major changes, but my daily routine got in the way (I go out a lot at night), so during the summer I wasn’t very consistent sometimes applying at 9 PM, 10 PM, or even midnight or sometimes less than 4 hours after I showered. I eventually **stopped in early August 2025, and after that I kinda noticed a clear acceleration in my receding hairline, even if I didnt notice any result from it.** It felt like things got significantly worse within about two months.\n\n**In October, I started finasteride at 1.25 mg per day** (insurance doesn’t cover the 1 mg dose). I experience **zero side effects** it feels like taking a sugar pill lol. I’ve always had a high libido, and sex has been a big part of my adult life. **I also think side effects may be somewhat exaggerated and influenced by psychology (without dismissing others’ real suffering)**. I’m generally a very anxious person, but honestly I don’t focus on it I take finasteride in the morning and sometimes even forget I’m on it. I also try not to constantly check Reddit, take too many photos of my hair, or let my life revolve around hair loss.\n\nI**t’s now been 3 months on finasteride, and I’ve noticed my hairline becoming more sparse. The edges look frizzy and brittle, and it seems to be receding. I also see a lot of small hairs around the area. I’m not sure what to expect next, which is why I’m here.**\n\nSome additional context:\n\n* Very tall and skinny (6'1\", 65 kg)\n* **Unhealthy lifestyle: student, go out a lot, sleep very late, and don’t sleep much**\n* No alcohol or energy drinks; some coffee\n* **Take Adderall, Xanax, Ketamine and weed daily, also a heavy vaper.**\n* **Diet isn’t too great**\n* Sometimes take very hot showers and use basic shampoo\n\n**I had blood work done in August 2025 because of a car accident, MCV is good and nothing abnormal such as anemia, B12 deficiency, or serious health issues. However, I do have a mild potassium deficiency and haven’t tested my vitamin D.**\n\nI know vitamins and lifestyle can play a role, but **my hair loss looks much more like male pattern baldness than diffuse thinning (like telogen effluvium)**, so I don’t think that’s the main cause. Tell me if im wrong tho!\n\n**I’m much more worried about the effectiveness of finasteride and minoxidil than their side effects.** I’ve always been a skeptical person, so real results feel almost too good to be true. I’m also prepared to accept going bald—even if it makes me look worse, I’ll adapt my style, because confidence and what you project matter more than hair. I don’t want to become the kind of desperate guy chasing questionable remedies or products. **I want to maintain a healthy and balanced mindset, hair loss is an aesthetic issue, and while it bothers me, it’s not like losing an arm.**\n\n**I’m realistic with my expectations. I’m more focused on maintaining what I still have rather than trying to regrow everything.**\n\nSorry for the long post guys ! I wanted to be as clear and transparent as possible.  \nShould I restart minoxidil? Change my lifestyle? What should I realistically expect from my current treatment? Any advice is appreciated :)",
