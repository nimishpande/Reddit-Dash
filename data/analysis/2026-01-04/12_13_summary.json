Currently it is almost under control with Spironolactone and topicals but I've still got years of marks to clear up. I decided to splash out and treat myself to some skin peels to help.\n\nThese skin peels are very expensive. I don't know why as they take like 15 minutes. This was my third one at this place. The practitioner said to me 'oh wow your skin is bad' and then continues to go on about it. Like I know it's not perfect, that is why I am here?? Spending lots of money?? It's not even that bad at the moment.\n\nI would say it's down to the person but this has been a regular occurrence for me and I have tried different places but people always seem to comment on how bad my skin is. For reference I currently have three active spots and some redness on my chin from previous spots.\n\nWhy do they do this? What do I do when they make comments like this and it upsets me? My urge is to get out pictures of my skin a year ago to prove it's better lol. \n",

      "content": "HI!\n\nSo Ive gotten buzzcuts my whole life, never had a haircut to style it. My hair has only recently gotten to a length that it feels even remotely feminine to me. So Im terrified of getting a haircut, but my hair is a mess and needs it.\n\nIm working with a few issues here, name 1) My hairline is fucked, especially at the temples. Luckily my hair is dense everywhere else. 2) My hair is curly and I still havent figured out how to manage it yet.\n\nThe first 2 pics are unedited pics of my hair, but the last 2 are with the Zoom background blur, and I lowkey love how much nicer it makes my hair look.\n\nI'm going to a queer friendly hair salon, so I expect they wont fuck me over with a masc cut. But IDK what to ask for. I dont want to lose length, but Im sick of my hair being a poofy, frizzy mess.\n\nI feel like curtain bangs are the obvious answer for the hairline issue, but I think they can be hit or miss for me. Sometimes my bangs form locks, and I feel like that would ruin the curtain bang effect.  What other things could I ask for to help get a more fem appearance?\n\nI grew my hair out longer than this, once when I was younger, but I had a Highschool Musical Corbin Bleu Fro and it doesnt read particular fem for me.\n\nAs far as my haircare goes, I shampoo 3x a week (scalp only) and conditioner 6-7x week. I always apply a castor oil/jojoba  oil blend onto my hair while its still damp, and then let it air dry. I have a shower filter which seemed to help with the dryness, and satin pillow cases which seemed to reduce my hair turning into a complete birds nest. I have a sensitive scalp, so I just use Cerave gentle shampoo/ conditioner, which my scalp is most happy with. Any curly hair products I tried aggravated my scalp so badly.\n\nLast thing, I feel like Ive just started getting past the \"awkward\" phase where it was extra poofy, and Im scared any cuts will just send me back to the \"awkward\" phase. Am I better just not cutting it until it grows a bit longer?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated :) ",

I used the 4-clip towards the bottom, another 4-clip just above it, and two 2-clips on each side on the front, about two fingers from my hairline. Thet set also comes with two 3-clips.\n\nThe set was about $160 on sale from $200. The extensions are really lovely and fantastic quality. However, as much as I love the extensions, Bebonia gets a fail on convenience. I tried a different color initially and exchanged them for another. They charged me $30 to return! It's really hard to match your color on the first try, so that's kinda BS because it could take more tries. \n\nFor my routine, I use suave daily clarifying shampoo, 2 pumps each half of my head of aunt jackie frizz patrol mousse, generic bounce brush, and dyson dryer to set the curls. \n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Hi guys, I feel like I’m at my wits end trying to figure out how to address this acne that’s appearing all over my face.\n\nI think it started back at the end of October when I might have over exfoliated my face. After using cosrx’s bha blackhead power liquid and anua’s azaleic acid (would use one of them every three days and alternate for the next time), I developed colorless bumps on my cheeks. I’ve always struggled with texture in the center of my face but never like this. I stopped using these products very quickly.\n\nI went on vacation in November and during that time, I did get some pimples but I think that it was from starting garnier’s waterproof micellar water as most disappeared when I stopped using it.\n\nSince I came home in December, it has just gotten so much worse. As of right now, I am using cetaphil cleanser and lotion. I alternate between regular garnier micellar water and dhc cleansing oil to remove makeup. For sunscreen, I alternate between elta md and round lab.\n\nI feel like I have tried literally every product at some point in my life and most things don’t work for my dry, sensitive skin. I know for a fact my skin does not like vanicream or toners. I’m sticking with cetaphil right now bc it reduced a stubborn redness in the center of my face and did not trigger any reaction before all this. I also do not think there has a been a major shift in my diet nor stress.\n\nBased on all this information, I would really appreciate any suggestions or advice anyone can offer! I would especially love to know if anyone thinks I should reintroduce actives again or just focus on my barrier :)",

Some of the bumps become painful, inflamed, and when they come to a head they fill with pus. Sometimes they hurt so much that I end up popping them just to relieve the pressure.\n\nI’ve tried everything:\n\t•\tSalicylic acid\n\t•\tLa Roche-Posay, Eucerin (basically every pharmacy brand available to me)\n\t•\tKorean skincare as well (sadly, it didn’t help and sometimes made things worse)\n\t•\tI’m currently using Skinoren (azelaic acid – Greek version) and a zinc oxide cream\n\t•\tI cleanse with a product containing activated charcoal\n\nMy skin type is normal to oily.\n\nAll my hormonal blood tests are normal, yet the acne keeps coming back and never fully clears.\n\nI also want to mention that I live in the Balkans, so I don’t have easy access to all cosmetic or prescription products that are commonly recommended in the US or Western Europe.\n\nThis is not severe acne, but it’s chronic, painful, and exhausting, and nothing seems to truly calm my skin.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with cheek-focused, painful acne with normal hormones, I’d really appreciate your advice.\nThank you.\n",

      "content": "I have 3a/3b curls that used to easily retain moisture, were quite tight and lasted me 3-4 days. After a haircut in September, where my hair was sadly straightened,my curls started looking a lot looser and were not as nice looking. They started falling flat and limp, were frizzy and just looked way different than they used to. When they were straightened a heat protectant was used, however, I don’t know which one. I started using Rizos Curls Products after that haircut, which basically has no Protein as far as I know. So basically my hair wasn’t getting protein for almost 3 months straight. My hair dries different now and also feels different. I have no idea how to get them back.\n\nMy routine consisted of:\n\n\\- Shampoo and Conditioner by Jean&amp;Len\n\n\\- As I Am leave in classic\n\n\\- Rizos Curls Curl Defining Mousse\n\n\\- Rizos Curls Strong Hold gel\n\nI started with the leave in and raked that throughout my hair with my hands, just a quarter size. Then 3 pumps mousse, sometimes raked in sometimes scrunched. Then the gel, just a little bit also scrunched. After that I diffused and always slept with a bonnet.\n\nWhen I started researching why my hair was like this, I heard a lot about Protein, so I got the Rehab Salve from Curlsmith. I used this like 2 times now but it just looked better right after that but not long term. I’ve been trying for a month now to find the problem but I am clueless. I don’t know what to do and how to fix it and it’s really messing me up because I love my hair :(\n\nThe first two pics is my hair over a year ago where I was only using As I Am Long&amp;Luxe Curl Enhancing Smoothie.\n\nThe 3rd and 4th pic is before the haircut, after that my hair was straightened and I wasn’t using any protein products. The other pics is my hair now using the same styling method, however, my curls look much looser now in my opinion.\n\nCould it be dead ends now that they grown out more? Is it the lack of protein over 3 months? Is it something else entirely? If you have any ideas please tell me!\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "I've combed this sub for previous posts and comments on advice for leave ins, focusing on the ones that reference their porosity and curl pattern for context, and have narrowed it down to Innersense and Ecoslay's leave ins sounding best for my hair (waist length easily dried out, low porosity, mixed 2c/3a with mostly 3a, used to be quite thick but due to thyroid issues and other health problems the last few years it's gotten thinner and more easily weigh down than I've been used to throughout my life, but not quite full on \"thin\" caregory). \n\nMy question to you guys is, for those of you have used the rice pudding leave in, is protein overload ever an issue for you? Any cons to either leave in that I should keep in mind while using to avoid problems? My biggest goals with it are just to hopefully find something that isn't too heavy that it weighs my hair down, but also something that helps moisturize my hair and prevent split ends.\n\nFor context, my routine is:\n\nI wash my hair twice a week at the most, and do a once a month bentonite clay apple cider vinegar clarifying treatment followed by a deep conditioner treatment. Sometimes shea moisture (manuka honey or sea kelp masks) or miracle repair. I do the Elizavecca CER-100 treatment every 2 or 3 weeks, if I've just done a deep condition treatment within 2 weeks though I wait at least 2 weeks to do a CER-100. To style I use Innersense I create definition scrunched out with hair oil on wash days, and have been using Tre luxe 4 in 1 hydrating curl cream before applying the innersense, but it's a bit heavy for me and looking to try something else. \n\n\nThanks for anyone sharing their experience with these two products, or things to look out for based on their ingredients! Appreciate you guys and have learned a lot here : )",
