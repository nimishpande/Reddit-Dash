I’ve also gotten brow laminations and tints, which helps the appearance a lot, but only for about 3-4 weeks. \n\nIf anyone has any advice or ways to fix this please let me know!

I'm on the verge of giving up, but I thought I'd try extensions as a final effort and I love them! \n\nThese are Bebonia, curly (not coily) 2b-3b, in the color dark ash brown, 14 in. I used the 4-clip towards the bottom, another 4-clip just above it, and two 2-clips on each side on the front, about two fingers from my hairline. Thet set also comes with two 3-clips.\n\nThe set was about $160 on sale from $200. The extensions are really lovely and fantastic quality. However, as much as I love the extensions, Bebonia gets a fail on convenience. I tried a different color initially and exchanged them for another. They charged me $30 to return! It's really hard to match your color on the first try, so that's kinda BS because it could take more tries. \n\nFor my routine, I use suave daily clarifying shampoo, 2 pumps each half of my head of aunt jackie frizz patrol mousse, generic bounce brush, and dyson dryer to set the curls. \n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I have a wide tooth comb I use, and a regular comb I will use to fix my part in the middle. I also sleep with satin pillow cases and also use a bonnet if I don't feel like wetting my hair the next day. \n\nI really want to keep growing it out, although how long it's taking is a tad frustrating some times.

First picture is in a dryer climate and last in a very humid climate. \n\nRoutine: I use cantu conditioner and leave in conditioner from kinky curly knot today on soaking wet hair + hair foam. I wash 2-3 times a week and I usually do no poo unless there’s a lot of build up. I also only aid dry. I sleep with my hair pineapple style but just normal pillow and don’t have a refresh routine since my hair takes too long to get wet. \n\nHope these pics aren’t too creepy btw but I’m a bit nervous about posting online. \n\nThank you so much everyone :))",

I’m trying to find a moisturizer because I live in an area with very dry, cold winters and recently, my cheeks and lip area have been getting extremely irritated :(. \n\nThe problem is every moisturizer I’ve tried over the years has broken me out in some way on my forehead and/or causes small bumps to appear on my cheeks.\n\nMoisturizers I’ve tried:\n\n1. Drunk Elephant Lala Retro\n\n2. CeraVe PM Lotion\n\n3. Torriden Dive In Cream\n\n4. Dr. G Red Blemish Cream\n\n5. Iunik Centella Gel Cream\n\n1-4 gave me under the skin pimples, while 5 gave me closed comodones (helped a lot with my redness though!)\n\nMy current routine is:\n\n1. Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Foaming Cleanser\n\n2. Skin 1004 Sunscreen (sometimes 💀)\n\nIf it also helps, Im allergic/sensitive to:\n\n1. Wind/Cold\n\n2. Citrus (It’s like a scale, I can eat 5 strawberries and have a similar reaction to eating 1 orange slice)\n\n3. Fragrance and Flavoring in lip balms (I got a super red and flaky rash from a lip balm that had to be solved by a derm) 😭\n\n4. Pollen\n\n5. Dust mites\n\nLiterally open to anything!!! Thank you!!!",

      "content": "**22-year-old male with a strong family history of baldness on both my paternal and maternal sides. (Dad started balding in his early 30s)**\n\n**I first started noticing my hair loss in April 2024**. Unfortunately, I convinced myself it was probably just a mature hairline, so I didn’t do much about it. At first it didn’t bother me at all, but as time went on, I started thinking about it more and more.\n\n**In March 2025, I started using Rogaine Foam once a day** at 8:00 PM. I honestly didn’t notice any shedding, either in the shower or around me. I also didn’t notice major changes, but my daily routine got in the way (I go out a lot at night), so during the summer I wasn’t very consistent sometimes applying at 9 PM, 10 PM, or even midnight or sometimes less than 4 hours after I showered. I eventually **stopped in early August 2025, and after that I kinda noticed a clear acceleration in my receding hairline, even if I didnt notice any result from it.** It felt like things got significantly worse within about two months.\n\n**In October, I started finasteride at 1.25 mg per day** (insurance doesn’t cover the 1 mg dose). I experience **zero side effects** it feels like taking a sugar pill lol. I’ve always had a high libido, and sex has been a big part of my adult life. **I also think side effects may be somewhat exaggerated and influenced by psychology (without dismissing others’ real suffering)**. I’m generally a very anxious person, but honestly I don’t focus on it I take finasteride in the morning and sometimes even forget I’m on it. I also try not to constantly check Reddit, take too many photos of my hair, or let my life revolve around hair loss.\n\nI**t’s now been 3 months on finasteride, and I’ve noticed my hairline becoming more sparse. The edges look frizzy and brittle, and it seems to be receding. I also see a lot of small hairs around the area. I’m not sure what to expect next, which is why I’m here.**\n\nSome additional context:\n\n* Very tall and skinny (6'1\", 65 kg)\n* **Unhealthy lifestyle: student, go out a lot, sleep very late, and don’t sleep much**\n* No alcohol or energy drinks; some coffee\n* **Take Adderall, Xanax, Ketamine and weed daily, also a heavy vaper.**\n* **Diet isn’t too great**\n* Sometimes take very hot showers and use basic shampoo\n\n**I had blood work done in August 2025 because of a car accident, MCV is good and nothing abnormal such as anemia, B12 deficiency, or serious health issues. However, I do have a mild potassium deficiency and haven’t tested my vitamin D.**\n\nI know vitamins and lifestyle can play a role, but **my hair loss looks much more like male pattern baldness than diffuse thinning (like telogen effluvium)**, so I don’t think that’s the main cause. Tell me if im wrong tho!\n\n**I’m much more worried about the effectiveness of finasteride and minoxidil than their side effects.** I’ve always been a skeptical person, so real results feel almost too good to be true. I’m also prepared to accept going bald—even if it makes me look worse, I’ll adapt my style, because confidence and what you project matter more than hair. I don’t want to become the kind of desperate guy chasing questionable remedies or products. **I want to maintain a healthy and balanced mindset, hair loss is an aesthetic issue, and while it bothers me, it’s not like losing an arm.**\n\n**I’m realistic with my expectations. I’m more focused on maintaining what I still have rather than trying to regrow everything.**\n\nSorry for the long post guys ! I wanted to be as clear and transparent as possible.  \nShould I restart minoxidil? Change my lifestyle? What should I realistically expect from my current treatment? Any advice is appreciated :)",

I just don't have the time or energy anymore to have to style it all the time. My wash day takes 3 hours every 4 days and I just can't do it anymore. Swimming, rain, humidity, etc, it all makes me so scared to just experience life without 24/7 worrying about my hair.\n\nI want to get it straightened, so that even after I wash it, it will come out straight, or like SLIGHTLY wavy is fine, like 1c,2a. **I got a keratin smoothing** done this year, they told me it would not straighten, just defrizz. They said it'd last up to 6 months. I got it done at a salon, and they said to leave it in for 2-3 days before washing, but the longer the better, i left it in for 7 days and then washed. My **hair reverted to curly as usual**, I can't tell if it was less frizzy or not, but wtv. About 2 months later, I had **SO SO MUCH shedding**, idk if it was related to the keratin treatment or not. I did feel a little bit of scalp burning during the treatment. SO MUCH SHEDDING. I was so so worried. The shedding lasted about 4 washes, or a month, and then went away I think.\n\nAnyway, now, I really want straightening done, not smoothing or defrizzing, actually straight. **It needs to be straight after washing too**. BUT, I am worried about damage, specifically shedding/hair loss, **idc if it causes split ends, but I CANNOT have hair loss or too much breakage** again. **I've looked into magic sleek, proaddiction, pura luxe, keratin?, brazillian, etc.**\n\n**Please SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE with the treatments, and if you're a stylist, give recommendations.**",

I switched to an oral minoxidil and finasteride combo pill in June and starting in September or October I noticed even more shedding than usual and recently noticed less density in my (non-existent) hairline.\n\nI decided to switch to Dutasteride a month ago and I haven't had a large shedding phase so far but I have noticed an improvement. Instead of seeing hair on my hands every single day, I now have a day or two where I won't lose any hair at all. On days I do shed it's a lot less, although I did lose quite a bit yesterday. \n\nThis may be a dumb question that I might already know the answer to but does this mean Dutasteride is actually working for me? Is there a minute chance it could help give me some regrowth in the temple region? I will start taking pictures so I have a point of reference ",
