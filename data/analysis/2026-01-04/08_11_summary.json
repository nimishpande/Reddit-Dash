I'm on the verge of giving up, but I thought I'd try extensions as a final effort and I love them! \n\nThese are Bebonia, curly (not coily) 2b-3b, in the color dark ash brown, 14 in. I used the 4-clip towards the bottom, another 4-clip just above it, and two 2-clips on each side on the front, about two fingers from my hairline. Thet set also comes with two 3-clips.\n\nThe set was about $160 on sale from $200. The extensions are really lovely and fantastic quality. However, as much as I love the extensions, Bebonia gets a fail on convenience. I tried a different color initially and exchanged them for another. They charged me $30 to return! It's really hard to match your color on the first try, so that's kinda BS because it could take more tries. \n\nFor my routine, I use suave daily clarifying shampoo, 2 pumps each half of my head of aunt jackie frizz patrol mousse, generic bounce brush, and dyson dryer to set the curls. \n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I have a wide tooth comb I use, and a regular comb I will use to fix my part in the middle. I also sleep with satin pillow cases and also use a bonnet if I don't feel like wetting my hair the next day. \n\nI really want to keep growing it out, although how long it's taking is a tad frustrating some times.

      "content": "I've combed this sub for previous posts and comments on advice for leave ins, focusing on the ones that reference their porosity and curl pattern for context, and have narrowed it down to Innersense and Ecoslay's leave ins sounding best for my hair (waist length easily dried out, low porosity, mixed 2c/3a with mostly 3a, used to be quite thick but due to thyroid issues and other health problems the last few years it's gotten thinner and more easily weigh down than I've been used to throughout my life, but not quite full on \"thin\" caregory). \n\nMy question to you guys is, for those of you have used the rice pudding leave in, is protein overload ever an issue for you? Any cons to either leave in that I should keep in mind while using to avoid problems? My biggest goals with it are just to hopefully find something that isn't too heavy that it weighs my hair down, but also something that helps moisturize my hair and prevent split ends.\n\nFor context, my routine is:\n\nI wash my hair twice a week at the most, and do a once a month bentonite clay apple cider vinegar clarifying treatment followed by a deep conditioner treatment. Sometimes shea moisture (manuka honey or sea kelp masks) or miracle repair. I do the Elizavecca CER-100 treatment every 2 or 3 weeks, if I've just done a deep condition treatment within 2 weeks though I wait at least 2 weeks to do a CER-100. To style I use Innersense I create definition scrunched out with hair oil on wash days, and have been using Tre luxe 4 in 1 hydrating curl cream before applying the innersense, but it's a bit heavy for me and looking to try something else. \n\n\nThanks for anyone sharing their experience with these two products, or things to look out for based on their ingredients! Appreciate you guys and have learned a lot here : )",

      "content": "Hi! I'm pretty new to taking care of my skin. Unfortunately, I've spent my 20's neglecting it but I want to make changes!\n\nI guess I'm looking for someone to take a look at my skin and point me in whichever direction I need to go - I grew up in a household where skincare was shunned. My Pa didn't believe in it (His words!), and so much as a little mousturiser was too effeminate. Since then I've come out as non-binary, and am undergoing a feminizing transition, shows what he knows! Unfortunately, the side effect is that I've done nothing for 30 years and I'm utterly clueless, and I'm losing my beard which, although a good change, has meant I can no-longer just cover up my face in wirey fuzz.\n\nI figure it's probably best if I just list out what's going on because I don't know what is and isn't relevent!\n\n* I'm undergoing laser hair removal for my beard. 8 sessions in, many more to go. I've taken to it well, but it's a long process.\n* I'm taking HRT, estrogen and testerone levels are in the female range.\n* I have psoriasis with maybe a dozen small spots on my face that I treat in short courses of mild steroids. Potentially adding calcipotrol. My derm has me applying VERY small amounts of the medication to my plaques on my face. VERY small amounts. No more than 2 weeks continued usage.\n* I've lost, and am losing, a lot of weight. 30kg in the past year for various reasons, and I've noticed it in my face. Just looks like it's lost a bit of that bounce as the fat has gone!\n\nAnd then there's a couple things I'm immediately concerned with, and what I'd like to change\n\n* I have sun damage on my cheeks. Spider-veins and rosacea run in the family, but I'm sure some of that is sun damage, too.\n* I feel as though my skin is just kinda lifeless and drained, especially around my eyes. I drink a lot of water, so I'm sure I'm not just dehydrated. Could stress be a factor or is some of that just the aforementioned weight loss?\n* I want my skin to look more even, as much as I can be with respect to both my age, the permanent damage and the changing nature of LHR and how my facial hair and shadow cycles in and out.\n* I want to know I'm doing all I can to keep my skin healthy. I went into my 30's wishing I knew more and took better care of it, I don't want to go into my 40's thinking the same thing. Second best time to plant a tree is right now, right?\n\nI've started wearing sunscreen whenever I'm doing more than putting the garbage out as my first step - La Roche Posay Anthelios UVMune. It's the only sunscreen that doesn't immediately sweat and bead off. So, that's a good start I think!\n\nI've tried digging into YouTube videos as well as the threads in this sub's Holy Grail index - There looks like a lot of great information, but I really can't decipher a lot of it, and the sheer volume is overloading!\n\nKnowing where to start and what I should be or could be helping/correcting in regards to my own skin would be what's needed I think. I will continue reading those threads, though. I'm sure it'll begin to sink in once I get going! The begginer FAQ is already a great help, but I'm really after all I can get.\n\nI hope the photos are helpful, that last one is a bit of a weird angle but I threw that in because it's a close-up in neutral light, just in case it helps! (Rest assured the horrendous eyebrows have been dealt with and are no longer a threat)\n\nThank you &lt;3",

      "content": "**22-year-old male with a strong family history of baldness on both my paternal and maternal sides. (Dad started balding in his early 30s)**\n\n**I first started noticing my hair loss in April 2024**. Unfortunately, I convinced myself it was probably just a mature hairline, so I didn’t do much about it. At first it didn’t bother me at all, but as time went on, I started thinking about it more and more.\n\n**In March 2025, I started using Rogaine Foam once a day** at 8:00 PM. I honestly didn’t notice any shedding, either in the shower or around me. I also didn’t notice major changes, but my daily routine got in the way (I go out a lot at night), so during the summer I wasn’t very consistent sometimes applying at 9 PM, 10 PM, or even midnight or sometimes less than 4 hours after I showered. I eventually **stopped in early August 2025, and after that I kinda noticed a clear acceleration in my receding hairline, even if I didnt notice any result from it.** It felt like things got significantly worse within about two months.\n\n**In October, I started finasteride at 1.25 mg per day** (insurance doesn’t cover the 1 mg dose). I experience **zero side effects** it feels like taking a sugar pill lol. I’ve always had a high libido, and sex has been a big part of my adult life. **I also think side effects may be somewhat exaggerated and influenced by psychology (without dismissing others’ real suffering)**. I’m generally a very anxious person, but honestly I don’t focus on it I take finasteride in the morning and sometimes even forget I’m on it. I also try not to constantly check Reddit, take too many photos of my hair, or let my life revolve around hair loss.\n\nI**t’s now been 3 months on finasteride, and I’ve noticed my hairline becoming more sparse. The edges look frizzy and brittle, and it seems to be receding. I also see a lot of small hairs around the area. I’m not sure what to expect next, which is why I’m here.**\n\nSome additional context:\n\n* Very tall and skinny (6'1\", 65 kg)\n* **Unhealthy lifestyle: student, go out a lot, sleep very late, and don’t sleep much**\n* No alcohol or energy drinks; some coffee\n* **Take Adderall, Xanax, Ketamine and weed daily, also a heavy vaper.**\n* **Diet isn’t too great**\n* Sometimes take very hot showers and use basic shampoo\n\n**I had blood work done in August 2025 because of a car accident, MCV is good and nothing abnormal such as anemia, B12 deficiency, or serious health issues. However, I do have a mild potassium deficiency and haven’t tested my vitamin D.**\n\nI know vitamins and lifestyle can play a role, but **my hair loss looks much more like male pattern baldness than diffuse thinning (like telogen effluvium)**, so I don’t think that’s the main cause. Tell me if im wrong tho!\n\n**I’m much more worried about the effectiveness of finasteride and minoxidil than their side effects.** I’ve always been a skeptical person, so real results feel almost too good to be true. I’m also prepared to accept going bald—even if it makes me look worse, I’ll adapt my style, because confidence and what you project matter more than hair. I don’t want to become the kind of desperate guy chasing questionable remedies or products. **I want to maintain a healthy and balanced mindset, hair loss is an aesthetic issue, and while it bothers me, it’s not like losing an arm.**\n\n**I’m realistic with my expectations. I’m more focused on maintaining what I still have rather than trying to regrow everything.**\n\nSorry for the long post guys ! I wanted to be as clear and transparent as possible.  \nShould I restart minoxidil? Change my lifestyle? What should I realistically expect from my current treatment? Any advice is appreciated :)",

I wash my hair 1 a week with shampoo, some anti-dandruff, and some actual conditioner, finished off with more coconut oil, of course. If I'm going anywhere, I have this styling gel that definitely meant more for theatrical theater uses than curly hair, but a tiny dosage of it certainly keeps the frizz at bay for another hour or so. \n\nI am the only person to have curly hair in my immediate and extended family and I lot of what I do I've had to learn from the internet. A lot of curly hair products seems to be a lot more expensive and I don't know where to start or even if they're worth it. I'm tired of my hair feeling greasy all the time and the frizz never working out. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated, thank you! ❤️❤️",
