      "content": "Hi! I've been wanting short hair for a longgg time &amp; finally got the courage to get my first ever haircut last year. It used to be waist-length when stretched. I got it cut to around shoulder-length (with shrinkage: a little bit past my chin). \n\n**Important context though** On Day 1 of wash day I have less volume and more definition (as seen in pics 1 &amp; 2) but around Day 3-4 I have a LOT of volume (as seen in pics 3 &amp; 5). I also learned it can turn into an afro the first month after my haircut because it was short enough and cut into a round shape (pic 7)\n\nI'm getting another haircut soon and would love to get a pixie this time (reference pics 8-12), but I'd like to get some advice from my fellow redditers. I know all about the pros and cons but I'm just a bit nervous, **with my features will I look more or less feminine? Do I have the features to pull it off? I won't lie, these things are important to me.** Lmk what you think I included pics with and w/o makeup &lt;3\n\nWash-n-go routine:\nWash with Native Coconut shampoo\nConditioner: Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Conditioner, detangle in 6 sections with Crave Naturals brush\nRinse thoroughly\nAdd Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Leave-in Cream to each section, prayer hand method\nBrush style with Crave Naturals brush for volume\nRake in Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic Gel to each section, finger coiling any curls that need some extra love\nAir dry, then scrunch out the crunch with Carol's Daughter 7 Oil Blend Hair &amp; Scalp Oil\nI use a bonnet every night, no refresh\n",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nSo normally I don’t post much, but wanted to drop this as a warning for anyone buying products purely on hype and regretting later.\n\nBack in September I got into fitness, and by December started protein supplements. My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily.\n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

      "title": "[Acne] Anyone else get oily skin / acne specifically from high-protein yogurt? (Greek, cottage cheese, skyr, etc)",
      "content": "I wanted to share an observation I’ve made over years that finally clicked recently while traveling in Southeast Asia.\n\nFor me, high-protein yogurt is a guaranteed trigger for oily skin and pimples. Not dairy in general… not calories… not sugar alone… but concentrated dairy protein.\n\nHere’s the pattern.\n\nFoods that reliably mess up my skin:\n\nEvery single time I eat these regularly, within a few days my face gets noticeably oily and I start getting pimples:\n\n• Greek yogurt\n• Skyr\n• Cottage cheese\n• Chobani\n• “High protein” / low-fat yogurts\n• Fitness yogurts\n• Whey protein\n\nThe first sign is always oiliness… acne comes later if I keep eating it.\n\nFoods that don’t cause problems\n\nThis is where it gets interesting.\n\n• Skim milk\n• Small amounts of regular milk\n• Traditional yogurt (non “high protein”)\n• Eggs\n• Meat / fish\n• Non-dairy protein\n\nSo it’s not “all dairy”… and it’s not simply low fat either.\n\nWhat made it finally click:\n\nI was eating yogurt daily in Vietnam… a normal, traditional yogurt… no issues.\n\nThen I moved to Thailand and replaced it with a low-fat, high-protein yogurt that looked similar.\nWithin days… oily face again.\n\nSame habit. Same timing. Totally different result.\nThat’s when I stopped thinking “dairy causes acne” and started thinking protein concentration and delivery speed.\n\nThe actual trigger (for me):\n\nThe common denominator across everything that breaks me is:\n\n• High protein density\n• Concentrated milk proteins (especially whey)\n• Low or removed fat\n• Fast absorption\n\nLow-fat, high-protein dairy doesn’t exist in nature. It’s milk that’s been taken apart and re-engineered.\n\nYou remove the fat (which slows absorption)… then you concentrate the protein (which spikes insulin)… and you end up with a food that sends a very strong insulin / IGF-1 / mTOR signal.\n\nSebaceous glands are extremely sensitive to those signals.\n\nFor me, that signal = oil.\n\nWhy skim milk doesn’t cause issues (this confused me for a long time)\n\nSkim milk is still:\n\n• Diluted\n• ~8g protein per cup\n• Mostly casein\n• Not a protein “bolus”\n\nHigh-protein yogurt is often 15–25g of protein in one serving, delivered fast.\n\nSame food family… completely different hormonal effect.\n\nThat resolved the contradiction for me.\n\nWhy full-fat or traditional yogurt can be safer\nFat slows digestion and blunts insulin response.\n\nTraditional yogurts tend to be: \n\n• Lower protein density\n• Less whey concentration\n• Slower digestion\n\nSo even though they’re still dairy, they don’t blow past my personal threshold.\n\nWhy this shows up as oiliness first:\n\nOil is the early warning sign.\n\nInsulin / IGF-1 increases sebum production before acne forms.\n\nIf I stop the trigger food, oiliness drops within 3–5 days.\n\nThat’s been incredibly consistent.\n\nThis doesn’t mean everyone will react this way\nSome people tolerate high-protein dairy just fine.\n\nBut if you’re acne-prone or suddenly oily and eating:\n\n • Greek yogurt daily\n• Cottage cheese\n• Skyr\n• Whey shakes\n…it might be worth testing a short elimination.\n\nNot forever. Just 5–7 days.\n\nSebum responds fast.\n\nMy personal rule now:\n\nI don’t avoid dairy entirely.\nI avoid concentrated dairy protein.\n\nIf it’s marketed as: \n\n• “High protein”\n• “0% fat”\n• “Fitness yogurt”\n\n…I assume my skin will hate it.\n\nPosting this in case it helps someone else\n\nI spent years confused because nutrition advice kept saying: “There’s no link between dairy and acne.”\n\nFor me, that statement was too vague to be useful.\n\nOnce I narrowed it to protein density + absorption speed, everything finally made sense… across countries, brands, and years.\n\nCurious if anyone else has noticed the same pattern.",

I only trimmed it once just to clean up the shape and ends, and I’m planning another trim this January to refine the cut and remove damaged ends.\n\nMy goal is a long curly haircut (mine seems to be 3A), but I’m really unsure about the shape:\n- more elongated / layered and flowy, or\n- more rounded overall\n\nI honestly don’t know what would suit my curls and head shape better. I'd like an androgynous look/haircut!\n\nI also feel like my hair looks dry and very frizzy, especially when there’s wind. Sometimes it just loses definition instantly.\n\nDo you think using a dryer + diffuser more often could help with frizz and definition compared to air-drying?\n\nCurrent routine:\n- I follow a hydration / nutrition / reconstruction rotation\n- Wash 2–3x a week\n- One wash per week with ketoconazole shampoo (scalp reasons)\n- Leave-in + curl cream, usually air-dry\n\nDoes my hair look too dry to you?\n\nAny haircut references, shape advice, or routine tweaks are super welcome! Some androgynous haircut suggestion would be really great ;).\n\nThanks!\n\nOBS: Also worth mentioning: I have some thinning at the crown, which I’m already treating.\n\nIf you have haircut suggestions that could help disguise or balance that area, I’d really appreciate!!",

      "content": "Hi, I want to preface this with the fact that I’ve been going to the same stylist for around 6 years. I always ask for the exact same style…. Heavy highlights, keeping my natural color, only highlights on the top portion and a trim. It never ever changes. The last 2 times she’s messed it up. The last time was in May of this year… she put a toner that apparently contained ash and it my hair looked grey. I prefer warmer tones. Thankfully I told her before I left the salon and she fixed it with a warmer toner. Over the past 7 months I’ve struggled with hair loss and started taking oral minoxidil. It’s finally started to work but I’ve been extra careful with my hair, very little heat, products etc. I noticed that alot of my new hair around my face was grey so this time I asked that she color just the pieces around my face with my natural color and then do the usual highlights. She insisted that lifting my roots would help hide the grey better. I really didn’t want bleach all over my new baby hairs and told her I was concerned with it damaging my hair. Not to mention I really didn’t want my base color changed. Well she just absolutely insisted. Not only did my hair turn out what looks like 5 different colors of orange/gold but I have never ever paid $372 for my hair (plus her tip and the washer’s tip)! I looked at my receipt and I was charged $140 for an all over root color! She didn’t lift my roots all over… only partial! I never have her touch my hair underneath! It didn’t look as bad in the salon because of the way she dried it. After I got home I pulled it up in a pony tail and it’s such a splotchy orange mess! Omfg!!! I’ve added pictures from 3 different rooms in my house as well as pics from outside. I’m terrified if she adds another toner it’s going to damage my hair even worse! Should I just try to put purple conditioner in my roots and around my face or would you have the salon fix this??  Please tell me how you would handle this. Call the salon, email salon with pics, text the stylist privately?? Thoughts?? Thank you!!  ",

I use spf when I’m going to be outside for more than 15 mins. Most cleansers irritate my face so I only use the aveeno oat one once in a while. \n\nI struggle with that specific zit right in the middle of my forehead every time I moisturize. And you can’t really see it in these pictures but I also get a lot of flaky skin between my eyebrows on the bridge of my nose. \n\nI can’t really figure my exact skin type, but open to any and all suggestions for the following:\n \n- get/keep skin healthy\n- slow down aging - retinol?

I have some gray hairs, but not many.\n\nHey guys, happy new year! So I shaved my head over the summer due to a scalp condition. I am growing out something similar to a mohawk but need to keep the sides shaved or buzzed due to my skin condition. Also I like the look. I am going to be coloring my hair with a dark burgundy demi-permanent dye. It's my first time using demi-permanent, is it substantially less damaging than permanent? Also, I am considering growing out the \"mohawk\" area but not sure how to with my hair texture. You usually see this style with straight hair, and I'm not sure how it would look. I have been DIYing my hair since I was 14, I cannot afford salons. I do have a small amount of cosmetology training. I don't want to iron my hair, but I have stretched it with products and liked the results so I am open to that. Any ideas for upcoming colors and styles? Length, etc? I do not want to lighten my hair either, due to the damage it does.\n\nRoutine: CeraVe shampoo, CeraVe conditioner, Honest Leave-In spray, Prose custom curl cream (run through hair with fingers), Prose custom hair gel (run through hair with fingers), air-dry. I do not protect my hair when sleeping, I refresh with water when needed.",

After dread shed ends is your daily hair fall rate supposed to go back to what it was before starting treatment or is it supposed to lower beyond that? For reference I was shedding around 115-130 hairs before treatment, doubled that loss rate in the dread shed phase, and am back down to around 100-115 a day a few weeks after shedding has ended. I know it's slightly less than before treatment and it is impovement but I'm thinking to may be a fluke or I fucked up my counting (which I am very diligent in).",
