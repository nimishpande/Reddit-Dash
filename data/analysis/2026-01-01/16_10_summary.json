      "content": "Hi! I've been wanting short hair for a longgg time &amp; finally got the courage to get my first ever haircut last year. It used to be waist-length when stretched. I got it cut to around shoulder-length (with shrinkage: a little bit past my chin). \n\n**Important context though** On Day 1 of wash day I have less volume and more definition (as seen in pics 1 &amp; 2) but around Day 3-4 I have a LOT of volume (as seen in pics 3 &amp; 5). I also learned it can turn into an afro the first month after my haircut because it was short enough and cut into a round shape (pic 7)\n\nI'm getting another haircut soon and would love to get a pixie this time (reference pics 8-12), but I'd like to get some advice from my fellow redditers. I know all about the pros and cons but I'm just a bit nervous, **with my features will I look more or less feminine? Do I have the features to pull it off? I won't lie, these things are important to me.** Lmk what you think I included pics with and w/o makeup &lt;3\n\nWash-n-go routine:\nWash with Native Coconut shampoo\nConditioner: Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Conditioner, detangle in 6 sections with Crave Naturals brush\nRinse thoroughly\nAdd Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Leave-in Cream to each section, prayer hand method\nBrush style with Crave Naturals brush for volume\nRake in Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic Gel to each section, finger coiling any curls that need some extra love\nAir dry, then scrunch out the crunch with Carol's Daughter 7 Oil Blend Hair &amp; Scalp Oil\nI use a bonnet every night, no refresh\n",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nSo normally I don’t post much, but wanted to drop this as a warning for anyone buying products purely on hype and regretting later.\n\nBack in September I got into fitness, and by December started protein supplements. My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily.\n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

She recommended IPCA Acne UV gel and afaik it's one of the best for my skin types, but as a broke ahh college student I just can't afford that. \n\n\nThen I started searching skincare related subreddits for other options and learnt that there are barely any good and reliable ones under ₹500.\nAll of the sunscreen options fall in one of these categories:\n1. They're affordable but from a cosmetic brand with shady practices or no proper certification.\n2. They make you look like a ghost by leaving a white cast or feel sticky and greasy and aren't photostable.\n3. They're reliable and it works but costs and an arm and a leg for a measly 30 g pack.\n\n\nLike what am I supposed to buy??\n\nThe same goes for body sunscreen too, I saw great reviews about Nivea SPF 50 sunscreen's protection, but it apparently feels very sticky and greasy.\n\nP.S. what's up with r/indianskincareaddicts?

I'd like my skin to be smoother and less 'pink', if that makes sense??\n\nAnyway, I put together this routine based on some basic research:\n\n**Morning**\n\n1. **CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** (water cleanser: ceramides + hyaluronic acid)\n2. **Neutrogena Hydro Boost** (hyaluronic acid)\n3. **Beauty of Joseon Sunscreen** (rice + probiotic, SPF50+, PA++++)\n\n**Night**\n\n1. **The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm** (oil cleanser)\n2. **CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** (water cleanser: ceramides + hyaluronic acid)\n3. **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5**\\+ (barrier repair: panthenol)\n4. **La Roche-Posay Retinol B3 Serum** (retinol + niacin) - **ramping from once per week**\n\nI've already bought these products and used the AM set once this morning for the pics above. Three things I'd like advice on are:\n\n* Sources are conflicted on whether retinol should be before or after the cleanser/barrier repair. I put it after, knowing that I still need to be gentle to protect against sensitivity in the first week or so, but after that, should I swap things round?\n* AFAIK none of this will help with the dark circles. What can you recommend for that? Collagen or microneedling etc?\n* There's a singular pink bump on my left cheek, as seen in pics. Will this go away sooner or later with this routine?\n\nThank you for your help and happy new year!!",

      "content": "Good morning everyone and Happy New Year! 🎆 I have a few questions I’m hoping to get advice on. I had gastric bypass, lost almost 170 pounds, went from 377 to 210. Looking great, feeling great! However, I noticed that I’m starting to have dry flaky spots on my face, and I’m getting bags under my eyes. I’m 41, so the bags don’t necessarily bother me, it’s part of the aging process, but the dry spots are bad.\n\nMy dermatologist suggested rosehip oil, he says it helps tighten the skin, provides more moisture and may even help with the bags. It has the good vitamins like A C and E that is essential for the skin. I just started using it like 3 days ago, he suggested once in the morning, and once before bed. I’m noticing a difference yet, he says it may take a few days/weeks to notice a change as everyone’s skin is different.\n\nI have been seriously self conscious going out in public because of the dry patches on my face. It looks horrible. My husband says I’m still beautiful and it doesn’t bother him, but I feel like he HAS to say that because he’s my husband. Like he can’t say “babe your face is gross” you know what I mean?\n\nI guess questions would be, is rosehip oil really good? Has anyone used it and it helped their skin? Will it help with the dry flaky skin on my face? Are there any other recommendations you guys may have that I can try?",

I met a guy recently with whom I kissed and he had a very short beard, so it was extremely harsh on my skin. After kissing him I had a lot of redness the following day around my nose and lips, where his beard touched but next day it was gone. Then after 5 days I discovered a lot of red small pimples on my nose, it was really bad… and then it started to spread in my chin, around lips and next to my nose. It’s very itching, especially the nose. It doesn’t look that bad on picture but in reality the dots are red and there’s many of them next to my nose area. I never had this problem before but it was the first time when I kissed with a guy with harsh beard while also using retinol. I don’t know if it has anything to do though.\n\nDid anyone experience anything like this? I went to dermatologist and she prescribed me a topical Anity inflammatory cream but it doesn’t help at all.. I don’t know what to do, it looks really terrible. I don’t think she diagnosed me correctly she just looked at my face for 5 minutes.\n\nMaybe someone had something similar and got the treatment right.\n\nRight now I stopped using retinol and acids but still a month has passed and it’s just getting worse with more pimples I new areas, it travelled onto my cheek:(",

I am growing out something similar to a mohawk but need to keep the sides shaved or buzzed due to my skin condition. Also I like the look. I am going to be coloring my hair with a dark burgundy demi-permanent dye. It's my first time using demi-permanent, is it substantially less damaging than permanent? Also, I am considering growing out the \"mohawk\" area but not sure how to with my hair texture. You usually see this style with straight hair, and I'm not sure how it would look. I have been DIYing my hair since I was 14, I cannot afford salons. I do have a small amount of cosmetology training. I don't want to iron my hair, but I have stretched it with products and liked the results so I am open to that. Any ideas for upcoming colors and styles? Length, etc? I do not want to lighten my hair either, due to the damage it does.\n\nRoutine: CeraVe shampoo, CeraVe conditioner, Honest Leave-In spray, Prose custom curl cream (run through hair with fingers), Prose custom hair gel (run through hair with fingers), air-dry. I do not protect my hair when sleeping, I refresh with water when needed.",

      "content": "as the years coming to an end, i am curious to hear everyones favorite skincare finds of 2025\n\nfrom my finds, the one with the most value for money is melano cc. it lasts a long time without oxidizing and most importantly it actually works. it visibly brightens the skin and works especially well on fading newer acne marks. totally worth every penny.\n\nanother product is loreal paris ha sheet mask. as a guy who rarely gets compliments, some female friends and two of my ex gfs actually complimented my skin after seeing the glow it gave. it gives a near glass skin look for 2 to 3 days but their ha serum is pretty mid and it doesnt really do better than any other ha serum but the mask is the best one i have ever used\n\nand the third product is pha toner from minimalist. as a person with acne prone oily skin, everything new usually breaks me out just because its new. i normally need to wait a couple of weeks to be sure if a product is actually causing breakouts or if its just new to my skin but after starting the pha toner, new products didnt start breaking me out. it subtly protects my skin from other products causing breakouts and is pretty hydrating and mildly exfoliating for daily use.\n\nso what new products did you find this year that are actually worth it? anything that gave visible results, worked consistently or just felt really good on your skin? tell me your 2025 holy grails",

Wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner (They’re not curly hair tho but all types)\n2. Then I brush until they’re untangled then put the care then the mask (I don’t put it everytime tho like once or twice a week) and end with the gel\n3. And today, add the diffuser during 5-10 minutes \n\nWhich lead to current pictures, my hair is better than ever but there’s something disturbing and I don’t even know what, I just look at my hair and feels like “yeah, what I’m doing is shit” and I don’t even have anyone else to ask because my dad’s hair is short, grandma’s straight, the few friends I have have straight hair, and my mom whom I inherited my hair passed away so no one to tell me if I’m doing something wrong 🤧 So I’m asking here",

Sometimes I finger curl flat strands with some water and gel.\n\nI have low porosity, medium density and stand with, and I guess my curl type is somewhere between 2B and 3A (depending on the weather and stuff).\n\nNow I can’t seem to get it right. If I use the richer conditioner or curl cream I get nice, shiny definition, but my curls don’t spring but get droopy and heavy and are flat the next day. At least there is no frizz and they are orderly.\nIf I use lighter products I get more curls and volume, but also a lot of frizz. And I will need to comb or make it wet the next day, because I look like a birds nest.\n\nIs this a usual trade off? Any ideas to find the sweet spot? \nCould it be the gel? Or is it a skill issue? Or do I just need to live with it?\n\nThanks for taking the time to read!",

      "content": "I have struggled with hormonal acne my whole life and have always been self conscious of it. I previously posted (about 3-4 months ago) how after much trial and error, I finally found a combination of products from La Roche Posay, The Ordinary, and Murad that was really making a difference in keeping the acne at bay. But those products never helped with some acne that was deeper in the skin. I talked to my doctor who prescribed me Tretinoin 0.025% to help with cystic acne and scarring, and after a month I am completely blown away by how much brighter and smoother my skin has become, and I have not had any cystic acne creep up. I’m sharing some before and after photos of one month using the tret, same lighting and same location. I wish I had progress photos from my regular routine beforehand, but I am so thankful I finally found what works for me. I’m happy to share my routine again for those who want it. I have added a couple additional products from The Ordinary that I rotate in and out since my first post. For those of you still struggling, I really hope you all find what works for you in 2026!!!",

I know it may seem very shallow but I honestly can't put into words the impact of having clear skin after so many years. I've kept my skincare routine very simple post completion and tolerate adapalene well so use it every night. I've introduced niacinamide and azelaic acid but I'm conscious of other products and my skin barrier. I've started a course of microneedling and have had a panic this month when I had my first breakout on my forehead although I resisted the urge to pick and they have dried and cleared quickly. I've noticed that the sebaceous filaments are returning on my nose (what a bonus it had been to get rid of these) and I'm wondering if I should add some additional active to try and help. Even if it's just used on my nose. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions to navigating skin post Isotretinoin, I love skincare but it's overwhelming and I am anxious of an acne relapse!",

Most data suggests sperm parameters usually recover, plenty of guys have kids on fin/dut, etc. I get that.\n\nThat said, a few things made me pause:\n\nDutasteride isn’t something most of us take short-term, I'll be taking it for the foreseeable future. Realistically it’s a 10–20+ year drug. And there isn't a 10-20 year safety profile yet for this for fertility issues. \n\nThe half-life is insanely long, so stopping isn’t like stopping fin and being “clear” in a few weeks.\nThere was that recent paper suggesting persistent fertility issues in a subset of men, yeah, it’s disputed and not definitive, but what stuck out to me was that some parameters didn’t fully bounce back even compared to controls who never took dut.\n\nFertility data beyond short- to mid-term use just isn’t that deep yet.\n\nFor me it wasn’t “panic”, it was more:\nif there’s even a small unknown and an easy workaround, why not?\n\nSperm banking is:\nRoutine (chemo, TRT, surgeries, etc.) \nOne-time effort\nFrozen sperm lasts 20-30 years or if stored well indefinite. The company I'll be doing this with have a great track record. \nQuality depends on how good it is now, not how long it’s stored\n\n\nWorst case? I never use it and wasted a bit of money. I'm doing this in a country where this is very cheap to freeze and preserve/store. \n\nBest case? I never have to stress about fertility later while being on one of the strongest DHT blocker we’ve got (ofc 2.5mg dut exists) .\n\nI still think dut is probably safe for most guys. I’m still going to be taking it. This just felt like cheap insurance before committing long-term.\n\nCurious if anyone else here has done this or thought about it. Is it overkill or reasonable? ",
