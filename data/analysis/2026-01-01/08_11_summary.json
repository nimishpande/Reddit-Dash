I’m trying to achieve even 10% of what she has.\n\nI am currently on day 3 after washing. My current routine for this week was: I shampoo with moisturizing curl talk shampoo, then I do Mielle rosemary mint strengthening hair mask. Then I do 3-in-1 Curl Talk conditioner and don’t fully wash it out and squish in a bit to my ends before exiting the shower.\n\nThen I praying hands Pattern styling custard and drag it through a bit on top.  I then use them bounce curl clips while diffusing on warm setting for heat and low intensity with minimal movement to set the curls. I fluff out the roots after dry with the bounce curl volume comb. I scrunch in Ouai hair oil once dry.\n\nToday I sectioned my hair out while using tresemme keratin smooth weightless anti-frizz finishing spray at the roots and using the bounce curl volume comb diffusing where I sprayed after using the comb on low cold setting to set the spray.\n\nI’m pretty happy with the results, but looking for more tips if anyone has any? \n\nI may just need a hair cut. I just can’t seem the back to achieve the same volume at the back that I get around my face. At the side part it seems flat as well.  Amy other hair spray, how to cut the hair (I just cut my own hair how I feel like, so I’m not scared to try), or technique tips?\n\nI also want to understand how they do her lazy messy updo (see photo)??? I’m totally lost on how that is achieved.\n\n\n",

I got it cut to around shoulder-length (with shrinkage: a little bit past my chin). \n\n**Important context though** On Day 1 of wash day I have less volume and more definition (as seen in pics 1 &amp; 2) but around Day 3-4 I have a LOT of volume (as seen in pics 3 &amp; 5). I also learned it can turn into an afro the first month after my haircut because it was short enough and cut into a round shape (pic 7)\n\nI'm getting another haircut soon and would love to get a pixie this time (reference pics 8-12), but I'd like to get some advice from my fellow redditers. I know all about the pros and cons but I'm just a bit nervous, **with my features will I look more or less feminine? Do I have the features to pull it off? I won't lie, these things are important to me.** Lmk what you think I included pics with and w/o makeup &lt;3\n\nWash-n-go routine:\nWash with Native Coconut shampoo\nConditioner: Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Conditioner, detangle in 6 sections with Crave Naturals brush\nRinse thoroughly\nAdd Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Leave-in Cream to each section, prayer hand method\nBrush style with Crave Naturals brush for volume\nRake in Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic Gel to each section, finger coiling any curls that need some extra love\nAir dry, then scrunch out the crunch with Carol's Daughter 7 Oil Blend Hair &amp; Scalp Oil\nI use a bonnet every night, no refresh\n",

My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily.\n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

I’ve been using 1 mg finasteride for 3 months, and I just started using the (cheap) Kirkland 5% minoxidil solution once a day.\n\nI started on the recommendation of a trichologist, and she did a baseline evaluation with a trichoscope.\n\nAll the vellus hairs you can see in the images are brand new—similar length, very tiny, but pigmented.\n\nThe images cover a 4 mm × 7.5 mm area (about 0.3 cm²). The white patches are residue from the cheap minoxidil/vehicle.\n\nI know these vellus hairs most likely won’t become terminal, but I’m impressed by how quickly minoxidil can push hairs into a growth phase and make them sprout so fast, seemingly all at the same time. It gives me hope it will positively impact my terminal hairs too (I’m currently around \\~30 follicular units per cm² on an NW7 pattern, with a lot of thin single-hair follicular units), so I can eventually go for a transplant.\n\nI’ll keep updating this.\n\nCheers.\n\n",

If i somehow manage to get a decent wash day going, the next day it falls completely flat and feels so lifeless. \n\nI don’t really care anymore about wether or not its curly. I just want my hair to look shiny, healthy, and well done. \n\nHere is my current wash routine!\n\n  \n1. double shampoo with h&amp;s clean shampoo\n\n2. camille rose guava slip leave in conditioner \n\n3. section hair into 3 large horizontal sections:\n\nadd gel to each large section, then brush style small vertical sections with bounce curl brush\n\n4. remove excess water with cotton t shirt &amp; air dry\n\nNotes: \n\nmy hair reacts horribly to coconut oil! It gets squishy and extremely stringy so i try to avoid it. \n\ni work in fast food, so the majority of my week my hair is in a tight slicked back bun underneath a hat.",

Some people have naturally thin hair.\n\nIt's vital to take identical photos every few months. Remember that [consistent lighting is extremely important](/r/tressless/comments/fxb0xn).\n\nAge and family history are worth mentioning.\n\n## Just starting out?\n\n1. Read the [beginner's guide](https://tressless.com/learn/beginners-guide)\n2. Read the [\"learn\" section](https://tressless.com/learn) section with different treatments\n3. [use search](https://tressless.com/search) *before* asking any questions.\n4. [Chat with the TresslessGPT bot](https://tressless.com/chat) to ask any questions about treatment or their hairline, it's free for everyone now.\n\n## Ready to start treating?\n\n1. Talk to a doctor\n2. [Find products in your area](https://tressless.com/products)\n3. then [start a journal on community.tressless.com](https://tressless.com/start-journal), and update every couple of months.\n\nYou might not get an answer if your question is too basic or common, because treatment is the same for almost everyone. Nobody can predict if a treatment will work for you.\n\nThis is a community, and you can help out fellow members by commenting under their photos and upvoting people that leave you comments.

Now I’m actually having troubles with how much density I have. No matter what I do with minoxidil it seems to just keep on giving me dandruff even with nizoral and I have had a bunch of hair loss. So I decided to stop using it at all and so far my scalp feels better, no itching, less flakes, and less hair loss until about a week and a half into quitting where it’s been ramping up. \n\n\nIs this the right thing to do for my hair loss?

Ends up looking super weird? I've tried \n\nCurrent Routine:\n1. Curl shampoo + conditioner (Brand: By Veira curl shampoo / conditioner)\n2. Leave in conditioner combed into wet hair (Garnier Curl Cocoa Butter leave in conditioner)\n3. Curl gel combed into wet hair (Schwartzkopf Otis+ Professional Curl Jam)\n4. Scrunch\n\n--- used to just air dry, but after watching a couple of tutorials w/ diffuser:\n\n5. Diffuse around hair to dry slightly\n6. Part into 2/4 sections (ended up looking similar, but definitely will be doing 4 in the future)\n7. Diffuse each section for at least 15-20 minutes\n\nIt ends up looking worse than if I air dried, uneven curls and some just like straight sections with a couple of curls at the end? It's also still frizzy? I also am aware I need to trim my ends and just get a haircut in general :p\n\n\nI'm really bummed as I thought diffusing would help define my curls as they're getting weighed down :(",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",
