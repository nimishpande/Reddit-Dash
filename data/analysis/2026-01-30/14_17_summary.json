      "content": "I’ve been trying a few underarm roll-ons lately, including be bodywise and chemist at play, and noticed some subtle differences so y’all can know.  \nbe bodywise is better if pigmentation is your main concern. the 6% aha bha roll-on works gradually, but with consistent use it does help with underarm darkness. it’s not an instant fix, but def worked well, reduced hyper pigmentation.  \nchemist at play, on the other hand, is good for odour control. they have a wider variety of fragrances, the formula is lightweight and non-sticky, which i liked. however, it can feel a bit stingy and causes irritation, especially on sensitive skin or right after shaving, so a patch test is a good idea  \nIn the end be bodywise suited me better, so that’s my experience.   \n",

During that time I was also using minoxidil. My shedding was pretty manageable and honestly the meds worked really well. I noticed my hair getting darker, thicker, and longer pretty quickly.\n\nAfter those first six months, I stopped minoxidil because I didn’t like how greasy it made my hair. I decided to stick with just the pill and switched to taking it every other day. That routine has been much easier for me to stay consistent with.\n\nIn December 2025, I chopped all my hair off and basically restarted from scratch because I wanted to grow it out evenly instead of keeping the mullet style I had before. Since then, it’s been growing really nicely and I’m happy with the progress.\n\nRight now I take 0.5 mg every other day and honestly I plan to stay on it long term. I’m happy with my hairline and don’t feel like I’ll ever need a transplant. Dutasteride is definitely one of those things I always budget for. It’s a permanent staple for me.\n\nOverall it’s been a great experience. If anyone has questions about my routine or results, feel free to ask me anything\n\nPhotos 1 to 3 → Aug–Sep 2024\n\n• Photos 4 to 5 → November 2024\n\n• Photo 6 → February 2025\n\n• Photo 7 → July 2025\n\n• Photo 8 → December 2025\n\n• Photo 9 → January 2026",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi! I am very new to my natural hair, but have high hopes😊 I have been endlessly researching what routine to use for my hair, but there’s so much information online it’s a little overwhelming, and I would love tips if from seeing my hair and hearing my routine, you see even a couple initial glaring issues.\n\nI have course, middle-eastern, 2C hair, but it’s thinned a lot. My scalp gets oily fast though my hair itself is always super dry. My hair takes a minute to get fully wet, and a good amount of time to dry fully (maybe medium porosity?)\n\nI just cut like 11” off my hair as a refresh. In the pictures I show for context what my curls looks like now, what they looked like long, and what they looked like long with no product at all.\n\nMy current routine is using the Odele ultra sensitive shampoo and conditioner, squeezing out excess water with my hands, adding a generous amount of Trader Joe’s leave-in conditioner, a smaller amount of their hair oil, a good amount of “Miss Jessie’s Multi Cultural Curls” cream, another quarter size amount of her “Jelly Soft Curls” gel, spray my whole head with Pantene non-aerosol hairspray (level 4), cover my hair in Tresemme heat protectant spray, and then scrunch my hair upside down like crazy. The only combing I do is when I run my fingers through my hair to evenly distribute the products.\n\nI let it air dry and continue to scrunch, then when it’s almost dry I will diffuse for a second, then take off the diffuser attachment and scrunch my hair as I lightly dry it. I’ll scrunch in a little more oil to help frizz. I go to bed with a satin bonnet. Second day curls require me to re-wet and diffuse again for a second.\n\nI’ve never used a curling brush and I’ve never used a deep conditioner - from reading it sounds like something to maybe look into. I would so appreciate any advice, product suggestions, or tough love😅 you might have from seeing my hair and hearing my routine. Even haircut tweaks would be appreciated! Thank you so much in advance!",

      "content": "This took a lot for me to post, and is super embarrassing.\n\nI’ve never had any kind of skin care routine ever. The most I’ve ever done is wash my face in the shower with the orange neutrogena oil free acne face wash. I’ve never established a daily and nightly routine but I’d like to but I have no idea where to start.\n\nI have PCOS and have struggled with hirustism for as long as I can remember. 13 years old maybe? I’m 23 now and I don’t think my skin has ever been so bad before. I’ve considered laser and other treatments, but unfortunately it’s too much out of my budget at the moment and I want to give a good skin care routine a try first to hopefully work a miracle over time. I’ve been plucking my neck but everytime I pluck it, my neck gets so irritated and bumpy :(\n\nI don’t really wear any makeup because I’ve never dived deep into learning how to do it. I grew up with hardly any females in my family and without a mom. I’ve always felt way too insecure to talk to the friends I do have about this, and when I have asked I really only get advice to use alcohol on my face, and from what I’ve read, that’s not really good for it?\n\nI’ve been drinking two cups of spearmint tea everyday for a little over two weeks now, and I’m looking for recommendations on your alls favorite skin care and what has helped you. I know everyone’s skin is different, and I’m not really sure what mine is to be honest. My forehead is bumpy and dry feeling, but most of my acne is around my jawline, cheeks, chin, lips. I think I’m in between oily and dry, but the most dryness is on my forehead.\n\nI’ve been on TikTok watching the skincare girlies and a lot of them seem to have multiple steps in their routine. Like cleanser, moisturizer, serum, etc and it’s really confused me because I’m not really sure what I need or what any of it does. can anyone please explain to me kinda everything? I figured this would be the best place to ask!! I’m struggling SO bad with this 😩\n\nThank you everyone ❤️",

I know cuticles dont work like blinds that just open and close. In my experience, washing 24 hours after color shouldn’t affect the longevity because the color doesn’t continue processing &amp; the conditioner seals with an acidic pH. I’m confusedddd",

My face is okay and experience pimples time to time. \n\nThis may be related to my poor diet, poor lifestyle (depression) and an underlying health issue. I went for a blood test and the dr said I have an iron deficiency + high testosterone. I am also East Asian and seem to scar very easily. \n\nRight now I am using dove beauty bar with an African body sponge and naturium body lotion (which I love but it is too expensive so plz recommend body lotions like this). \n\nI’ve tried glycolic acid in the past which just burns my skin. I also do not like aveeno body lotion or cerave moisturising cream as they also burn my skin. \n\nPlease recommend any tips, products (I’m in the uk), and advice. I would appreciate this a lot!

Apart from my gym and dietary additions, I’ve finalised on the attached skincare routine. I want help on a few points which I’ve mentioned. Please take a look.",

      "content": "Hi everyone- I'm a 19 year old male who is just starting to get into actually looking after my appearance and hair. I've always had cripplingly low self esteem, which has led to me feeling demotivated when it comes to caring for my hair, and so I often used to leave it for months without styling it or even using shampoo.\n\nI've gone off to uni now and my confidence has really increased a lot, so I'm looking to see if there is anything I can do to improve my hair. From what I know about it- it's quite thick, and very dense. It doesn't seem to get oily at all and naturally has a lot of volume (but seems to go very limp and flat if I try to use conditioner). I've always assumed it was straight but I've been told that it might be slightly wavy and so I've been trying to grow it out to see if I can get more of the wave texture to show up. I've also started styling it with curly/wavy products (with limited success... the results seem to change every time and I don't really have any idea what I'm doing...).\n\nPeople have told me that I'm \"lucky\" that my hair is so thick, but honestly its always felt a bit unmanageable, and at the moment it seems that as I grow it out, its growing upwards and outwards and becoming a bit poofy, which I don't know how to solve... I just wanted it to have more texture but it seems like the side effect is it becoming very bulky and heavy.\n\nI've attached a few pictures of my hair over the past few days (the first is of my \"bedhead\" haha, and the last is my hair completely unstyled) and then a photo of my \"dream\" hair (Finn Wolfhard from the newest season of stranger things). Does anyone have any tips for removing bulk whilst emphasising the wave texture? And does it look like my dream hairstyle is achievable or is my hair too straight/thick?",
