      "content": "So, I’m 25 years old now, but started to take meds for my baldness when I was 21.\n\nI don’t know why I started balding? No one in my family is bald so is not genetics, and I’m not a stressed person to the point of losing my hair. \n\nAnyway, I started with **only** topic minoxidil 5% by kirkland, just with a few drops on my scalp every night before sleep. \n\nThe first photo is from October 2021 and the other one is from January 2022. In three months I had an insane regrowth progress. \n\nAnd so I keep up with the treatment for the next year or so, but then I stopped in December 2023… worst mistake ever, so that was my hair in March 2024 on the day that I’ve started taking **only** oral minoxidil 2,5mg and oral finasteride 1mg. One capsule from each every night before sleep. \n\nThen, after an insane shredding phase that I did not take pics(because of how bad i’ve looked), in July 2024 my hair looked like the one in the picture, not as good as it was in the first treatment, but better than no hair right?\n\nAnd the last picture is my hair now (January 2026). I’ve never stopped the treatment with the oral finasteride and minoxidil, and I continue to use it daily(sometimes I forgot to take it, but it’s not that bad to forget just a few days - i hope so). \n\nMy hair is still not perfect and I have plans of doing an hair transplant in the future, but at least is not ugly and sad like it was back in the days that i’ve stopped the treatment lol.\n\nSo yeah, that was my journey. I’ve never had any collateral effects with the medicines, the only bad thing that happened is that I can’t donate blood because of the medicine :( \n\nBut both of them (topical minoxidil or oral finasteride and minox) can help with the hair loss a lot, but if you stop the treatment like I did, you might be cooked like I was.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Too much energy. \n\nJust a paddle brush to tame it, put it in a ponytail or claw clip if I'm too wiped out to brush it. \n\nI use a squishmallow for a pillow that I wash once a week and I don't protect my hair except for twist braiding it once every blue moon when I have the energy. \n\nI don't know how to French/Dutch braid and I've never been able to learn because it makes me so tired to have my hands above my head for long. \n\nI know this routine will likely be physically painful to some of you out there but if there's anything I can do that's low low maintenance to help my poor hair I'd appreciate it.

      "content": "Hello!\n\nFor most of my life I've kept things pretty safe with skincare, just normie cleansers and moisturisers and I don't think I can get away with it much longer..\n\nMy main concern is my back acne so l recently ordered the panoxyl benzoyl peroxide (4%) because I heard good things and hoped for the best. I think the same people also said that it works best paired with a spray after showering, mainly hearing things about salicylic or glycolic acid. Then again l've also heard people talking about how benzoyl peroxide can be dangerous when combined with things so my minds a bit scattered.\n\nMy main questions are:\n\n* ﻿﻿would combining it be dangerous?\n* ﻿﻿are the acids left on or washed off? Is moisturiser placed straight on top of the spray?? I'm baffled\n* ﻿﻿just general advice on steps or how long I should leave it on, no suggestion is silly, I truly could not know less about this\n\nThank you :))",

      "content": "**The Issue(s):** \n\nLately I feel as though my skin looks very haggard and that the nasolabial folds and malar edema are particularly pronounced. I’m only 28 so I’d like to do everything in my power to counteract that now. \n\nPlease recommend additional treatments, products, etc. I should investigate. Willing to investigate expensive procedures as well, just want to know what to look for. \n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Do you think the lines and folds are due to aging or mainly lifestyle?\n\n2. Would you say this aging is accelerated for 28 or expected? Feels accelerated to me. \n\n2. What treatments, products, and services would you recommend? Not working with a tremendous budget but want to know what I should be saving up/aspiring toward. I also have a TON of skincare products and tools at my disposal, but not sure which are the most effective to incorporate \n\n4. How much of an improvement could you foresee if I changed habits such as: \n\na) using my laptop and phone while lying on my back vs prone/hunched all day as I usually do\n\nb) Rs-applying sunscreen multiple times midday (I wfh and don’t go out btw)\n\nc) Sleeping on my back vs face \n\nd) Discontinuing use of microfiber cloth/silicone scrubber if it’s too abrasive \n\ne) Quitting alcohol &amp; getting serious about hitting protein &amp; micronutrient goals\n\n**Skin Type:** \n\nNormal but with Eczema flares it flakes and gets extremely dry. Been having lots of flares lately and days where all my skin is peeling.\n\nNote: Been in a mental health funk so haven’t been 100% about this routine every day but I usually do most of it:\n\n**Current Morning Routine:**\n\n1. Cleanser (I often skip this in the morning tbh and just wipe my face with a hot, damp microfiber cloth)\n\n3. ***Dose of Glow Vitamin C Serum*** by Prosera\n\n4. Moisturizer (I also switch between tons but lately ***Essenherb morning barrier cream***)\n\n5. Tatcha ***Vitamin*** ***C eye cream***\n\n6. Hamel ***SPF***\n\n**Current Nighttime Routine:**\n\n1. Cleanser (I switch between so many but lately I’ve been manly using Allies of Skin Vita-C Cleanser)\n\n2. Mechanically apply cleanser with Sxnse Facial Scrubber Pro &amp; wipe off residue with microfiber cloth (Question - is this too much exfoliation?)\n\n2. ***0.1% Tretnoin***\n\n3. Clarins ***Eye Serum*** \n\n4. Essenherb ***nighttime barrier cream***\n\n5. Occasionally ***Vaseline*** \n\n**How Long w/Current Routine:**\n\nLet’s say a month. Before that it was the same core routine just different products:\n\nMorning \n\nCleanser &gt; Vitamin C Serum &amp; Eye Cream &gt; Moisturizer &gt; SPF \n\nEvening \n\nCleanser &gt; Retinol + Anti-Aging Eye Cream &gt; Barrier Cream of some kind \n\n**Anything New:**\n\nMy life is chaotic, it’s hard to say what isn’t new. I do but I have been drinking too much lately and will be stopping that and drinking way more water. I also barely sleep but that’s been the case for years. \n\nI’ve been going out even less than normal so should mean less sun exposure, but I don’t do my skincare routine at normal times of day because I’m normally anchored to do so at fixed times by events \n\n**Location:**\n\nUSA\n\nAny and all help is greatly appreciated!",

      "content": "Your skin doesn’t understand the concept of “indoors.”  \nIt only responds to radiation exposure.\n\nFrom a biological standpoint na, the skin’s pigment cells and collagen fibres react to UVA radiation, not to whether you’re sitting at a beach or like under office AC. Unlike UVB (which causes visible sunburn), UVA rays remain constant throughout the day and penetrate glass effortlessly. This means your skin can be triggering melanin production and collagen degradation even when the temperature is cool and the light feels harmless. What makes this exposure deceptive is its low intensity but high frequency. A few minutes near a window, daily commuting, or repeated indirect sunlight doesn’t cause immediate damage but research shows it leads to photoaging, pigmentation irregularities, and barrier weakening over time. Ik Ik big concepts but then yeah they exist. This is why sunscreen isn’t positioned as an outdoor only product in dermatology. It functions as a biological filter, reducing the amount of radiation that reaches deeper skin layers regardless of whether that radiation comes from a beach or behind a glass panel.\n\nIn other words, office AC doesn’t neutralize UV exposure. It just makes it easier to ignore. I’ve made plenty of skincare mistakes over the years, learnt a lot through trial, error, and listening to people who know better and I’m still learning. Sharing this so it helps you make a more informed choice, not because there’s only one “right\" way. ",

After she uses Curl Talk curl cream and diffuse dries. She sleeps in a bonnet and never uses a brush. Her curls look pretty good, but could look better. She has some frizz and her hair is a little dry. I feel like there is a better curl cream out there for her hair and a weekly mask would help. We already have a hair steamer as I also have low porosity hair. I would love any advice! I have super straight hair so we are both learning as we go. Also want to add that she has alopecia but the hair is growing back, not sure if that matters.",

      "content": "Hi Reddit, I've been struggling so much with my hair (fine, high density, low porosity)! It oscillates between beautiful bouncy waves and being straight and kinda bleh (see photos). I have been wanting to embrace my curls, but whenever I try, it seems like my hair is weighed down with product and gets greasy. I'm not entirely sure how I achieved the waves in the photo, but here is what I have tried. I'v studied this reddit extensively, and am in need to some advice!\n\nHere are my issues (that I think are) impeding my waves. Any and all advice would be helpful\n\n**1. I can never get my hair wet enough to achieve the 'seaweed' texture that people talk about. I feel like my hair does not absorb water in a normal way, but it still takes (literally!) 12+ hours to airdry and at least an hour with a diffuser on medium heat**\n\n**2. I can not get my hair to form a cast! My hair is always super soft and no matter how much or how little product I try, a cast does not show up!**\n\nAny tips or tricks are appreciated. I don't mind spending $ on product but really would love to get back to my 1x a week wash schedule with bouncy waves!\n\nCurrent Routine:\n\n1. Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Conditioner and MorrocanOil Curl Shampoo, with \\~biweekly Malibu Undo Goo clarifying and Ouai Curl Creme and Neuma NEU Styling Mousse - this was working when I had longer hair (1x a week wash) and if I finger curled and then slept in it, but now that it's a bit shorter, it just weighs it down.\n2. I have tried to switch to a mousse only approach",
