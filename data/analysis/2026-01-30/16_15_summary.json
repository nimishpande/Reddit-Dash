During that time I was also using minoxidil. My shedding was pretty manageable and honestly the meds worked really well. I noticed my hair getting darker, thicker, and longer pretty quickly.\n\nAfter those first six months, I stopped minoxidil because I didn’t like how greasy it made my hair. I decided to stick with just the pill and switched to taking it every other day. That routine has been much easier for me to stay consistent with.\n\nIn December 2025, I chopped all my hair off and basically restarted from scratch because I wanted to grow it out evenly instead of keeping the mullet style I had before. Since then, it’s been growing really nicely and I’m happy with the progress.\n\nRight now I take 0.5 mg every other day and honestly I plan to stay on it long term. I’m happy with my hairline and don’t feel like I’ll ever need a transplant. Dutasteride is definitely one of those things I always budget for. It’s a permanent staple for me.\n\nOverall it’s been a great experience. If anyone has questions about my routine or results, feel free to ask me anything\n\nPhotos 1 to 3 → Aug–Sep 2024\n\n• Photos 4 to 5 → November 2024\n\n• Photo 6 → February 2025\n\n• Photo 7 → July 2025\n\n• Photo 8 → December 2025\n\n• Photo 9 → January 2026",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I use this everyday, for nights I use the same sans the azelaic acid and sunscreen.\n\nOne and off every other/every week (depending if I forgot it or not) I use The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution.\n\nI have really oily skin so I try to not use anything heavy, but sometimes I'll have a couple of small eczema patches in these same spots and only in these instances I use my heavy eczema cream from Bepanthen on my face.\n\nI'd also love to hear recommendations if you have any for the (probably) blackheads which you can see are spanning from my nose to cheeks.\n\nI'm also wondering if this is a skin barrier damage or could be some allergic reaction to the detergent I wash my pillowcases with? Since I wash them every other day, but I prefer sleeping on my left side and the left side of my face looks admittedly worse. The rest of my face is nearly spotless, so I'm really at loss what I'm doing wrong. (Before I made an attempt at skincare my forehead was also full of pimples and spots, but cleaned up pretty quickly afterwards.)\n\nI'm pretty desperate, I appreciate every bit of advice.

      "content": "Hi! I am very new to my natural hair, but have high hopes😊 I have been endlessly researching what routine to use for my hair, but there’s so much information online it’s a little overwhelming, and I would love tips if from seeing my hair and hearing my routine, you see even a couple initial glaring issues.\n\nI have course, middle-eastern, 2C hair, but it’s thinned a lot. My scalp gets oily fast though my hair itself is always super dry. My hair takes a minute to get fully wet, and a good amount of time to dry fully (maybe medium porosity?)\n\nI just cut like 11” off my hair as a refresh. In the pictures I show for context what my curls looks like now, what they looked like long, and what they looked like long with no product at all.\n\nMy current routine is using the Odele ultra sensitive shampoo and conditioner, squeezing out excess water with my hands, adding a generous amount of Trader Joe’s leave-in conditioner, a smaller amount of their hair oil, a good amount of “Miss Jessie’s Multi Cultural Curls” cream, another quarter size amount of her “Jelly Soft Curls” gel, spray my whole head with Pantene non-aerosol hairspray (level 4), cover my hair in Tresemme heat protectant spray, and then scrunch my hair upside down like crazy. The only combing I do is when I run my fingers through my hair to evenly distribute the products.\n\nI let it air dry and continue to scrunch, then when it’s almost dry I will diffuse for a second, then take off the diffuser attachment and scrunch my hair as I lightly dry it. I’ll scrunch in a little more oil to help frizz. I go to bed with a satin bonnet. Second day curls require me to re-wet and diffuse again for a second.\n\nI’ve never used a curling brush and I’ve never used a deep conditioner - from reading it sounds like something to maybe look into. I would so appreciate any advice, product suggestions, or tough love😅 you might have from seeing my hair and hearing my routine. Even haircut tweaks would be appreciated!

I wanted a cool ash brown. I don’t like the chunky look, and although we discussed it, I don’t feel like we were on the same page. My stylist is super sweet and I like her a lot, but I feel like she forgot part of my concerns and we only addressed it after the foils were pretty much in place. I really thought we were going to do an all over color with some lightening to achieve something closer to the inspo pic. I know that sometimes it’s not always possible and managed my expectations, but I am not as happy as I thought I would be. Any thoughts, advice, input on how to ask her to change it when I return?

At first, my skin was glowy and barely a purge. But gradually, my skin was worse and worse (gradually, yes I did the sandwich method, and slowly introduced it) until I could not handle it anymore. Prior, I used the Effaclar Duo cream by La Roche Posay for 3 years and I am back on it again. My skin is still experiencing breakouts. I am so frustrated. I want to get back on tretinoin--- maybe it is my routines fault. Please let me know if there are any issues with the routine I had when I was on tretinoin.\n\nNevertheless, here was my routine:\n\n2x double cleanse\n\n\\- with a hydrating and purifying cleanser from La Roche Posay. Youth to the People Green tea, or the Kate Sommerville sulfur cleanser.\n\n\\- Use a disposable tissue to wipe my face dry\n\n\\- Tower 28 SOS Spray\n\n\\- Round Lab toner\n\n\\- Good Molecules Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n\\- Avene cicalfate or a cerave moisturizer\n\n\\- Aquaphor sides of my nose and my lips\n\n\\- (wait for it to dry for about 5-15 minutes, depending on how tired I was)\n\n\\- tretinoin .025\n\n\\- Avene cicalfate.\n\n  \n",
