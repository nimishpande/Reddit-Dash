Now, I am using deconstruct niacin-amide face wash and started avoiding soap on face. But ever since i started doing this, i am feeling like my face becoming more oily and greecy, making it look dull. Whereas, cintol would make my skin so clear and would keep it like that throughout the day.\n\nNow, i shifted to a routine, where i am using soap while taking bath in the morning, and using the face wash before sleep with a serum and a moisturiser.\n\nShould I continue what works for me, or should i use face wash only for my skin. \n",
