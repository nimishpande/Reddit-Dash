Boroline doesnâ€™t work for me, Vaseline actually makes my lips more cracked, and the Laneige lip mask just sits on top without doing much. i also do drink enough water for it to not get cracked but The only thing that works is Boroplus but I donâ€™t like that it leaves a white cast and residue.would appreciate any suggestion ",
