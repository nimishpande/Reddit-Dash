But I accumulate these hyperpigmented spots faster than they fade, which has led my back to look like this. My face is clear now and the occasional spots fade within a week or two, but my body takes forever. For my face, I use cerave's benzoyl peroxide and retinol.\n\nIve tried the ordinary's glycolic acid and salicylic acid but they irritate my skin (i have eczema). Now I've been using Cerave SA cream for bumpy skin for the past month and it smoothened my skin initially but I think my skin is flaring up from it too now? Like my shoulders and breast skin gets inflamed, but my tummy, back, and butt seem fine with it.\n\nNow im worried these spots could be permanent since I've had them for so long. Could that happen?\n\nIm open to any skincare routine, lifestyle changes, or diet recommendations.",

I asked an employee with visibly well maintained coily/thick hair for advice and she said Shea Moisture was way too heavy for me with my fine hair - that it contained glycerin and was too heavy for her hair type, so it was definitely the wrong choice for me. She recommended Nexxus Pure and Clean shampoo and conditioner and I'm trying it out now with nothing else changed in my routine, but my curls fall out of their curl pattern within the day. I spend the days between wash days with hair that looks like someone with wavy hair tried to straighten it.\n\nSo clearly this current shampoo and conditioner is not for me, but was she right that the other was too heavy for me and was weighing down my curls?\n\nWhat kind of products and routines do you use for your fine curly hair, and how long do your curls last?",

I do get Ouidad curly cuts - last one done on 9/27. \n\nAs far as shampoo/cond I used to use Kevin Murphy Hydrating &amp; then switched to Davines Love curl, which worked for awhile &amp; then started to make my hair feel like straw. At the time I paired it with Davines Curl Building serum, but didn’t think it was creating nice curls. \n\nSwitched to Ouidad Curl Quencher sham/cond when I got my first curly cut, and paired that with the Ouidad Whipped Curls, but felt like that combo was too much moisture &amp; was weighing down my hair. \n\nA few weeks ago I purchased some Curlsmith Full Body Weightless sham + Milk Cond and then tried various combinations of the Hydro-style flex jelly, Weightless air dry cream, and Vital Curl, none of which seemed to do much for me. I get much better definition from the whipped curls than the vital curl gel. In fact, by day 2 on Vital Curl, my hair was totally listless and lost curl. \n\nToday’s routine:\n1. Washed &amp; conditioned with the CS Full Body\n2. Whipped curls (I literally used like a teaspoon or so &amp; mixed in some Vital Curl gel\n3. Combed thru w wide tooth comb (only to disperse product)\n 4. Sprayed some extra water and then plopped as usual with a microfiber cloth. But \n\nAnd my hair just looks greasy &amp; lifeless. \n\nI am at a loss. What is wrong with my hair and what should I change? I believe it’s low porosity (I tend to dryness, but get weighed down easily) but too much protein or something? I don’t know. My curls used to look so much better, but maybe this is just my hair on menopause + a year on GLP-1. \n\nFirst pic is this past July 20, the last 3 are today. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!! ",

I'm sure this sub has lots of good product recommendations for curly hair and I'll search through them later today, but I just want to vent about how curly hair products are constantly getting discontinued 😓\n\nI was using the Not Your Mother's Naturals Curly shampoo and conditioner, which I liked a lot. Then when I couldnt find that in stores I tried L'Oreal Elvive Dream Lengths Curl shampoo and conditioner, which worked great! Air drying and using their Dream Lengths Curl leave in conditioner made my curls so happy. And now they don't make it anymore 🙃\n\nI'm at a loss. Those were reasonably priced and  worked great for me, so now I need to trial and error again to find something else. \n\nHas anyone dealt with the same thing? Finding a hair routine that works and then it's discontinued? It's so frustrating 😓",

I’ve been struggling with this dry, flaky patch on my cheek(photo 1) for months, and even after trying dermatologist-recommended products, it hasn’t gone away completely.\n\nIt feels like no matter what I use — my skin either becomes too dry and tight, or it breaks out with closed comedones and small white bumps. I have been using the Minimalist:5% Aquaporin Booster Face Wash With Hyaluronic Acid and  Dot &amp; Key: Ceramides &amp; Hyaluronic Barrier Repair Moisturizer and aloe vera gel. \n\nCould anyone please suggest:\n•A hydrating serum that won’t clog pores\n•A gentle toner that helps with dryness but doesn’t irritate\n•Even a different moisturizer that’s safe for dry, acne-prone skin (non-comedogenic, soothing)\n\nAny specific product recommendations ( affordable ) would be really helpful.\n\nThank you so much in advance.",

Recently it has gotten even thinner and I am noticing a lot more breakage, split ends, and frizziness. I do not use any heat on my hair nor do I dye it. I get my hair trimmed once every 3-4 months. I most recently got my hair cut 1 month ago and my hair felt like straw at the time because of how damaged it was. It felt a bit healthier after I got it cut, but the split ends, thinness, and dryness/frizziness quickly returned. I feel like I can’t even wear my hair down anymore because it frizzes out so much, and I am unable to define my curls.\n\nI added a picture before my most recent hair cut that shows how thin and damaged the ends of my hair were. One month later it is starting to look like that again :(\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to rescue my hair?? Thank you!",

I am considering a refurbished Dyson, or maybe something else altogether. *I am after something that will get the job done fast* and will also last longer than a year! I need to make a choice ASAP so I can actually get a dryer in my hands and not walk around with damp roots for hours in the morning. I HATE the feeling of wet hair, especially when it starts getting cold.\n\n  \nAny advice is appreciated!\n\n  \nRoutine: Wash and condition with inner sense. It's a 10 leave in. Crown Affair foam sometimes too. I really keep things minimal nowadays, and my hair doesn't behave at all when we start moving into the colder months.",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "I have been thinking about adding retinol to my routine for the anti-aging benefits (helping reduce fine lines and wrinkles and promote collagen production). I'm in my early 30s and have noticed more fine lines recently, especially on my forehead. \n\nI know you must wear sunscreen when using retinol and protect yourself well from the sun. My job is outdoors for about 6 months and I sweat a lot while working outside. I always put sunscreen on at the beginning of the day (and always wear a hat, long sleeves, and pants), but usually can't re-apply sunscreen throughout the day due to how sweaty I get. \n\nSo I am wondering if it would be worth using retinol 6 months on (when my job is indoors and I can reliably wear sunscreen all the time) and 6 months off (when my job is outdoors)? Or would the 6 months off of retinol reverse all the benefits/progress? \n\n\nThanks! ",
