I was on adapalene and isotretinoin in 2020 and it cleared my skin but I shifted to Delhi in 2024 and it took a toll on my skin!😣\n\nI came in June and skin started getting worse! Went to a dermatologist in October but he kept on prescribing very expensive hyaluronic acid, vitamin c and niacinamide serums even when I told him I’m allergic to niacinamide😒\n\nSo finally in November my neighbour aunty told me to give raw aleovera a chance and started using it everyday at night after my skincare routine and cleared my skin😭😭😭\n\nMy cousin who is around 18 has acne since he was 14, just how my skin looks. Even he started aleovera and he’s happy with the results! (I will post his before and after in few months)\n\nWith aleovera I followed a simple skincare routine: \n\n1. Facewash : Simple Facewash (using it since 3 years now)\n2. Moisturiser: Formula rx hydra veil moisturiser (love of my life💝)\n3. Sunscreen : I was using reequil matte during the summer season and currently using minimalist fluid sunscreen 🧴 \n4. Bioderma Micellar water or Deconstruct cleansing balm for makeup removal 🎀\n\nI use to 10-15 step routine before this and I have over consuming way too much! \n\nHow I use the aleovera:\n\n1. Cut a piece from plant\n2. Clean it with water\n3. Keep it in water for 20 mins (it ensures all the yellow part is removed)\n4. Apply it after 1 Hour after doing my skincare routine which is just applying my moisturiser \n\nTo anyone who is going through acne just give aleovera a try! Please please please😭😭\n\n*Some people are allergic to aleovera too so do a patch test! ",

      "content": "Hi guys. As the title suggests I really need some advice on my skin. As a teen/tween I had bad breakouts on my face and chest and terrible KP on my upper arms and chest area as well. Im now 18 and don’t really struggle with active breakouts but all the breaks out that I used to have, have left a myriad of dark spots, hyperpigmentation and scars all over my face, chest and upper arms. I’ve been struggling with those marks for years and they make me feel terrible, it’s gotten to a point where I don’t wear anything that shows my upper arms or chest and I never leave the house without full coverage makeup . Please help me out 😭I wanna feel comfortable and wear cute clothes again.\n\nExtra info to my skin: Chest - oily skin Upper arms - dry skin Face - combination (Nose, chin and middle of forehead oily. Cheeks and sides of forehead dry) - so basically  inner face oily and outer face dry if that makes sense.\n\nRoutine: I don’t really have a consistent routine I keep up with, but I do wash my arms and chest with a 5% urea body wash and I use the ordinary 7% toner on them with a cotton pad bidaily and lotion with a 15% urea body lotion. I also had a cream prescribed for my dermatologist for my KP. It’s called selgamis by galderma and it’s 50 Mikrogramm trifaroten /g creme \n\nAs for face I use an 5% salicylic acid face wash (eucerin)  and double cleanse with an oil cleanser (balea) to get all my makeup off. I’ve used vitamin C and niacinamide and retinol (the ordinary) but I wasn’t consistent and I don’t use them anymore (I ran out lol)\n\n \n\nI am also based in the EU which means some products may not be super easily available to me but please recommend whatever works best. I appreciate any and every advice. Thank you guys so much",

      "content": "My routine used to be washing my hair 2x a week with Shea Moisture  Curl and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner, lightly wringing out the water with a microfiber towel until its damp but not dripping, applying Not Your Mother's Curl Talk gel and scrunching before letting it air dry and breaking the hard cast the gel dried into. \n\nThis would get me a mix of ringlets and looser curls, hair kind of going whatever direction it wanted at the shorter parts, and the curls would survive up to 3 days with the gel, sleeping on silk pillowcases. \n\nI liked most of my routine and how it held up between washes, if not how greasy it would look sometimes, and the fact that I know my curls have been tighter in the past, but when I last ran out of my Shampoo and Conditioner, the store was out of stock. I asked an employee with visibly well maintained coily/thick hair for advice and she said Shea Moisture was way too heavy for me with my fine hair - that it contained glycerin and was too heavy for her hair type, so it was definitely the wrong choice for me. She recommended Nexxus Pure and Clean shampoo and conditioner and I'm trying it out now with nothing else changed in my routine, but my curls fall out of their curl pattern within the day. I spend the days between wash days with hair that looks like someone with wavy hair tried to straighten it.\n\nSo clearly this current shampoo and conditioner is not for me, but was she right that the other was too heavy for me and was weighing down my curls?\n\nWhat kind of products and routines do you use for your fine curly hair, and how long do your curls last?",

I've tried using a bounce curl brush, denman brush, and now I finger coil, but still no luck. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I thank you all in advance!\n\n✨️\n\nRoutine:\n•Wash my hair twice a week\n•Wash only top of my hair with Herbal Essence sulfate-free shampoo, condition only bottom of my hair with Herbal Essence sulfate-free conditioner\n•Use Ouidad Coil Infusion Deep Conditioner on whole head once a week\n•Clarify whole head with Olaplex Clarifying Shampoo once a month\n•Put Rizo's Curl Cream on soaking wet hair (whole head including roots)\n•Put Ouidad Advanced Climate Control gel on wet hair (whole head including roots)\n•Finger coil whole head, using fingertips to pull at roots to make them not so kinky (which isn't working)\n•Add a small amount of Kenra No.9 hairspray\n•Diffuse with Babyliss dryer\n•Use small amount of Kenra Luxe Shine Oil to break cast\n•Sleep in silk bonnet and silk pillowcases",

Last september I added 1x 0.5mg dut to my 7x 1mg fin regimen. I even improved my hair thickness for 6 months. BUT I started to shed after the end of this 6 month.\n\nIn march 2025 I started to shed like crazy… This shed lasted until today, and still going. I tried to increase my dut dosage up to x2 and x3 with x7 fin per week but nothing changed.\n\nTo clarify, I do not use generic brands. Only propecia and avodart.\n\nSo, the question rises now: What should I do?\n\nA) Stop dutasteride fully because it gives damage (?) to my hair and only stick with finasteride. 9 month is already enough.\n\nB) 2-3x dut is not enough so increase it to ED.\n\nFor the option A, I do find it weird to be honest because some people say that I might not be responding enough to dut But dont forget, I have never stopped using 7x fin.\n\nCould you guys help me, or just share your ideas please? I am planning to see a doctor but they are generally useless since they are mainly not pro fin/dut in my country.\n\nI appreciate all the help and comments",

Some say it helps clean better, others say it can irritate the skin.\n\nSo I wanted to ask:\n\n* Do you actually follow the 60-second rule?\n* How long do you massage your cleanser in?\n* What water temperature do you prefer (warm, cold, or lukewarm)?\n* How many times a day do you wash your face?\n* Any safe tips to reduce redness after cleansing?\n\nNot asking for medical advice — just looking for real experiences or step-by-step routines that help with balanced cleansing for combination skin.\n\nThanks in advance! 🙏",

I’ve been struggling with this dry, flaky patch on my cheek(photo 1) for months, and even after trying dermatologist-recommended products, it hasn’t gone away completely.\n\nIt feels like no matter what I use — my skin either becomes too dry and tight, or it breaks out with closed comedones and small white bumps. I have been using the Minimalist:5% Aquaporin Booster Face Wash With Hyaluronic Acid and  Dot &amp; Key: Ceramides &amp; Hyaluronic Barrier Repair Moisturizer and aloe vera gel. \n\nCould anyone please suggest:\n•A hydrating serum that won’t clog pores\n•A gentle toner that helps with dryness but doesn’t irritate\n•Even a different moisturizer that’s safe for dry, acne-prone skin (non-comedogenic, soothing)\n\nAny specific product recommendations ( affordable ) would be really helpful.\n\nThank you so much in advance.",

And something that helps with having different colors across different parts of my face. \n\n2. Are pharmaceutical products really good? Has anyone tried here? Something to help with acne scars and dark lips?\n\n3. I read reviews dat wishcare body lotion is very good for tan removal on ur hands. Has anyone here used it?\n\n4. There is this video about using dove body scrub with some red color serum. Does that actually help your body skin become smooth?\n\nAdvices and answers would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

At the time I paired it with Davines Curl Building serum, but didn’t think it was creating nice curls. \n\nSwitched to Ouidad Curl Quencher sham/cond when I got my first curly cut, and paired that with the Ouidad Whipped Curls, but felt like that combo was too much moisture &amp; was weighing down my hair. \n\nA few weeks ago I purchased some Curlsmith Full Body Weightless sham + Milk Cond and then tried various combinations of the Hydro-style flex jelly, Weightless air dry cream, and Vital Curl, none of which seemed to do much for me. I get much better definition from the whipped curls than the vital curl gel. In fact, by day 2 on Vital Curl, my hair was totally listless and lost curl. \n\nToday’s routine:\n1. Washed &amp; conditioned with the CS Full Body\n2. Whipped curls (I literally used like a teaspoon or so &amp; mixed in some Vital Curl gel\n3. Combed thru w wide tooth comb (only to disperse product)\n 4. Sprayed some extra water and then plopped as usual with a microfiber cloth. But \n\nAnd my hair just looks greasy &amp; lifeless. \n\nI am at a loss. What is wrong with my hair and what should I change? I believe it’s low porosity (I tend to dryness, but get weighed down easily) but too much protein or something? I don’t know. My curls used to look so much better, but maybe this is just my hair on menopause + a year on GLP-1. \n\nFirst pic is this past July 20, the last 3 are today. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!! ",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

It’s dry, rough and frizzy.\n\nI tried sulfate free and sulfate shampoo and didn’t noticed a difference. I always use hair conditioner, hair mask, leave in conditioner spray, oil, blow dry cream and heat protectant if heat styling.\n\nThe only changes I can really think of was I got a Dyson air wrap 2 years ago and I moved from Vancouver to California. I also dyed my hair into a brown before my wedding 3 years ago, but no bleaching. But my hair looked fine after, so don’t know if that’s related or not.\n\nI also lost a shit ton of hair and my scalp hurts like never before. I went to the dermatologist about it but they couldn’t find anything wrong.\n\nSo what can I do? Any hair treatments I can do at the salon?
