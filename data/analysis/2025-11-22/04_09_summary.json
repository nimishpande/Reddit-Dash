So many have the “same type” but totally different hair needs. That’s because the Andrew Walker typing system isn’t actually accurate and doesn’t tell you anything.

      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Later, we had a detailed call where he explained the entire process—how many grafts were required, donor areas, and how the procedure would be spread across 3 days to avoid stressing the body.\n\nHe also asked me to get blood work and basic investigations done to ensure it was safe to proceed.\n\n, the logistics worked out perfectly for me. On the first day, he walked me through the entire process, took pictures, and made sure I was completely comfortable. The clinic was clean, hygienic, and well maintained.\n\nMy procedure took 3 days. On Day 1, markings were made and my head was shaved. In the OT, the surgeon personally administered anesthesia. This was the only part that was slightly painful, but he was patient and took it slow. He ensured every area was properly numb before starting. Both the extraction and the implantation were performed by the surgeon himself, supported by his staff. I was comfortable throughout, even using my phone at times. We took breaks, and lunch/snacks were provided. He was available the whole time to answer every question I had.\n\nAfter the 3rd day, I was given medications and a saline spray to keep the grafts hydrated. The first week was a bit stressful because I was being extra careful to protect the implanted area. Sleeping was slightly tricky, but a travel pillow helped a lot.\n\nAfter a week, I went for cleaning and my first head wash. Post that, I was told I could resume most normal activities except heavy workouts.\n\nShedding started around the 2nd–3rd month, which I knew was normal. Around the 5th month, I began noticing visible growth. I’m currently at the 6-month mark and the improvements are clear and encouraging.\n\nI’m very happy with the progress so far and confident it will keep improving over the next few months.",

      "content": "These pics are about 10 years apart. I was cleaning out my photos, and came across some pictures I'd taken when my cystic acne was really bad. I always had perfectly nice skin until I hit about 26 and my face went nuts. It was incredibly painful, and the cysts would pop at the slightest touch sometimes.\n\nI couldn't find any good pictures from a few years later once I finally got the acne tamed, but I had some pretty heinous scarring. Lots of boxcar scars and deep red purple hyperpigmentation. I felt like I'd never like my skin again.\n\nWell. Here I am, barking at 40, and people tell me all the time how great my skin is. I still have some texture for sure, but the worst of the scarring has faded. I couldn't afford any fancy treatments. I've just continued to care for my skin, wearing sunscreen, exfoliating, supporting my moisture barrier, and using Differin when possible, although I've been either pregnant or nursing for the last 3+ years so no retinoids for me lol.\n\nJust wanted to say that a lot of this can be chalked up to patience. Even when you don't have the cash for peels or microneedling, a lot of times your skin will recover. &lt;3\n\n(Combination skin, now moving into anti-aging concerns. \n\nRoutine: AM: wash with water, Findive Vit C serum (not dedicated to this brand, I got it for free), The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid, The Ordinary Squalane, La Roche Posay Anthelios sunscreen. PM: CeraVe cleanser, The Ordinary Glycolic Acid, The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid, The Ordinary Squalane.\n\nWhen I'm not nursing anymore, I'll be adding back in Differin Gel.)",

I've also tried an AHA toner from byoma and an AHA toner from Paula's choice, neither of them did anything. So clearly AHA alone isn't strong enough but that salicylic acid cleanser was way too strong. Anyone have product recommendations for me? It doesn't have to be from Ulta, it can be from anywhere.

Right now I use a red light mask every morning after cleansing but am getting a booster pro and a tripollar vx 3 for Christmas. Can they be used in the same routine? If yes, should I avoid certain modes on the booster pro on vx 3 nights? Is not, what would a good rotation be?\n\nI am hoping to use the vx 2x a week at first, eventually 3, the mask daily, the booster pro (minus air shot mode daily) and the air shot mode 2x a week. \n\nAmy advice or links to videos and/or articles would be appreciated.  Thank you",

I also have pimples on my shoulders, upper back, and sometimes in the hair at the back of my neck.\n\nI mostly stay indoors, though I sometimes go out for work or errands. Currently, I don’t use any face washes or creams because I want a routine that’s affordable, simple, and doesn’t take too much time.\n\n**Photos:**\n\n\\- I’ll be sharing pics of both cheeks and my forehead (not my full face). The images are taken in bright light, but in indoor lighting the scars, marks, and tanning look more noticeable.\n\n**My goals:**\n\n* Reduce or remove red areas, dark spots, and pigmentation\n* Fade both old and newer acne scars\n* Prevent new breakouts (face, shoulders, neck)\n* Keep my routine basic and on a low budget\n\n**Extra info:**\n\n* Skin is oily, especially forehead and nose\n* New pimples appear less often now\n* Not sensitive, but avoid products that burn\n* Pimples also on shoulders, upper back, around neck/hairline\n* I have used benzoyl and tretinoin. Both works, but acne keep coming back. benzoyl did peel of skin, it's irritating, but I didn't monitor much, so don't know if it removed acne scars.\n\n**Product questions:**\n\n* I’m planning to buy the beminimalist Niacinamide 10% Face Serum (10ml to try first). Would it suit oily, acne-prone skin like mine? How should I use it, and how often?\n* And also thinking of buying a vitamin C serum for dark spots.\n* If you notice pigmentation or uneven tone in the images, which cream or serum should I use for that (and for tanning/dullness)?\n* I don’t want to go for brands or creams with a shady background or too much marketing hype. Please suggest genuinely good options.\n\n**What I need:**\n\n* Daily routine, max 2-3 steps (just cleanser, serum, moisturizer or SPF is ideal)\n* Affordable, India available options\n* Quick tips to reduce redness before events\n* **How to tackle pigmentation, dark spots, acne scars with budget products (if OTC works, or when to see a dermatologist)**\n* Suggestions for pigmentation/tan and dark spots (please mention 2-3 product options in different price ranges so I can pick based on my budget)\n\n**Thanks a lot for reading!**\n\nAny honest, practical advice, routines, or product suggestions are appreciated. I hope I’ve covered all details. Ask if you need more context.",
