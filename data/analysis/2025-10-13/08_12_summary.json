I’ve tried so many eye creams over the years, from vitamin C to arnica to caffeine, and nothing seems to help. I know it’s genetic, but I’m also dealing with other factors like low iron and allergies. It's been pointed out to me my entire life, even by doctors. The weird thing is, I don’t feel like my undereyes are super hollow. There’s a bit of hollowness, but I’m not sure it’s enough to explain the discoloration. I’m really stumped and would love to hear if anyone has suggestions for what might help. I’m curious about options like PDGF, lasers, or anything that could potentially make a long-term difference.

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I started off with 0.5 but recently realized that my skin doesn’t handle it especially when I am using azelaic acid along with it, so I moved to 0.025%. While this has helped keep those skin flakes at bay, my skin still feels dry and I have mild acne/texture all over my face. \nI’m open to recommendations for moisturizers, ampoules, or in-office treatment.\n\nThank you!!\n",

      "content": "I’ll do my best not to write a novel. But I like to give as much info as possible, so apologies in advance. (3rd time trying to post this so hopefully it’s successful).\n\nI tried following the starting cg method in the google doc, and I don’t know that it’s going to work for my hair. But I need help figuring out what to do next. I have a tendency to get overwhelmed easily. \n\nMy hair started doing these little curls in the front when it would get wet from walking in the rain, high humidity, etc. out of no where (last picture). \n\nTHEN I noticed my hair is getting some waves while it’s wet in the shower after I wash. To my brain, I’m thinking, this doesn’t matter because it still always dries without texture. Then I stumble across this sub, and now my brain is like “maybe it’s not just breakage, maybe I’m also fighting frizz?” \n\n2nd to last pic is how my hair dries when absolutely no effort is made not even conditioner.\n\nIMPORTANT: I have a d-limonene allergy. It can lurk in fragrances causing most things to be hit or miss. But if something explicitly says it contains d-limonene anywhere in the ingredients, it’s a no go. \n\nAt moment I’m using OGX coconut curls. I got it before I noticed the waves because I like the way it smells and it surprisingly doesn’t irritate my allergy. But I think it is probably WAY too heavy for my hair. I’m almost out so now is a good time to ask for advice.\n\nI was looking at Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Bond Repair shampoo and conditioner. Would this be the right direction?\nPossibly their sea salt spray as well?\n\nI was also looking at OGX Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse in place of the mouse as a replacement for the Aussie gel as well? Unless this is also too heavy?\n\nQuick Points:\nI have fine hair but quite a bit of it. \n\nNo color or chemicals in my hair.\n\nAside from experimenting twice with the diffuser, I don’t use heat at all. \n\nMy hair dries fast with no conditioner. \nIt dries in a reasonable amount of time with conditioner that has been rinsed out. \nIt doesn’t seem to dry at all with the gel (at least not while plopped). \n\nI can’t handle the cowash or heavy product and I have to wash my hair a minimum of every other day lest I risk my crown follicles trying to murder me.\n\nI NEED sulfates or something similar enough. All the hypoallergenic shampoos I’ve tried are all sulfate free and my hair feels awful and my scalp doesn’t feel clean. \n\nBudget is somewhat important, I mostly stick with stuff I can find at my grocery/drug store (which does carry quite a large variety). \n\nI trimmed my hair a few weeks ago, but I know it probably needs more than that as it’s been horribly neglected and frequently thrown into ponytails. I probably need layers. Was thinking about the waterfall wolf cut by curl maven in that’s linked in the doc.\n\nBut any other advice or tips would be greatly appreciated! I’m at the end of my hair trying to figure this stuff out. If there are more questions to answer, I will be more than happy to. \n(If I take a while to respond, I probably fell sleep)\n\nRequired routine for posting even though I don’t have a set one yet:\nOGX coconut curls shampoo and conditioner.\nAussie wavy leave-in. Air dry. I’ve stopped using the Aussie gel at the moment.",

      "content": "So I need tips for my skincare! This is my very basic routine I currently have and honestly I don’t know anything about skincare. I have oily skin with some dry patches sometimes on my forehead. My nose is very very oily and has clogged pores. Like when I rub my nose the stuff in my pores fall out. I can’t even put foundation on my nose! It’s all patchy and looks bad. It used to look like that on my whole face but this face wash really helped. I exfoliate my face with a silicone scrubber. My skin is very sensitive and prone to eczema, the first bad flare I had my face was swollen. I was prescribed a cream for it and it got rid of the eczema. Some products I’ve tried have caused bad flares. So I can be scared of trying new products. I have bad dark circles under my eyes although there is no swelling, just darkness. My face is also pink but I wouldn’t classify it as rosacea, but my upper lip and chin aren’t pink so it’s like a mustache and goatee of my skin color haha. I wash my face in the shower which I know people don’t recommend but it makes it easier for me to do. I’m kind of lost on if the products I’m using are good and what products to add or change. If you can please give me some advice! I really dont have the money to go to a dermatologist. Thank you!\n\nTLDR: clueless on skincare, oily skin, clogged pores, sensitive skin prone to eczema. Need advice. Pictures are my current products",

It’s supposed to have two speed settings, but the medium speed doesn’t work at all—only the highest one does. I’ve already requested a replacement, but now I’m a bit unsure about the overall quality.\n\nThe product itself looks really good—sturdy build, nice color, and feels premium for the price. But since I got a defective piece right away, I’m worried that even the replacement might not last long.\n\nI mainly bought this one because it comes with a diffuser head—I’ve never tried diffusing before, and I have wavy, frizzy hair, so I was hoping it would help tame my curls and reduce frizz.\n\nSo now I’m wondering—\n👉 Should I stick with the replacement and give it another try?\n👉 Or should I return it and go for a different dryer altogether?\n\nWould really appreciate any experiences or suggestions—especially if anyone here has used the AGARO HD-1120 or another good low-wattage dryer with a diffuser!\n",

      "content": "So I need tips for my skincare! This is my very basic routine I currently have and honestly I don’t know anything about skincare. I have oily skin with some dry patches sometimes on my forehead. My nose is very very oily and has clogged pores. Like when I rub my nose the stuff in my pores fall out. I can’t even put foundation on my nose! It’s all patchy and looks bad. It used to look like that on my whole face but this face wash really helped. I exfoliate my face with a silicone scrubber. My skin is very sensitive and prone to eczema, the first bad flare I had my face was swollen. I was prescribed a cream for it and it got rid of the eczema. Some products I’ve tried have caused bad flares. So I can be scared of trying new products. I have bad dark circles under my eyes although there is no swelling, just darkness. My face is also pink but I wouldn’t classify it as rosacea, but my upper lip and chin aren’t pink so it’s like a mustache and goatee of my skin color haha. I wash my face in the shower which I know people don’t recommend but it makes it easier for me to do. I’m kind of lost on if the products I’m using are good and what products to add or change. If you can please give me some advice! I really dont have the money to go to a dermatologist. Thank you!\n\nTLDR: clueless on skincare, oily skin, clogged pores, sensitive skin prone to eczema. Need advice. Pictures are my current products",

      "content": "Prior to this I had blonde highlights and I got a lot of positive attention. People were more friendly, both men and women were nicer to me and I feel like maybe it was because I looked less alternative so people were less judgy. and also because blonde is perceived as less intimidating. Idk but it’s been bothering me because while I notice that some girls are nicer while I have the red as they compliment my hair and appearance, some talk to me more condescendingly like I’m weird and it’s been pissing me off. Men also hit on me less, which I honestly don’t mind as I was sick of the sexual attention. However, I feel ugly because of this, and the guy I previously dated (who I dropped now thank god) didn’t really compliment my change of color so I think he preferred the blonde. \n\nSo I don’t know if the red just doesn’t suite me or if I’m just being insecure because of not having that much positive reactions compared to the blonde. I also used to get bullied so I am kind of sensitive when it comes to being treated like an outcast when I know I should be treated by the way my personality is not by my hair. I have always been very confident since and am quite social/extroverted but yeah I can’t help but notice the weird judgy looks.  \n\nBoth slide 2 and 3 was the same hair except with different hairstyles. last slide was me with black hair. Wondering if I should just do black, or go a deeper red as I do also believe I am a deep winter. Or just keep it lol because I am not sure if I am overthinking it.",

I started off with 0.5 but recently realized that my skin doesn’t handle it especially when I am using azelaic acid along with it, so I moved to 0.025%. While this has helped keep those skin flakes at bay, my skin still feels dry and I have mild acne/texture all over my face. \nI’m open to recommendations for moisturizers, ampoules, or in-office treatment.\n\nThank you!!\n",
