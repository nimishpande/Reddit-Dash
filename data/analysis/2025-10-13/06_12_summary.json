      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe‚Ñ¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I started off with 0.5 but recently realized that my skin doesn‚Äôt handle it especially when I am using azelaic acid along with it, so I moved to 0.025%.

      "content": "I‚Äôll do my best not to write a novel. But I like to give as much info as possible, so apologies in advance. (3rd time trying to post this so hopefully it‚Äôs successful).\n\nI tried following the starting cg method in the google doc, and I don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs going to work for my hair. But I need help figuring out what to do next. I have a tendency to get overwhelmed easily. \n\nMy hair started doing these little curls in the front when it would get wet from walking in the rain, high humidity, etc. out of no where (last picture). \n\nTHEN I noticed my hair is getting some waves while it‚Äôs wet in the shower after I wash. To my brain, I‚Äôm thinking, this doesn‚Äôt matter because it still always dries without texture. Then I stumble across this sub, and now my brain is like ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs not just breakage, maybe I‚Äôm also fighting frizz?‚Äù \n\n2nd to last pic is how my hair dries when absolutely no effort is made not even conditioner.\n\nIMPORTANT: I have a d-limonene allergy. It can lurk in fragrances causing most things to be hit or miss. But if something explicitly says it contains d-limonene anywhere in the ingredients, it‚Äôs a no go. \n\nAt moment I‚Äôm using OGX coconut curls. I got it before I noticed the waves because I like the way it smells and it surprisingly doesn‚Äôt irritate my allergy. But I think it is probably WAY too heavy for my hair. I‚Äôm almost out so now is a good time to ask for advice.\n\nI was looking at Not Your Mother‚Äôs Curl Talk Bond Repair shampoo and conditioner. Would this be the right direction?\nPossibly their sea salt spray as well?\n\nI was also looking at OGX Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse in place of the mouse as a replacement for the Aussie gel as well? Unless this is also too heavy?\n\nQuick Points:\nI have fine hair but quite a bit of it. \n\nNo color or chemicals in my hair.\n\nAside from experimenting twice with the diffuser, I don‚Äôt use heat at all. \n\nMy hair dries fast with no conditioner. \nIt dries in a reasonable amount of time with conditioner that has been rinsed out. \nIt doesn‚Äôt seem to dry at all with the gel (at least not while plopped). \n\nI can‚Äôt handle the cowash or heavy product and I have to wash my hair a minimum of every other day lest I risk my crown follicles trying to murder me.\n\nI NEED sulfates or something similar enough. All the hypoallergenic shampoos I‚Äôve tried are all sulfate free and my hair feels awful and my scalp doesn‚Äôt feel clean. \n\nBudget is somewhat important, I mostly stick with stuff I can find at my grocery/drug store (which does carry quite a large variety). \n\nI trimmed my hair a few weeks ago, but I know it probably needs more than that as it‚Äôs been horribly neglected and frequently thrown into ponytails. I probably need layers. Was thinking about the waterfall wolf cut by curl maven in that‚Äôs linked in the doc.\n\nBut any other advice or tips would be greatly appreciated! I‚Äôm at the end of my hair trying to figure this stuff out. If there are more questions to answer, I will be more than happy to. \n(If I take a while to respond, I probably fell sleep)\n\nRequired routine for posting even though I don‚Äôt have a set one yet:\nOGX coconut curls shampoo and conditioner.\nAussie wavy leave-in. Air dry. I‚Äôve stopped using the Aussie gel at the moment.",

I am 31F and feeling a little overwhelmed while trying to research and figure out this stuff.\n\nI'm new to more \"advanced\" skincare and need some help structuring the routine. I know for some products you need to ease your way in, so don't worry I won't blitz my face with everything at once!\n\nI'm thinking something along the lines of:\n\nAM - water wash, toner, moisturiser with spf\n\nPM - (alternating days, starting at 1-2 day a week) BHA exfoliate, moisturiser with peptides \n\nI didn't want to go too overboard at first, these are just products I already own right now. Though I am looking to get a new toner and spf moisturiser now I am using BHA, what sort of thing should I look for with that in mind now?\n\nI also have been thrown in a free retinol sample with a recent purchase of BHA, which is something I have been interested in starting now I'm in my early 30s. I know you're supposed to ease your way into those too, when would that be best to apply? Should I wait to start it or can I slowly introduce it too. (And I am assuming to make sure to not do it the same day as BHA exfoliating?)\n\nThanks in advance for anyone's help/advice, and I am open to other product suggestions if they compliment anything here. üôè",

How long will it take for me to see some \"coverage\"? Should I cut everything off or should I stay strong and see how things go?\n\nWhat was your experience like? Anyone been in a similar situation that can give me their opinion? \n\nThanks to anyone who will give me a feedback, stay strong brothers, we're in this together!!!\n\nBTW, sorry if my english might be a little criptic sometimes, it's just that it's not my main language so yeah....",

Thank you in advance for all your help!!\n\nMy skincare journey started with moderate but stubborn acne which reacted to dust, dairy, nightshade plants‚Äî you name it!!!\nI tried switching up products, but what really helped was isotretin prescribed by my dermatologist.\n\nComing to my moisturizer issues, I have tried multiple moisturizers, but just about everything breaks me out.\n\nThe ones I have tried:\n1) Mary and May Idebenone Moisturizer \n2) Soon Jung Etude House 10 Free Emulsion\n3) Sebamed Clear Gel (possibly the citric acid in it)\n4) InTree Tea Tree \n5) Beplain Cicaful Calming Gel\n6) Sidmool 100 Honey Moisture\n7) Neutrogena 72 Hours Moisturizer \n\nOther things which broke me out-\n1) TO alpha arbutin but Cos de Baha arbutin didn‚Äôt‚Äî just to cross out ingredients\n2) Numbuzin number 5+\n\n\nThings that don‚Äôt break me out- \n1) Iunik beta glucan serum \n2) Cosrx full fit propolis ampoule\n3) plain old glycerine \n4) Purito Daily soft touch sunscreen\n5) Cosrx snail mucin (not sure about this one)\n6) skin1004 Centella ampoule\n\nI was hoping to find a decent moisturizer to help my skin restore its barrier given I have to use tretinoin and azelaic acid every day. \nI have been using tretinoin for about 3 years now. I started off with 0.5 but recently realized that my skin doesn‚Äôt handle it especially when I am using azelaic acid along with it, so I moved to 0.025%. While this has helped keep those skin flakes at bay, my skin still feels dry and I have mild acne/texture all over my face. \nI‚Äôm open to recommendations for moisturizers, ampoules, or in-office treatment.\n\nThank you!!\n",

It has worked alright and has helped to prevent the pimple from ‚Äúrenewing‚Äù, but I have also noticed that the wounds heal slowly and scar quite a bit. \n\nIs it true that using rubbing alcohol is actually a really bad thing to do, because it‚Äôs really irritating and destroys healthy skin cells? I have struggled with hyperpigmentation and oily skin, could using rubbing alcohol cause all of that? (I dont rub it on my face, only popped pimples though) What are the alternatives?",
