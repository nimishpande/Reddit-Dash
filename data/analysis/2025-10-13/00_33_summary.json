I’ve had these intense dark circles basically since birth, and the last photo of me at 2 or 3 years old shows the same thing—those same purple undereyes. I’ve tried so many eye creams over the years, from vitamin C to arnica to caffeine, and nothing seems to help. I know it’s genetic, but I’m also dealing with other factors like low iron and allergies. It's been pointed out to me my entire life, even by doctors. The weird thing is, I don’t feel like my undereyes are super hollow. There’s a bit of hollowness, but I’m not sure it’s enough to explain the discoloration. I’m really stumped and would love to hear if anyone has suggestions for what might help. I’m curious about options like PDGF, lasers, or anything that could potentially make a long-term difference. (And I know allergy and iron pills too, which do help some but not enough)",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I start by detangling my hair a bit with my hands after wetting it, then I wash my hair with Aveeno apple cider vinegar shampoo clarifying shampoo, before I condition with redken all soft conditioner, and detangle fully with a wet brush, I brush my hair to the opposite side to which I wear it on, add my leave in conditioner (Marc Anthony Grow Long) and a small small amount of coconut and shea curl cream, I brush it through then I use my styling brush (I don’t bother sectioning because I only have hair on top anyway) I spray with heat protectant then diffuse most of the way, spray with a bit more morrocan oil and wear a bonnet for 15 minutes (seems to help me with frizz) then take it off and let it fully dry.",

Today I stupidly used a glycolic acid cleanser (Glytone Exfoliating Body Wash 8.8%, which my derm has recommended for use on my face in the past) thinking that would help with some flakiness that had started building up, and now my skin is red, very tight, and stinging. I'm scared to put anything on – moisturizers often sting my skin, even basics from Vanicream or CeraVe, and I fear it will be even worse after the glycolic acid.\n\nCan anyone recommend a moisturizer to save me from the sensitivity in this moment while I make a derm appointment? Preferable if I can buy it at a drugstore, since I'd like to go out and buy it ASAP.",

I also have a big forehead lol and want wispy bangs but my hairstylist says my hair is too long to blend bangs into? \n\nMy routine is Not Your Mothers Shampoo and Conditioner and then I brush in IGK curl cream while it’s soaking wet and scrunch in IGK curl gel or Not Your Mothers Flash Freeze Gel after scrunching out with a cotton t shirt. I then plop for a few hours and then let it air dry! I’ve tried using claw clips to give me so volume while it’s drying and that gives me about 30 minutes of volume haha.",

      "content": "Hi!  I (30F) am seeking advice on my skincare routine (+retinol).  I'm new to skincare beyond the basics, so please bear with me!  I'm happy to provide any extra info that is helpful. \n\nMy skincare goals are to have healthy skin (which has to me meant not being too dry and staying acne free, but I am learning there's a lot more to it than that) and to prevent fine lines to the extent possible.  \n\nMy skin type is... nothing out of the ordinary I guess?  It's even in color and I don't get regular acne.  It isn't too dry, though it starts to get more oily as the day goes on.  I'm starting to develop fine lines between my brows.  I don't wear makeup except the occasional blush or spot coverup, and I wear hats so my skin isn't much in the sun. \n\nMy recently-retired dermatologist recommended I use Kiehl's retinol (I think this is the Micro-Dose Anti-Aging Retinol Serum with Ceramides and Peptide) before trying a retinol prescription. \n\nMy morning and night skincare routine consists of (in this order):\n\n--Cleanse with Cetaphil bar soap\n\n--Occasional clay mask \n\n--Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel\n\n--Neutrogena Hydro Boost Ultra Hydrating Serum\n\n--Neutrogena Hydro Boost Eye Cream (only under my eyes)\n\n--At night I use Scotch tape between my brows so I don't furrow in my sleep (same effect as frownies/smoothies I think?) \n\nThat being said! \n\n1. How often should I start using Kiehl's?  The website says it's okay to use daily, but I have seen much advice on this sub about easing into retinols, though I haven't seen much about Kiehl's specifically. \n\n2. Does retinol actually expire more quickly if I do not keep it in the refrigerator? \n\n3. What order should I be using products in?  I watched a video of a dermatologist talking about retinol sandwiches so should I just slot it in after the Water Gel and before the serum? \n\n4. Do you have recommendations for other products or SPF that have worked well for you?  Especially for those of you that also like the Hydro Boost products?  (I've tried the City Shield and it is okay, but it causes a lil bit of skin activity compared to the epic no-pimple effects of the Water Gel.) \n\nThank you so much! \n\ntldr -- Do you have any advice about incorporating Kiehl's retinol into my routine?  My biggest priorities are minimizing my \"elevens\" for as long as possible and not having acne/ oily skin/too-dry skin.  Thanks!",

Since I started using the Vanicream moisturizer and washing my face with just water in the monring, my skin feels less dehydrated, but it still doesn’t feel fully hydrated on its own. My skin also looks very dull and have hyperpigmentation from the acne.\n\nOverall, I’m happy with my current routine — I’ve been following it for about four months, and PanOxyl has been an absolute game changer for my breakouts. Also, I live in Canada, where the climate is very dry.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\n\n**Morning**\n\n* Wash with water (occasionally use the CeraVe Foaming Cleanser)\n* Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer\n* Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum\n\nHypochlorous acid spray in between\n\n**Evening**\n\n* PanOxyl 4% wash (two times a week) or Cerave cleanser\n* Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer\n\nI've used both the Cerave lotion and moisturizing cream are okay but my skin sometimes feels irritated and heavy after using them.

      "content": "Hello! I dealt with minor acne throughout my 20s until working with an esthetician through the Face Reality program when I was 26. It really helped clear things up other than the occasional hormonal breakout. \n\nHowever, this last March, I had a bad reaction to a sunscreen which kicked off a 6-7 month battle with severe eczema all over my face and neck. It got really bad around August which is when I had to start cutting out products, including all of the Face Reality skincare I’ve been using for 6 years now. Benzoyl peroxide was one of the ingredients making the eczema worse and I’ve now gone without it for about 30 days. It also turns out I have a lot of contact allergies that have come to the surface since the bad sunscreen reaction and that’s what was causing the eczema (including BP). It took a few weeks and while my eczema is completely cleared up, my skin is now covered in acne and clusters of bumps, especially all over my jawline and temples (a spot I’ve never had breakouts before).\n\nIs it normal to purge after cutting out benzoyl peroxide when you’ve been using it for years? If so, how long will the purge be expected to last and is there anything I can do to get my skin back on track as quickly as possible? Asking for my own mental sanity after months of extreme skin issues 😭\n\nDue to the various allergies, the skincare I can use is very limited so I’m not going to try and ask for advice there. But what I am currently using is CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser, a hypochlorous acid spray, and La Roche-Posay Toleriane double repair face moisturizer - in case there’s anything glaring that I should be avoiding. \n\nAppreciate any and all advice on cutting out benzoyl peroxide from skincare and getting my skin back on track.

      "content": "So... these products (particularly the Pink Collagen Masks) are everywhere. I am aware that a lot of influencers were paid to get a lot of this Medicube stuff off the ground. And due to this, they were hotly contested / debated. People seemed to think it was basic brand korean skincare being marketed to the gullible west.\n\nSince then, however, influencers I trust appear to be banging on about Medicube PDRN series without being paid: \n\n– Paige Desorbo mentioned she loves the pink collagen mask (and the electric thingy)  \n– Tana Mongeau basically said she would get a subscribe and save to the pink collagen masks \n\nMultiple others that I can't remember now or point at. \n\nI've got them and I've been using the Pink Collagen Masks and the Serum. My Mum keeps asking what I'm doing to my skin and it looks amazing after I use the products. Weirdly, I don't seem to notice much difference... but I'm still using them. What's everyone's opinion? Has anyone noticed significant results?\n\nI've used the wrapping mask... I don't really have a verdict. Seems very messy for something an emollient would do. I'd love to hear other people's opinions or tips on how to use it for maximum effect. \n\nThe electric thing I don't have, but I'd trust Paige Desorbo's recommendations with my life and she seems to love it? Has anyone used it, loved it, and if so what products did you pair it with and how did it fit into your routine? ",
