Aussie Instant Freeze Gel\n-rake into all wet hair except for scalp and scrunch it in upside down\n-plop in scarf for 20 minutes, then let it down  and air dry until DRY DRY\n4. Put 2-3 drops of jojoba oil into palms and rub together and scrunch out the crunch\n\nI need to look into training my waves/curls. Any suggested changes? I’m in love with the result, but I see my hairs potential at the ends and I want the top to look like that too. Any advice would be appreciated! I’m so excited to start this journey! \n\n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I also have a big forehead lol and want wispy bangs but my hairstylist says my hair is too long to blend bangs into? \n\nMy routine is Not Your Mothers Shampoo and Conditioner and then I brush in IGK curl cream while it’s soaking wet and scrunch in IGK curl gel or Not Your Mothers Flash Freeze Gel after scrunching out with a cotton t shirt. I then plop for a few hours and then let it air dry! I’ve tried using claw clips to give me so volume while it’s drying and that gives me about 30 minutes of volume haha.",

Thank you in advance for all your help!!\n\nMy skincare journey started with moderate but stubborn acne which reacted to dust, dairy, nightshade plants— you name it!!!\nI tried switching up products, but what really helped was isotretin prescribed by my dermatologist.\n\nComing to my moisturizer issues, I have tried multiple moisturizers, but just about everything breaks me out.\n\nThe ones I have tried:\n1) Mary and May Idebenone Moisturizer \n2) Soon Jung Etude House 10 Free Emulsion\n3) Sebamed Clear Gel (possibly the citric acid in it)\n4) InTree Tea Tree \n5) Beplain Cicaful Calming Gel\n6) Sidmool 100 Honey Moisture\n7) Neutrogena 72 Hours Moisturizer \n\nOther things which broke me out-\n1) TO alpha arbutin but Cos de Baha arbutin didn’t— just to cross out ingredients\n2) Numbuzin number 5+\n\n\nThings that don’t break me out- \n1) Iunik beta glucan serum \n2) Cosrx full fit propolis ampoule\n3) plain old glycerine \n4) Purito Daily soft touch sunscreen\n5) Cosrx snail mucin (not sure about this one)\n6) skin1004 Centella ampoule\n\nI was hoping to find a decent moisturizer to help my skin restore its barrier given I have to use tretinoin and azelaic acid every day. \nI have been using tretinoin for about 3 years now. I started off with 0.5 but recently realized that my skin doesn’t handle it especially when I am using azelaic acid along with it, so I moved to 0.025%. While this has helped keep those skin flakes at bay, my skin still feels dry and I have mild acne/texture all over my face. \nI’m open to recommendations for moisturizers, ampoules, or in-office treatment.\n\nThank you!!\n",

      "content": "So I need tips for my skincare! This is my very basic routine I currently have and honestly I don’t know anything about skincare. I have oily skin with some dry patches sometimes on my forehead. My nose is very very oily and has clogged pores. Like when I rub my nose the stuff in my pores fall out. I can’t even put foundation on my nose! It’s all patchy and looks bad. It used to look like that on my whole face but this face wash really helped. I exfoliate my face with a silicone scrubber. My skin is very sensitive and prone to eczema, the first bad flare I had my face was swollen. I was prescribed a cream for it and it got rid of the eczema. Some products I’ve tried have caused bad flares. So I can be scared of trying new products. I have bad dark circles under my eyes although there is no swelling, just darkness. My face is also pink but I wouldn’t classify it as rosacea, but my upper lip and chin aren’t pink so it’s like a mustache and goatee of my skin color haha. I wash my face in the shower which I know people don’t recommend but it makes it easier for me to do. I’m kind of lost on if the products I’m using are good and what products to add or change. If you can please give me some advice! I really dont have the money to go to a dermatologist. Thank you!\n\nTLDR: clueless on skincare, oily skin, clogged pores, sensitive skin prone to eczema. Need advice. Pictures are my current products",

      "content": "Could you advise me how to use this products in correct dosage to ensure I will not cause my skin any harm? I have oily skin with acne and a lot of scarring. Every little pimple is leaving a scar even if I am not touching or squeezing it.\n\nCURRENT ROUTINE: \n\nFace wash AM/PM\n1. Dermedic Hydrain3 Hialuro creamy cleansing gel\n2.  bean cleansing oil\n\nSPF\n1. Paula’s Choice Youth Extending Daily Hydrating Fluid SPF 50\n\nMoisturizer\n1. Cetaphil PS Lipoactive for dry and sensitive skin\n2. Avene Cicalfate+ repairing protective cream\n\nOnce or twice a week but never on the same week\n1. Ph Doctor RetinALL 0,05 by inti skin\n2. The ordinary salicylic acid 2% solution\n\nFor breakouts and as spot treatment\n1. The ordinary azelaic acid suspension 10%\n\nWhat works and what I think doesn’t: \nDOES HELP\n1. Salicylic acid and azelaic acid I think work well for me. I have used them in the past and they helped, the best for me was the previous formula of the ordinary salicylic acid.\n2. What did help but only temporarily are dermapen and acids treatments done by a certified skin professional. I have done many sessions and spent thousands on dermapen. The results were amazing and it did get rid of my scars. But after a few months acne came back and I have scars all over my cheeks and chin again. Doing these treatments every month would help but I would have to do that infinitely and they are very expensive and only give temporary results.\n\nDOES NOT HELP \n1. All retinols and retinals I have tried were causing breakouts and painful cystic acne even months into using it.\n2. Moisturizers I use I think are not great for my skin type. They make me very oily. I used to use snail mucin but it had a burning sensation and was not great for my skin.\n3. All dermatologists say that it’s acne vulgaris and no meds would help, they only give skin treatments based on benzoyl peroxide like Duac or Epiduo. They never work and I have tried multiple times. They only cause breakouts, my skin is very dry and sensitive and I am left with more scars and in worse condition every time after using it.\n\nNEW ROUTINE: \nThese are the products I want to incorporate in my skincare routine:\n1. The Ordinary Glucoside Foaming Cleanser – can be used daily, morning and evening\n2. The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG – can be used daily, morning and evening for eyes\n3. The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% – can be used daily, morning and evening\n4. The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% – use in the evening (not every day, may cause irritation)\n5. The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Masque – use once a week in the evening\n6. The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Beta Glucan – can be used daily, morning and evening\n7. La Roche Posay Effaclar H Iso-Biome (moisturizing cream) – can be used daily, morning and evening\n8. Avene Cleanance Aqua Gel (mattifying gel) – can be used daily, morning and evening on the entire face 9.Avene Cleanance Cleansing Mask – can be used 1–2 times a week, leave on for 5 minutes, then rinse off\n10. The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% – can be used daily, morning and evening\n\nWATCHOUTS: \nI know I should not use salicylic and azelaic acid together. As for Avene and Salicylic Acid masks - I think I will use them once a week and one week use the Avene one and the next week salicylic acid mask.\n\nWHY NEW ROUTINE:\nMy skin is sensitive so I don’t want to overdo it. I want to change my routine because over the last few months my skin has worsened. I have a lot of texture, bumps, whiteheads and scars. Every day I have at least one new pimple and they always leave scars and marks. All of the scars are bright red and even though I don’t have much inflammation it looks like I do because of my skin texture. I also want to finally deal with oily skin. My makeup looks bad and makes the texture very visible, it gets cakey after a few hours and just slides off my skin. I use Estée Lauder and setting powder so it’s not caused by bad makeup but by my skin.\n\nAny advice on this routine? Do you think it’s good? How can I make sure to not overdo it?\n\nI’m sorry for the long post! Wanted to share all context and products I have used",

      "content": "I’ll do my best not to write a novel. But I like to give as much info as possible, so apologies in advance. (3rd time trying to post this so hopefully it’s successful).\n\nI tried following the starting cg method in the google doc, and I don’t know that it’s going to work for my hair. But I need help figuring out what to do next. I have a tendency to get overwhelmed easily. \n\nMy hair started doing these little curls in the front when it would get wet from walking in the rain, high humidity, etc. out of no where (last picture). \n\nTHEN I noticed my hair is getting some waves while it’s wet in the shower after I wash. To my brain, I’m thinking, this doesn’t matter because it still always dries without texture. Then I stumble across this sub, and now my brain is like “maybe it’s not just breakage, maybe I’m also fighting frizz?” \n\n2nd to last pic is how my hair dries when absolutely no effort is made not even conditioner.\n\nIMPORTANT: I have a d-limonene allergy. It can lurk in fragrances causing most things to be hit or miss. But if something explicitly says it contains d-limonene anywhere in the ingredients, it’s a no go. \n\nAt moment I’m using OGX coconut curls. I got it before I noticed the waves because I like the way it smells and it surprisingly doesn’t irritate my allergy. But I think it is probably WAY too heavy for my hair. I’m almost out so now is a good time to ask for advice.\n\nI was looking at Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Bond Repair shampoo and conditioner. Would this be the right direction?\nPossibly their sea salt spray as well?\n\nI was also looking at OGX Locking + Coconut Curls Decadent Creamy Mousse in place of the mouse as a replacement for the Aussie gel as well? Unless this is also too heavy?\n\nQuick Points:\nI have fine hair but quite a bit of it. \n\nNo color or chemicals in my hair.\n\nAside from experimenting twice with the diffuser, I don’t use heat at all. \n\nMy hair dries fast with no conditioner. \nIt dries in a reasonable amount of time with conditioner that has been rinsed out. \nIt doesn’t seem to dry at all with the gel (at least not while plopped). \n\nI can’t handle the cowash or heavy product and I have to wash my hair a minimum of every other day lest I risk my crown follicles trying to murder me.\n\nI NEED sulfates or something similar enough. All the hypoallergenic shampoos I’ve tried are all sulfate free and my hair feels awful and my scalp doesn’t feel clean. \n\nBudget is somewhat important, I mostly stick with stuff I can find at my grocery/drug store (which does carry quite a large variety). \n\nI trimmed my hair a few weeks ago, but I know it probably needs more than that as it’s been horribly neglected and frequently thrown into ponytails. I probably need layers. Was thinking about the waterfall wolf cut by curl maven in that’s linked in the doc.\n\nBut any other advice or tips would be greatly appreciated! I’m at the end of my hair trying to figure this stuff out. If there are more questions to answer, I will be more than happy to. \n(If I take a while to respond, I probably fell sleep)\n\nRequired routine for posting even though I don’t have a set one yet:\nOGX coconut curls shampoo and conditioner.\nAussie wavy leave-in. Air dry. I’ve stopped using the Aussie gel at the moment.",

      "content": "4th and 5th image are the exfoliants I used (i cant rember how much I used the second one)\nThe first image was my skin before using store bought chemical exfoliants, I had some very mild acne on my forehead, cheeks and chin, it was making me extremely insecure. Looking back on it now, it really wasn't that bad. This is much worse. The products instructions read to use twice a day, I did so for maybe a week? Or two? And then I took the second image (which was originally a video hence the poor quality) after stopping exfoliating because my face burned, you can see the grooves in my face, lines from exfoliating. Now those are gone after 4 whole months (now) but I am left with this orange peel texture (in the third picture), just look at the difference in the first and third photo. Ive ruined my skin, I hate myself more than l'd ever hated myself before, I look like I have the skin of a 60 year old and I'm only 17. What makes this worse is l've struggled with BDD my whole life, and I was just starting to get used to my appearance and now l've gone and erased all the progress I had made seeking out the clear skin that I already had.\n\nIve tried all kinds of things: When I first discovered the damage I used dove soap only on my face dor maybe a week or less \n\nThen I changed to just water and sunscreen until things got a little better \n\nThen I tried: All natural skincare: aloe Vera, 100% rose water for cleansing +CeraveAM Acenecide to clean out the pores hoping they'd be more likely to close \n\nInsane moisturising regime(recently made my face hot and burn): \nAcenecide beforehand Vichy mineral 89 + CervaPM + Cerave inthe tub\n\n\nIt has been 4 months between the 2nd and 3rd picture and there's been barely any change. Im starting to think this is permanent. I was honestly so stupid to use these in the first place and not think twice about how they could damade mv skin esneciall when the instructions\n\ntold me to overuse. I really didn't need these products, my skin was practically perfect, making the consequences hurt even more because this really is the fault of my own stupidity and insecurity.\n\nIm desperate. I can't go into school. I can't look at myself without my heart sinking. I honestly don't think I can live looking like this, I sound insane but this has got me contemplating suicide almost everyday. I really need some advice and some reassurance that my skin will go back to normal.",

This made me think I have a damaged skin barrier, however whenever I've had any damaged skin barriers in the past, I've usually cured it through 2-3 times application of SebaMed Clear Gel. However, this time this application didnt really help, and im still struggling with extremely burning and tightness, and big pimples due to damaged skin barrier. I used to usually wake up with oil on my face but now i wake up with complete dry skin, hence I've stopped morning washes. I then heard that CebHydra moisturizer is really helpful. Using that religiously, but even that's not working. Its been over a week now and I don't know what to do. Ive stopped applying sunscreen as well, as it burns when I do so. My eyebrows have started to shed skin and it looks like I have eyebrow dandruff😃 Could yall give any advice or share your experience? It would be really helpful!",

But since I got a defective piece right away, I’m worried that even the replacement might not last long.\n\nI mainly bought this one because it comes with a diffuser head—I’ve never tried diffusing before, and I have wavy, frizzy hair, so I was hoping it would help tame my curls and reduce frizz.\n\nSo now I’m wondering—\n👉 Should I stick with the replacement and give it another try?\n👉 Or should I return it and go for a different dryer altogether?\n\nWould really appreciate any experiences or suggestions—especially if anyone here has used the AGARO HD-1120 or another good low-wattage dryer with a diffuser!\n",

Tried all sorts of things (went as far as trying two different antibiotics and when that didn’t work, chemical peelings). What ultimately cleared it up was changing my routine to the selfless by hyram combo + occasionally using Paula’s choice BHA 2% exfoliant.\n\nNow, I’m getting very annoyed at the green washing and random price rises at selfless by hyram - so I’d like to change to another brand. I don’t know a lot about skincare, but I’m looking for a gentle cleanser and would probably buy whatever moisturizer is sold along with it. The cleanser would ideally be a little less stripping as well, as the gel cleanser I use now does leave my skin very dry and tight if I would skip/forget moisturizing. I have combination skin and am still prone to break-outs (although not nearly as bad as they used to be), so I’m a bit anxious about changing my routine.\n\nAny advice? I might try LRP toleriane hydrating gentle cleanser, so also feel free to lmk if that could be a good alternative!\n\nI’m in Europe btw.\n\nThanks a lot 🙏",

      "content": "So I need tips for my skincare! This is my very basic routine I currently have and honestly I don’t know anything about skincare. I have oily skin with some dry patches sometimes on my forehead. My nose is very very oily and has clogged pores. Like when I rub my nose the stuff in my pores fall out. I can’t even put foundation on my nose! It’s all patchy and looks bad. It used to look like that on my whole face but this face wash really helped. I exfoliate my face with a silicone scrubber. My skin is very sensitive and prone to eczema, the first bad flare I had my face was swollen. I was prescribed a cream for it and it got rid of the eczema. Some products I’ve tried have caused bad flares. So I can be scared of trying new products. I have bad dark circles under my eyes although there is no swelling, just darkness. My face is also pink but I wouldn’t classify it as rosacea, but my upper lip and chin aren’t pink so it’s like a mustache and goatee of my skin color haha. I wash my face in the shower which I know people don’t recommend but it makes it easier for me to do. I’m kind of lost on if the products I’m using are good and what products to add or change. If you can please give me some advice! I really dont have the money to go to a dermatologist. Thank you!\n\nTLDR: clueless on skincare, oily skin, clogged pores, sensitive skin prone to eczema. Need advice. Pictures are my current products",
