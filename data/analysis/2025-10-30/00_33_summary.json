      "content": "Hey everyone 👋\n\n26M here. I recently saw my dermatologist and they suggested trying Skinoren 20% (Azelaic Acid) for my mild acne and post-inflammatory erythema (PIE).\n\nA bit of background:\n\n\t•\tI’ve never had acne before until recently — everything started after a really stressful period and almost no sleep for a few days.\n\n\t•\tSince then, I’ve been dealing with small whiteheads and pustules, mostly on my cheeks and around my nose.\n\n\t•\tMy skin is also quite sensitive because I probably damaged my barrier when I tried too many actives at once (vitamin C, BHA, niacinamide, etc.).\n\n\t•\tI stopped all that and switched to a very gentle routine: CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser, CeraVe Moisturizer, and sometimes a hydrating toner.\n\nMy dermatologist said Azelaic Acid might help calm inflammation, even out my skin tone, and reduce new breakouts\n\n👉 Has anyone here used Skinoren 20% for mild acne and PIE, especially on sensitive skin?\n\n\t•\tHow long did it take before you noticed results?\n\n\t•\tDid you go through a purge or initial irritation?\n\n\t•\tAny tips on how to layer it with moisturizer (before or after)?\n\nI’m a bit nervous to start because my skin finally feels calmer, but I still get small recurring pustules at the same spots.\n\nWould love to hear your experiences or advice 🙏\n",

I'm thinking it was a combination of diffuse thinning + stress? So anyway, I hopped on topical min for a year, I feel like it helped a little?   \n  \nUnfortunately I dropped my phone in the sea where I had most of my progress pictures month by month. But yeah, you can see what my hair looked like when I started min in August 2024. And the next picture is from August 2025. It was drastically thicker and more volume overall. But as expected, min did as much as it could and growth stopped at some level.   \n  \nI'm 30 now and always had long hair most of my life, so my goal is to have the hair I had at 25. I gave myself a buzz cut on 1st of August this year and added %0.1 topical fin, 3x / week dermastamps at 0.6mm and keto shampoo.   \n  \nRest of the pictures with short hair are from today, after being on the new regimen for 3 months. I feel like I'm experiencing great increase in volume &amp; baby hair popping up all over.   \n  \nObviously its different hair length but it's shorter, so it must show the scalp even more? \n\nI took the pictures in the same room, at the same spot and time of the day to have the same natural light.   \n  \nIs this regrowth or am I imagining it? What do you guys think? Before anyone asks, I've experienced zero sides so far. at some point in the future I could switch to pills as well. ",

Been trying to re-introduce BHA but my skin barrier was damaged it seems so I’m having to be really careful. I’ve been healing the barrier with a gentle oil cleanser and then using a mild gel cleanser to double cleanse, gel moisturiser and nothing else. That has really helped heal what used to be big red angry breakouts. Now it’s just a lot of congestion (blackheads and whiteheads that don’t surface and don’t go away on their own) but I just seriously can’t stand there being ‘stuff’ in my skin. I’m really struggling to leave it alone so thinking the best thing might be to go get a facial and deal with it properly and safely to hopefully just reset my skin. Could anyone please please recommend somewhere in London? Thank you, I’m really at my wits end with all this tbh and I’ve never had a facial before so I really appreciate any recommendations",

Brushes are only good for clumping if I can get enough tension. I just wish the notches were bigger, sometimes it separates too much. Finger curling takes eons. I genuinely have tried everything for the last 2 years. The best i can do is redo the secions I don't like or that I just want different and atp I cba. It's pointless lmao. Next time I'll put this chi heat resistant hairspray on top of everything and see if that helps with the low porosity back top roots that just can't soak anything up as much as the rest of my hair. And yes this is my hair after styling straight from the shower. 🤷‍♀️\n\nI've also tried adding a little extra gel after using a hair towel to get extra water out after the initial gel-ing. Plopping is nothing but a waste of time. I'd say doing so prior to styling helps absorb moisture from the shower and leave in though but after styling it doesn't help me any. My gel is not the issue it holds great. My hair is just stupid and annoying as far as consistency goes.\n\nI'm kinda complaining but mostly I find it funny lol.",

Because of that, I usually steer clear of anything with shea butter or heavier, oily textures.\n\nRight now I’m torn between the Rhode Barrier Restore Cream, Avène Cicalfate, and La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5. The only serum I use is the Skin1004 Madagascar Ampoule (the clear one with niacinamide), both morning and night, so I’m hoping to find a cream that offers a little extra benefit beyond basic moisture.\n\nThanks so much!\n",
