It's always flat at the top and all the hairs clump together\n2. I get ropey waves\n\nSeparating them does nothing other than turn them in skinnier ropes waves and it just looks like I have dreads.\n\nI know my hair can not do this, as it's happened before, and that's because it was the 2nd day, I steamed my curls in the shower and ran my wet hands through them. Unfortunately no photo since it was a once in a lifetime experience I'm sorry.\n\nI don't know why we need to submit a routine just for basic help considering nobody knows wtf products we use if we're not from the US but hey! here you go:\n\n1. Sulkin volumising conditioner (protein) or garnier watermelon conditioner \n2. Redwon teatree shampoo (clarifier) or garnier watermelon shampoo\n3. vo5 megahold gel\n4. sometimes a leave-in conditioner on the ends\n\nOther methods I've tried:\n\n1. Scrunching conditioner in the shower upside down (no)\n2. Only using gel on the ends/mids (no)\n3. Not diffusing my hair (no)\n4. Diffusing my hair (no)\n5. Deep conditioning my hair (no)\n6. Not conditioning my hair at all, just shampoo &amp; gel (no)\n7. Separating my curls when wet or dry (no)\n\nWhat can be done 😭",

      "content": "My son has beautiful curly hair but it’s very fine and gets frizzy and tangly so easily. Is there any way to keep his curls mostly intact overnight? I’ve tried a bonnet, but they typically slip off his head while he’s sleeping so now I do a loose bun on top of his head. Sometimes in the morning, I can take out the bun, wet the hair that gets frizzy around his face and it’ll do in a pinch. If I want the curls to look nice again though, I completely wet it with water and leave in conditioner and comb it out. This definitely works, but I feel bad sending him to school with damp hair, especially in the colder months. Are there any other options to keep his curls overnight or to refresh them in the morning without getting his hair completely wet? Any suggestions would be so appreciated!\n\nI have straight hair and my husband has much thicker curly hair so these types of curls are new to him too so we’re both trying our best to learn as we go.\n\n(The first picture is of his hair still a little damp and freshly washed and the second picture shows his hair let down from sleeping in a bun and fixed up as much as I could without starting from scratch)\n\nOur wash routine: We wash with Honest shampoo and conditioner, then use finger comb through a bit of Alaffia leave in conditioner and let air dry. \n",

Ive always had parts of my hair that were a little more curly but its gotten worse. Here's some info in case any of this is important:\n\n*I'm mixed (half black, half white) &amp; in my 40s.\n*I do straighten my hair sometimes using a Chi Lava plate straightener which is at 250 degrees &amp; always use heat protectant.\n\nRoutine: I don't always use the same products &amp; don't always use a diffuser, but this was my routine today when these pix were taken. However this is an issue no matter what the routine is. \n\nSol de Janiero shampoo, Garnier Fructis Sleek conditioner in the shower. Sprayed a little conditioner/water mix &amp; used a detangling comb for detangling. Small amount of Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine for heat protection. Mizani True Textures Curls, Coils &amp; Waves for definition. Diffused until mostly dry (had to go somewhere &amp; was running late) with a TGIBedhead diffuser (dont know the name but its the one thats JUST a diffuser) on medium heat &amp; high speed.\n\n I'm including pix that show my whole head of hair also so you can get an idea how the majority looks vs the problem areas. I've spent my entire life figuring out how to work with my hair &amp; its still a work in progress so please be nice 🙏🏼. All pix are from today since I needed to include the routine. I would love to know any tips on getting the curl texture back or making them look better. Thanks in advance. ",

I just got engaged and I hate how red my hands are and I don't want it to ruin any pics. I talked to my derm and she suggested vascular laser treatment but its $4500 and insurance won't cover it. I'd love to try other remedies before resorting to that if possible. From my research, using Ordinary's Lactic Acid 10% or Topicals 'Faded' Brightening and Clearing serum might help. Do you guys recommend one over the other for getting this cleared up within a few months, or have any other suggestions? I'm going to start using sunscreen on my hands daily to help prevent it from darkening further too!",

Plus, a lot of my products are good and made for sensitive skin, which I have (dry/sensitive, a bit of acne, texture, and uneven tone). They also said my skin is dehydrated.\n\nI get that there’s a sales aspect to it, but implying that only what they sell will work feels extreme.

I am in my 40's and have been trying to combat wrinkled hands for over 3 years. \n\nI have used a variety of products from aquaphor, trentinoin, Nivea, La Roche Posay, DIY hand scrubs, Ponds, other body lotion and creams, Castor Oil, Coconut oil, etc. \n\nThese are all great for moisturizing, but not so great at reducing my wrinkles. I am thinking of buying Mary Kay Satin Hand set again. I bought this 15+ years ago and I feel like it really helped my hands. Before buying this again, can anyone tell me if this has helped to decrease the appearance of wrinkles. \n\nOr do you have other recommendations? I can't afford expensive beauty products. If you have something in mind that is less than $50, please send the product info to me and let me know how long it took for you to see results. ",

I hydrate, I moisturize, I’m currently on hydroquinone, and I use AHA/BHA peels twice a week.\n\nI don’t know what else to do to tackle these scars and hyperpigmentation together?

Also the last two photos is what my skin just looked like a year ago. \n\nAround like 7-8 months ago my skin started gaining this really weird texture. The two best ways I can describe it are like a woven basket or also like dried glue.\n\nI wear moisturizer (Malezia) every day- I put it on every morning and evening and sometimes mid day if my face is a little dry. I wear sunscreen every day (Tizo. Mineral sunscreen tinted). I don’t use like actives. I used to use this retinol called Aklief and honestly my skin was so good during that time, but my insurance stopped covering it and my skin hates tretinoin. I also drink so much water during the day and use a humidifier. \n\nI know people will say it’s pores it’s normal but I’m sorry this isn’t just pores. I’ve always had bigger pores and they do not look like this. These look like super dry but I don’t know how they could be?? So yeah, also my face doesn’t feel dry either. \n\nI’ve gone to the dermatologist to ask about this and she literally told me straight up.. oh yeah that is really odd. Doesn’t look normal, let me take a picture of it so I can show my team. But when she got back to me she was like essentially we aren’t sure but use vitamin c serum. \n\nGuys I just want to know if anyone’s dealt with this before and how you helped it :(? ",

However, that has allll changed recently.\n\nI started a new medication, lamictal, and it has drastically increased oil production on my face. I now am dealing with clogged pores and small, raised, flesh colored bumps that sometimes have plug/tiny hair come out. My skin texture looks horrific. I’m devastated. I’ve worked years on finding the perfect combo of skincare products for my skin and I feel so helpless bc I know nothinggg about oily skin.\n\nMy current skin care routine is as shown in the picture as well as what the breakouts look like. I prefer to keep using tretinoin and azaleic acid since I’m 35 and have sun spots and wrinkles. I did recently stop both for a few weeks bc I thought it was my skin barrier but started back up the last 2 weeks since I noticed it was oil related.\n\nWhat should I change and how can I get the oil under control? I don’t want to change medication but it is really effecting my self esteem and confidence. TIA!",

However, that has allll changed recently.\n\nI started a new medication, lamictal, and it has drastically increased oil production on my face. I now am dealing with clogged pores and small, raised, flesh colored bumps that sometimes have plug/tiny hair come out. My skin texture looks horrific. I’m devastated. I’ve worked years on finding the perfect combo of skincare products for my skin and I feel so helpless bc I know nothinggg about oily skin.\n\nMy current skin care routine is as shown in the picture as well as what the breakouts look like. I prefer to keep using tretinoin and azaleic acid since I’m 35 and have sun spots and wrinkles. I did recently stop both for a few weeks bc I thought it was my skin barrier but started back up the last 2 weeks since I noticed it was oil related.\n\nWhat should I change and how can I get the oil under control? I don’t want to change medication but it is really effecting my self esteem and confidence. TIA!",
