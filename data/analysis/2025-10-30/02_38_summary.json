      "content": "Not sponsored or anything, just wanted to share because I’ve been seeing a lot of posts lately about dry winter skin and eczema. My skin always freaks out once the cold hits. It gets tight, flaky, red and sometimes even burns around my nose and cheeks. I also get mild eczema, so most creams either sting or make it worse.\n\nA while back I came across this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1oclgol/ive\\_had\\_eczema\\_my\\_whole\\_life\\_here\\_are\\_8\\_things/](https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1oclgol/ive_had_eczema_my_whole_life_here_are_8_things/). The person wrote about their long journey with eczema and how they finally got it under control, and in the edit they mentioned that the moisturizer that helped them was the Mudmasky leave me on winter mask. I remembered getting a Mudmasky product in one of my Ipsy bags a long time ago (can’t remember which one), so I figured I’d give this one a try. I also saw it has the National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance, which made me feel a bit safer testing it out.\n\nI’ve been using it for about a week now and honestly it’s been really good. It feels more like a light barrier than a heavy cream. My face doesn’t sting when I go outside anymore and I wake up without that dry tight feeling. Even the eczema patches around my mouth have calmed down a lot. What I dodnt like is that the tube is super small.\n\nObviously everyone’s skin is different, but this has been the first thing in a while that actually made a difference for me during winter. Just thought I’d share since winter skin and eczema posts are everywhere right now and this one actually helped me for once.",

I switched that last year once her curls came in more, because I noticed her dove baby shampoo made her hair extremely dry looking. \n\nWhen I need to style it, I wet it and use “Devacurl” Styling cream, and occasionally “Not Your Mothers” freeze gel for flyaways on hairstyles. A family friend recommended both of these styling products, she showed me how she does the cream and then put gel onto the curls, I just cannot execute it properly, I need more practice. \n\n\nHer hair gets SO frizzy. I am waiting for payday to order her silk bed set (she doesn’t always use pillows lol), she will NOT tolerate a silk cap to wear overnight since she is only 2.5 years old.\n\nShould I be putting product in her hair immediately after a bath? Something for overnight to help it be less frizzy? \n\nIs there a certain way to dry her hair after a bath? I currently scrunch some water out with a towel, brush it then let it air dry. \n\nHow much of curly hair is truly trial and error? I do not have the funds to be constantly trying new products just for them to not work, but if that’s what I need to do to get the most healthiest hair that’s what I will do. ",

      "content": "Hello everyone!   \n  \nI started using topical min last year when my hair was in a pretty bad shape. It got so bad so fast. I'm thinking it was a combination of diffuse thinning + stress? So anyway, I hopped on topical min for a year, I feel like it helped a little?   \n  \nUnfortunately I dropped my phone in the sea where I had most of my progress pictures month by month. But yeah, you can see what my hair looked like when I started min in August 2024. And the next picture is from August 2025. It was drastically thicker and more volume overall. But as expected, min did as much as it could and growth stopped at some level.   \n  \nI'm 30 now and always had long hair most of my life, so my goal is to have the hair I had at 25. I gave myself a buzz cut on 1st of August this year and added %0.1 topical fin, 3x / week dermastamps at 0.6mm and keto shampoo.   \n  \nRest of the pictures with short hair are from today, after being on the new regimen for 3 months. I feel like I'm experiencing great increase in volume &amp; baby hair popping up all over.   \n  \nObviously its different hair length but it's shorter, so it must show the scalp even more? \n\nI took the pictures in the same room, at the same spot and time of the day to have the same natural light.   \n  \nIs this regrowth or am I imagining it? What do you guys think? Before anyone asks, I've experienced zero sides so far. at some point in the future I could switch to pills as well. ",

Been trying to re-introduce BHA but my skin barrier was damaged it seems so I’m having to be really careful. I’ve been healing the barrier with a gentle oil cleanser and then using a mild gel cleanser to double cleanse, gel moisturiser and nothing else. That has really helped heal what used to be big red angry breakouts. Now it’s just a lot of congestion (blackheads and whiteheads that don’t surface and don’t go away on their own) but I just seriously can’t stand there being ‘stuff’ in my skin. I’m really struggling to leave it alone so thinking the best thing might be to go get a facial and deal with it properly and safely to hopefully just reset my skin. Could anyone please please recommend somewhere in London? Thank you, I’m really at my wits end with all this tbh and I’ve never had a facial before so I really appreciate any recommendations",

And I’m not sure if that is due to postpartum hair issues or if it’s because with kids I can’t afford nice salon grade shampoo and conditioner. For some reason lately my hair turns into a giant rats nest by end of day on its first day after washing and I end up having to comb it out which kills my curls. It just feels fried and tangled all of the time. I’m 95% sure this is the shampoo/conditioner I’m using because I first notice signs that it will happen just based on how it feels in the shower. What will rehydrate me and give my hair some slip so it’s not just knotting up?? \n\nShampoo and conditioner have been ever changing since I switched to drugstore but my current routine is:\n1. For shampoo I recently finished using the last of my Klorane for sensitive scalp (this is when things started getting much worse) and started using ogx coconut curls.\nCurrent conditioner is half ogx coconut curls and half ogx rosemary mint. \n(I used to swear by ogx in high school but maybe the quality changed in the decade since??) I also tried native but it turned by hair to straw!\n\n2. For products I use redkin anti-snap treatment (I absolutely swear by this and my hairdresser is always amazed by my lack of split ends despite having very long hair). I also use ogx coconut milk serum, and living proof curl definer. \n\n3. I squeeze out water as I put in product. Then plop with a microfiber towel. After that I air dry. I NEVER put heat on my hair!\n\n4. Satin pillowcases\n\n\nHelppppppppp!!!!",

      "content": "* EDIT - transformation pictures are at the bottom of the text, I forgot to add them earlier :(\n\nI know this might not be the craziest of the transformations on here (keep in mind it's only been 3 weeks), but I decided to share it with you since it may help some of you and give you a possible alternative to all these medicines such as Minoxidil, Finasteride (Fin), Dutasteride, and others that, when stopped, cause the hair to start falling out again. I never really noticed it before, but the hair on the back of my head has always been a bit thinner, with a few spots that looked less dense than the rest, and this was pointed out by my barber. So I panicked and began to search for solutions, came across many serums and treatments that contained either Minoxidil, Finasteride, or other medications that were prescription-only, so I opted for red light therapy instead. And I know a lot of you think red light therapy is super expensive because of brands like CurrentBody, FolliconLab, Foreo, or HigherDose (I know some of them use laser technology, but devices from these brands cost anywhere from $400 to $800). The one I am using is from Noravele. Now, it has to be used while connected to a charger, which is very annoying in my opinion, and there is only one fit with no adjustments (for me it's fine since I have a bit bigger head, so I don't mind it at all), but it uses the same wavelengths and has the same number of LEDs as all the premium brands for less than half the price. As mentioned on the website, I used the hat for 10 minutes every day for about 3 weeks, and the spots that were less dense and thinner have improved a lot. Even with a shorter haircut, the results are visible. Now, I’m not a specialist or anything like that, so please make sure to do your own research on red light therapy and see if it’s suitable for your situation or any medical condition you might have before buying any device. Also, take laser-based devices into consideration as well, even though they’re usually more expensive, they might be a better fit for some people. I’ll keep you guys updated on how things go over the next few weeks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lc6s55dvt4yf1.jpg?width=646&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6b7ca43462b914e4b37ecdab9643ea6eec226ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4pv646dvt4yf1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45f46540e7b4a0e6112b6b944e86cc2a433b0646",
