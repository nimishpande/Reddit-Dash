I get ropey waves\n\nSeparating them does nothing other than turn them in skinnier ropes waves and it just looks like I have dreads.\n\nI know my hair can not do this, as it's happened before, and that's because it was the 2nd day, I steamed my curls in the shower and ran my wet hands through them. Unfortunately no photo since it was a once in a lifetime experience I'm sorry.\n\nI don't know why we need to submit a routine just for basic help considering nobody knows wtf products we use if we're not from the US but hey! here you go:\n\n1. Sulkin volumising conditioner (protein) or garnier watermelon conditioner \n2. Redwon teatree shampoo (clarifier) or garnier watermelon shampoo\n3. vo5 megahold gel\n4. sometimes a leave-in conditioner on the ends\n\nOther methods I've tried:\n\n1. Scrunching conditioner in the shower upside down (no)\n2. Only using gel on the ends/mids (no)\n3. Not diffusing my hair (no)\n4. Diffusing my hair (no)\n5. Deep conditioning my hair (no)\n6. Not conditioning my hair at all, just shampoo &amp; gel (no)\n7. Separating my curls when wet or dry (no)\n\nWhat can be done 😭",

Ive always had parts of my hair that were a little more curly but its gotten worse. Here's some info in case any of this is important:\n\n*I'm mixed (half black, half white) &amp; in my 40s.\n*I do straighten my hair sometimes using a Chi Lava plate straightener which is at 250 degrees &amp; always use heat protectant.\n\nRoutine: I don't always use the same products &amp; don't always use a diffuser, but this was my routine today when these pix were taken. However this is an issue no matter what the routine is. \n\nSol de Janiero shampoo, Garnier Fructis Sleek conditioner in the shower. Sprayed a little conditioner/water mix &amp; used a detangling comb for detangling. Small amount of Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine for heat protection. Mizani True Textures Curls, Coils &amp; Waves for definition. Diffused until mostly dry (had to go somewhere &amp; was running late) with a TGIBedhead diffuser (dont know the name but its the one thats JUST a diffuser) on medium heat &amp; high speed.\n\n I'm including pix that show my whole head of hair also so you can get an idea how the majority looks vs the problem areas. I've spent my entire life figuring out how to work with my hair &amp; its still a work in progress so please be nice 🙏🏼. All pix are from today since I needed to include the routine. I would love to know any tips on getting the curl texture back or making them look better. Thanks in advance. ",

This time I saw this \"Blue light\" one was on offer on Zepto and thought to myself \"oh wow, how nice\" and decided to give this a try because I had a good experience with the original one. Huge mistake. \n\nFirst of all, nowhere on the packaging have they mentioned that this is a tinted sunscreen, I went and bought this completely unaware of this. \n\nSecond, once you apply this on your face it will give you the worst white cast you've ever seen, it might put Casper the ghost to shame, it's so hard to blend and it will take you a very long time to get it to settle down. You have to pay attention to areas like your eyebrows and the corner of your lips to make sure this is blended otherwise someone might mistake it for unblended concealer.\n\nAfter probably 20-30 minutes it will start looking somewhat normal on your face. \n\nI would not recommend this to even my worst enemy. \n \n",

I use the stuff in this order from left to right. I wash my face with the detergent, then put on the exfoliator stuff and let that dry for idk 30 sec. Then I put on the vitamin C serum, then the pro-retionol cream and lastly the moisturizer (idk why I picked one with Q10 I have 0 clue)\n\nI was thinking about ordering the stuff everyone talks about by the ordinary or whatever but I decided to pick something at the store first as a start and might order later on.\n\nIs this ok as a routine and how often should I use the stuff? Once a day or in the morning and in the evening? And would you say this will help me with my goal for my skin?\n\nThank you very much for any help/comment much love.",

I have curly hair so this isnt a surprise as such. \n\nThe middle back however, seems to be both. It seems to curl near the root and stick out dead straight mid curl. This area matts like crazy. Its matted every morning when he wakes up and no matter how ‘neat’ we get it before we leave home, the back of his head rubs on the car seat/pram/jacket and immediately seems to matt and stick out horizontally from the curl near the roots again.\n\nWe love his curls and longer hair but he just looks so messy and unkempt. \n\nWe wash it with a gentle baby shampoo and I use argon oil before trying to brush it. I say ‘trying’ because he’s two, its not easy to do alot of brushing!\n\nAny thoughts on how to stop this? He’s only two, so hopefully nothing too complex but we’d really prefer not to cut it short",

Do you just wash it with shampoo and let it dry right before going? My hair is like ultra dry so that really only makes it worse usually.\n\nI've been to a couple hair salons but usually it's the same issues and my hair always comes out in much worse shape than before.\n\nMy current wash routine once a week:\n\nWet the hair thoroughly, put in shampoo and rub the scalp, wash it out, put it conditioner, wait 5-10 minutes (sort of a hair mask light honestly), comb it with a wide toothed comb while the conditioner gives it slip getting some breakage often due to knots, wash it out then wring it out a little, put in a leave in conditioner while still wet and comb it out again this time I don't get any breakage, put a tshirt on my hair but I don't tie it up or anything it's mostly just to keep my wet hair off my body while I do skincare like lotion and also my face, then I take the tshirt off and put argan oil in my hands and run them through my hair to coat it and then I let it air dry.\n\nDaily I wet my hands with water and run my fingers through my hair to wet it a little and then I do the same with argan oil to coat them again. Getting some snapping the process too.\n\nAlso my hair really sucks like it's always frizzy and dry no matter what I do, So I guess general help would be appreciated too.",

Overall, the skin on my body is normal, not dry and not oily. I used to go to the gym 2–3 times a week and never had any pimples on my body, but now that I’ve increased my activity level, I’ve started getting reddish pimples on my chest. They don’t have whiteheads, but still look awful. In addition, there are some closed comedones.\n\nI tried the CeraVe cleanser with salicylic acid, but it doesn’t help, even though I’ve been using it for more than two months.

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
