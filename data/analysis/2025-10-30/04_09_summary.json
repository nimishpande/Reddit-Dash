A family friend recommended both of these styling products, she showed me how she does the cream and then put gel onto the curls, I just cannot execute it properly, I need more practice. \n\n\nHer hair gets SO frizzy. I am waiting for payday to order her silk bed set (she doesn’t always use pillows lol), she will NOT tolerate a silk cap to wear overnight since she is only 2.5 years old.\n\nShould I be putting product in her hair immediately after a bath? Something for overnight to help it be less frizzy? \n\nIs there a certain way to dry her hair after a bath? I currently scrunch some water out with a towel, brush it then let it air dry. \n\nHow much of curly hair is truly trial and error? I do not have the funds to be constantly trying new products just for them to not work, but if that’s what I need to do to get the most healthiest hair that’s what I will do. ",

      "content": "Hello everyone!   \n  \nI started using topical min last year when my hair was in a pretty bad shape. It got so bad so fast. I'm thinking it was a combination of diffuse thinning + stress? So anyway, I hopped on topical min for a year, I feel like it helped a little?   \n  \nUnfortunately I dropped my phone in the sea where I had most of my progress pictures month by month. But yeah, you can see what my hair looked like when I started min in August 2024. And the next picture is from August 2025. It was drastically thicker and more volume overall. But as expected, min did as much as it could and growth stopped at some level.   \n  \nI'm 30 now and always had long hair most of my life, so my goal is to have the hair I had at 25. I gave myself a buzz cut on 1st of August this year and added %0.1 topical fin, 3x / week dermastamps at 0.6mm and keto shampoo.   \n  \nRest of the pictures with short hair are from today, after being on the new regimen for 3 months. I feel like I'm experiencing great increase in volume &amp; baby hair popping up all over.   \n  \nObviously its different hair length but it's shorter, so it must show the scalp even more? \n\nI took the pictures in the same room, at the same spot and time of the day to have the same natural light.   \n  \nIs this regrowth or am I imagining it? What do you guys think? Before anyone asks, I've experienced zero sides so far. at some point in the future I could switch to pills as well. ",

      "content": "I’m struggling hardcore with my hair right now. My hair is long and thick. Currently it’s like a 2b/2c but at its best it was more of a 3a. It’s best was before having kids. And I’m not sure if that is due to postpartum hair issues or if it’s because with kids I can’t afford nice salon grade shampoo and conditioner. For some reason lately my hair turns into a giant rats nest by end of day on its first day after washing and I end up having to comb it out which kills my curls. It just feels fried and tangled all of the time. I’m 95% sure this is the shampoo/conditioner I’m using because I first notice signs that it will happen just based on how it feels in the shower. What will rehydrate me and give my hair some slip so it’s not just knotting up?? \n\nShampoo and conditioner have been ever changing since I switched to drugstore but my current routine is:\n1. For shampoo I recently finished using the last of my Klorane for sensitive scalp (this is when things started getting much worse) and started using ogx coconut curls.\nCurrent conditioner is half ogx coconut curls and half ogx rosemary mint. \n(I used to swear by ogx in high school but maybe the quality changed in the decade since??) I also tried native but it turned by hair to straw!\n\n2. For products I use redkin anti-snap treatment (I absolutely swear by this and my hairdresser is always amazed by my lack of split ends despite having very long hair). I also use ogx coconut milk serum, and living proof curl definer. \n\n3. I squeeze out water as I put in product. Then plop with a microfiber towel. After that I air dry. I NEVER put heat on my hair!\n\n4. Satin pillowcases\n\n\nHelppppppppp!!!!",

I am a 34 year old man and never had a skin care regimen outside of a basic face wash and sometimes moisturizer if my skin was dry but I can see myself getting older and some minor lines. I want to be proactive about this. I am planning to start a regimen that includes vanicream cleanser, tretinoin, GHK-Cu and vanicream moisturizer but there are so many brands for these items. Any help on which brands to go with would be very appreciated. Thanks so much.",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
