Sulkin volumising conditioner (protein) or garnier watermelon conditioner \n2.

      "content": "Hello everyone!   \n  \nI started using topical min last year when my hair was in a pretty bad shape. It got so bad so fast. I'm thinking it was a combination of diffuse thinning + stress? So anyway, I hopped on topical min for a year, I feel like it helped a little?   \n  \nUnfortunately I dropped my phone in the sea where I had most of my progress pictures month by month. But yeah, you can see what my hair looked like when I started min in August 2024. And the next picture is from August 2025. It was drastically thicker and more volume overall. But as expected, min did as much as it could and growth stopped at some level.   \n  \nI'm 30 now and always had long hair most of my life, so my goal is to have the hair I had at 25. I gave myself a buzz cut on 1st of August this year and added %0.1 topical fin, 3x / week dermastamps at 0.6mm and keto shampoo.   \n  \nRest of the pictures with short hair are from today, after being on the new regimen for 3 months. I feel like I'm experiencing great increase in volume &amp; baby hair popping up all over.   \n  \nObviously its different hair length but it's shorter, so it must show the scalp even more? \n\nI took the pictures in the same room, at the same spot and time of the day to have the same natural light.   \n  \nIs this regrowth or am I imagining it? What do you guys think? Before anyone asks, I've experienced zero sides so far. at some point in the future I could switch to pills as well. ",

A family friend recommended both of these styling products, she showed me how she does the cream and then put gel onto the curls, I just cannot execute it properly, I need more practice. \n\n\nHer hair gets SO frizzy. I am waiting for payday to order her silk bed set (she doesn‚Äôt always use pillows lol), she will NOT tolerate a silk cap to wear overnight since she is only 2.5 years old.\n\nShould I be putting product in her hair immediately after a bath? Something for overnight to help it be less frizzy? \n\nIs there a certain way to dry her hair after a bath? I currently scrunch some water out with a towel, brush it then let it air dry. \n\nHow much of curly hair is truly trial and error?

      "content": "Hello everyone! I am 25F and I am worried my current (newish) skin routine is absolutely destroying my skin. I have honestly never struggled with acne or textured skin in my entire life. To be truthful, I‚Äôm honestly blessed with fairly decent skin and never had to any intense routines.\n\nMy previous routine was extremely simple, I only washed my face with CeraVe Foaming Cleanser when I wore makeup and then moisturized with CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion. That‚Äôs it.\n\nI wanted to venture out and see if I could have my skin looking even better, and have my makeup look nicer as well, since I do have pretty dry skin with occasional hormonal breakouts. \n\nMy new routine is:\n1. Mixsoon Bean Oil Cleanser\n2. Mixsoon Centella Cleansing Foam\n3. *Occasionally* Glycolic Acid as toner \n3. Bubble Cosmic Silk Toner\n4. Mixsoon Bean Essence\n\nAm I just overloading my face with product? I‚Äôm not sure whether to think it‚Äôs my skin purging, or it‚Äôs just not reacting right. I have been doing this routine for about a month now and my skin has been continuously breaking out and becoming more textured like bumps and stuff.",

My hair was very damaged then and I've been very careful with it. Since it grew out a lot in 5 months I wanted to get it done professionally, so I went to a very pretty salon to get it dyed brown, and my pink retouched (wanting brown hair with pink highlights) no bleach was used. She even dyed it darker (almost black) than my natural hair colour.\n\nI went two weeks ago, washed my hair three times only (the third time being today, because my hair felt so gross and was soooo dry and oily at the same time?), and it's already fading much faster that I expected. It's dry and damaged and I have no idea what the stylist did to it to turn out this way!! Both the pink and brown are turning blonde. I'm over it all after struggling bad with my hair for a few years and I'm thinking I'll dye it my natural colour myself because I'm so over trying to have something nice. This is my third horrible experience at the hairdresser, I hadn't gone for three years until now.\n\nWhat can I do to treat it for the brittleness? I already deep condition, use hair masks, oil every night... I don't know what else to do. Help.",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "* EDIT - transformation pictures are at the bottom of the text, I forgot to add them earlier :(\n\nI know this might not be the craziest of the transformations on here (keep in mind it's only been 3 weeks), but I decided to share it with you since it may help some of you and give you a possible alternative to all these medicines such as Minoxidil, Finasteride (Fin), Dutasteride, and others that, when stopped, cause the hair to start falling out again. I never really noticed it before, but the hair on the back of my head has always been a bit thinner, with a few spots that looked less dense than the rest, and this was pointed out by my barber. So I panicked and began to search for solutions, came across many serums and treatments that contained either Minoxidil, Finasteride, or other medications that were prescription-only, so I opted for red light therapy instead. And I know a lot of you think red light therapy is super expensive because of brands like CurrentBody, FolliconLab, Foreo, or HigherDose (I know some of them use laser technology, but devices from these brands cost anywhere from $400 to $800). The one I am using is from Noravele. Now, it has to be used while connected to a charger, which is very annoying in my opinion, and there is only one fit with no adjustments (for me it's fine since I have a bit bigger head, so I don't mind it at all), but it uses the same wavelengths and has the same number of LEDs as all the premium brands for less than half the price. As mentioned on the website, I used the hat for 10 minutes every day for about 3 weeks, and the spots that were less dense and thinner have improved a lot. Even with a shorter haircut, the results are visible. Now, I‚Äôm not a specialist or anything like that, so please make sure to do your own research on red light therapy and see if it‚Äôs suitable for your situation or any medical condition you might have before buying any device. Also, take laser-based devices into consideration as well, even though they‚Äôre usually more expensive, they might be a better fit for some people. I‚Äôll keep you guys updated on how things go over the next few weeks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lc6s55dvt4yf1.jpg?width=646&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6b7ca43462b914e4b37ecdab9643ea6eec226ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4pv646dvt4yf1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45f46540e7b4a0e6112b6b944e86cc2a433b0646",
