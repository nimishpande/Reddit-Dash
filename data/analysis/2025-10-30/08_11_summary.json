I get ropey waves\n\nSeparating them does nothing other than turn them in skinnier ropes waves and it just looks like I have dreads.\n\nI know my hair can not do this, as it's happened before, and that's because it was the 2nd day, I steamed my curls in the shower and ran my wet hands through them. Unfortunately no photo since it was a once in a lifetime experience I'm sorry.\n\nI don't know why we need to submit a routine just for basic help considering nobody knows wtf products we use if we're not from the US but hey! here you go:\n\n1. Sulkin volumising conditioner (protein) or garnier watermelon conditioner \n2. Redwon teatree shampoo (clarifier) or garnier watermelon shampoo\n3. vo5 megahold gel\n4. sometimes a leave-in conditioner on the ends\n\nOther methods I've tried:\n\n1. Scrunching conditioner in the shower upside down (no)\n2. Only using gel on the ends/mids (no)\n3. Not diffusing my hair (no)\n4. Diffusing my hair (no)\n5. Deep conditioning my hair (no)\n6. Not conditioning my hair at all, just shampoo &amp; gel (no)\n7. Separating my curls when wet or dry (no)\n\nWhat can be done üò≠",

I have honestly never struggled with acne or textured skin in my entire life. To be truthful, I‚Äôm honestly blessed with fairly decent skin and never had to any intense routines.\n\nMy previous routine was extremely simple, I only washed my face with CeraVe Foaming Cleanser when I wore makeup and then moisturized with CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion. That‚Äôs it.\n\nI wanted to venture out and see if I could have my skin looking even better, and have my makeup look nicer as well, since I do have pretty dry skin with occasional hormonal breakouts. \n\nMy new routine is:\n1. Mixsoon Bean Oil Cleanser\n2. Mixsoon Centella Cleansing Foam\n3. *Occasionally* Glycolic Acid as toner \n3. Bubble Cosmic Silk Toner\n4. Mixsoon Bean Essence\n\nAm I just overloading my face with product? I‚Äôm not sure whether to think it‚Äôs my skin purging, or it‚Äôs just not reacting right. I have been doing this routine for about a month now and my skin has been continuously breaking out and becoming more textured like bumps and stuff.",

      "content": "Hello everyone!   \n  \nI started using topical min last year when my hair was in a pretty bad shape. It got so bad so fast. I'm thinking it was a combination of diffuse thinning + stress? So anyway, I hopped on topical min for a year, I feel like it helped a little?   \n  \nUnfortunately I dropped my phone in the sea where I had most of my progress pictures month by month. But yeah, you can see what my hair looked like when I started min in August 2024. And the next picture is from August 2025. It was drastically thicker and more volume overall. But as expected, min did as much as it could and growth stopped at some level.   \n  \nI'm 30 now and always had long hair most of my life, so my goal is to have the hair I had at 25. I gave myself a buzz cut on 1st of August this year and added %0.1 topical fin, 3x / week dermastamps at 0.6mm and keto shampoo.   \n  \nRest of the pictures with short hair are from today, after being on the new regimen for 3 months. I feel like I'm experiencing great increase in volume &amp; baby hair popping up all over.   \n  \nObviously its different hair length but it's shorter, so it must show the scalp even more? \n\nI took the pictures in the same room, at the same spot and time of the day to have the same natural light.   \n  \nIs this regrowth or am I imagining it? What do you guys think? Before anyone asks, I've experienced zero sides so far. at some point in the future I could switch to pills as well. ",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
