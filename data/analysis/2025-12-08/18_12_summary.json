      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Just Kidding but, we do take exfoliating pretty seriously, the whole body should be squeaky clean after showers and baths. And that takes time as well but while travelling, I don't know how to keep up with the routine or else I will feel uncomfortable with the feeling of dead skin layer on me. \n\nWhile staying at hotels, I can't really spend much time showering as I'll be sharing my room with another family member and I can't take my usual physical exfoliators with me cause airport security and all. \n\nMy skin is used to exfoliating so if I use a scrub, it usually feels like it just made the dead skin loose but didn't remove it completely. So, using a scrub is not a great idea really for me. \n\nA friend of mind suggested to apply glycolic acid on wet skin, wait 3-5 minutes and then rinse it off in shower. I don't know if that'll work? Or should I buy a soap/body wash with chemical exfoliator? I want something that works instantly so I don't have to spend an hour in the bathroom and makes my skin squeaky clean like I want. \n\nPlease 🥺 help. Or share your exfoliating routine, please. ",

      "content": "Posting this because I want to warn others and to see if this has happened to anyone else.   \n  \n**TL;DR:** Used a hand soap I bought from a supermarket for months and developed a horrible skin reaction around my eyelids and eyes. Took me half a year to figure out it was the soap because honestly who suspects hand soap?? It's a soap by a company called Moss &amp; Adams.  \n  \n**What happened:** Started getting really dry, cracked skin around my eyelids. Then it got progressively worse - constant cracking, peeling, bleeding etc. It made my eyelids so heavy and I was tired all the time. I couldn't wear makeup and I just looked so unwell all the time. People kept asking me if I was okay. Wasn't the best.  \n  \nI went through EVERYTHING trying to figure out what was causing my problems. I read through lots of stories and suggestions on here. I changed my laundry detergent, all my cleaning products, bought a humidifier, got rid of my plants, threw out my new (expensive!) pillows, the list goes on. Nothing helped and I kept getting worse.  \n  \nI finally figured it out when I noticed I was getting extra damaged skin in the same place on my eyelid - where I was rubbing my eyes. So I realised that something from my hands was transferring onto my eyes. As I'd reduced down to using the bare minimum products (in an effort to identify the problem) there was only one product left that I used multiple times a day on my hands: hand soap. I used a hand soap by a company called Moss &amp; Adams which I just found in the supermarket. I switched to another brand asap and boom - it stopped getting worse within days.  \n  \nI wanted to post because in none of the forums that I found when I was looking was there a suggestion that it could be hand soap causing the issue - so I just thought I'd post in case this helps anyone at all. Genuinely wondering if I'm the only one or if others have had similar reactions and just haven't figured it out yet. It was only around my eyes because that's where I touched after washing my hands.  \n  \n**Has anyone else had issues with Moss &amp; Adams products or had mystery reactions that turned out to be something totally unexpected?**",

      "content": "I’ve been noticing a lot of consumerism, marketing gimmicks, and wrong skincare trends especially things like topical glutathione, 7-step routines, and overly hyped beauty serums. So here’s some simple, dermatologist-backed guidance based on personal experience and expert advice:\n\nA basic routine will always beat a complicated one. It saves money, protects your barrier, and gives long-term results.\n\nSunscreen: Use it daily (preferably a pharma-clinical grade sunscreen with a blue-light protection filter) and a lip sunscreen. If you have active, inflamed acne, avoid applying sunscreen directly on top instead use shade, or stay indoors.\n\nCleanser: Use a gentle cleanser. Double cleansing is recommended on days with heavy sunscreen or makeup and its encouraged to do so if you have oily skin. You don’t need morning cleansing cold water is enough unless you’re producing too much oil. keep the Cleansers with actives on your skin for 45 seconds before washing it off.\n\nMoisturiser: Choose one according to your skin type. Ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramides are helpful.\n\nThat’s all you need. If you have skin concerns, choose one active only. Get a dermatologist assessment and lean towards pharma-grade medicated products, staying consistent with one routine for at least 3 months before changing anything.\n\nRetinoids: Tretinoin is a holy grail as retinoids help with cell turnover and target many major concerns. Glycolic acid , adapalene, and azelaic acid also work well when used correctly (start slow, sandwich method, apply in moderation).\n\nExfoliation: Avoid physical scrubs and herbal DIY remedies. Only use chemical exfoliants like AHA/BHA (salicylic, glycolic, lactic acid, etc.) and use them sparingly.\n\nSheet masks: Expensive and wasteful; the fiber isn’t great for skin or the planet.\n\nToners: Mostly unnecessary. Just dampen your skin with rose water or plain water before applying products to improve absorption. All products like snail mucin, peptides, ceramides, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid should be used on Damp skin while \npotent actives should always be applied on dry skin ideally 10–15 minutes after washing.\nWhen the skin is damp, absorption increases too quickly, which can push strong ingredients deeper than intended and lead to irritation, or burning.\n\nEye creams: Often unnecessary. Under-eye darkness is mostly genetics, sleep, lifestyle, and makeup (some studies show kajal contributes to darkening).\n\nTrends: Don’t blindly follow trends like slugging with Vaseline. It only works if done properly because petroleum jelly is an occlusive  it must be layered over good hydration and only if your skin type suits it.\n\nK-beauty: Korean skincare products aren’t automatically suitable for everyone. Their products are created for Korean climate and skin, and true “glass skin” is usually genetics + aesthetic procedures.\n\nHyperpigmentation in brown skin: Brown skin produces more melanin when healing. So if glycolic acid, shaving, or any method “darkened” your skin, it’s usually because: • your barrier was weak • the product was overused • sunscreen wasn’t applied properly Barrier repair + fewer actives + gentle care is the real solution.\n\nHair removal: Face shaving and laser is usually gentler and better because they don’t pull hair from the root, unlike waxing/threading. (If you have PCOS or hormonal issues, treat the root cause first.)\n\nVitamin C: Not every active is essential. Vitamin C is helpful but potent having the ability to damage your skin instead. improving your diet with these nutrients is often more effective than relying solely on the serum.",

It feels stringy and too soft, but as far as i know i’m not doing anything excessive to be causing this(styling-wise).\n\n\nTo sum it up, the bottom is suffering the most, but all of my hair feels very limp, has basically no retention when messed with, and falls apart quick. \n\n\nI’ve been following a wavy-curly routine for 3 months, and this is what i know about my hair + my full monthly routine:\n\n\n• mixed porosity (crown+ face framing bits are high porosity, everything else is low-medium)\n\n• 2b-2c-3a, i have the occasional damaged pieces that curl and then fall into a 2b wave, and some that wont curl at all. i believe i’m predominantly 2c rn\n\n• medium density\n\n• fine strands\n\n• my curl pattern is quite damaged(used to be 3a-3b throughout my whole life) from years and years of straightening my hair twice a day, excessive bleaching and dying, and a hair pulling disorder focused on the crown &amp; pieces around my neck.\n\n• my hair naturally has a soft finish to it, so the excessive shine isn’t something i’m new to, but yesterday i looked in the mirror and literally looked like a disco ball… i’m reflecting INSANE amounts of light.\nthis isnt normal for me, lol!\n\n\npre-shampoo treatments:\n\n\ntwice a month - curlsmith bond curl rehab salve, i leave it on longer on my high porosity area, and about 20 min into waiting i apply it to everything else.\n\n\nonce a month - some kind of conditioning treatment, usually with a good protein-moisture balance. recently it was the garnier SOS keratin filler.\n\n\nwashing:\n\n- bounce curl gentle clarifying shampoo, i use this as a regular shampoo, it’s very light &amp; really doesnt strip much\n\n\n- macadamia naturals conditioner, i use this every second or third wash, my hair already feels too soft in the shower.\n\n\n- olaplex clarifying shampoo, once a week or once every two weeks. depends on how much i wash my hair that week.\n\n\nstyling:\n\n\n- i use mielle rosemary+mint leave in MAYBE once a month, only for my crown, if it feels dry. \n\n\n- balea sea salt spray, i use this before i do my whole routine &amp; spray pretty generously. my hair is naturally very soft too, so it needs some texture.\n\n\n- got2b curls mousse, 1 pump for my whole head, probably golf ball sized\n\n\n- keune styling x gel, i’m not sure exactly what amount i use, i just follow the needs of my hair that day. sometimes more, sometimes less.\n\n\n- i diffuse on medium air &amp; medium temp, switching to cool temp throughout the process.\n\n\nall products r applied with praying hands &amp; then scrunched in to the top.\n\ni don’t apply any stylers on the scalp, i just go near it, and my hair seems to react pretty well to it. i got it as a tip from my stylist, and my roots have been curling pretty well!\n\n",

Im just looking for some advice on what I can use to either stop or tone down the acne I get the week (sometimes 2 weeks) before I get my period.\n\nI am 30 years old, and in the past few years I have started getting HORRIBLE acne, mostly on one side of my face, a week or two before my period. It always seems to clear up almost completely right before it comes back again. These pimples are typically large and painful. I also get them along the bottom of my jaw.\n\nI also have constant sebum buildup on the nose and chin that I'd love to tone down or get rid of as well if anyone can help with that! And I am constantly finding blackheads on the sides of my face.  They never seem to stay away no matter what I've used.\n\nI’ve included a list of products I use below :)\n\n⭐ Face washes I currently use (rotating):\nCetaphil Gentle Exfoliating SA facial cleanser and Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/mask. (Sometimes I use it as a mask but usually as a face wash.)\n\n⭐ Moisturizer:\nClean and Clear Essentials Daily Moisturizer\n\n⭐ Medicated cream:\nBenzoyl Peroxide with Clindamycin (I don’t really use this as much as I should because even with moisturizer it dries me out badly but I do break it out and use regularly for a few days when my acne gets bad)\n\n🌟I also use maximum strength stridex pads on occasion but not regularly because they also dry my skin out.🌟\n\nI have very oily skin  (but also somehow dry?)\n\nAny recommendations would be wonderful, thank you so much!

When I do this, it take maybe 30 minutes to dry, but when I do my full routine (not including shampoo), it takes up to three hours to dry. I got a diffuser and used it today (my first time ever), and even by diffusing it for 20 minutes, it was still fairly damp. Even on high heat.\n\nWhen I do use shampoo, my hair is extremely dry and can take up to 3 days to regain some moisture. If I wash my hair the next day after shampooing, even with the full routine, it's still quite dry and not as defined. This still happens with sulfate-free shampoo. I'm assuming that this is most likely due to the shampoo being harsh, but still adding this information in case it helps. Not sure about my curl pattern but I feel like it's a mix of 2a to 3a. \n\nMy hair rarely gets oily, it mostly just gets drier when I don't wash it for multiple days, but my scalp does get oily fairly quickly. Not sure if this is related to hair porosity, but still adding it for extra information. \n\n\n\nAdded pictures for reference if it helps!",

Panicked when I couldn’t grab hair from my crown while showering looked at my crown with another mirror for the first time and nearly died. Looked up what to do and learned about fin, was afraid for 2 whole years due to fear mongering, that’s hair ill likely not get back due to not getting on instantly in 2020, couldn’t been in my 5th year mark with a head full of hair. But even with that I still recovered so much. Either patience and consistency. Only missed like 5 days total in all 3 years. Hope this gives some inspiration. This side by side blew my mind when I took them. Right now I’d be shinny bald. That’s a scary daunting thought. And in 2 more years I’ll get even better results. It’s never just a year. It’s more, I barely saw anything till year two, but year 3 was when it exploded. Been on this sub for so long and I’m finally one to post. ",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
