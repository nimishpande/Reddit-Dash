      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

After that I apply a thin layer of vaseline.\n\n\nFor the last 2 weeks I've also been applying 0.2% retinol, using the same layering method as mentioned above, so I'm alternating between the three actives. \n\n\nI want to add HA into my routine and I'm completely lost on how to schedule my actives and have so many questions:\n\n\nAm I using too many exfoliants? My skin has been looking great though but I'm afraid of potential irritation and overexfoliation.\n\n\nIf I have to choose between glycolic and lactic, which one should I keep in my routine?\n\n\nIs my layering method optimal? I love slogging and would prefer to be able to apply my moisturizer over damp skin if it doesn't disrupt the actives.\n\n\nCan I apply HA under glycolic/lactic and retinol? I know that slogging is very effective when used with HA, so I'd rather apply it at night. And can I use HA everyday? I'd like to have a day or two a week with no actives to let my skin rest, so would HA be considered as resting?\n\n\nI need help with scheduling when to use each active, ideally I'd prefer to use retinol 3x a week and glycolic/lactic 2x times, and use HA under each if possible.\n\nPlease help a girl out!",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

First one is my personal favorite with the last one being my least favorite.  \n[Glass 1](https://ibb.co/g504zCP)  \n[Glass 2](https://ibb.co/jZyY126z)  \n[Glass 3](https://ibb.co/fWTTwqj)\n\nI’m mainly trying to figure out:\n\n1. Which pair suits my face shape best overall?\n2. Does the round style look current on me or a bit off/out of date?\n3. How does the colour of the glasses work with my hair, beard and skin – is the dark tortoise/amber combination flattering or should I go for something lighter/darker?\n4. As a guy, I’m also wondering whether the glasses reads fairly neutral/masculine, or if it comes across a bit too soft/feminine on me.\n5. If you see any fit issues (too wide/narrow, lens height, bridge, etc.), I’d really appreciate tips on what to look for instead.\n\nThanks a lot for any feedback.",

When I say ***I am desperate for help***, I am genuinely like crying out to you all lmao. I didn't get many responses, so I just wanted to chime in again as I feel my skin is just getting worse. I have struggled with acne for 10 years. I've tried several derm recommended creams/retinoids and even accutane while in high school and while accutane worked, my acne came back. It's been somewhat tame through college, but now, my senior year, I feel like it's never been this bad. I have such horrible redness and so many large pimples in places that I usually do not get them in.\n\nPlease let me know if any of these products would be better swapped for something else, any additions that may be helpful (would love some recs for help w my redness, as well as scarring), or anything I should change.\n\nMorning:\n\n\\- Cerave acne control cleanser (4% benzoyl peroxide) (I worry this might be too much in tandem with my night routine; let me know what you think plz)\n\n\\- Bubble Day Dream serum (vitamin c and niacinamide) (would love to know if there is another more beneficial version of this serum or how effective this one actually is)\n\n\\- Vanicream daily facial moisturizer for sensitive skin\n\nNight:\n\n\\- Wash w neutrogena hydro boost gel cleanser\n\n\\- Bubble day dream serum\n\n\\- Differin adapalene gel\n\n\\- Twice a week, equally spaced out, I skip the differin and exfoliate. Once a week with The Ordinary BHA AHA peeling solution, the other time with The Ordinary Glycolic acid exfoliating toner. (I am wondering if I should make some change here or stop doing it twice a week, etc.)\n\n\\- Vanicream daily facial moisturizer for sensitive skin\n\nI started using the differin about 2 months (ish??) ago and have noticed very conflicting results. I definitely had a bit of a purge with that for a while, but I think I am past the point that I should be having those kind of effects. If it helps any, I wear mascara everyday and very occasionally some concealer (the brand I use is non-comedogenic)  but that is pretty much it as far as makeup goes.\n\nI will take ANY help or advice I can get. Thank you in advance!!!!",

I’m also trying to address some PIE left behind from the nodules if anyone has any advice.\n\nMy skin tolerates the azelaic acid 20% well, but I noticed it stung a bit when I applied it the night after my first use of tretinoin. I took a small break from azelaic acid after that happened, but my skin still stung around my mouth when I applied moisturizer for a day afterwards.\n\nMorning:\n1. Vanicream gentle facial cleanser\n2. Timeless Skin Care 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid serum\n3. The Inkey List Tranexamic Acid serum\n4. Dapsone gel 7.5%\n5. Vanicream daily facial moisturizer \n6.
