      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Cleanser: same as AM\n2. Serum: 10% niacinamide (minimalist) OR hyalouronic acid - usually I alternate between these as niacinamide daily use made my skin dry\n3. Moisturiser: Clinique 100H moisture surge / plum bulgarian rose\n\nSaturday: 2% salicylic acid serum(minimalist) at PM for exfoliation. \nI was also using vitamin c serum at AM earlier but dermat asked to discontinue as I was having active acne at that time. \n\nMy skin improved after following this (pic attached) but still there are visible pores which am not able to get rid of + mild pigmentation and acne marks. Now according to chatGPT all my skin needs now is retinal/retinol to address all concerns. I was eyeing Hyphen 0.1% retinal + their milky toner essence to use as base before retinal. \n\nSUGGESTION NEEDED:\n1. Does it look like my skin really needs retinal or it’ll repair itself eventually by following above routine. \n2. Is it true that if we start using retinal we need to keep using it forever or can discontinue in between due to xyz reasons?\n3. As a beginner is it recommended to use 0.1% retinal serum directly or should I start with something light like a retinol based moisturiser?\n\nI have weddings to attend in Feb 2026 and want to look my best there, please helpp!",

I’ve had curly hair my entire life and have never learned how to properly take care of it.   \n  \nI’ve gone through phases of short hair (shown in photos), and I’ve found that my curls would naturally form and look decent (?) without too much work. As soon as my hair grows out enough to touch my shoulders, that goes to hell. Chaos ensues.  \n  \nI’ve decided to grow my hair out and I’m struggling to manage.  \n  \nI’ve included photos of when I attempt to do a curl routine, and also when I just let my hair naturally dry. You can see both do not look very good.  \n  \nI’m 99% sure that my hair is super thick and has very low porosity (it refuses to get wet and then takes literally forever to dry). I’ve tried curl products in the past and they usually just weigh everything down and make my hair greasy. Weirdly enough, when I use basic shampoo and conditioner, my hair actually looks better?\n\nI'm pretty sure my hair is *relatively* healthy. Like I don't think I have any heat damage or anything like that. I try my best to not overdo washing or brushing. \n\nI honestly haven't given too much thought on the products that I use. I just buy whatever looks good enough. I gave up trying to find products for my hair since they never worked and just made my hair worse. \n\n**Products + Routine**  \nRight now I’m using:  \n1. Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Shampoo  \n2. Dove Daily Moisture Damage Therapy Conditioner\n\n**When I try a curl routine, I use:**  \n1. CURLSMITH Curl Defining Styling Souffle Medium Hold\n\nI shampoo and condition as usual, and then I usually comb &amp; dry my hair a bit. Then, using the \"praying hands\" motion, I'll apply the gel to my hair while upside down. Then I let it airdry. My curls always end up sitting really weirdly and it looks awkward. \n\nI have three main questions:\n\n1. What should I change about my routine?   \n2. What specific (*preferably* budget) products do you recommend for my hair type?   \n3. What haircut should I get? What should I ask for? \n\nThank you!",

I was depressed, crying a lot (can't mention the reason here), barely eating, sometimes only once a day or not at all, drinking almost no water and sleeping maybe 3 hours a night. Most of the time i had trouble sleeping because of nightmares.\n\nA few years later I met my partner (we were LDR before), and my life improved a lot. I started eating and sleeping normally again and got way better. But the one thing that hasn't got better is dark circles around eyes. I still have dark circles that extend pretty far to the sides of my eyes don't even know what that area is called.\n\nNo one in my family has dark circles, so I'm pretty sure it's not genetic. I've also never smoked, drank alcohol, or used anything lile that till now. Any pics i take all have so much dark area around my eyes it makes me saddd\n\nMy question is: Can depression and all that i mentioned cause the area around the eyes to become hollow? And if so, is it possible for this to get better? All i do is facewash and face moisturizer that's all.",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI went to the dermatologist today because I wanted to start finasteride. I’ve been using minoxidil for over half a year now with good results. In the Netherlands minoxidil is available without a prescription, but finasteride isn’t.\n\nI intentionally waited to start finasteride because my partner and I had a desire to have children. Now that this is no longer a concern, I figured it was time to finally begin.\n\nHowever, the dermatologist refused to prescribe it. He said that very recent research (&lt;1 year old) showed worrying results regarding male breast cancer as a side effect. According to him, depression was still “manageable” because they could monitor that, but the breast-cancer findings caused him — and apparently the entire medical team in my region — to completely stop prescribing finasteride.\n\nHe also mentioned hearing at a conference about a finasteride topical lotion that includes 15% minoxidil, which he suggested as an alternative. That sounded like overkill to me and honestly made me question his knowledge a bit. He also said there was no difference between dutasteride and finasteride in terms of side effects or their frequency, which added to my doubts.\n\nObviously I assume a doctor should know more than someone like me who gathers info online, but the whole consultation left me feeling like he might not be fully informed on hair loss treatments.\n\nMy question to you all:\nHas anyone heard about this supposed recent study linking finasteride to increased male breast cancer risk? I can’t find anything about it anywhere.\n\nThanks in advance.",

      "title": "[Routine Help] When to incorporate mandelic acid?",
      "content": "After many years, I finally have a routine that is keeping active acne and rosacea flare-ups at bay. The biggest thing, surprisingly, has been to stop washing my face!! I have only ever used gentle cleansers, but find that even washing it once a day with something as gentle as cerave, cetaphil, or vanicream makes me break out. Contradictorily, I don’t think I have very sensitive skin, as makeup doesn’t make me break out, and I have a compulsive picking habit but it never seems to infect or make worse any blemishes. The only ingredient I am sensitive to is niacinamide. I also don’t think I had/have a compromised barrier as I honestly rarely do anything to my face, rarely wear makeup, and my skin was best when I was bad about remembering use moisturizer and would go days without washing it but would break out when I tried washing it once a day with very gentle cleanser and just using moisturizer. \n\nSince washing my face seems to be my biggest trigger, I rinse it 3X a week with water, use micellar if I’ve worn makeup that day, or spritz with hypochlorus acid if I’ve gotten sweaty. I still get acne in and around my hairline, but i’m pretty sure it’s from washing my hair, as my skin just seems to hate cleanser lol! \nI’ve been using prescription 15% azelaic acid for about four months morning and evening for rosacea redness and scarring/discoloration, but it hasn’t improved either of those, though it hasn’t made them any worse either. I want to replace my AA with mandelic acid for the hyperpigmentation and scarring, but am unsure where to add it into my routine. \n\nHere is the routine I have going that’s been working for me:\n\n**AM:**\n\n- No washing face\n- Azelaic acid\n- Avène tolérance control baume\n\n**PM:**\n\n- No washing face\n- Azelaic acid\n- First Aid Beauty ultra repair cream\n- Avène cicalfate+\n\nTwice a week, in the AM, I’ll use De La Cruz 10% sulfur acne treatment as a mask for about 10-15 mins. This stuff is amazing and calms my skin down so much, and sometimes I want to use it more frequently, but I only use it on my hair wash days since it’s so smelly and really clings to my hair lol. If I have a pimple in the meantime I’ll use it as a spot treatment, or use Kate Somerville Eradikate sulfur spot treatment or a regular pimple patch. \n\nShould I incorporate mandelic acid into my routine? Should I stop with the AA and replace it with the MA, or use both? How often should I use the MA and when? I know the sulfur mask is a bit exfoliating so should I avoid using them on the same day? And for anyone else who shares my skin issue of hating getting cleansed lol— any tips on the hairline acne?? \n\nThank you in advance!! \n ",

      "content": "**How it started:**  \nWhen I was 16, I used one of my mother’s facial creams to wash my face. I don’t remember exactly what it was, but it made my entire face turn red. I went to a dermatologist who prescribed a cortisone (steroid) cream and a liquid version of it. That’s where everything began to go downhill. I was young and didn’t understand what I was doing, so I used the steroid products excessively—mostly the liquid form, maybe the cream once or twice.\n\n**How it’s going now:**  \nI’m 36 years old, and ever since that experience I’ve been extremely cautious with products. For years I only used jojoba oil and pure manuka honey treatments and nothing else because I felt go natural maybe I will heal and won't run into flareups, etc. My biggest issue for the last decade has been my skin being both oily and dry at the same time. Every day when I shower, I get visible white peeling—what I assume is dead skin—that I have to rub off. When I do, it reveals enlarged pores and uneven skin texture. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore my skin just won't heal properly.\n\nRecently, I started using the Cetaphil cream for sensitive skin that contains niacinamide and B5. I’ve been using it for two months, and it has helped with my hyperpigmentation, but not with the texture or consistent hydration. I can only apply it at night because within minutes my face becomes extremely oily. I’m nervous to try anything new due to my skin also being prone to acne breakouts from the oiliness.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
