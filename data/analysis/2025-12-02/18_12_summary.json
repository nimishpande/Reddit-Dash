      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I’ve gotten a bunch of products (I’ve been influenced unfortunately) over the past few months and I don’t really know what to think. \n\nSo when my skin was worse than the picture about two weeks ago, I was using the neutrogena peroxide wash, peel shot occasionally, then I would put hypochlorus acid (because they were literally wounds) before adding salicylic acid from the ordinary or sulfur for 15min at a time. \n\nIt eventually got better but not by much. My skin is not as angry but I felt the routine was a bit harsh. So I started using the pore cleansing oil when I wear makeup, mochi cleanser, the I’m from toner, then I’ve layered the two Anua serums then the 345 cream and vanicream in more dry areas. \nThis is day 2 of doing it. \n\nI really like the other products I have but now am unsure of how to use them or circulate them. Also I’m afraid that the retinal was what I had the reaction to, but I told myself I was in a purge for weeks. \nI haven’t traditionally struggled with acne but with age and stress/meds, I guess it’s an issue I have now. \n\nI’m not sure if my insurance covers a dermatologist, so I’m hoping some of you have some good info that will be helpful. I’ll post my skin, and the ridiculous amount of products that I have and see what you guys think. ",

First one is my personal favorite with the last one being my least favorite.  \n[Glass 1](https://ibb.co/g504zCP)  \n[Glass 2](https://ibb.co/jZyY126z)  \n[Glass 3](https://ibb.co/fWTTwqj)\n\nI’m mainly trying to figure out:\n\n1. Which pair suits my face shape best overall?\n2. Does the round style look current on me or a bit off/out of date?\n3. How does the colour of the glasses work with my hair, beard and skin – is the dark tortoise/amber combination flattering or should I go for something lighter/darker?\n4. As a guy, I’m also wondering whether the glasses reads fairly neutral/masculine, or if it comes across a bit too soft/feminine on me.\n5. If you see any fit issues (too wide/narrow, lens height, bridge, etc.), I’d really appreciate tips on what to look for instead.\n\nThanks a lot for any feedback.",

I’ve had curly hair my entire life and have never learned how to properly take care of it.   \n  \nI’ve gone through phases of short hair (shown in photos), and I’ve found that my curls would naturally form and look decent (?) without too much work. As soon as my hair grows out enough to touch my shoulders, that goes to hell. Chaos ensues.  \n  \nI’ve decided to grow my hair out and I’m struggling to manage.  \n  \nI’ve included photos of when I attempt to do a curl routine, and also when I just let my hair naturally dry. You can see both do not look very good.  \n  \nI’m 99% sure that my hair is super thick and has very low porosity (it refuses to get wet and then takes literally forever to dry). I’ve tried curl products in the past and they usually just weigh everything down and make my hair greasy. Weirdly enough, when I use basic shampoo and conditioner, my hair actually looks better?\n\nI'm pretty sure my hair is *relatively* healthy. Like I don't think I have any heat damage or anything like that. I try my best to not overdo washing or brushing. \n\nI honestly haven't given too much thought on the products that I use. I just buy whatever looks good enough. I gave up trying to find products for my hair since they never worked and just made my hair worse. \n\n**Products + Routine**  \nRight now I’m using:  \n1. Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Shampoo  \n2. Dove Daily Moisture Damage Therapy Conditioner\n\n**When I try a curl routine, I use:**  \n1. CURLSMITH Curl Defining Styling Souffle Medium Hold\n\nI shampoo and condition as usual, and then I usually comb &amp; dry my hair a bit. Then, using the \"praying hands\" motion, I'll apply the gel to my hair while upside down. Then I let it airdry. My curls always end up sitting really weirdly and it looks awkward. \n\nI have three main questions:\n\n1. What should I change about my routine?   \n2. What specific (*preferably* budget) products do you recommend for my hair type?   \n3. What haircut should I get? What should I ask for? \n\nThank you!",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
