      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Cleanser: same as AM\n2. Serum: 10% niacinamide (minimalist) OR hyalouronic acid - usually I alternate between these as niacinamide daily use made my skin dry\n3. Moisturiser: Clinique 100H moisture surge / plum bulgarian rose\n\nSaturday: 2% salicylic acid serum(minimalist) at PM for exfoliation. \nI was also using vitamin c serum at AM earlier but dermat asked to discontinue as I was having active acne at that time. \n\nMy skin improved after following this (pic attached) but still there are visible pores which am not able to get rid of + mild pigmentation and acne marks. Now according to chatGPT all my skin needs now is retinal/retinol to address all concerns. I was eyeing Hyphen 0.1% retinal + their milky toner essence to use as base before retinal. \n\nSUGGESTION NEEDED:\n1. Does it look like my skin really needs retinal or it’ll repair itself eventually by following above routine. \n2. Is it true that if we start using retinal we need to keep using it forever or can discontinue in between due to xyz reasons?\n3. As a beginner is it recommended to use 0.1% retinal serum directly or should I start with something light like a retinol based moisturiser?\n\nI have weddings to attend in Feb 2026 and want to look my best there, please helpp!",

I have some vitiligo on my scalp. \n\nI added some pictures of my hair. The first is right after I brushed through it (which I don't do often) and the second is it sopping wet.

In the Netherlands minoxidil is available without a prescription, but finasteride isn’t.\n\nI intentionally waited to start finasteride because my partner and I had a desire to have children. Now that this is no longer a concern, I figured it was time to finally begin.\n\nHowever, the dermatologist refused to prescribe it. He said that very recent research (&lt;1 year old) showed worrying results regarding male breast cancer as a side effect. According to him, depression was still “manageable” because they could monitor that, but the breast-cancer findings caused him — and apparently the entire medical team in my region — to completely stop prescribing finasteride.\n\nHe also mentioned hearing at a conference about a finasteride topical lotion that includes 15% minoxidil, which he suggested as an alternative. That sounded like overkill to me and honestly made me question his knowledge a bit. He also said there was no difference between dutasteride and finasteride in terms of side effects or their frequency, which added to my doubts.\n\nObviously I assume a doctor should know more than someone like me who gathers info online, but the whole consultation left me feeling like he might not be fully informed on hair loss treatments.\n\nMy question to you all:\nHas anyone heard about this supposed recent study linking finasteride to increased male breast cancer risk? I can’t find anything about it anywhere.\n\nThanks in advance.",

I was depressed, crying a lot (can't mention the reason here), barely eating, sometimes only once a day or not at all, drinking almost no water and sleeping maybe 3 hours a night. Most of the time i had trouble sleeping because of nightmares.\n\nA few years later I met my partner (we were LDR before), and my life improved a lot. I started eating and sleeping normally again and got way better. But the one thing that hasn't got better is dark circles around eyes. I still have dark circles that extend pretty far to the sides of my eyes don't even know what that area is called.\n\nNo one in my family has dark circles, so I'm pretty sure it's not genetic. I've also never smoked, drank alcohol, or used anything lile that till now. Any pics i take all have so much dark area around my eyes it makes me saddd\n\nMy question is: Can depression and all that i mentioned cause the area around the eyes to become hollow? And if so, is it possible for this to get better? All i do is facewash and face moisturizer that's all.",

It’s caused so much breakage I’m pretty much bal*ing (no kidding) and atp I’m just crying myself to sleep every other night.\n\nDoes anyone please have any recommendation for protein treatment? Rice water doesn’t work for me, I’ve tried multiple times :(. I’ve tried so much and yet nothing seems to help. I am willing to spend as much money as possible and do anything that would help.\n\nRecently I saw someone suggest Shea Moisture’s Manuka Honey, I haven’t tried that yet, but when I Google it it says it moisturizes the hair? I added photos of the product. If any of you have used it, how is it?\n\nRoutine rn is pretty much all over the place, most recently I did Curlsmith Strength recipe shampoo, the same conditioner/mask and no products for styling, diffuse so the hair doesn’t stay wet for too long.\n\nPlease please if any of you have been in a similar situation, I would be forever thankful, if you could help :,).",

      "title": "[Routine Help] Early 30f New to Skincare",
      "content": "As the title states, I’m in my early 30s and have NEVER had any sort of skincare routine. Right now, I’m specifically looking for a good lip mask, face wash, and something to help with dead skin. I need something that is hypoallergenic (as I’m allergic to A LOT) and my skin isn’t all that dry, nor is it oily. I don’t know if it matters in what may work, but I’ve also never worn, nor currently wear, any sort of makeup.\n\nThe chapsticks I usually use (Burt’s Bees and Blistex) just don’t seem to be helping anymore. I would also like to stay away from anything tinted. I did see TATCHA and Melixer (Agave) suggested to others, but what are the thoughts on these? I’ve seen such wildly mixed reviews.\n\nAs for a scrub/face wash, any suggestions at all? I’ve tried Apricot scrub from Neutrogena, Burt’s Bees, and small businesses, but I still come out with a TON of dead skin flaking off after a shower. Do I need a specific washcloth/tool? I can’t use cotton (allergic) so I don’t have a typical washcloth, but something more loofa like in texture (but not a loofa). Is the loofa like texture just not good enough to get all the skin?\n\nI’m sorry for the long post, and if there’s extra info needed to be able to help, please let me know! Thank you in advance for any advice!\n\n(PS Anything I can get at Ulta would be a plus as I have a job interview Wednesday and would love to not have chapped lips for that!)",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I have no idea what’s going on with my hair right now and I need some advice. For context I have had the top half of my hair bleached a solid color for 4-5 years now. I went from black asian hair to platinum over the course of 8 months. My hair has red undertones so I had to let it rest 8 or so weeks at a time and it took maybe 4-5 sessions to get it platinum. because of the hassle I have been strict on the upkeep and going to my same stylist every 4 weeks for just root touch up and toner. I don’t use heat on my hair and i let it air dry so it’s been healthy for a long time. However in may of 2024, I did ask my stylist to dye my hair a slate gray when i came in for my root touch up. I ended up liking it so I did it again in august 2024 for a trip and then feb 2025 for another trip. At first The gray faded fine but after the third time I feel like my hair had instead turned a murky looking brown. Is this caused by the dye or could it be some other factors? I uploaded some photos showing the progression. Because my hair is already prone to breakage from how much it has been lightened, I definitely don’t think i’ll be able to do an all over bleach. It’s also super damaged and dry and breaking off like crazy, not from me but from health problems i’ve been having. (My products are the same, if i blow dry i use cold air only, i use a silk pillowcase, and i don’t do tight/damaging hairstyles which is how i know it’s not me along with the fact my peekaboo color underneath is my virgin hair and it also basically is shrivelling up and dying and breaking off) I basically wanna get back to my previous color but i’ve tried living proof clarifying shampoo and trying to wait it out and see if the dye will fade more on its own over time but i dont see a difference even after a few months. Photos 1-3 is my hair at my lightest and what i would like to go back to. Photo 4 is the freshly dyed gray. Photo 5 is the gray fading into more of a light silver/ ash blonde. and then the remaining photos are my hair now, also in natural lighting, looking brown and murky\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9js9zfsjr4g1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=100c34e9314c34e7a5bb383ae2eb5f58246be5d7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2z23fzfsjr4g1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4d3c6cfd177ffe9112dc7a0657837292b84d615\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bd7w10gsjr4g1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9350440eb6bbaf99bb546e9fe5edad07ced0d979\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bv64czfsjr4g1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4c2db615f326c42886b557365824ed7110db6af\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1scjlzfsjr4g1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa48b77b9cc14cdcc3dd144537c14606442127d5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blry5zfsjr4g1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8bbcea1ba98183132980eb379a43a941ae8bf01\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l2uss0gsjr4g1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03513121e1edc9b09f06a8b28721f31cc4733a63\n\n",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

Any product/routine recommendations are much appreciated! \n\nCurrent routine:\n\nOlaplex clarifying shampoo every few washes\n\nRedken All Soft mega curls shampoo 2x\n\nRedken All Soft mega curls conditioner, leave in for a few minutes and brush through before rinsing\n\nBefore putting hair in towel, I rake the Redken all soft mega curls hydramelt treatment through my hair (I do love this product bc I can really feel it helping with actually moisturizing) \n\nHair in microfiber towel 5 min\n\nRe-wet hair until soaking (I still struggle to get hair fully wet sometimes, my head will be dripping but there will small spots and sections that continue to repel water, even in shower when rinsing out conditioner)\n\nApply Ouai curl cream root to tip by taking in\n\nUse the bounce curl volume brush in sections (just using the tension and teeth, not legitimate brush styling IMO)\n\nFlip head over and praying hands not your mother strong hold curl gel, scrunch with pulsing at top\n\n\nScrunch with towel\n\nDiffuse, hover for a few minutes, then flipped over cupping method , and side to side as well\n\n\nThank you in advance for any help!!

His skin has some dark sun spots due to the nature of his work/job.\n\nFew days ago he used the pilgrim 10% vitamin c serum and he really liked it, says it gave him some kind of result, but personally I'm skeptical about this brand and so got him the deconstruct niacinamide + alpha arbutin serum but we did not see much changes in his skin after using this serum. So I'm confused if I should just get him the pilgrim serum again or any other serums. And any other suggestions or recommendations would also be thankful.\n\nPS: I did got him to use sunscreen everyday now so his skin looks good not completely repaired.",
