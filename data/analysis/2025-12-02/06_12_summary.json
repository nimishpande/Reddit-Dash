      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI went to the dermatologist today because I wanted to start finasteride. I’ve been using minoxidil for over half a year now with good results. In the Netherlands minoxidil is available without a prescription, but finasteride isn’t.\n\nI intentionally waited to start finasteride because my partner and I had a desire to have children. Now that this is no longer a concern, I figured it was time to finally begin.\n\nHowever, the dermatologist refused to prescribe it. He said that very recent research (&lt;1 year old) showed worrying results regarding male breast cancer as a side effect. According to him, depression was still “manageable” because they could monitor that, but the breast-cancer findings caused him — and apparently the entire medical team in my region — to completely stop prescribing finasteride.\n\nHe also mentioned hearing at a conference about a finasteride topical lotion that includes 15% minoxidil, which he suggested as an alternative. That sounded like overkill to me and honestly made me question his knowledge a bit. He also said there was no difference between dutasteride and finasteride in terms of side effects or their frequency, which added to my doubts.\n\nObviously I assume a doctor should know more than someone like me who gathers info online, but the whole consultation left me feeling like he might not be fully informed on hair loss treatments.\n\nMy question to you all:\nHas anyone heard about this supposed recent study linking finasteride to increased male breast cancer risk? I can’t find anything about it anywhere.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Does it look like my skin really needs retinal or it’ll repair itself eventually by following above routine. \n2. Is it true that if we start using retinal we need to keep using it forever or can discontinue in between due to xyz reasons?\n3. As a beginner is it recommended to use 0.1% retinal serum directly or should I start with something light like a retinol based moisturiser?\n\nI have weddings to attend in Feb 2026 and want to look my best there, please helpp!",

      "content": "As the title states, I’m in my early 30s and have NEVER had any sort of skincare routine. Right now, I’m specifically looking for a good lip mask, face wash, and something to help with dead skin. I need something that is hypoallergenic (as I’m allergic to A LOT) and my skin isn’t all that dry, nor is it oily. I don’t know if it matters in what may work, but I’ve also never worn, nor currently wear, any sort of makeup.\n\nThe chapsticks I usually use (Burt’s Bees and Blistex) just don’t seem to be helping anymore. I would also like to stay away from anything tinted. I did see TATCHA and Melixer (Agave) suggested to others, but what are the thoughts on these? I’ve seen such wildly mixed reviews.\n\nAs for a scrub/face wash, any suggestions at all? I’ve tried Apricot scrub from Neutrogena, Burt’s Bees, and small businesses, but I still come out with a TON of dead skin flaking off after a shower. Do I need a specific washcloth/tool? I can’t use cotton (allergic) so I don’t have a typical washcloth, but something more loofa like in texture (but not a loofa). Is the loofa like texture just not good enough to get all the skin?\n\nI’m sorry for the long post, and if there’s extra info needed to be able to help, please let me know! Thank you in advance for any advice!\n\n(PS Anything I can get at Ulta would be a plus as I have a job interview Wednesday and would love to not have chapped lips for that!)",

I make sure to wash my face before shaving, showering with warm water beforehand, using shaving cream, and proper skin care afterward (moisturizer, plus either retinol or Byoma Phyto Mucin serum). I am making sure not to overwhelm my skin with more than one serum afterward. I was originally using a three-blade shaver, but I switched to a two-blade disposable to see if anything changed. I am not shaving against the grain either. The skin feels rough, kind of like sandpaper. Is there any product I can use or anything I should change that would get rid of this? + Bonus if anyone can help me get rid of whatever is causing my red cheeks.",

      "content": "Hello! I am dealing with growing in my hair after some really intense chemotherapy. Cancer is gone but chemo gave me curls. One other time, I ended up with curls but only 2/3 of my hair fell out that time so I had some length. \n\n1- I do not know how to make these curls do individual and weigh them down. Is that even a thing I can hope for at this point? \n\n2- I am a Special Education Teacher and avoid biting my nails ….. so I’ve started spinning my hair when nervous, especially in the back. I don’t want a mullet and I’m afraid it’s getting there. Is this mullet-y?\n\n3-What type of cut can I ask for to make it even up more…. I’d like to have a curly bob in the beard future…. Maybe that will take a long time since it’s so curly though. \n\n4- I’m teaching elementary now and have to go out for recess. What is the best hat for the winter that will not ruin my curls? \n\n5- is there an elongation method for my hair? Can I twist it at night or something? What would that be called? \n\nRoutine- I wash it every other day with curl enhancing shampoo/conditioner. Daily- I spray it down. I use a leave-in conditioner, then a strong mousse, then use my hands to push the curls up. Next, I use a comb to part it and sometimes a little bit of gel to keep the part longer. \n\nPlease, take note of the images. Some are at the beginning of today’s work day (the bottom dries so fast and frizzes up but the rest doesn’t) and the other is after work. ",

Now I'm trying to figure out how to best maximize that and embrace it. However, I'm having huge problems with frizz, and with Day 2 or Day 3 hair. \n\nRight now I use Curly Pop shampoo and conditioner, scrunch with Fenty Homecurl after shower, and either wrap in a cotton T-shirt or diffuse dry. I have a satin pillowcase and bonnet (haven't been the best at wearing the bonnet though). \n\nI have fine hair, I'd say, and I know it's low porosity. I've heard about cowash but any time I look for products I'm just lost with the amount! I do have Rizzos Curl Custard, but it has extreme \"slip\" (still not sure what that means) and I don't seem to be able to get it to work for me, so I've been sticking with Fenty Homecurl. But even with that, my day 2 hair is pretty rough. \n\nAny suggestions on routine, product recommendations, etc., would be very appreciated! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p77el2wbun4g1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf809ea01974bb3e10f54c721eae1c950d032d28\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7x3nksvbun4g1.jpg?width=2160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f01a7999f70504eed562b349891119e09ee9e4f8\n\n",

His skin has some dark sun spots due to the nature of his work/job.\n\nFew days ago he used the pilgrim 10% vitamin c serum and he really liked it, says it gave him some kind of result, but personally I'm skeptical about this brand and so got him the deconstruct niacinamide + alpha arbutin serum but we did not see much changes in his skin after using this serum. So I'm confused if I should just get him the pilgrim serum again or any other serums. And any other suggestions or recommendations would also be thankful.\n\nPS: I did got him to use sunscreen everyday now so his skin looks good not completely repaired.",

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
