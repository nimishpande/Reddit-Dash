      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

So naturally I developed pits in my lips in frequently bitten areas.\n\nI realized that the pits were deep and dark, and wanted to stop when it got too painful. So I looked up thick balms and landed on Laneige. \n\nI bought the Laneige lip sleeping mask in Gummy Bear on October 06 2025. I took the first picture before applying the mask for the first time.\n\nI religiously applied it every night and made a lot of effort to stop biting down on my lips again.\n\nThe second picture is from October 14 2025. In just a week I noticed that the pits were healing and my lips were feeling much healthier.\n\nNow I  have made it a habit to slather my lips with the mask whenever I feel like biting, and I must say it helps a lot. \n\nI saw a few posts on reddit subs about Laneige exacerbating rosacea around the lips and I'm a bit worried about tackling that if it happens to me. Otherwise I'm really happy with my results  ☺️ \n\nSharing in case there are other people out there suffering from my condition and wondering if a lip product might help.\n\n",

I wash my face, blink, and I’m shiny again. On top of that, my skin is **porous** (i.e., large-looking pores, textured, things seem to hold onto oil/sweat etc).\n\nSo I’m on the hunt for a **cleanser** that:\n\n* Helps control/seb-regulate the oil production (or at least reduce the slick-factor)\n* Doesn’t strip my skin so much that it freaks out or over-compensates by making even more oil\n* Works for porous skin / helps somehow with texture or visible pores\n* Preferably available in India (but if international, worth the buy)\n\nAlso: I know I’m “late” to actively caring for my skin — but is it *too late*? Can oily &amp; porous skin still be improved significantly even if I start now?\n\nWould love recommendations + your routine tweaks that you swear by. Thanks in advance! 🙏",

Then I use Not Your Mother's curl talk curl cream after the shower. I just let my hair air dry, but I do have a diffuser. \n\nIt's not much right now because I got a severe flare up of sebderm a while back and didn't know what was going on, it took months to figure out how to treat it, and now it's gone but my hair texture is weird. My ends specifically are getting matted easily, and look weird. \n\nThe first three images are how my hair, ends specifically, look now, but the fourth one is how I looked earlier after my shower (10 ish hours ago). I want to keep my curls alive all day, and have both definition and volume in them. Again, I have sebderm, and also I have low porosity hair if that matters (?). Please help me!!!

I already tried tretinoin and completed a full isotretinoin course, but my skin still breaks out mostly on my cheeks and jawline. I’d describe my skin type as combination with an oily T-zone, and I feel like my acne might be hormonal.\nMy routine is simple: a gentle cleanser each morning and night, a light moisturizer, and daily sunscreen. I’m careful with diet and don’t use many products. Still, the inflamed pimples keep coming.\nHas anyone experienced something similar or found a solution when topicals and isotretinoin haven’t worked? I’d appreciate any advice on what to try next or what might be the underlying cause.\nThanks in advance.\n",

I used color remover that contained liquid bleach. Didn’t realize the color stripper had bleach until after. then I used ash blond toner. The first picture is after coloring it with 6NN color. It was to light so I got 4NN after and haven’t used it yet. Since then I haven’t done anything with is because I don’t want to ruin my hair. It’s already a little damaged and doing the elastic stretching if that makes sense. I’ve used a blue hair packet thing from Sally’s and that’s it.

I just wanted to fix or reduce my sebaceous filaments, general bumpiness, and the rare small red spot. Quit my habit and started using Paula's Choice BHA along with a generic CeraVe moisturizing cream. I wash my face once a day, after the wash I pat-dry then apply BHA, let it set for 30 minutes than apply the moisturizer. BHA only goes on 3 times a week. I also use sunscreen when I go outside.\n\nAnd... no changes. My skin looks like I do nothing to do it. I did notice my skin purged around a month after starting the exfoliant, which is now gone, but I still don't look better than before I started this routine. What should I change with my routine to meet my goals? Remember, I'm not acne-ridden, I just want smoother, more consistent skin. AHA? Vitamin C? Some other product I don't know about?",

      "content": "Hi there! This is a very unique situation, but I'm hoping someone can help.\nI work as a jeweler and my hands, arms, face, and neck get pretty dirty throughout the day due to a polishing compound we use, little pieces of metal flying everywhere, dust, etc. I love having good skin and had a great routine going before this job, but lately have been struggling with breakouts, clogged pores, dry skin, and fine lines because of how rough my work environment can be. I try to wear a mask and gloves when I can. I have found a good hand lotion which creates an invisible barrier so my hands are easier to get clean. I was wondering if there are some product suggestions people may have for my face and neck too.\nI'm looking for suggestions or ideas to keep my skin clean, make it easier to wipe dirt off, or keep skin plump and hydrated.\nI also noticed recently when I focus really hard I purse my lips and get kind of more noticeable laughing lines - would it be silly to wear something kind of similar to an under eye mask but on my laughing lines around my mouth underneath my N95 mask? Like a small collagen sheet mask? I don't care if it is silly...I'll try it!\n\nI use a Cetaphil moisturizing cream in the morning so it will last throughout the day, but my N95 mask will typically absorb some of it when it comes in contact with my face. I also worth with flames and chemicals that tend to dry out the air around me, so my moisturizer doesn't seem to go as far as it should.\nIt also doesn't seem to help much with preventing the dirt/soot from sticking to my face and I have to do a lot of tough scrubbing to get it off. \nWhen I come home I have to double cleanse even after wiping my face off and you'd be amazed how gross my washcloth looks! \n\nAny thoughts or tips are appreciated!",

What is this test called?  What kind of doctor will give me this test?  Do you know of any doctors or clinics in New York City who you would recommend for this?\n\nBonus question : I've been using minoxidil and it seems to be working.  Will the successful minoxidil treatments make the test less effective, since it may \"hide\" the causes of the hair loss?\n\nContext : About a year ago I did a two-month course of ozempic for weight loss.  During that time I basically didn't eat.  After the two months, I noticed a bald spot, and so I started using minoxidil.  The bald spot disappeared pretty quickly and the hair grew back as thick as the hair on the rest of my head.  I've been using minoxidil since but I'm trying to figure out if I need to stay on it or not.  Apparently sometimes people experience hair loss on ozympic if they stop eating like I did.",

I’ve been following the curly girl method for a two months, but I’m still not happy with what happens after wash day.\n\nRight after washing and styling, my hair looks pretty nice overall — defined, soft, bouncy (well maybe there’s still some cast)(pics 1-2) But after just a few hours (especially by the evening), it loses definition and shape (and maybe cast). The curls get frizzy and stretched out, especially on the top layer.\n\nHere’s my routine:\n\t•\tWash and condition my hair\n\t•\tApply leave-in/cream\n\t•\tDetangle\n\t•\tScrunch\n\t•\tApply gel\n\t•\tScrunch again\nI let it dry naturally \n\nI used to use mousse before gel, but I didn’t really see any difference.\n\nAnother problem is that the hair on the top of my head is much less curly than the rest — it tends to stay flatter and frizzier.\n\nOn the last photo you can see the products I’m currently using.\n\nAny advice or product suggestions would be super appreciated.

      "content": "I was having very dark skin all around my neck for 3-4 years, and also dark underarms, and I noticed 3-4 small skin tags coming up. Also I was overweight and drinking alcohol almost daily plus smoking couple of packs of cigarettes every day.\n\nSince 4 months back, I started eating clean food, doing workout, no alcohol at all, and I lost 12 kgs weight. Now 90% of the darkness on my neck has gone away, which is very good.\n\nBut on the side and back of neck, there is this thick line like thing which is not going. My fitness coach said that since most things improved with diet, the remaining needs some skin care like vitamin C serum to remove it. I never did any skin care in my whole life, so I don't know what to do.\n\nAnyone else had this problem? What vitamin C serum should I use for neck dark lines? Or any simple tips for beginner like me? Please help to get rid of this. Thanks!\n\n",
