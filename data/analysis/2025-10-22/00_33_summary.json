      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Sorry, long rant I’m just feeling sorry for myself.\n\nI had been seeing the same stylist for about 10 years and she always gave me a good cut. I went regularly every 3 months. COVID came along and I didn’t get a haircut for about 2 years, just trimming it myself. I finally went back in 2021. That first post-COVID cut was the best. I restarted my every 3 month schedule. The next 5 cuts were horrendous, each one worse than the last. Unwanted short layers that spring up leaving the look of a bowl cut with awkward length in the back that looked like a mullet. After the 5th non-consensual mullet I decided I had enough with that long time stylist and needed a break. \n\nI spent the next year growing out the terrible layers and trimmed it myself to minimize the mullet effect while the top layers grew out. I finally screwed up enough courage to seek out a new stylist after a full year of growing it out. I researched all of the stylists in my area who do curly hair. I finally found one that was highly rated by fellow curlies and booked an appointment. I told her all of my trauma and what looks bad on me: short layers. What does she do? Give me a cut with short layers and my hair overall too short. I’m coming up on the 1 year anniversary of that last cut, I’ve been trimming it myself again while trying to even out the layers. It’s still shorter than I’d like due to the layers.\n\nI’m scared to even get back in the chair now.\n\nI get it, when the hair is uneven you need to take off more to even it out, but how do I get it through to stylists that I absolutely do not want layers? They just wind up looking horrible.\n\nRoutine: daily wash and conditioner with Pantene (I don’t care this is what works best for my hair)",

      "content": "My hair is struggling to curl. It only curls at the ends, and i feel like for the most part it's because my haircut has no layers (i only have face framing pieces).\n\nHere's my issue : last time i went to the hairstylist (first pic is the most recent, 2 months after i went there), she refused to give me layers and told me my hair was too thin for that. Individual strands are indeed thin (would the right term be fine hair?) but i feel like my hair is still a bit dense, and with a blunt cut, i kinda look like a cocker dog. \nIs she right, or just lying to me cuz she wouldn't know how to style it?\n\nThen, she proceeded to cut it as straight as she could and for a few weeks even my ends stopped being curly.. She once tried a curl \"routine\" on my hair but just dried it, brushed it and then added a curl cream. The detangling part was really rough too. It obviously looked terrible.\n\nHere's my routine and what i know about my hair :\n- honestly any shampoo, sometimes a sulfate free one. doesn't seem to change a thing\n- sometimes garnier banana hair mask/cocoa butter\n- garnier avocado conditioner or energie fruit coco conditioner\nI add a very small amount of banana hair mask as a leave in after every wash. I make sure my hair is not stuck to my roots and i scrunch properly. When i refresh, i spray water mixed with my leave in. I wash every 4 to 5 days, and these days i sleep in a braid since my hair won't curl correctly anyway.\n\nI don't use a gel because i don't like how it feels; it's hard to remove the crunch and i mess it up most of the time. It looks better when i stop at the leave in.\nI just stick to drugstore products because i'm tired of buying stuff that doesn't seem to do anything.\n\nI think my hair is low porosity and it seems to be straight at the roots. I don't think it's a routine issue, it's just how my hair is supposed to be. It looks wavy overall but i can see small curls pretty much everywhere and if that matters, it's even curlier around the neck/ears. That's why i'm wondering if it could look curlier.\n\nShould i search for another hairstylist or should i stick with this hairstyle? If you have good reference pictures, i'd like to see them! btw i'd prefer it if i could keep my length.\nenglish is not my first language so i hope it wasn't too hard to read..",

The curls get frizzy and stretched out, especially on the top layer.\n\nHere’s my routine:\n\t•\tWash and condition my hair\n\t•\tApply leave-in/cream\n\t•\tDetangle\n\t•\tScrunch\n\t•\tApply gel\n\t•\tScrunch again\nI let it dry naturally \n\nI used to use mousse before gel, but I didn’t really see any difference.\n\nAnother problem is that the hair on the top of my head is much less curly than the rest — it tends to stay flatter and frizzier.\n\nOn the last photo you can see the products I’m currently using.\n\nAny advice or product suggestions would be super appreciated.

I'm more in the 2 to 3 time a year range (and I bun it up when it starts looking awful 😅)\n\nWhat I can do in between visits that will extend the life of the color (at home toner? Gloss?)\n\nI do have a very dark brown base (like the before picture in #1) so I yellow out really quickly and I feel like I'm just throwing money down the drain when it doesn't hold out for more than 2 weeks.\n\nCurrently I only wash 2x a week with warm/luke warm water with Loreal Professional Vitamino line products and I'm trying to do the redken purple hair mask every week.

Just for reference, OpenAI raised between $100M Series B, and the company for VDPHL01 raised $75M. $$$ doesn't directly = success, and venture investing is betting on a lottery winner out of a bunch of lemons. But from a valuation perspective, and especially in biotech, the dollar commitment is a reflection of the investor's probability of success, after looking through trial data, etc. \n\nPelage hasn't released much information to the public, except for the one or two cherry-picked statistical points everyone keeps speculating on, but investors would demand and have access to the full data. **Basically all this hints the 2A trials look really, really good, beyond what we've been given.** \n\nFurthermore, Pelage has one product in their pipeline, and it's a cosmetic treatment, a sector of pharmaceuticals that sits lowest in terms of demand and priority. So from that angle, $120M means even more, because it means investors see potentially large future returns on a consumer discretionary basis. \n\nAlso by now, Pelage and PP-405 has been covered by many media sources, not just by shoddy hair treatment or clinical news sites. In itself, this doesn't mean much, but it makes me cringe when people compare it to shoddy third-world products like GT20029, Kintor, etc and make the comments about \"5 more years\". Pelage is private and hasn't released a valuation, but if I had to make an educated, conservative guess based on the Series B and everything I've seen, I'd estimate in low billions as is now.\n\nJust for reference, I don't have any medical background, and don't have any experience with the biotech or pharmaceutical industries, and everything here is just my personal opinion, but I do work on Wall Street as an investor. Personal background is ivy league to investment banking to private equity, and I currently work at a large hedge fund in credit. The shop I work at has a venture and biotech sleeve, and I have spoken to a couple people there about Pelage out of personal curiosity, and from what I've gathered, it's not their focus but they've heard about Pelage before. Word is it's not so easy to get a meeting there, and they're oversubscribed in funding as is. \n\n**None of this means the product will be a success**, because that's based on science and biology, but from a financials perspective, all the noise points towards something good.

      "content": "Hello everyone, \n(19M) I have been on finasteride 1.25mg daily (Proscar tablets cut in quarters, as effectively as I possibly can..) since January 2025, combining with topical minox+fin (2x a day). Consistenly, without any breaks, maybe missing 2-4 days through this whole period.\n My hair before starting was reaally thick and curly but I had widow peaks that were getting bigger.\n After 10 months of usage, my hair is still shedding everyday with more than appx. 70 hairs on my pillow every morning (terifying). Hair has just became a lot thinner. My widow peaks are somewhat the same, with tiny hairs popping out, but overall the density is just getting worse, especially on the top and middle. \nI have tested my DHT levels and I have very low DHT levels with a normal to high TEST levels, also don't have any other blood issues that could cause hairloss. I have seen a lot of black, dog like hairs on my head in past few months, now a lot less.. I am not really sure what to do, I really liked my thick hair and could probably have hidden my peaks by a different hairstyle, but now can't really do anything.\n I'm not depressed by this anymore, just fairly dissapointed.. \nMy question is, how often does dutasteride make a difference in people's cases and HOW should i implement it? Do i put it in a weekly rotation in the beginning? Any advice would be helpful.",

My medicine cabinet is full of half-used bottles, and I'm still using my old cleanser even though it's just 'meh' because I'm genuinely terrified of trying something else and making my skin worse.   \n  \nI struggle to trust reviews or influencers because, even if they aren't ads, I can't tell whether they have the same problems as I do. **Is there a playbook** ***I'm missing*** **for vetting a product before you actually use it?** How do you validate that something will actually work for you and not just destroy your skin? I'm lost, and I don't know if this is all just an expensive, stressful game of trial and error.\n\nI don't necessarily need specific product recommendations, although I'm certainly open (22 YO, super dry and sensitive skin).

What's your hair texture? :-)\n\n\\--\n\nI know everyone swears by applying stylers (gels, creams, etc.) on soaking wet hair, but this past wash day I tried styling on truly damp hair... wow! My hair looks and feels so much better.\n\nFor context, I have very coarse, dense, wiry, chronically dry hair and I've never really been able to get a gel cast when styling on soaking wet hair. I think the extra water might be diluting my products too much. Normally, I gently squeeze out excess water with a damp t-shirt after styling, but this time I went further: I used a microfiber towel to really absorb the excess water before I styled and didn't re-wet my hair at all during the process.\n\nSome sections were starting to dry out by the time I got to them, so instead of adding water, I just added a bit more product. The result? My hair feels moisturized, defined, and I finally got a cast! I'm realizing I may have been under-moisturizing all along. I always follow the advice of YouTubers with fine or medium hair who use lighter products, but my hair clearly needs more moisture. Lesson learned, lol. Do what feels better to you!\n\nMy routine: \n\n* Shampoo, switch between a few: Ouidad VitalCurl Clear &amp; Gentle, Amika Hydro Rush, Ouai Detox\n* Conditioner: Redken All Soft Mega Curls, Ouidad VitalCurl Balancing\n* Stylers\n   * Fenty Home Curl Cream (LOVE!!!!) or Rizos Curls Defining Cream\n   * Ouidad Heat &amp; Humidity Gel (red bottle) or AG Care Liquid Effects Gel\n   * Sometimes I use a mousse: AG Care Mousse Gel, but the added grit makes my hair feel like straw lol. The volume is nice though!",

Also, I have the unbrush, a denman 7 row and the bounce curl define brush. I used the bounce define brush today😕\n\n\nI did just get a shag type haircut a week ago, the layers are a bit on the short side i know but it revealed how unmanageable the bottom layer of hair is. I can see what i want from my hair forming at the top but it just generally looks like trash.\n\nI went on a hugeee hyper focus kick about my hair back in 2020, got some ok results with different methods but the only ones that I got really good results with required at least 2 hours so I can’t really keep up with that since it didn’t even look on day 2 hair either (generally looks like the first pic the day after a beautiful wash day, but today wash day failed..) the hair in 2020 is the last picture and I miss that a lot.\n\nSleep with a silk bonnet, have to wear my hair up for a work a lot so I know that can cause damage.\nI haven’t had hair shorter than this since 2012 btw. I am a long hair girl and just need some kind of solution or direction. But Really don’t want to cut more off….\n\nProducts i’ve tried:\nall about curls (no-lather, lo-lather, high def gel, bounce cream)\nas i am long &amp; luxe line up, and as i am deep conditioners and moisture leave in\nbiotera \naussie curls line\nLUS love your curls 3 step\ncurls blueberry bliss (entire line up)\nCake Beauty curl enhancing shampoo/conditiner, the curl cream, mousse and gel (current products being used)\nmaui moisture (the coconut shampoo/conditioner and whatever the pink one is)\nMielle products (various, deep conditioner and shampoo/conditoner, curl cream)\ntons of shea moisture products\ntexture ID detangling line up\nVerb ghost line up\n\nI’ve nailed down that my hair really does not like coconut products as far as I can tell also… At this point, tried so many products over the years that I’m just lost and really upset with my hair today, and the last few months.",

Between the wind and humidity you can see how that turned out. \n#3 &amp; 4 is post wash using Mielle (not for my hair type but so far it’s about the only thing that doesn’t leave my hair tangled and feeling dry) and then Briogeo superfoods mask, I rinsed most of it out but not all. While it was wet I added some garnier curl sculpt gel and plopped it in a t shirt for about 30 minutes, then scrunched in some NYM’s curl cream and let it air dry\n#5 is the next day after adding some NYM’s curl refresh foam and vegamour hydr-8 oil \n#6 is my hair a year ago. Still not its best but much more manageable. \n\nI don’t use heat tools on my hair or color it, but it obviously has quite a bit of sun bleaching going on. I had dark blonde hair until my mid twenties so that may be why it lightens so easily in the sun. My hair started thinning back in 2020 so I have less than half the amount of hair that I used to which doesn’t help. I have pretty fine hair with low porosity. When it’s healthy I get cute little ringlets, but even in its current state I get them without doing anything. I just don’t know how to encourage them lol I know my hair needs a pretty big chop but I haven’t worked up the nerve to do it yet so I trim every few months and snip off split ends as I find them. I am open to any and all advice. I just want to have pretty hair again. ",
