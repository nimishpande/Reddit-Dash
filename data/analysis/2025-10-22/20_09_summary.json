      "title": "Found out my routine was weighing my (super) fine hair down, but not sure what and how to change it",
      "content": "Hi! I am currently SO lost in my hair care routine and would deeply appreciate any advice. Firstly, I think my hair is between a 2c and 3a, because my hair definitely isn't wavy but isn't as curly as some of the 3a photos I've seen. My hair is also ULTRA fine, and I realized I've been weighing it down w/ my old routine. Please don't judge the amount of products, I was trying all the things recommended to me in hopes that something would work out... \n\nFor more context, I wash my hair every 3rd day. I spent many years insisting my was straight and using straight hair products (it was a bird's nest but at least the curls were all brushed out right? /s). I've always thought my roots were VERY oily, but once I spaced out washes and started using shampoos for curly hair, it helped tremendously. Additionally, the very beginning of my roots are straight, so the hair starts to curl 1-2 fingers away (unless it is being weighed down). Now, my roots aren't dry but they aren't as oily -- they only start to get oily at the end of the 3rd day. \n\nPRODUCTS (and how I used them): \n\n* Lóreal Metal Detox shampoo (1x/month)\n* Aveda Be Curly Advanced shampoo, conditioner, curl enhancer cream, and gel. Plus the mask (substituting the conditioner) every once in a while. Here's how I use them: \n   * Shampoo twice, then conditioner paired with the Tangle Teezer Ultimate Detangler brush. After detangling, I pin my hair up while I wash my body etc, and later take out the clip to wash it off\n   * Right after I turn off the faucet, without squeezing any water out of my hair, I split it in half. Then, I split it in between the hair in front of and behind my ears. I pin the front part and brush the curl enhancer cream with my fingers on the back half. After that, I use the Bounce Curl Volume Edgelift brush and scrunch\n   * Repeat on the front part, and then apply gel and scrunch with my head down. Then I scrunch it a bit with a DevaCurl hair towel and then put it on my head\n* Styling mousse I bought in my area. I use it after I take off the hair towel and scrunch\n* Heat protecting, volumizing spray (used to be OUAI thickening spray but I started using the Olaplex volumizing blow dry mist)\n* Diffuse\n* Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Smooth Shine oil to break the cast afterwards\n\nAs you can probably imagine, all of this weighed down my hair. I had curl definition, but my roots seemed glued to my head. The curls would start to 'die' (can't find a better word) from the root down. Frustrated, I even bought a bunch of drugstore hair clips to try creating volume (after diffusing). I looked insane, and I was willing to keep doing that if it worked. It kinda worked, but only for a few hours.\n\nI gave up and decided my hair did not, and would not, ever have volume. Fast forward to one night when I started feeling off after I got out of the shower: I decided I would style it in the morning. The next day, when I took my hair out of the bonnet, it *magically* had volume I hadn't seen in ages. Plus, my curls were still pretty defined on their own (not as defined as they can get, but still pretty good). I did this a couple times, and it worked. Still, some of my curls weren't looking as good, specially my bangs (I have a curly cut w/ curtain bangs).\n\nYesterday, I tried washing my hair as normal, scrunching out the water, and then using a towel I got at the curly hair salon to scrunch and put up my hair to dry. After a bit, I put my hair down, used a water spray to get my hair soaking wet again (except the roots -- as suggested by a stylist). Then I split my hair into top &amp; bottom to try to give the roots and bangs 'special attention.' I used the *tiniest* amount of curl cream, the Bounce Curl brush, and another tiny amount of gel on all my hair. I then put it up to dry a bit with a 100% organic cotton t-shirt. Afterwards, to diffuse, I sprayed the smallest amount of the Olaplex spray I could use while still feeling confident about the heat protection. My hair looked good, but the next morning it still looked like it was weighed down (not as much as before though). The ends (&amp; most of the middle) of my hair had pretty defined curls, but some of the top and most of the front of my hair (specially my bangs) looked lifeless and limp, with my curls 'dying' (I hope this makes sense lol) starting from the top of my hair. \n\nSome more info that I'm not sure is relevant: sometimes my hair looks curlier and w/ more volume right after being twisted up in a bun for a while, and I don't understand why.\n\n",

But I’ve been diligently growing my hair out with the hopes of finally embracing the curls again (I prefer long curls on me)!\n\nMy one non-negotiable is keeping the length, no trim necessary quite yet. At this point when the curls are happy it looks good, I think I only need a little shaping, face framing, some curly curtain bangs and some layering around the cheek to eye level. What do you think would look best on me? I believe my head shape to be square-square/oval and feel a bit insecure about a fuller jaw area, so I feel that bringing more attention higher on my head will help with that? I do really like curly shags, especially more wolf cut less mullet for myself :) I love feminine, ethereal, natural, lived in vibes!\n\nThis routine was pretty simple, I washed with Garnier Whole Blends Honey Treasures shampoo and Camille Rose Guava Slip conditioner. I dried with a T-shirt then applied Ouai hair oil, finger coiled front an some other top pieces and diffused mostly dry, then air dried the rest of the way.",

I have never dyed it before. The back half reaches halfway down my neck and the front off is about ear length. I’m looking for streaks of blond in the back and the front, but definitely not all-over, nor so I want highlights. \n\nPersonally I was shocked about the estimate. The longest point of my hair is maybe 6-7 inches and, while I would understand the price if I was dying everything blond, I thought that the streaks would require less time/product.\n\nAlso, this is not a luxury salon but I live in Boulder which could contribute to the price. The pic attached is what I mean when I say streaks but it is NOT a pic of me or my hair.\n\nLet me know if I should commit to this stylist or if I should look elsewhere for a different price estimate!

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I’ve never really sectioned my hair out because it’s so intimidating and my hair’s pretty thick. I usually just let it fall where it wants. If I even move a clump out of place when it’s not soaking you can totally tell that clump wasn’t meant to be there. But the Bounce Curl works best with small sections. I’d been trying to section it out myself over the past few times I’ve used it, but it kept getting frizzy, so I followed a tutorial on how to properly section out my hair and it totally flopped!!! I was sure to continuously mist my hair, but it came out even frizzier than before! In addition I’m just getting needlessly frustrated trying to work with it and section it out. I also don’t really see much of a change in definition when using it. It’s driving me crazy, but I feel awful giving up on this brush when it was an expensive gift. \n\nSo my question is: Should I practice more and make it work, or am I better off without it?\n\nThe first photo is no Bounce Curl, and the second photo is Bounce Curl. \n\nHere’s my routine\n1. I co-wash twice a week with Texture ID 3x Moisture Cream Conditioner and squish to condish\n\n2. I apply Lotta Body Foaming Mousse, Mielle Mango and Tulsi Leave in Conditioner, and Jamaican Mango and Lime Black Castor Oil with Coconut, then brush it out\n\n3. (This step is only when I’m trying to use the Bounce Curl) I section out my hair and use the Bounce Curl on it, making sure to apply tension and mist frequently\n\n4. I wrap in a towel for a minimum of 15 minutes, and then air dry (or diffuse if I’m in a rush)\n\n",

I have combination acne-prone skin, and started using the Skinceuticals 0.5% retinol in August to help with closed comedones and occasional cystic acne, and anti-aging benefits as I’m in my late 20s. I’m applying retinol 3x a week and follow a skin-cycling routine by using a gentle BHA 2x a week and 2 days of no actives. \n\nAfter 12 weeks, my skin continues to develop cystic acne with pustules (only in my acne-prone areas). I don’t think I’m experiencing irritation since my skin doesn’t burn after applying the retinol. Is this normal or should I take a break from the retinol? I’m also not sure if I should increase my use to 4-5x per week and if this would speed up the purging stage?\n\nEdit: it’s my first time using retinol so I gradually increased my retinol use from 1x per week for the first 4 weeks, then 2x for the next month, and now I’m at 3x per week.

I remember the dermatologist at the time kept pushing me to use them, which in hindsight, as someone who has studied health related topics in university now, I find it kind of crazy she did that. Antibiotic resistance is so real, and I was also so young then and it wasn’t even working, so I don’t know why she was adamant about it? Did you take antibiotics for acne and did they ever work?\n\nThe reason I’m asking this is because personally the only thing that cleared my acne was accutane, but I was only able to be on it for 4 months instead of 6 because covid came and dermatologist offices were closed. When my acne came back a few years later, I invested in skincare and I found tropical retinoids worked very well for my acne and cleared it up. Recently though, I’ve been experiencing cystic acne on other parts of my body, which makes me think I have some internal issue? So if you have any recommendations for what actually did clear your acne it’d be super helpful, thank you!!",

      "content": "On Sunday, I developed a light red mark on the border of my upper lip, close to the corner of my mouth. Felt uncomfortable, particularly because of the location. Looked more red on Monday. Small whitehead formed overnight into Tuesday. Avoided picking at it completely. Last night, I placed a Mighty Patch on it, woke up today with the white gone, still reddish. Looks dry like it’s starting to scab. My question is: what can I put on it to heal quicker? \n\nSome context: I’ve had minor battles with acne over the years. I’m 30M. It’s gotten a better over the last few years or so with my diet and skin care routine. Stay away from dairy as much as I can. Ate lots of sweets over the weekend, which I’m guessing caused this pimple. \n\nI wash my face in the morning and at night with a light amount of cleanser, followed by the same brand of moisturizer. Always after I brush my teeth and before I shower. Switched from Cetaphil to La Roche Posay last month, wanted to try something new. I’ve noticed some good results. Skin less oily and less dry, if that makes sense. \n\nSeems like I catch a new noticeable pimple every third month or so, almost always around my mouth and chin, but hardly ever near my lips. Annoying but I manage. Had something similar to this (pimple on border of lip) happen a couple times in the past. Always coincided with putting chapstick or Aquaphor on my lips. So now, I’m afraid to put anything on or near my lips. I usually put Aquaphor on my pimples so they can heal, usually helps a bunch. But I’m scared of putting anything on or near my lips. Don’t want to break out or damage my barriers.\n\nI don’t think it’s a cold sore. Never had one, as far as I know. Doesn’t tingle or burn like I’ve read. Not in a cluster or blister-y.",
