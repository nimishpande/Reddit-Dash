      "title": "What is the science behind 'less damaging' hair dryers such as the Dyson?",
      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I comb through my hair with the conditioner in my hair while in the shower. Then I don't brush or comb after I rinse all of the conditioner out. It kind of seems like my hair doesn't get a wet ass it should or it just dries really fast at the roots. I use ouidad climate control on wet hair and scrunch. I air dry my hair while it's down.

      "content": "My dermatologist instructed me to use adapalene 0.3% by waiting 30 minutes after cleansing (so skin is completely dry), then applying a thin layer, and **not** applying anything else before or after—not even moisturizer. She emphasized this multiple times.\n\nI’ve tried searching for the rationale behind this, but I haven’t found any clinical sources or guidelines that support a “no moisturizer” approach with adapalene. In fact, most reputable dermatology sources and clinical advice suggest using a moisturizer to help reduce irritation and dryness, especially during the initial adjustment period.\n\nTo give more context:\n\n* This is the dermatologist my family physician referred me to.\n* I waited 6 months to see her, and both times I met her, she was very evasive when I asked questions.\n* When I brought up my confusion (since I couldn’t find this advice anywhere else), she just said, *“Don’t believe everything you read on Google.”*\n\nNow, two years later, I still get acne (though slightly reduced), but I also have persistent dry, flaky spots that never fully healed—despite using healing ointments on them (outside of my adapalene time window).\n\nI’m on another waiting list to see a different dermatologist, but in the meantime, does anyone know the medical justification (if any) for using adapalene completely alone, with no moisturizer before or after?\n\nLike adapelene, or adapelene + moisurtizer didn't clear my acne. But I DO KNOW that just using adapelene definitely made my skin barrier worse.\n\nSo it seems my acne isn't even gone and my skin barrier is more damaged using her approach.",

      "content": "I am 22 years old. I have extremely dry, sensitive skin. I developed hyperpigmentation on my chin from an Avon toner when I was younger, and since then, my chin has been very dry. Around my nose and eyes I’m flaky as well, and I just have a dullness to my skin that I hate. \n\nMy skin is also extremely sensitive. I’ve been using Neutrogena Oil Free Cleanser and Pond’s Cold Cream for about ten years. I’ve tried countless other products, including some marketed for sensitive skin, but they all burn. I had high hopes for Aveeno oat cleanser, but no luck. I can’t wash my face twice a day because it will burn. Even my tears burn my face when it’s really bad. \n\nOf all that I’ve tried, La Roche Posay moisturizer was the only one that really worked for me. My skin barrier was still bad because I used the same face wash, but I loved the moisturizer. The issue is how expensive it is. I’ve heard The Ordinary is good, but I’m scared to try new products. \n\nIs there anything I can do to repair my skin barrier and hydrate my skin more?\n\n",

I’ve been following the curly girl method for a two months, but I’m still not happy with what happens after wash day.\n\nRight after washing and styling, my hair looks pretty nice overall — defined, soft, bouncy (well maybe there’s still some cast)(pics 1-2) But after just a few hours (especially by the evening), it loses definition and shape (and maybe cast). The curls get frizzy and stretched out, especially on the top layer.\n\nHere’s my routine:\n\t•\tWash and condition my hair\n\t•\tApply leave-in/cream\n\t•\tDetangle\n\t•\tScrunch\n\t•\tApply gel\n\t•\tScrunch again\nI let it dry naturally \n\nI used to use mousse before gel, but I didn’t really see any difference.\n\nAnother problem is that the hair on the top of my head is much less curly than the rest — it tends to stay flatter and frizzier.\n\nOn the last photo you can see the products I’m currently using.\n\nAny advice or product suggestions would be super appreciated. I really want to figure out how to keep my curls defined and consistent throughout the day and actually make the whole hair curlier, make my top layer look better 💫\n",

I’d really like to go at least 2-3 shades lighter until my hair looks like a natural medium brown. Is there any way I can safely do this at home? I have access to Salon centric through a friend who lives out of state so she can ship me products if needed. I was looking to do a color correction in a salon and the cheapest it would be is $350, and that’s just the lowest (i’d definitely get charged more since I have very long thick hair). I used to use ion and wella from sally’s btw, I know that’s not any better than regular box dye but I’m just curious if anyone thinks I’d lift easily!! \n\nEdit: I don’t know anything about hair, but if this is any helpful information I’ve never bleached my hair before. I’ve only ever gone darker",

      "content": "My hair is struggling to curl. It only curls at the ends, and i feel like for the most part it's because my haircut has no layers (i only have face framing pieces).\n\nHere's my issue : last time i went to the hairstylist (first pic is the most recent, 2 months after i went there), she refused to give me layers and told me my hair was too thin for that. Individual strands are indeed thin (would the right term be fine hair?) but i feel like my hair is still a bit dense, and with a blunt cut, i kinda look like a cocker dog. \nIs she right, or just lying to me cuz she wouldn't know how to style it?\n\nThen, she proceeded to cut it as straight as she could and for a few weeks even my ends stopped being curly.. She once tried a curl \"routine\" on my hair but just dried it, brushed it and then added a curl cream. The detangling part was really rough too. It obviously looked terrible.\n\nHere's my routine and what i know about my hair :\n- honestly any shampoo, sometimes a sulfate free one. doesn't seem to change a thing\n- sometimes garnier banana hair mask/cocoa butter\n- garnier avocado conditioner or energie fruit coco conditioner\nI add a very small amount of banana hair mask as a leave in after every wash. I make sure my hair is not stuck to my roots and i scrunch properly. When i refresh, i spray water mixed with my leave in. I wash every 4 to 5 days, and these days i sleep in a braid since my hair won't curl correctly anyway.\n\nI don't use a gel because i don't like how it feels; it's hard to remove the crunch and i mess it up most of the time. It looks better when i stop at the leave in.\nI just stick to drugstore products because i'm tired of buying stuff that doesn't seem to do anything.\n\nI think my hair is low porosity and it seems to be straight at the roots. I don't think it's a routine issue, it's just how my hair is supposed to be. It looks wavy overall but i can see small curls pretty much everywhere and if that matters, it's even curlier around the neck/ears. That's why i'm wondering if it could look curlier.\n\nShould i search for another hairstylist or should i stick with this hairstyle? If you have good reference pictures, i'd like to see them! btw i'd prefer it if i could keep my length.\nenglish is not my first language so i hope it wasn't too hard to read..",

I tend to leave a rootier look for the grow out, but I do NOT have the time or budget to get this done every 4 to 6 weeks. I'm more in the 2 to 3 time a year range (and I bun it up when it starts looking awful 😅)\n\nWhat I can do in between visits that will extend the life of the color (at home toner? Gloss?)\n\nI do have a very dark brown base (like the before picture in #1) so I yellow out really quickly and I feel like I'm just throwing money down the drain when it doesn't hold out for more than 2 weeks.\n\nCurrently I only wash 2x a week with warm/luke warm water with Loreal Professional Vitamino line products and I'm trying to do the redken purple hair mask every week.  It doesn't seem to help though so it feels like a waste of time. ",

      "content": "Hi there! I only started experimenting with styling my hair wavy/curly earlier this year after years of bleaching and coloring, but I’ve honestly never styled my hair wavy/curly even when I was younger so this is all new to me. The first photo is from one of my first attempts at styling it wavy/curly, then I cut it short to start over fresh, and the next photos are some of the progress I’ve had with the last photos being the most recent. I cannot air dry my hair, while I have finer strands I have a LOT of it and it takes hours if not an entire day to air dry, so whatever style I do, I have to be able to diffuse it to mostly dry. I only wash a couple times a week max due to the time investment and I don’t have super greasy hair. \n\nMy current wash day routine is:\n- Loma moisturizing shampoo and conditioner\n- “It’s a 10” leave in conditioner and detangle with wet brush\n- (The rest of the routine is bent over with hair upside down)\n- With sopping wet hair, rake in some Loma curl cream and Paul Mitchell sculpting gel\n- Brush through with bounce curl brush and gently shake to form curl clumps\n- Scrunch and pulse with hands (I get a nice squish sound when I do this)\n- Scrunch in a little bit of Loma volumizing mousse (doesn’t provide much hold)\n- Scrunch out extra water with microfiber towel\n- Cradle ends of hair in towel and start diffusing upside down, once a little bit of a cast is in place, then gently lift roots and tilt head until I’m right side up again, and finish diffusing right side up.\n\nI’m hoping to get some guidance on:\n1. I’m not getting a very good cast most days, but I feel like the best wave and curl definition I get and least amount of frizz is when I have a decent cast. Is this an issue with my products or with my technique?\n2. I struggle with getting a consistent curl pattern, it seems like I have some clumps that want to wave, some that curl, and some that have a complete mind of their own, but it looks different every single time! Is this normal?\n3. I don’t currently do any “refreshes” throughout the week. Once my waves/curls have relaxed a couple days in, I brush them out and wait until the next wash day. Any tips for getting the definition to last longer?\n \nAppreciate any tips or product recommendations!!",

I use Garnier fructis products on my hair, their shampoo and conditioner, and their strong hold gel. My hair doesn’t ever get weighed down and I wash it 1 time a week to every 10 ish days and then style it on wash day for the remaining week, refreshing with water and more gel if I need. I air dry because I can’t afford a good diffuser (I’m a broke university student). I also wear a bonnet to bed. I’d like to speak to a hairdresser who specializes in very thick curly hair. I am Caucasian but people swear my hair is some of the thickest out there. I would love advice 1 on 1 or in a group from hairdressers who can help based on my situation of being little and low income and in college where it can get hard mentally as well. Thanks! ",

      "content": "Hi everyone, spent a little time on this sub but never posted here before. As a lot of people know, Pelage recently raised $120M in Series B funding. There's been a couple posts regarding this, but I don't think anyone's really discussed the significance. \n\n$120M is a very large amount for Series B in general, even for capital intensive businesses like biotech. Just for reference, OpenAI raised between $100M Series B, and the company for VDPHL01 raised $75M. $$$ doesn't directly = success, and venture investing is betting on a lottery winner out of a bunch of lemons. But from a valuation perspective, and especially in biotech, the dollar commitment is a reflection of the investor's probability of success, after looking through trial data, etc. \n\nPelage hasn't released much information to the public, except for the one or two cherry-picked statistical points everyone keeps speculating on, but investors would demand and have access to the full data. **Basically all this hints the 2A trials look really, really good, beyond what we've been given.** \n\nFurthermore, Pelage has one product in their pipeline, and it's a cosmetic treatment, a sector of pharmaceuticals that sits lowest in terms of demand and priority. So from that angle, $120M means even more, because it means investors see potentially large future returns on a consumer discretionary basis. \n\nAlso by now, Pelage and PP-405 has been covered by many media sources, not just by shoddy hair treatment or clinical news sites. In itself, this doesn't mean much, but it makes me cringe when people compare it to shoddy third-world products like GT20029, Kintor, etc and make the comments about \"5 more years\". Pelage is private and hasn't released a valuation, but if I had to make an educated, conservative guess based on the Series B and everything I've seen, I'd estimate in low billions as is now.\n\nJust for reference, I don't have any medical background, and don't have any experience with the biotech or pharmaceutical industries, and everything here is just my personal opinion, but I do work on Wall Street as an investor. Personal background is ivy league to investment banking to private equity, and I currently work at a large hedge fund in credit. The shop I work at has a venture and biotech sleeve, and I have spoken to a couple people there about Pelage out of personal curiosity, and from what I've gathered, it's not their focus but they've heard about Pelage before. Word is it's not so easy to get a meeting there, and they're oversubscribed in funding as is. \n\n**None of this means the product will be a success**, because that's based on science and biology, but from a financials perspective, all the noise points towards something good.

Consistenly, without any breaks, maybe missing 2-4 days through this whole period.\n My hair before starting was reaally thick and curly but I had widow peaks that were getting bigger.\n After 10 months of usage, my hair is still shedding everyday with more than appx. 70 hairs on my pillow every morning (terifying). Hair has just became a lot thinner. My widow peaks are somewhat the same, with tiny hairs popping out, but overall the density is just getting worse, especially on the top and middle. \nI have tested my DHT levels and I have very low DHT levels with a normal to high TEST levels, also don't have any other blood issues that could cause hairloss. I have seen a lot of black, dog like hairs on my head in past few months, now a lot less.. I am not really sure what to do, I really liked my thick hair and could probably have hidden my peaks by a different hairstyle, but now can't really do anything.\n I'm not depressed by this anymore, just fairly dissapointed.. \nMy question is, how often does dutasteride make a difference in people's cases and HOW should i implement it? Do i put it in a weekly rotation in the beginning? Any advice would be helpful.",
