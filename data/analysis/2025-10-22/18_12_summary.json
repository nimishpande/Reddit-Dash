      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I now look at my old photos and miss the skin I used to have and think it wasn’t even that bad before 😭\n\nI’ve now been trying to clear it up by simplifying my routine with just micellar water, gel cleanser, hydrating serum, and gel moisturiser but I’m generally just really lost. I assume I have closed comedones but it looks nothing like the photos I’ve seen when searched. Please help me 🙏🏼\n\nNote: these were all taken with makeup on!!

I’m hoping to get maybe some tips or advice for the top of my hair because I’m kinda stuck. \n\nMy hair routine so in the shower includes: \n- Eufora urgent repair (a clarifying shampoo- product buildup loves me) \n-Eufora aloe therapy shampoo after that for moisture (I’m considering dropping these bc they’re expensive so if you have any store bought recommendations lmk)\n- if I wash my hair more than once a week, I use the L’Oréal Elvive Hyaluron+Pump - I bought this specifically bc I think I have low porosity hair? I get confused bc in the shower my hair gets wet right away but when I’m starting w dry hair &amp; spraying it with my continuous misting sprayer, I really have to spray a lot and do praying hands over my hair or else it just sits in beads on top of my hair.\n- Mielle Babassu &amp; Min Deep Conditioner OR \n- Not your mother’s Tahitian gardenia flower &amp; mango butter conditioner \nProducts out of the shower include: \n- Not your mother’s nourishing curl talk leave in (my hair loooooves this) \n- For gel, I’ll use either Miss Jessie’s Jelly Soft Curls or just straight 100% natural aloe Vera gel (my hair likes the aloe better) \n- if I use a mousse, it’s going to be the Herbal Essences Curl Boosting Mousse in the purple bottle \n\nI get my hair trimmed every 8 weeks &amp; i get my roots touched up w/ a brown-copper every 16 weeks. I do sleep with a silk bonnet and if im wearing my hair up, it’s always with a banana clip or a claw clip. \n\nNow, my main problem is the top of my hair, from basically the tops of my ears and up. It’s super flat and just doesn’t want to curl. I used to get my hair bleached (highlights) so normally I’d say that was the issue but it’s been so long that I don’t have any left in my hair. The bottom of my hair is super curly. Everything above that, I basically have to force to somewhat curl with a comb (I’ll brush it and twist it around the tail end of a rat tail comb like one would with a denman brush). A few months ago, I cut my hair up to my shoulders and got a lot of layers to see if that would help the top of my hair curl but alas, it did not. \n\nI’ve attached photos just to show exactly what I’m talking about. The non-collage one best represents what my hair looks like after my full routine and you can see the top is just meh and ive sorta forced it to curl (btw im a natural sandy-blonde and when im outside a lot, the top of my hair gets a lot lighter - that’s why i stopped bleaching my hair). I understand that I could just have different curl types and it can truly be that drastic of a difference between the curl types on one person’s head, but the top front of my hair near my face just started to curl up right at the root (it’s never done this before- image of this also included) so I think there’s potential and I’m not sure what else I can do to bring those out. \n\nAny help or recommendations is greatly appreciated 🫶🏼",

      "content": "I've had acne for all of my post-pubescent life. It was never really that bad until age 16, when I went to the dermatologist for mild acne flare ups I now know were most likely just hormonal/stress related. She put me on a benzoyl peroxide face wash and trentenoin and recommended daily use for both. This caused my acne to go from mild to severe in a year a usage. It just kept getting worse and worse. I have tried every product under the sun. Benzoyl peroxide, trentenoin, adapalene, salisayic acid, clindamycin, and spironolactone but none of them worked, and it just kept getting worse and worse. I then finally went on birth control and that helped to clear up my acne for around 6 months, but then it slowly started to come back and slowly getting worse and worse. After birth control being listed as a class 1 carcinogen and it no longer helping with my acne, I decided to stop using it. What should I do now for my acne? Is there any hope? Or am I stuck with mild acne for the rest of my life? I feel like its important to mention that I have Hashimotos as that is an issue with my hormones. My recent approach has been trying to balance my hormones and focusing on a gentle routine. Is this wise? Should I give up on actives? My current routine is AM:  Cleanse with micellar water, and wash it off with water. Then I use the La Roche Posay double repair moisturizer, and the La Roche Posay 60 SPF light tinted sunscreen. PM: micellar water again, followed by the La Roche Posay toleraine purifying cleanser, and then the Avene Cicalfate+ moisturizer. I have also been trying to cut out gluten and dairy. Is this all unnecessary?  Any gentle actives I could try to help get rid of my scarring and prevent new acne from forming? Any and all advice is appreciated. I just want clear skin.",

      "content": "Hi I am in desperate need of help with my skin care routine! Nutrafol messed up my hormones really badly which caused this cystic acne on my chin and jawline. I have been off of it for almost a month now but am still dealing with the breakouts, my period has also been really bad this month which is why i’m sure my hormones are the cause of this. I asked ChatGPT for help with my skin care routine which I’m not sure was the greatest idea… but it’s all I could think of. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Every time I start to notice my skin clear up a new cystic spot appears which is very frustrating. A little background info: I just got a membership at my tanning salon, which I know most people would recommend against but in the past it’s the only thing that’s been able to help with my skin. My membership also includes unlimited red light and infrared sauna as well as Polly red light. I have been using the red light bed every time I go to tan and have done the sauna for 30 minutes once so far. I have not used the poly red light yet but if anyone recommends I definitely can. Chat GPT also recommended i take a supplement called DIM but I have read some Reddit pages and stopped taking this for a couple of days now. Currently I am taking a spearmint supplement and drinking spearmint tea nightly but that is all I’m doing for my hormones at the moment. If you have read all of this, thank you so so much. I greatly appreciate it. Here is my skin care routine: \n\nMorning: \n1. Laroache possay cleanser or Cerave SA cleanser depending on how my skin is feeling \n2. Naturium niacinimide serum or The ordinary azeac acid \n3. Krave Beauty oat so simple moisturizer \n4. Good Molecules eye cream \n\nNight time: \n1. Youth to the people cleanser or panoxyl and let it sit on acne as a mask for a couple mins \n2. Prescription clindamycin \n3. Same moisturizer and eye cream as morning \n4. Murad deep relief acne treatment for deep cystic spots or pimple patch for spots that are coming to a head\n\nOther products I have but not currently using: \nLa roache possay moisturizer \nAvene cicalfate+ \nMedicube zero pore pads\nPaula’s choice BHA liquid exfoliant\nClear stem BRIGHTMEUP toner and match eye pads - I feel victim to the tiktok shop ads and just got these but have not started using yet. \n\nAny tips or advice would be greatly greatly appreciated. I am desperate for help at this point thank you so much for reading all of this.❤️❤️\n",

I usually say I want a round cut with short layers on top, but it still turns out like a shag cut. I don’t know what my old dresser used to do differently\n\nRoutine:\nSkala Leave in conditioner raked through wet hair\nHair seperated into top, middle, bottom section\nApply LA TI NA curl activator and style each section with Denem brush\nDifuse and pick out and shake hair for more volume\nSpray Big Sexy Hairspray in roots\n\nEdit: also want to add, this is nothing against the shag cut, I just dont get the volume I want with it.

I’ve never really sectioned my hair out because it’s so intimidating and my hair’s pretty thick. I usually just let it fall where it wants. If I even move a clump out of place when it’s not soaking you can totally tell that clump wasn’t meant to be there. But the Bounce Curl works best with small sections. I’d been trying to section it out myself over the past few times I’ve used it, but it kept getting frizzy, so I followed a tutorial on how to properly section out my hair and it totally flopped!!! I was sure to continuously mist my hair, but it came out even frizzier than before! In addition I’m just getting needlessly frustrated trying to work with it and section it out. I also don’t really see much of a change in definition when using it. It’s driving me crazy, but I feel awful giving up on this brush when it was an expensive gift. \n\nSo my question is: Should I practice more and make it work, or am I better off without it?\n\nThe first photo is no Bounce Curl, and the second photo is Bounce Curl. \n\nHere’s my routine\n1. I co-wash twice a week with Texture ID 3x Moisture Cream Conditioner and squish to condish\n\n2. I apply Lotta Body Foaming Mousse, Mielle Mango and Tulsi Leave in Conditioner, and Jamaican Mango and Lime Black Castor Oil with Coconut, then brush it out\n\n3. (This step is only when I’m trying to use the Bounce Curl) I section out my hair and use the Bounce Curl on it, making sure to apply tension and mist frequently\n\n4. I wrap in a towel for a minimum of 15 minutes, and then air dry (or diffuse if I’m in a rush)\n\n",

I’ve tried everything to get rid of them- AHA, BHA, Tret, clay mask, oil cleansing, that k beauty sebum softener etc. If I don’t really keep on top of it, they will get to a point that they’re sticking out and you can see the texture even if I have makeup on. I can get them pretty cleared out but within an hour they are back to being dark. I’ve gotten to a point that they do look smaller in diameter if I do a multi step clean out but they darken again almost immediately. And it doesn’t take long for them to return to the larger diameter either. \n\nI think I just have tough skin because I have stubborn KP all over too, chemical exfoliation does nothing for face or body. My facial skin is normal except my nose and middle chin alone are oily, especially my nose.\n\nI know you can never get rid of them, but I’d like to have a maintenance routine that can keep them looking good for at least a day at a time… my husband’s nose has no visible SFs at all and I’m very envious.\n\nCurrent routine- AM\n\nNeutrogena foaming ultra gentle cleanser\n\nDIY vitamin C serum (just water/ascorbic acid/ baking soda as needed for pH adjustments)\n\nAveeno Calm and Restore gel moisturizer (recently switched from Cerave, I heard that might make SFs worse)\n\nSkin1004 centella sunscreen\n\nPM- prequel oil cleanser\n\nNeutrogena foaming ultra gentle cleanser\n\nTO 0.2% retinal (was on tret for years, took 1.5 year break to try for a baby, using this now until I can get another tret rx)\n\nTO Niacinamide serum\n\nAveeno calm and restore gel moisturizer \n\nSometimes I’ll use a drop or two of jojoba oil- I’m not sure if that would help or make it worse\n\nTo get my SFs cleaned out at all I use the Ilso sebum softener and then the 50 shades of snail method.\n",
