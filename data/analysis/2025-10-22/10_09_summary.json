      "title": "What is the science behind 'less damaging' hair dryers such as the Dyson?",
      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "I bite my lips as a stimming mechanism as I have severe GAD. So naturally I developed pits in my lips in frequently bitten areas.\n\nI realized that the pits were deep and dark, and wanted to stop when it got too painful. So I looked up thick balms and landed on Laneige. \n\nI bought the Laneige lip sleeping mask in Gummy Bear on October 06 2025. I took the first picture before applying the mask for the first time.\n\nI religiously applied it every night and made a lot of effort to stop biting down on my lips again.\n\nThe second picture is from October 14 2025. In just a week I noticed that the pits were healing and my lips were feeling much healthier.\n\nNow I  have made it a habit to slather my lips with the mask whenever I feel like biting, and I must say it helps a lot. \n\nI saw a few posts on reddit subs about Laneige exacerbating rosacea around the lips and I'm a bit worried about tackling that if it happens to me. Otherwise I'm really happy with my results  ☺️ \n\nSharing in case there are other people out there suffering from my condition and wondering if a lip product might help.\n\n",

I really want to achieve that “glass skin” look.\n\nI’d love advice on a routine that actually works for fading dark spots, clearing clogged pores, smoothing out bumps, and improving overall skin texture.

On top of that, my skin is **porous** (i.e., large-looking pores, textured, things seem to hold onto oil/sweat etc).\n\nSo I’m on the hunt for a **cleanser** that:\n\n* Helps control/seb-regulate the oil production (or at least reduce the slick-factor)\n* Doesn’t strip my skin so much that it freaks out or over-compensates by making even more oil\n* Works for porous skin / helps somehow with texture or visible pores\n* Preferably available in India (but if international, worth the buy)\n\nAlso: I know I’m “late” to actively caring for my skin — but is it *too late*?

Now 90% of the darkness on my neck has gone away, which is very good.\n\nBut on the side and back of neck, there is this thick line like thing which is not going. My fitness coach said that since most things improved with diet, the remaining needs some skin care like vitamin C serum to remove it. I never did any skin care in my whole life, so I don't know what to do.\n\nAnyone else had this problem? What vitamin C serum should I use for neck dark lines?

The top layer of my hair struggles to curl but the underneath coils well. I don't have a set routine as I'm still exploring but I use the Garnier superfoods aloe shampoo and conditioner, then some Aveda curl enhancement cream sample I had onto wet hair, then left my hair to air dry.\n\nI have tried several products but have found that my hair either gets weighed down and turns into more of a flat wave, or gets super frizzy quickly (like in the picture).\n\nId really appreciate some recommendations as I want to enjoy wearing my hair natural 😁 \n",

Then I use Not Your Mother's curl talk curl cream after the shower. I just let my hair air dry, but I do have a diffuser. \n\nIt's not much right now because I got a severe flare up of sebderm a while back and didn't know what was going on, it took months to figure out how to treat it, and now it's gone but my hair texture is weird. My ends specifically are getting matted easily, and look weird. \n\nThe first three images are how my hair, ends specifically, look now, but the fourth one is how I looked earlier after my shower (10 ish hours ago). I want to keep my curls alive all day, and have both definition and volume in them. Again, I have sebderm, and also I have low porosity hair if that matters (?). Please help me!!! How do I manage all of this?",

What is this test called?  What kind of doctor will give me this test?  Do you know of any doctors or clinics in New York City who you would recommend for this?\n\nBonus question : I've been using minoxidil and it seems to be working.  Will the successful minoxidil treatments make the test less effective, since it may \"hide\" the causes of the hair loss?\n\nContext : About a year ago I did a two-month course of ozempic for weight loss.  During that time I basically didn't eat.  After the two months, I noticed a bald spot, and so I started using minoxidil.  The bald spot disappeared pretty quickly and the hair grew back as thick as the hair on the rest of my head.  I've been using minoxidil since but I'm trying to figure out if I need to stay on it or not.  Apparently sometimes people experience hair loss on ozympic if they stop eating like I did.",

      "content": "I was having very dark skin all around my neck for 3-4 years, and also dark underarms, and I noticed 3-4 small skin tags coming up. Also I was overweight and drinking alcohol almost daily plus smoking couple of packs of cigarettes every day.\n\nSince 4 months back, I started eating clean food, doing workout, no alcohol at all, and I lost 12 kgs weight. Now 90% of the darkness on my neck has gone away, which is very good.\n\nBut on the side and back of neck, there is this thick line like thing which is not going. My fitness coach said that since most things improved with diet, the remaining needs some skin care like vitamin C serum to remove it. I never did any skin care in my whole life, so I don't know what to do.\n\nAnyone else had this problem? What vitamin C serum should I use for neck dark lines? Or any simple tips for beginner like me? Please help to get rid of this. Thanks!\n\n",

      "content": "Hi. I'm a diffuse thinner. I don't think I have aggressive AGA, maybe I've been thinning since my twenties, really don't know. It's most apparent on the crown, it's worse on the cowlick, apart from that it's not very noticeable unless it's wet or parted (I style my hair forward towards the front, no parting). Hairline is solid, still NW1.\n\nJust wondering what my chances are here. I know it's difficult to say but considering I'm 39 maybe it will stabilise around this level and not get much worse? It's still a full head of hair so maybe if I've hit 40 like this I can hold onto most of it?\n\nI have tried F (I don't want to say the drug because I swear my post gets autoblocked on this subreddit just for saying it in the slightest negative light) on and off since 2022, unfortunately I just can't handle it, the lowest dose I tried was 0.25mg EOD. So I did have some help from it since 36 years old. Idk how much worse I'd be today had I never taken it.\n\nBtw I've heard that in order for follicles to miniaturise they need to almost constantly be attacked by DHT. I feel like I can gauge how severe my hair loss is by how much my scalp is burning/itching. When I was on F the scalp burning completely went away, without F I can feel it intermittently and it always coincides with more hair shedding. So... if I don't experience scalp burning all that often (I get it maybe once daily for like half an hour) perhaps that's an indicator that my hair loss is not so bad?\n\nI know this is kind of a silly topic but I'm still interested in what you think. I wish I could handle F but I can't. Are there any other things I could try? Like Rosemary Oil, microneedling, keto shampoo? Thank you.",
