      "content": "Hi! Asking for help in how I can get a Victoria's Secret Blowout hairstyle as a girl with straight, thinner width hair type with some layers (see reference for last image). \n\nI dont put much in my hair besides occasional oils, hair mask (fino) and regular shampoo (2x) and conditioner. I trim my hair a lot and have some layers if I want a wolf-cut sometimes, but I think in a blowout they don't have much layering? Should I stop cutting layers into my hair?\n\nI'm letting my hair grow out now and I was thinking about getting a Dyson to curl. Perhaps I could curl it with a standard curler, or hair rolls? \n\nWhat products do you personally use or should I go to a hair salon and ask if I can/how I can get it done instead?\n\nThank you so much! 🥲❤️\n\n",

      "content": "(Picture of routine after skin pics)\n\nHello, no matter what I do my skin is always constantly irritated to some extent. It flares up into all these little red spots especially after I wash my face. I went to my derm and they gave me a 10% glycolic acid face cleanser which felt like it helped for a bit but now I feel like it might be doing more harm than good. When it comes to skincare I never know what I’m doing and honestly dermatologists are no help other than to just put u on tret which id be willing to give a chance again if that would solve my issue better. \n\n To describe my skin to the best of my abilities I think it’s more on the sensitive side (maybe rosacea?) and I think it’s more dry than oily but I always say combination because I don’t know. I have large pores especially on my nose and no matter what I use they don’t go down. I understand they aren’t going to completely go away but there’s still gunk in them even after cleansing. Sometimes I feel like maybe I’m over doing it but I just want to be able to feel clean and refreshed after washing my face. I just find it difficult to find products catered to sensitive skin that also will actually help clear my pores a bit. \n\nSome routine notes:\n-I was using beauty of joseon glow serum (the one with niacinamide) in the morning instead of the hyaluronic acid but I ran out and have been waiting to repurchase in case there’s better out there haha\n-I use the topicals faded like every other day or sometimes every 2 days depending on how my skin is looking. Honestly I don’t even know if my skin needs that product or if it’s even helping with anything.\n-I recently purchased the axis y dark spot correcting serum. Now that I’m looking at them I realize that they might both be for the same thing so I probably don’t need to use both. \n-I don’t wear sunscreen often tbh. I use that one on days I’m not wearing makeup and know I’m gonna be outside. I’m open to suggestions and advice on that. \n-I haven’t had any issues with the red bean water gel moisturizer or the dynasty cream.\n-I added the succinic spot treatment on there just for you guys to see but I only use it sometimes \n\nIf you’ve made it to the end thank you. I would really appreciate any tips or suggestions. I’m pretty open to trying new products as long as they are not outrageously expensive. Idk after looking at my routine now I feel like I’m overdoing it. I guess I just want a simple routine that won’t irritate my skin too bad but will also treat my concerns. \n\n*also please bear with me cos for some reason every time I take a picture with my phone it literally BLURS THEM😭😭 but I’ll save those concerns for another group hehe",

      "content": "Hi everyone! Sorry for the long post. These pictures were taken on the third day after wash day. I haven't looked after my hair well by not treating it as curly/ wavy (not sure what the type is yet), but l'd love to start and get my hair looking healthy again. I've tried reading how the curly girl method works and other people's routines, but it's a lot of information and I can't tell what would be good for me anymore. So l had a few questions to ask and am open to any tips you all have for me!\n\n1. I usually have a bunch of split ends. I'm going to get my hair trimmed in a week, but unfortunately a curly hair specialist is out of my budget. Is there anything I should specifically ask the hairdresser for to help accommodate my hair well? I usually get layers and a U-cut which I think has been alright so far. I want to grow my hair out but the split ends keep me from doing so.\n\n2. Along with the split ends, my hair feels extremely dry, especially at the scalp. This leads to too many painful tangles if I leave my hair unbraided. If I detangle my hair, wear a low ponytail and leave the house, my hair gets tangled in less than 10 mins and shrinks to a little ball of fluff. Can you recommend any products like deep conditioners or leave-ins that can prevent this? I know people say to not brush your hair when dry, but it always felt like I needed to with how instantly tangled my hair gets.\n\n3. What l've picked up as the most basic steps to care for curly hair is shampoo &gt; conditioner\n&gt; detangle &gt; leave-in conditioner &gt; a styler &gt; dry. And product selection, moisture or protein ingredients, product application all depend on the hair characteristics? Do you have any recommendations for products I could start with that suit medium porosity and medium thickness hair? I've heard people say that their hair loves protein but I don't know if mine needs that more or moisture or equal quantities anymore 🥲\n\nMy current routine is just:\n1. Detangle with comb before shower\n2. Shampoo: Crème of Nature Argan Oil Moisture and Shine shampoo\n3. Conditioner: Crème of Nature Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment\n4. Air dry\n\nI realised later that the shampoo and conditioner were not CG approved. So I’d love to get some recommendations!\n\nI have tried detangling in the shower a few times but I didn't notice any difference as it gets tangled immediately. Probably because I don't use a leave-in yet maybe?\n\nAdditional notes: 1. I had used the Crème of Nature Argan Oil leave-in conditioner spray on dry hair once and it made my hair extremely stiff. I couldn't comb my fingers through my hair without it hurting. I haven't tried it ever since but l'm guessing it might be a different story if used on wet hair l've iust been scared of trying it. 2. I wash my hair twice a week. \n\nSo if you guys have any advice on how I can start looking after my hair well, make it look not as dry, reduce the tangles, or anything related to how to choose my products, let me know! I'd be really grateful, thanks &lt;3",

      "content": "So, i'm an eighteen year old male and i've fucked my hair quite a bit over the years. While i was on an edgy phase, i used to shave it on the sides a lot, and i also used some chemichals to straighten it, which i think made my hair lose all volume. In the past, i also used to wear my hair way too slicked back and using lots of gel, which surely fucked my hairline a lot.  \nCurrently, my hair is pretty short. I want to grow it out the most i can and regain volume.  \nAlso, my hair is currently kinda messy. When it dries, it starts to become spiky all of a sudden, mainly on the sides. My barber said it is because my hair is straight(Because of the chemichals i used), but it doesn't have enough length and volume, so it just becomes spiky.  \nI'm also using a minoxidil based product to fix my hairline. In just a month, it's already working, but my hair itself is still a mess.\n\nWhat would you all recommend me to do? I'm already doing the basics(Good diet, good sleep, no bad habits, limiting stress, etc etc). Should i use some sort of product or adopt some other habit that might help?\n\nOBS: Yes, i've quit using chemichals on my hair. Nowadays i only use soap and Dr. Sasquatch shampoo/conditioner. I also don't use gel or anything like that, i just wet my hair in the morning so i can brush it then i use it naturally.",

      "content": "Help! I’ve been doing all the “right” things but my skin continues to get worse.\n\nAge: 34 Location: Southern New Hampshire Skin type: combo — sensitive\n\nOther info:\n\nDiagnosed with rosacea and mild acne\n•\t⁠Healthy diet and exercise routine, but high stress\n•\t⁠The water we shower with is highly filtered (plumber husband)\n\nI usually get 2-3 pustules or papules a week, with the worst being on my cheeks (but they also pop up in my T-zone). I used to have cystic acne (in my mid 20’s) and was on Spironolactone until I had to go on blood pressure medication. I’ve been off birth control for most of the last decade, but did take the mini pill for about a year. The cysts never came back, but this new acne has been happening for about three years.\n\nBut aside from blemishes, my biggest issue with my skin is the scarring, redness, and discoloration. I feel embarrassed to be seen without makeup.\n\nMy routine:\n\nAM:\n•\t⁠La Roche hydrating gentle cleanser\n•\t⁠E.L.F. Hyaluronic acid serum\n•\t⁠Vanicream day moisturizer\n\nPM:\n•\t⁠La Roche hydrating gentle cleanser with konjac sponge\n•\t⁠E.L.F. Hyaluronic acid serum\n•\t⁠CeraVe renewing night cream\n\nI alternate prescription topicals, so Tret .025% one night, Azelaic acid 15% the next, followed by a night off. I’ve been doing Tret for ~6 months, Aze was added two months ago.\n\nI occasionally do a mud mask if I’m feeling really oily. I also have a red light mask from CurrentBody that I’ve used ~3 times a week for the last 9 months. Up until last spring, I was getting monthly facials (either DiamondGlow or mini peels). I stopped because it was expensive and didn’t seem to be helping. I cut out most other products about 2 months ago to try to better identify if the prescription topicals are helping — and they’re not.\n\nI was thinking of going back to the derm in another month, but they haven’t been super helpful…so any advice is welcome!

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

I use shampoos and deep conditioners that work for my hair and I clarify once a month, my hair accepts protein well so I do that once a month as well. I use a leave in and gel or mousse bc I find that works best for me. I don’t straighten it often and I have only dyed it twice. In other words, I have mastered my own routine. My hair has always been very healthy, voluminous, and very dense and full. As of lately, I don’t know what has happened, I dyed my hair with a safe dye and my hair looked great. A few months later the shedding is out of control, my hair is thin and too soft and it has lost its density and fullness, it looks like I don’t have much hair now and it’s very stringy, I have lost my curl pattern somehow and the ringlets have become zig zaggy waves that won’t curl much of a curl. I truly don’t know what the issue could be as I continue to take the same care of my hair, and my iron and vitamins seemed fine in my bloodwork. I feel hopeless and absolutely desperate for help, it is devastating to lose my curls after all these years of taking perfect care of them and avoiding damage at all costs.
