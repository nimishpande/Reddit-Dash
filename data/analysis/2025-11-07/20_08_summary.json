Asking for help in how I can get a Victoria's Secret Blowout hairstyle as a girl with straight, thinner width hair type with some layers (see reference for last image). \n\nI dont put much in my hair besides occasional oils, hair mask (fino) and regular shampoo (2x) and conditioner. I trim my hair a lot and have some layers if I want a wolf-cut sometimes, but I think in a blowout they don't have much layering? Should I stop cutting layers into my hair?\n\nI'm letting my hair grow out now and I was thinking about getting a Dyson to curl. Perhaps I could curl it with a standard curler, or hair rolls? \n\nWhat products do you personally use or should I go to a hair salon and ask if I can/how I can get it done instead?\n\nThank you so much! 🥲❤️\n\n",

      "content": "Hi everyone! Sorry for the long post. These pictures were taken on the third day after wash day. I haven't looked after my hair well by not treating it as curly/ wavy (not sure what the type is yet), but l'd love to start and get my hair looking healthy again. I've tried reading how the curly girl method works and other people's routines, but it's a lot of information and I can't tell what would be good for me anymore. So l had a few questions to ask and am open to any tips you all have for me!\n\n1. I usually have a bunch of split ends. I'm going to get my hair trimmed in a week, but unfortunately a curly hair specialist is out of my budget. Is there anything I should specifically ask the hairdresser for to help accommodate my hair well? I usually get layers and a U-cut which I think has been alright so far. I want to grow my hair out but the split ends keep me from doing so.\n\n2. Along with the split ends, my hair feels extremely dry, especially at the scalp. This leads to too many painful tangles if I leave my hair unbraided. If I detangle my hair, wear a low ponytail and leave the house, my hair gets tangled in less than 10 mins and shrinks to a little ball of fluff. Can you recommend any products like deep conditioners or leave-ins that can prevent this? I know people say to not brush your hair when dry, but it always felt like I needed to with how instantly tangled my hair gets.\n\n3. What l've picked up as the most basic steps to care for curly hair is shampoo &gt; conditioner\n&gt; detangle &gt; leave-in conditioner &gt; a styler &gt; dry. And product selection, moisture or protein ingredients, product application all depend on the hair characteristics? Do you have any recommendations for products I could start with that suit medium porosity and medium thickness hair? I've heard people say that their hair loves protein but I don't know if mine needs that more or moisture or equal quantities anymore 🥲\n\nMy current routine is just:\n1. Detangle with comb before shower\n2. Shampoo: Crème of Nature Argan Oil Moisture and Shine shampoo\n3. Conditioner: Crème of Nature Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment\n4. Air dry\n\nI realised later that the shampoo and conditioner were not CG approved. So I’d love to get some recommendations!\n\nI have tried detangling in the shower a few times but I didn't notice any difference as it gets tangled immediately. Probably because I don't use a leave-in yet maybe?\n\nAdditional notes: 1. I had used the Crème of Nature Argan Oil leave-in conditioner spray on dry hair once and it made my hair extremely stiff. I couldn't comb my fingers through my hair without it hurting. I haven't tried it ever since but l'm guessing it might be a different story if used on wet hair l've iust been scared of trying it. 2. I wash my hair twice a week. \n\nSo if you guys have any advice on how I can start looking after my hair well, make it look not as dry, reduce the tangles, or anything related to how to choose my products, let me know! I'd be really grateful, thanks &lt;3",

I’ve stopped using it since I think starting Arazlo &amp; Finacea at the same time was too much for my skin. \n\nMy skincare newbie questions:\n\n* Is the Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer with 50 spf good enough to be my sunscreen? Or should I use an actual sunscreen instead?\n* I’m not using any serums in my skincare routine yet - should I add any?\n* Am I missing anything from my skincare routine?\n* Are there any better products that I should use instead?\n* Any other advice/recommendations please!",

I washed my hair with Aussie bouncy curls shampoo and conditioner and separated my hair with my fingers in the shower. \n\n2. I scrunched my hair gently to get out excess water. \n\n3. I plopped my hair in a microfiber towel and left it roughly 10 minutes to dry slightly. \n\n4. I sprayed John Frieda dream curls styling spray liberally through my hair. \n\n5. I used a diffuser on a medium head and lowest setting to dry (placing sections of my hair into the diffuser from the tips and bringing it to my scalp).\n\nThis is the first time I've done any of this so everything like scrunching and plopping has just been my best attempt.\n\nThank you all in advance!

I use shampoos and deep conditioners that work for my hair and I clarify once a month, my hair accepts protein well so I do that once a month as well. I use a leave in and gel or mousse bc I find that works best for me. I don’t straighten it often and I have only dyed it twice. In other words, I have mastered my own routine. My hair has always been very healthy, voluminous, and very dense and full. As of lately, I don’t know what has happened, I dyed my hair with a safe dye and my hair looked great. A few months later the shedding is out of control, my hair is thin and too soft and it has lost its density and fullness, it looks like I don’t have much hair now and it’s very stringy, I have lost my curl pattern somehow and the ringlets have become zig zaggy waves that won’t curl much of a curl. I truly don’t know what the issue could be as I continue to take the same care of my hair, and my iron and vitamins seemed fine in my bloodwork. I feel hopeless and absolutely desperate for help, it is devastating to lose my curls after all these years of taking perfect care of them and avoiding damage at all costs. Any advice at all?\n\nFor reference, the first photo is the natural, usual state of my hair, and the second is where I’m at now.\n\nRoutine:\n-double random shampoo + NYM or Eva NYC deep conditioner, CER-100 protein treatment (recently)\n\n-Pattern leave-in, Design Essentials Mousse or Kinky Curly gel\n\n-Sometimes denman brush, diffuse every time\n\n-Sleep w/ satin pillow case and satin scarf or bonnet",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

I've been watching a lot of videos from Dr. Shah, Dr. Maxfield, and Dr. Dray, so that has really helped. I'm looking for an afforable and simple skincare routine for my face and body, combination products would be best. Also cheaper alternatives to what I'm currently using would be nice too!\n\nSkin Type: dry to combination skin(?), the skin on my body is dry, acne prone (face and back mainly), my skin is also sensitive, I'm also mixed so my skin has more melanin.\n\nMain Skin Concerns: acne, hyperpigmentation/dark spots/pih, dryness\n\nCurrent Routine\n\nFace:\n- [CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/cleansers/acne-salicylic-acid-cleanser) (been thinking of switching back to [this](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/cleansers/renewing-sa-cleanser) though)\n\n- [CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/daily-moisturizing-lotion)\n\nBody:\n- I use whatever bodywash, I'm trying to find a good one atm. I was using [Olay Super Serum Body Wash for Rough &amp; Bumpy Skin](https://www.olay.com/products/olay-super-serum-body-wash-for-rough-bumpy-skin), but i think its too rough/drying as a daily body wash, I also tried [Dove Acne Clear 1% SA](https://www.dove.com/us/en/p/acne-clear-serum-body-wash-with-clearing-salicylic-acid.html/00011111049451), but dont think that's good as a daily either, it is alot more gentle but it doesn't lather good and is expensive imo for how much product your getting, the Olay also dosen't lather good.\n\n- Occasionally I use the CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion (i should be using it everyday i know) or [AmLactin Daily Nourish 12%](https://amlactin.com/products/daily-nourish-lotion-with-12-lactic-acid), I think the AmLactin is too rough for my skin though I can't use it daily/often, I was using it for my acanthosis nigricans. Its good for knees, elbows, and feet though.",
