And I needed to be unemploymed for it 😂 (obviously seeing the time this took)\n\nI mean it makes sense right? There's no way I could have searched, found and done this routine while on my job. \n\nI'm not there yet in terms of styling but my curls are so much more defined than before. And mind you, this is not day one, I put products in them yesterday and and slept on my normal cotton pillow, they looked terrible in the morning and then I just put water in them again this morning, a bead of some random gel and let it air-dry. \n",

I provided some recent pictures of Jennifer Lawrence as inspo. My goal was to go just a shade blonder than my natural dark blonde hair and I tried to communicate to her that I was nervous about going too dramatic, I really wanted to baby step into this and have it be subtle. I chose partial highlights because that was what a different hairdresser recommended to me.\n\nIt turned out very chunky and icy and I feel really sick about it. I can’t tell if partial highlights were the wrong choice or if I mismanaged my expectations but I really dislike it and feel it looks very fake. The internet wisdom that I’ve read says wait a few days to get used to it, and they’ll also fade in time, so I’m resolved to wait until Monday before reaching out to the salon. I’m hoping for some outside perspective, and perhaps advice on what to ask for? At the very least I’d like my roots to blend better with my natural hair color, I think this will look terrible as it grows out. Thanks for your thoughts!",

I’m keeping my skincare minimal and barrier-focused, but would love your input on whether I’m on the right track.\n\nThis is what I am using right now Cleanser: Cetaphil Gentle or CeraVe Hydrating Moisturizer: Cetaphil DAM Sunscreen: Skin1004 Centella Water Fit (the only one that is not making my acne worse) \n\nShould I keep this going or add anything to this?\n\nI plan to avoid actives and exfoliants while my skin adjusts, but I’d love recommendations for:\n\n- Any other products to go with the current routine \n- Any specific shampoo or masks to help with hairfall (just being cautious) \n- Any Accutane related habits or routines \n- Any food related advice \n\nLiterally any advice you may have will go a long way for me! Thanks in advance xx \n",

I use shampoos and deep conditioners that work for my hair and I clarify once a month, my hair accepts protein well so I do that once a month as well. I use a leave in and gel or mousse bc I find that works best for me. I don’t straighten it often and I have only dyed it twice. In other words, I have mastered my own routine. My hair has always been very healthy, voluminous, and very dense and full. As of lately, I don’t know what has happened, I dyed my hair with a safe dye and my hair looked great. A few months later the shedding is out of control, my hair is thin and too soft and it has lost its density and fullness, it looks like I don’t have much hair now and it’s very stringy, I have lost my curl pattern somehow and the ringlets have become zig zaggy waves that won’t curl much of a curl. I truly don’t know what the issue could be as I continue to take the same care of my hair, and my iron and vitamins seemed fine in my bloodwork. I feel hopeless and absolutely desperate for help, it is devastating to lose my curls after all these years of taking perfect care of them and avoiding damage at all costs. Any advice at all?\n\nFor reference, the first photo is the natural, usual state of my hair, and the second is where I’m at now.\n\nRoutine:\n-double random shampoo + NYM or Eva NYC deep conditioner, CER-100 protein treatment (recently)\n\n-Pattern leave-in, Design Essentials Mousse or Kinky Curly gel\n\n-Sometimes denman brush, diffuse every time\n\n-Sleep w/ satin pillow case and satin scarf or bonnet",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "Hello, kind of a weird one for a guy but here we go: a few years back I had an accident that left a scar above one eyebrow, and ever since, that brow barely grows back. The result: one normal brow, one patchy.\nI’m looking for a natural-looking way to fill it in - nothing glossy, “wet“ or makeup-like. Just subtle symmetry so it doesn’t look weird in daylight.\nTbh, I’m a bit lost with all those gels, brushes and pencils…\nI tend to have a sensitive skin, so I need something gentle (minimal or natural ingredients, hypoallergenic if possible).\nAny product recs or techniques that work well for sparse brows? Preferably available in Europe/Germany.\nThanks for all advices in advance!",
