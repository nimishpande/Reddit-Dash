Using a Bounce Curl brush, I detangle each section and then apply my products in this order: leave-in, mousse, and gel. After that, I brush through again to distribute the products evenly and lock in definition.\n\nFor drying, I diffuse upside down on high heat, focusing first on my roots until they’re dry. Then I switch to low heat, flipping my head side to side to dry the ends and boost volume. Once it's totally dry I scrunch and usually separate some of the clumps.\n\nAs you can see, I’m a bit of an Original Moxie stan. It's expensive, but has been my holy grail!",

It also dries very fast compared to the normal parts of my hair. The only time i used heat was when my mom used to blowdry my hair pretty hot when i was younger. I have virgin hair, never dyed or bleached. I also wore a bun every day for years a few years ago so that couldve also damaged it. Now i try my best to take care of my hair, i use deep moisturizing/hydrating hair masks about twice a week. I dont really know what to do because my hair wont hold moisture anyway so the product probably isnt really doing anything. I know you cant fix low porosity hair cause thats just how it is, it just acts like low porosity hair but it also acts damaged? i dont know.\n\nIn the video its drenched in a hair mask but as you can see.. its just sitting on top. \nIm open to answer questions.\n\n",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "Hi! I have what I think is 2c hair and it is pretty much completely healthy (i think). I do not put heat on it unless I go to the salon, and I do not dye my hair either. I had keratin, (around 5 treatments), but the last one was over 4 years ago. I did end up letting my hair grow out for about 2 years and cut off all the dead ends (it was a LOT of hair). Now, i think my hair is super healthy. I recently cut it about a week ago so it can fully grow long and soft. \nI guess my question is can anyone recommend a good shampoo and conditioner? \n\nmy main concerns are frizz and growth, and the only products I use after I wash my hair are the Mizani Leave In Conditioner and the Design Essentials Almond &amp; Avocado Curl Enhancing Mousse. I always brush my hair, use the leave in first and then I just hand scrunch my hair after applying the mousse and let it air dry. I feel like at times my hair after styling and air drying doesnt really have much bounce to it. It is kind of dull and my curls are severely lacking definition. Btw I also lose a decent amount of hair in the shower, and it’s long strands. is this normal? \n\nI used Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner for like 3 years. I used the pink bottle, the white bottle and the blue bottle. Since cutting my hair I went to the store to buy a new shampoo and tried the Redken AllSoft for Mega Curls, but it was way too much for my hair. Then I exchanged it for the Redken Extreme Shampoo (dark blue bottle) and I don’t know how to feel about it. I used each of those one time so far. Are they more for damaged hair? I also know they have protein in them and I’m not sure if healthy hair needs that? I have also noticed that my scalp smells bad the day after washing. Does that mean I need a clarifying shampoo? and if so, are there any ones that are non drying? \n \nHonestly if someone wants to recommend me a complete hair routine I would be so appreciative. Above I have attached photos of my hair \n(explanation for each photo below)\n\n1- first wash after my most recent hair cut (november 2025) (mousse and leave in used) \n2- after first wash of hair cut before the most recent one (early september 2025)(first time using mousse and leave in mentioned) \n3&amp;4- before first hair cut in 2 1/2 years (march 2025) \n5- result of first wash after that first hair cut (march 2025) (no product)\n\nMy main questions are: \n1. is it normal to be losing long strands of hair in the shower \n2. please recommend me shampoo conditioner as well as any styling products, brushes etc. \n3. how do I prevent frizz \n4. how can I get my hair to look its absolute best \n5. how can i get it to grow strong and healthy?

The photos are from Monday 3 November.\n\nUsually my skincare consists of cleansing (BALEA foaming cleanser) my face in the morning and evening, and immediately after applying a face cream (GARNIER rose soothing cream)\n\nA few days ago, thinking of improving the situation, l purchased the LA ROCHE POSAY Effaclar cleanser, and the LA ROCHE POSAY Effaclar Mat moisturizing cream, both contain salicynic acid, and I noticed a slight improvement to tell the truth, but now my skin is very dry and last night it was quite burning, so this morning I decided not to use these last two products. Only after inquiring I discovered that it would be good not to use salicinic acid every day, what do you think? A thousand thanks!",
