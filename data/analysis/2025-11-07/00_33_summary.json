I kept the routine he gave me which was basically cleanse and that was it, he gave me a benzoyl peroxide cream, it was not until i showed him a picture of my redness that he recommended that la roche posay mela b3 serum, I think it helped a liiiiitle, but definitely not that much, i’ve been using it for around 3 months and noticed a bit of a difference.\n\nNOW here comes my new problem\n\nI am using the cleanser I attached, the la roche posay effaclar medicated cleanser, been using it for 2 months? i haven’t notice it breaking me out, maybe a little redness, I chose it because ( according to chat gpt) is the most similar one to the cleanser I used before\n\nanyway I bought adelaide acid from the ordinary as well as their moisturizer 3 days ago, and idk if my skin likes it, the first picture was taken Thursday, i felt a little redness, i took it to document my “progress” i wasn’t concerned, but yesterday (following pictures) as you can see my skin is so red!!! even on my jawline, it was red and itchy and peeling, i don’t know what to do! please help me, i bought adelaide axis because it is supposed to be good for pie but now i don’t know what to do",

      "content": "Hello, I (20F) am having extreme difficulty rehabilitating my hair. For context, my hair used to look pretty nice, but I lost a lot of it due to an eating disorder. Stress also caused it to thin, and when I tried to rehabilitate it by getting faux locs, my braider did them so tightly that a bunch of hair was ripped out.\n\nI used to straighten my hair weekly because I preferred it straight rather than curly—hence the heat damage. Some parts of my hair are now straighter than others. I’ve never been good at taking care of curly hair because I was so used to wearing it straight, but now I’m trying to learn how to wear it natural. It’s been really overwhelming because there are so many sources saying to use this or that, and to do this or that, and I feel like whatever I’m doing clearly isn’t working because my hair looks like shit, lol.\n\nIt’s one of my biggest insecurities. These are pictures of my hair after I got a big chop; I went to a hairdresser to cut off any heat-damaged parts. Does anyone have advice for products I could use, protective hairstyles, or whether I should cut more of my hair? Anything would help—thank you.\n\nMy routine..\n\nAs I am Bond Shampoo and condition. I shampoo and condition my hair every Sunday. My hair dresser told me that shampooing and conditioning is not a daily thing, if this is wrong please feel free to let me know.\n\nAfter my shower, I detangle my hair and put in a leave in conditioner from Mielle, I then twist my hair and put it in a bonnet. My routine is lack luster and shouts “I don’t know what I’m doing”.",

      "content": "I’m new to Reddit so apologies in advance \n\nBasically what the title says. I have curly hair and every time I blow it out straight (I use the revlon brush) it reverts to curly pretty soon after. The same thing happens when I get it done at a hair salon. Doesn’t matter about humidity/rain etc, it will curl back up when I’m just in my room.\n\nI’ve tried the WOW Dreamcoat, different hair mousses and other humidity protectants but none have helped. My hair doesn’t get frizzy, it just curls. This doesn’t happen as quickly when I use a straightener but using an iron always makes my hair look stiff and dry. I’ve tried using the iron after the revlon brush but unless I straighten my whole head the same thing happens.\n\nHas anyone had this problem before and have any advice on how I could keep my blowouts straight??",

I’ve never really struggled with acne before, so this is completely new for me.\n\nI’ve been using Bulldog (UK) face wash, face scrub, and moisturizer, but it hasn’t helped at all.\n\nNothing in my diet or stress levels has changed recently — this just seems to have appeared out of nowhere.\n\nHas anyone else experienced sudden adult acne like this? What actually worked for you? I’m feeling pretty lost and desperate for some guidance as I know nothing about skincare.\n\nI would really like to know if anyone has insight to the cause of this and has some advice to establish a routine to fix it.\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

I use Bear shampoo and Tresemme Smooth &amp; Shine conditioner. Haven’t oiled my hair in months.\n\nNow I’m starting to think this salty water has been slowly killing my hair.

I want to see how it does if I add protein to my routine. My hair does better with lightweight sprays vs creams and mousse. I have hip to butt length hair so I go through a lot of product. Cheaper options are preferred but not required if they actually work. \n\n**Any suggestions for a daily protein spray? Cruelty free required. Light on scent, unscented preferred. No floral scents at all. I have chronic migraines and unfortunately scents are a trigger for me.**\n\nMy routine: I wash every 3 days with Jason's Scalp Care Shampoo, followed Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil. I style with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Leave-In Conditioner and Aussie Instant Freeze Sculpting Gel. I will often also spritz with Aussie Instant Freeze Non-Aero Hair Spray especially on work days.\n\nI will sometimes refresh with Camille Rose Rosemary Water but not convinced it has done anything. Might use Shea Moisture's Coconut and Hibiscus Hold &amp; Shine Mist but its heavy on scent. Add gel as needed again. Once a month I deep cleanse with Kinky Curly Come Clean and Follow with Mielle Babassu &amp; Mint Deep Conditioner.",

Historically that worked well for me and my hair would dry like in the last 4 photos attached.\n\nHowever, I bleached my hair in 2020 and rebleached to touch up a few times until I let it grow out. I then bleached it again in 2022 and rebleached it a few times until I dyed it back to brown. I haven’t used any heat, bleach or dye since that point but my hair has never been the same. I asked a hairdresser if the bleached could have caused this, but she said it’s been too long since then and my hair should have repaired.\n\nThe first two photos are of my hair recently and my curls are weighed down and lifeless and my hair generally looks like it has less volume and thickness than before, even though my hair has always been thin and fine.\n\nFor context, my hair doesn’t grow longer than what is picture so I have cut my hair only a few times in my life, which I do myself to trim and shape.\n\nI would really appreciate any advice, whether that’s I need to chop it all off and start over or if I need to look at protein treatments.

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",
