After that, I brush through again to distribute the products evenly and lock in definition.\n\nFor drying, I diffuse upside down on high heat, focusing first on my roots until they’re dry. Then I switch to low heat, flipping my head side to side to dry the ends and boost volume. Once it's totally dry I scrunch and usually separate some of the clumps.\n\nAs you can see, I’m a bit of an Original Moxie stan. It's expensive, but has been my holy grail!",

There’s a lot of products out there right now that promises to do this and that - the majority seems to be aimed at a younger demographic, with very few anti-aging, age-defying lines. Stripped of marketing, 1) does older hair need its own formulation 2) can or has it been done? ",

My skin is oily and extremely sensitive and in recent years has become dry/dehydrated around my mouth/nose/chin. My nose itself is still oily but the folds on the side will become very itchy and dry. I work in an office and it’s so humiliating to see myself around 2pm and realize that the bottom half of my face has been flaking off for who knows how long. My routine in the AM is la roche posay gentle foaming cleansing oil, skin1004 Centella ampoule, Dr. Jart Hydro Plump Water Cream, and Mixsoon Bean Sunscreen. In the PM it is the same cleanser, skin 1004 centella ampoule, skin 1004 pro bio cica intensive ampoule, and the dr. Jart ceramidin cream. These products should all by helping but this issue continues and it’s driving me insane.",

What can I do to keep it fresh on day two and three?\n\nCurrent routine - curlsmith volumising shampoo and conditioner (with a clarifying shampoo once every few washes), curlsmith oil in cream after each wash, and jvn oil on my fringe (I have a micro fringe which I like to keep straight and sleek).

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

When my consultation was done, my wife casually asked about her face. She had had these scars from her college days which didn't bother her at all.   \nThe doctor suggested her some treatments,which she got done eventually post some research and had a drastic improvement.   \nThe problem is that she has become a little obsessed now, almost to the point of addiction. She keeps going to the doctor every month or so now for something or the other. This is not a rant about the doctor, she is very sweet and sincere and great at what she does, she would even tell my wife to take it slow. My wife is spending around 30k a month on this.  \nI mean we're well off, own a house in a posh society on the golf course road in ggn. The money is not really a problem, in fact it's a small fraction of what we earn.  \nShe justifies it by saying she feels beautiful and feels very confident and has become more social now, but I feel that this is an unhealthy obsession. I mean, we're all ageing, it's the inevtiable truth.  \nI've tried to have this conversation with her, but she deflects it by saying Zindagi na milegi dobara and other similar bs. Does anyone else have experience with this sort of thing?? How did you tackle it?",

      "content": "Hello, I (20F) am having extreme difficulty rehabilitating my hair. For context, my hair used to look pretty nice, but I lost a lot of it due to an eating disorder. Stress also caused it to thin, and when I tried to rehabilitate it by getting faux locs, my braider did them so tightly that a bunch of hair was ripped out.\n\nI used to straighten my hair weekly because I preferred it straight rather than curly—hence the heat damage. Some parts of my hair are now straighter than others. I’ve never been good at taking care of curly hair because I was so used to wearing it straight, but now I’m trying to learn how to wear it natural. It’s been really overwhelming because there are so many sources saying to use this or that, and to do this or that, and I feel like whatever I’m doing clearly isn’t working because my hair looks like shit, lol.\n\nIt’s one of my biggest insecurities. These are pictures of my hair after I got a big chop; I went to a hairdresser to cut off any heat-damaged parts. Does anyone have advice for products I could use, protective hairstyles, or whether I should cut more of my hair? Anything would help—thank you.\n\nMy routine..\n\nAs I am Bond Shampoo and condition. I shampoo and condition my hair every Sunday. My hair dresser told me that shampooing and conditioning is not a daily thing, if this is wrong please feel free to let me know.\n\nAfter my shower, I detangle my hair and put in a leave in conditioner from Mielle, I then twist my hair and put it in a bonnet. My routine is lack luster and shouts “I don’t know what I’m doing”.",

      "title": "Bad k tip installation?",
      "content": "Hey all, \n\nI just spent $1300 on hair/k tip installation and I’m a little stunned at how it turned out. I’ve been seeing the same stylist for a while for color/cut, I’ve never had extensions before but she said she had experience with them. \n\nA little background - I had a lot of hormonal hair loss when I stopped birth control in January, I am now almost 6 months pregnant and my hair has completely stopped shedding. I wanted to add a few k tips for volume, and then I decided to keep a little length too. They feel very heavy and are painful, im concerned if I keep them, they are gonna do some crazy damage to my already fragile hair. How do I go about fixing this?  I added a pic of my hair beforehand too.  I spent so much money on these, but I’m not in a place where I can be uncomfortable and anxious about my hair on top of being pregnant - these were supposed to make it easier. \n\nThanks! ",
