Using a Bounce Curl brush, I detangle each section and then apply my products in this order: leave-in, mousse, and gel. After that, I brush through again to distribute the products evenly and lock in definition.\n\nFor drying, I diffuse upside down on high heat, focusing first on my roots until they’re dry. Then I switch to low heat, flipping my head side to side to dry the ends and boost volume. Once it's totally dry I scrunch and usually separate some of the clumps.\n\nAs you can see, I’m a bit of an Original Moxie stan. It's expensive, but has been my holy grail!",

      "content": "Hi! I have what I think is 2c hair and it is pretty much completely healthy (i think). I do not put heat on it unless I go to the salon, and I do not dye my hair either. I had keratin, (around 5 treatments), but the last one was over 4 years ago. I did end up letting my hair grow out for about 2 years and cut off all the dead ends (it was a LOT of hair). Now, i think my hair is super healthy. I recently cut it about a week ago so it can fully grow long and soft. \nI guess my question is can anyone recommend a good shampoo and conditioner? \n\nmy main concerns are frizz and growth, and the only products I use after I wash my hair are the Mizani Leave In Conditioner and the Design Essentials Almond &amp; Avocado Curl Enhancing Mousse. I always brush my hair, use the leave in first and then I just hand scrunch my hair after applying the mousse and let it air dry. I feel like at times my hair after styling and air drying doesnt really have much bounce to it. It is kind of dull and my curls are severely lacking definition. Btw I also lose a decent amount of hair in the shower, and it’s long strands. is this normal? \n\nI used Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner for like 3 years. I used the pink bottle, the white bottle and the blue bottle. Since cutting my hair I went to the store to buy a new shampoo and tried the Redken AllSoft for Mega Curls, but it was way too much for my hair. Then I exchanged it for the Redken Extreme Shampoo (dark blue bottle) and I don’t know how to feel about it. I used each of those one time so far. Are they more for damaged hair? I also know they have protein in them and I’m not sure if healthy hair needs that? I have also noticed that my scalp smells bad the day after washing. Does that mean I need a clarifying shampoo? and if so, are there any ones that are non drying? \n \nHonestly if someone wants to recommend me a complete hair routine I would be so appreciative. Above I have attached photos of my hair \n(explanation for each photo below)\n\n1- first wash after my most recent hair cut (november 2025) (mousse and leave in used) \n2- after first wash of hair cut before the most recent one (early september 2025)(first time using mousse and leave in mentioned) \n3&amp;4- before first hair cut in 2 1/2 years (march 2025) \n5- result of first wash after that first hair cut (march 2025) (no product)\n\nMy main questions are: \n1. is it normal to be losing long strands of hair in the shower \n2. please recommend me shampoo conditioner as well as any styling products, brushes etc. \n3. how do I prevent frizz \n4. how can I get my hair to look its absolute best \n5. how can i get it to grow strong and healthy?

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

My hair is fine, greasy scalp and dry brittle ends.\n\nThis top layer does not seem to grow for the last 2 years. I stopped wearing high ponytails, i use conditioners, masks for 2 years now.. the rest of my hair seems better and it does slowly grow, but this top layer remains the same. I do not know what happened, i did have c ovid 3 times but i dont remember losing a bunch of hair then. I did wear a lot of tight ponytails 3 years ago, when i stared going to the gym. Could that cause such breakage? But i really dont wear ponytails for more than a year and it does not get better\n \nI used to have long hair, it always was a  bit brittle but at least they were all the same lenght (in high school at one point i had my hair to my waist)...\n\nI was thinking of trying the redken acidic bonding line? And buying a silk pilowcase...\nDo you think b-vitamins or sth. Like that would help?\n\nIf anyone has any idea what to do, let me know.

Then use cake curl mousse. Then put in Ouia curl cream followed by eco style coconut gel. Then I use keratase oil. \n\n3: I wash my hair 2-3 times a week and oil my ends every night. I use a silk pillowcase. I also use k18 bonding treatment every 2 weeks since I  get high lifts done on my roots every 6 weeks (no bleach). I live in an EXTREMELY dry and cold climate (northern Canada). I haven’t had a hair cut in a few months because I’m not sure the best cut to get for my curls and what kind of cut is easy to style.

      "content": "I have 3b/c hair that’s very fine and medium to low density. And it has absolutely no height whatsoever. It grows downwards instead of out, so I can’t really get any volume on top. \n\nI want my hair to be more spherical With the ends lifting away from the head instead of going downward. Similar to Ilana Glazer’s hair. But no matter what I’ve tried it hasn’t worked. Not hair clips while drying, not curly cuts, and not any any products. What should I do?\n\nAnd the picture isn’t the best representation of my hair. This was just one of the only pictures I had with my hair styled in any way. Usually, my hair is much more curly than this. It’s more like tight-ish spirals with some sharpie-width ringlets floating around. \n\nMy routine:  \n\nMiss Jessie’s leave-in condish followed by Curlsmith Miracle Shield heat protectant and Dippity Doo gel. Then I separate my hair into small sections and use a Denman brush before scrunching and diffusing. Then I sleep in a silk bonnet on top of a silk pillowcase. \nJ\nWash days are twice a week. Prescription shampoo and a regular conditioner the first day, deep conditioner the second. I wear a heat cap over my hair on deep condition days. \n\nTo refresh, a clothing steamer for the majority of the hair, a mist sprayer for the flyaways. ",
