I gifted her a curly hair set a few yrs ago, but I don't think they are still using curly hair products.  I want, if it even exist, a gift set that includes a  brush/comb, but most importantly, that comes with instructions on what to do with each product. My cousin has straight fine har that looks great just washed and brushed, so they have no idea how to properly set the girls hair. She's 10 now, so if it is easy enought, she may be able to do it herself now.  Picture if what her hair looks on the regular.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nHer hair routine as far as I know.\n1.

New potential treatments just fizzle out and go nowhere. Usually there's only ever one on the horizon. Everyone gets excited, and then it goes kaput. \n\nThe end of 2025, though, is definitely ending better than the previous ones.\n\nNot only are we getting closer to effective treatment, we're pretty close to more than one.\n\nBreezula, VDPHL01, and PP405 are all about to enter Phase 3 or have entered it already. While obviously we just don't know yet, it seems that all three of them more or less work. To what degree, we've yet to find out, but it doesn't look like any of them are complete duds.\n\nFurthermore, if they all pass Phase 3, they'll be released within a close time frame of each other, giving their companies strong incentive to make them affordable. It sure feels like Breezula is being slammed through because it may become obsolete very quickly if PP405 performs better. \n\nIf nothing else, we'll at least have the Phase 2 results we've been waiting so long for. \n\nI'd love to know what's going on with ET-02 and SCUBE3. \n\nBut for now, I'm grateful that it looks like we'll have at least a couple of treatments that will be worth a damn.

Unfortunately, I had to stop because my dermatologist-prescribed tret became hard to access. While I was on it, it did a great job controlling my breakouts. I’ve since switched back to benzoyl peroxide 0.5%, which is more accessible for me.\n\nMy main concern now is PIE and PIH—something I’ve been struggling with since starting tretinoin last year (December 2024). Acne is mostly under control, but the marks just won’t budge.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nAM: Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser - Cos De Baha Azelaic Acid 15% - Cetaphil Cream Moisturizer - Cetaphil Sunscreen\n\nPM: Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser - Benzoyl Peroxide 0.5% - Cetaphil Cream Moisturizer\n\nI’m thinking of adding Cos De Baha Tranexamic Acid 5% + Niacinamide 5% Serum to target these stubborn PIE and PIH marks.\n\nDo you think this would be a good addition to my routine? Where would you suggest placing it, and are there any potential conflicts with what I’m already using? I’d really appreciate your thoughts—thank you!",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
