New potential treatments just fizzle out and go nowhere. Usually there's only ever one on the horizon. Everyone gets excited, and then it goes kaput. \n\nThe end of 2025, though, is definitely ending better than the previous ones.\n\nNot only are we getting closer to effective treatment, we're pretty close to more than one.\n\nBreezula, VDPHL01, and PP405 are all about to enter Phase 3 or have entered it already. While obviously we just don't know yet, it seems that all three of them more or less work. To what degree, we've yet to find out, but it doesn't look like any of them are complete duds.\n\nFurthermore, if they all pass Phase 3, they'll be released within a close time frame of each other, giving their companies strong incentive to make them affordable. It sure feels like Breezula is being slammed through because it may become obsolete very quickly if PP405 performs better. \n\nIf nothing else, we'll at least have the Phase 2 results we've been waiting so long for. \n\nI'd love to know what's going on with ET-02 and SCUBE3. \n\nBut for now, I'm grateful that it looks like we'll have at least a couple of treatments that will be worth a damn.

(pics 2 and 3 were rn)\n\ni really feel like i fucked myself over. i would do almost anything for my skin 5 months ago. i dont know if the tretinoin is helping (0.025% dosage), and my skin feels inflamed and disgusting all the time.\n\nroutine\n\n* wash face with orien oil cleanser over sink (dry face)\n* get in the shower and rinse it ALL out\n* sandwich method cetaphil moisturizing cream ultimate with .025% tretinoin\n\nthats literally it. i stopped with the q tips (pic 4) at the end of september until yesterday when i got a 300 pack from amazon. its so tempting and i know it fucks my skin over, but i dont know how to get rid of the sebum plugs. i feel like if i leave em my pores will stretch but if i extract them they will do the exact same. i dont know how to remove them, and its a mix of sebum and keratin plugs. they are hard, and im not sure how to get rid of them since i have sensitive-ish skin)\n\nplease forgive me i am an academically stressed out teenager.",

      "content": "Hi all! For a bit of background, I took accutane for about 7 months, and my last dose was nearly 3 years ago. During and since, my face is always at least somewhat flushed (sometimes badly). It feels dry, hot, &amp; tight almost all of the time, no matter what I do. It sometimes looks like rosacea (bumps, etc.) and sometimes it just looks really red. My dermatologist told me that tretinoin would make it go away, but it has made it exponentially worse every time.\n\nSo, I’ve stopped using it, and started using Cerave hydrating cleanser and the tub moisturizer, as well as Musely’s Red Rescue cream. It worked very well for awhile, and now it just doesn’t anymore. I also have the Dr. Jart’s cream/paste, but I have to put so much on that it ends up looking cakey. For reference, my cheeks and nose are red most of the time, and sometimes my chin as well.\n\nI’ve been trying to stay away from makeup to avoid more irritation, but I was wondering if anyone had any product or routine suggestions for me? I would appreciate literally anything! I am pretty much clueless in the skincare realm, so anything would help!\n\nThank you!!",

      "content": "I hate being ugly. I hate the fact that i don't have any photos of myself that I like. I don't have any photos with loved family members that I like. I hate the thought that if they died and all I have to look back on is a photo with them but not likening how I look. I hate how I sound so selfish when saying this because they are much bigger issues in the world than what I look like. I can't tell what's true and what's not. I will look in the mirror one hour, the next I look completely different. I don't know what I truly look like. I feel like a beast. I would be one of the witches in one of the old movies. It makes me go insane not knowing what I look like. And it may not make sense to anyone else, they say look in a mirror or get a photo taken. But I look different in every single one. I hate the fact I can't just walk down the street without being conscious of how everyone is staring at me and they are all thinking the same thing. How can she be so confident when she looks like that. I fake my confidence. I have no idea how to truly act or be. I can't explain my feelings it only truly makes sense to me. I remember being 5 years old in primary school looking in the bathroom mirror wondering why I'm so different and why nobody likes me. And still to this day I think the same thing. My brain feels like it's going to explode. It's been such a big thing for me that consumes me every single day of my life. Life would be so much easier if I was naturally beautiful. I think back to my first ever childhood best friend. She was perfect. She was skinny, she had the prettiest face, a tiny nose, thick dark brunette slick straight long hair, the bluest eyes, normal ears and a pretty smile, an amazing jawline and a tiny chin. Me on the other hand, I have frizzy curly ginger hair, I have a weird lob sided jaw, I have a huge chin that sticks out when I smile, I have a huge bridge nose, tiny brown eyes, deformed ears, im fat and pale. Teachers always saw me different too. I was the ugly duckling. And because I was so quiet that didn't help either. So I would always observe every little thing and I guess over the years I put it down to me being unattractive meant nobody would ever like me. I tried lots of different things to change myself. Dye my hair, use fake tan, change my style, straighten my hair, use makeup, not eat anything to loose weight. So on so on. Nothing ever worked. I was always seen as the quiet weird ugly kid. In high school things got worse. Even my own best friend saw me as ugly then. That hurt the most. Having her blank me in class because she was with the pretty popular group and I wasn't apart of that. I'm crying my eyes out writing this. I guess my brain coming the the conclusion that the feeling will never go away. Knowing that I've tried for years hoping that maybe it's all a false illusion when it clearly isn't. Knowing that for the rest of my life I'm never going to have photos of me to look back on where I look pretty. It kills me. Being a teenage girl on a night out trying to enjoy herself with someone you thought was your friend and being called ugly by some stranger on the street. Being a teenage girl and only ever being used for your body for sex. Never being truly liked as a person. Never truly being seen as pretty or beautiful. Never having a boyfriend. Never been in love. Never been loved. Makes you question what's wrong with you. Knowing you have the sweetest souls ever and is kind to everyone and is never mean to anybody yet being treated the worst. My dad said I got scouted to model as a kid. He turned it down as he wanted me to have a childhood. Now I'm grown up I wish he took that chance. Maybe I would had saw myself as beautiful. Or if the modelling industry is just as bad they scout people who look different and I'm not actually beautiful. Do people stare at me because I'm ugly or because I'm pretty but quiet and mysterious and they wonder what a girl like me is living so ordinarily for. I don't know maybe that's the other side of my brain being delusional to survive and have a different outlook on things so I can survive. People say looks don't matter but they do. They impact everything. Every little thing. No matter how busy I make myself to distract myself from my appearance it never goes away. I see everyone else as beautiful though. I love humans. Humans who are kind anyway. Travelling around the world makes you see things differently and makes you appreciate what you have a lot more. I have so much yet why can't I be happy with myself. Seeing other girls my age, being able to go out and enjoy life and take photos and kiss boys, they are all so photogenic. Why not me? I feel like a waste. It's like I'm in a prison cage locked behind a window constantly watching others but never able to join in. I can't speak for the life of me. Why can others do it so naturally. It just makes me question myself over and over until I have a meltdown and harm myself because I hate myself so much. I feel like I'm trapped inside my body and can't escape. And time just keeps going fast and faster and I feel so lost. Like I'm missing out on so much life even though I am living. I wish I could make sense of my own brain.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

The next day I felt no irritation and thought maybe I put too much moisturizer. No irritation is a good thing tho. I was going to wait till the 14th to try it again.\n\nSo today 12/13/2025 I try for the first time in the AM:\n\nPaula's Choice Resist Advanced Replenishing Face Toner, Anti-Aging Facial Toner with Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C &amp; E\n\nAnd\n\nPaula's Choice SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant with Salicylic Acid\n\nIt is suggested to use the 2 together, which I did with LA ROCHE-POSAY double repair moisturizer. MY SKIN LOOKED GREAT afterwards with no irritation. I was very happy about it. \n\nSo I had an event to go to in the evening and I washed my face and applied TruSkin Vitamin C Serum For Face – Anti Aging Face Serum with Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E with tiege Hanley super serum (which has been PART of my usual AM routine) and didn’t have irritation UNTIL I got home.\n\nMy forehead mainly feels like it has sunburn with NO redness(so far). What could have caused this reaction? \n\nBefore using Retin-A I was using MEDITHERAPY Retinal Skin Booster Serum for 2+ months and for the last 2 weeks I have been using it daily and before that every other day. I don’t think it was Retin-A but who knows. \n\n\nDoes anyone know what may have caused this reaction? Any responses or answers will be greatly appreciated. I am a 40yr male. \n\nThanks",

I’ve been using these products for years, and don’t put them on my eyes. Is it possible to have a sudden sensitivity to niacinamide? I know other people have had similar reactions. I’ve also changed my face wash and tried several different things to figure out the cause and I’m starting to believe it is the skincare products.
