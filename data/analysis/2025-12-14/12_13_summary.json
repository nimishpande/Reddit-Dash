Any help would be incredibly appreciated! ❤️",

      "content": "Hi all, I am a 19 year old college student who recently began a combination of the typical doses of oral minoxidil and finasteride.\n\nTo those wondering, I did initially experience adverse side effects, like decreased libido and ED (at 19, crazy right), but they have since gotten much better 😉\n\nMy medication trajectory played out just as you might’ve imagined; I began and experienced an insane shedding. Now, keep in mind that I decided to take action against hair loss early; I probably could have gone another year without even noticing I was balding. However, I decided to be proactive. So I ended up losing a ton of volume in my hair, which stopped after about two months of constant shedding.\n\nSince the shedding stage stopped, I noticed small, ever darkening baby hairs growing at my hairline—I had hope. I felt that I was taking control of something that many cannot. However, I got ahead of myself.\n\nMonths have gone by, and I have noticed a gradual thinning of hair all over the top of my head. This has made it so that my once thick and luscious hair is now the consistency of thin strands of spaghetti. On top of this, it appears that my hairline is continuing to recede. The only affected (noticeable) parts during my initial shedding stage and overall alopecia before beginning the medication cycle was at my temples, or the corners of my hairline. I have since noticed that the mid section of my hairline is gradually going backwards. While there are many nearly invisible baby hairs growing here, I am very discouraged at the moment. The hair regrowth i experienced at my temples is also receding—but not as you might think. Somehow, the initial hair that has already began regrowth remains, but the hair behind it is receding?? I don’t get it. You can see it in the series of photos I’ve attached.\n\nToday marks month 5 of treatment, on the dot. I don’t know how to explain what’s happening because it’s truly been a rollercoaster. I don’t know if this is expected or if the treatment is even working at all. Did I experience a temporary positive from the minoxidil? Is the finasteride not slowing recession at all? I would love some sort of explanation or comparison if anyone here has any words to offer from their own experience or an actual scientific explanation.\n\nIf anyone can offer any words or advice or simply an explanation, that would be much appreciated. I truly thought this was going well and that starting so early would be a plus, but it doesn’t feel like it.\n\nThank you. If you have questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.\n\n5 MONTHS IN 🫡",

Could that be only a genetics issue? I didn't have any wrinkles a few years ago and I can't stop compare myself to my friends, most of them, even 10 years older, don't have such deep wrinkles.\n\n  \nIt really affects my self confidence.  \nOne eye is more affected than the other but I don't drive and I don't sleep on the side of the most affected eye either.  \n\n\nRegarding the routine I have a simple cleanser + moisturizer and I use suncreams every time I go out in the summer.\n\nAny idea what could help?

I know it's not just excessive breakage because I treat my hair so gently and it actually grows pretty fast. Also, the frizz is resistant to any oil or serum trying to make it go away so I am at a loss.\n\nI realized this summer I might have slight texture (1C/2A?), and got my hair nice a few times. I didn't have much time to practice during uni, but now that it's winter I feel like it's harder. I live in a really dry climate. I truly enjoy the look from photo 1, but can't get the definition to last until the end of the day. My hair is long and maybe I'm using too heavy of products so it just eventually falls, I'm guessing.\n\nI have the AG curl trigger spray that I will try tomorrow, but would love any and all suggestions. Especially for finding products to improve longevity, as well as techniques. I would love a conditioner reccomendation because I don't think the Fino hair mask is CG approved.\n\nThanks!!\n",
