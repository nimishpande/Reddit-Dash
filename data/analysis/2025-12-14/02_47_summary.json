      "content": "\n\n\nHey everyone,\n\nAfter reading so many transformation stories here, I finally gathered the confidence to share my own. It’s been a full 12 months since my journey began, and honestly, choosing to go ahead with a hair transplant has been one of the best decisions of my life.\n\nI’m a 41-year-old doctor, but for years I looked much older than my actual age. I had a very large forehead, strong frontalis muscle activity, and a badly receding hairline. It affected me more than I’d like to admit. I avoided mirrors, disliked being photographed, and slowly my confidence started fading. I run a small hospital, so looking constantly tired or stressed didn’t help either.\n\nThe Surgery &amp; Choosing the Right Doctor\nI had been thinking about a hair transplant for a long time, but time was always an issue. Traveling to another city felt exhausting, and I was very clear about one thing—I didn’t want a “hair mill” setup where technicians do everything. I wanted a qualified doctor who personally performs the procedure.\n\nThrough one of my colleagues, I came across a doctor in Patna, and from the very first consultation, I felt comfortable. What impressed me most was that he didn’t just talk about the number of grafts—he talked about aesthetics. He carefully studied my face, age, muscle movement, and skin laxity, and explained why my case needed a customized approach.\n\nFirst Sitting &amp; Setbacks\nMy first surgery involved 3,500 grafts. Unfortunately, soon after the procedure, I went through a very stressful personal phase. Because of that, I couldn’t follow the post-op routine properly—diet, supplements, and overall care were not ideal for almost six months. Naturally, this affected the results.\n\nBy the 8th month, the outcome was decent, but deep down I felt something was still missing.\n\nSecond Sitting – A Grateful Moment\nWhen I discussed this with my doctor, he was incredibly understanding. He agreed to a second sitting for refinement—free of charge, except for a minimal OT cost. I wanted a slightly lower hairline and better density, and around 1,800 additional grafts were added to enhance the hairline peak and blend everything naturally. I’m genuinely grateful for his honesty and support.\n\nHairline Design – The Game Changer\nThis is what truly changed everything.\n\nInstead of giving me a straight, artificial-looking hairline, he designed a:\n\nTriangular, age-appropriate hairline\n\nOne that perfectly matches my face shape and muscle movement\n\nNot too low, not too youthful—just natural and balanced\n\nThe Real Journey (No Sugarcoating)\nMonths 1–3: Shedding, anxiety, stress, and poor aftercare\n\nMonths 4–6: Early signs of growth\n\nMonth 7: Good density, but I wanted a lower hairline\n\nMonth 8: Second surgery for refinement (1,800 grafts)\n\nMonth 12: Major transformation\n\nSome areas are still improving, and since it’s only 4 months after the second sitting, I feel I might gain another 20–30% density.\n\nHow I Feel Today\nFor the first time in years, I don’t look constantly stressed or older than my age. I finally see a version of myself that feels right. The confidence this has given me—both personally and professionally—is something I can’t put a price on.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nA hair transplant isn’t just about getting hair back—it’s about getting your confidence back.\n\nIf you’re thinking about it:\n\nChoose a doctor who designs, not just implants\n\nBe patient—it’s a long journey\n\nTrust the process\n\nI’m finally at a place where I truly like how I look, and that feeling is priceless.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or share pictures if anyone wants",

Unfortunately, I had to stop because my dermatologist-prescribed tret became hard to access. While I was on it, it did a great job controlling my breakouts. I’ve since switched back to benzoyl peroxide 0.5%, which is more accessible for me.\n\nMy main concern now is PIE and PIH—something I’ve been struggling with since starting tretinoin last year (December 2024). Acne is mostly under control, but the marks just won’t budge.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nAM: Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser - Cos De Baha Azelaic Acid 15% - Cetaphil Cream Moisturizer - Cetaphil Sunscreen\n\nPM: Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser - Benzoyl Peroxide 0.5% - Cetaphil Cream Moisturizer\n\nI’m thinking of adding Cos De Baha Tranexamic Acid 5% + Niacinamide 5% Serum to target these stubborn PIE and PIH marks.\n\nDo you think this would be a good addition to my routine? Where would you suggest placing it, and are there any potential conflicts with what I’m already using? I’d really appreciate your thoughts—thank you!",

I am not a huge fan of matte lips so if there is possibly a satin-ish finish I would love that too as I typically don't wear heavy ,a.

New potential treatments just fizzle out and go nowhere. Usually there's only ever one on the horizon. Everyone gets excited, and then it goes kaput. \n\nThe end of 2025, though, is definitely ending better than the previous ones.\n\nNot only are we getting closer to effective treatment, we're pretty close to more than one.\n\nBreezula, VDPHL01, and PP405 are all about to enter Phase 3 or have entered it already. While obviously we just don't know yet, it seems that all three of them more or less work. To what degree, we've yet to find out, but it doesn't look like any of them are complete duds.\n\nFurthermore, if they all pass Phase 3, they'll be released within a close time frame of each other, giving their companies strong incentive to make them affordable. It sure feels like Breezula is being slammed through because it may become obsolete very quickly if PP405 performs better. \n\nIf nothing else, we'll at least have the Phase 2 results we've been waiting so long for. \n\nI'd love to know what's going on with ET-02 and SCUBE3. \n\nBut for now, I'm grateful that it looks like we'll have at least a couple of treatments that will be worth a damn.

I want, if it even exist, a gift set that includes a  brush/comb, but most importantly, that comes with instructions on what to do with each product. My cousin has straight fine har that looks great just washed and brushed, so they have no idea how to properly set the girls hair. She's 10 now, so if it is easy enought, she may be able to do it herself now.  Picture if what her hair looks on the regular.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nHer hair routine as far as I know.\n1.

Recently a friend's mom who's a doc got to know about it through my friend and she told me and my mom all the side effects it has. I checked on chatgpt it said it doesn't cause any major side effects with this dosage. But my mom isn't convinced. My mom took away the 15 tabs that I had of isotretinoin and told me i don't need them anymore so i should stop as she says my skin has improved now. I believe i should atleast complete those 15 tablets and then visit the new dermat later whenever possible as I've exams coming up in a while. Should I convince my mom to give me those? Or is it really that bad that i should stop? Pls help.\n\nAlso pls tell me if anyone had a similar skin condition like mine and anything else other than isotretinoin that helped them?",
