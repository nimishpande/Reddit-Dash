New potential treatments just fizzle out and go nowhere. Usually there's only ever one on the horizon. Everyone gets excited, and then it goes kaput. \n\nThe end of 2025, though, is definitely ending better than the previous ones.\n\nNot only are we getting closer to effective treatment, we're pretty close to more than one.\n\nBreezula, VDPHL01, and PP405 are all about to enter Phase 3 or have entered it already. While obviously we just don't know yet, it seems that all three of them more or less work. To what degree, we've yet to find out, but it doesn't look like any of them are complete duds.\n\nFurthermore, if they all pass Phase 3, they'll be released within a close time frame of each other, giving their companies strong incentive to make them affordable. It sure feels like Breezula is being slammed through because it may become obsolete very quickly if PP405 performs better. \n\nIf nothing else, we'll at least have the Phase 2 results we've been waiting so long for. \n\nI'd love to know what's going on with ET-02 and SCUBE3. \n\nBut for now, I'm grateful that it looks like we'll have at least a couple of treatments that will be worth a damn.

(pics 2 and 3 were rn)\n\ni really feel like i fucked myself over. i would do almost anything for my skin 5 months ago. i dont know if the tretinoin is helping (0.025% dosage), and my skin feels inflamed and disgusting all the time.\n\nroutine\n\n* wash face with orien oil cleanser over sink (dry face)\n* get in the shower and rinse it ALL out\n* sandwich method cetaphil moisturizing cream ultimate with .025% tretinoin\n\nthats literally it. i stopped with the q tips (pic 4) at the end of september until yesterday when i got a 300 pack from amazon. its so tempting and i know it fucks my skin over, but i dont know how to get rid of the sebum plugs. i feel like if i leave em my pores will stretch but if i extract them they will do the exact same. i dont know how to remove them, and its a mix of sebum and keratin plugs. they are hard, and im not sure how to get rid of them since i have sensitive-ish skin)\n\nplease forgive me i am an academically stressed out teenager.",

The next day I felt no irritation and thought maybe I put too much moisturizer. No irritation is a good thing tho. I was going to wait till the 14th to try it again.\n\nSo today 12/13/2025 I try for the first time in the AM:\n\nPaula's Choice Resist Advanced Replenishing Face Toner, Anti-Aging Facial Toner with Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C &amp; E\n\nAnd\n\nPaula's Choice SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant with Salicylic Acid\n\nIt is suggested to use the 2 together, which I did with LA ROCHE-POSAY double repair moisturizer. MY SKIN LOOKED GREAT afterwards with no irritation. I was very happy about it. \n\nSo I had an event to go to in the evening and I washed my face and applied TruSkin Vitamin C Serum For Face – Anti Aging Face Serum with Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E with tiege Hanley super serum (which has been PART of my usual AM routine) and didn’t have irritation UNTIL I got home.\n\nMy forehead mainly feels like it has sunburn with NO redness(so far). What could have caused this reaction? \n\nBefore using Retin-A I was using MEDITHERAPY Retinal Skin Booster Serum for 2+ months and for the last 2 weeks I have been using it daily and before that every other day. I don’t think it was Retin-A but who knows. \n\n\nDoes anyone know what may have caused this reaction? Any responses or answers will be greatly appreciated. I am a 40yr male. \n\nThanks",

During and since, my face is always at least somewhat flushed (sometimes badly). It feels dry, hot, &amp; tight almost all of the time, no matter what I do. It sometimes looks like rosacea (bumps, etc.) and sometimes it just looks really red. My dermatologist told me that tretinoin would make it go away, but it has made it exponentially worse every time.\n\nSo, I’ve stopped using it, and started using Cerave hydrating cleanser and the tub moisturizer, as well as Musely’s Red Rescue cream. It worked very well for awhile, and now it just doesn’t anymore. I also have the Dr. Jart’s cream/paste, but I have to put so much on that it ends up looking cakey. For reference, my cheeks and nose are red most of the time, and sometimes my chin as well.\n\nI’ve been trying to stay away from makeup to avoid more irritation, but I was wondering if anyone had any product or routine suggestions for me? I would appreciate literally anything! I am pretty much clueless in the skincare realm, so anything would help!\n\nThank you!!",

I got prescribed Elidel cream and they got better within a few days. 2 weeks ago the same issue flared up again and avene cicaflate has helped with the dry skin, but I still wake up with swollen irritated eyes, that get very teary at night.\n\nMy skincare routine at night is all the ordinary products: hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, salicylic acid (cut this out to see if it was the issue but it’s not), and their thicker moisturizer. I’ve been using these products for years, and don’t put them on my eyes. Is it possible to have a sudden sensitivity to niacinamide? I know other people have had similar reactions. I’ve also changed my face wash and tried several different things to figure out the cause and I’m starting to believe it is the skincare products. Any advice would be greatly appreciated thank you!!",

I've since finished my meds and my skin is back to its old self :/ \n\nI looked into it and I guess the meds killed the bacteria which cleared it up and it also said that using benzol peroxide can do the same thing??
