I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

To start, I know next to nothing about skincare, and it's always been trial and error for what works and what doesn't. I used to have oily skin, then went on accutane (8 years ago) and now have very dry skin.  I use several products from the CosRX line, but by the end of the day, my skin is scaly and almost painful it's so dry. I'm 27, and I'm starting to notice my skin aging faster than it should. I drink almost a gallon of water a day, and I use the pictured products in that order, with the vitamin E serum being every 2 days.  I do have acne scars, and very sensitive skin. I've tried asking for advice from the Ulta workers, but they always have something they're earning commission on and will recommend that whether it will work for me or not. I had an allergic reaction the last time they recommended me something, so now I'm a little more hesitant to ask for their advice. Any advice is super appreciated!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Now here's the issue the front part tends to get a really nice wave/curl, but the back of my hair STRUGGLES and the ends struggle slightly, im wondering if its something wrong in my technique or products, I only use a curl cream so far, and do the usual scrunch up, id say fresh out of the shower and out of towel wrap the waves are most prominent, then I brush threw once and do the rest, but they can never get to what they were before brushing it once, it just turns into this.",

A ponytail would maybe have the circumference of a US quarter? In the summer, I clipped all of it down to 1/4 in and have just let it do its own thing since. Not sure if I need a trip to a salon to tidy up my cut for the best outcome. For my routine, I tend to just use some cheap VO5 shampoo and conditioner about 2/3 times a week. Showers happen daily, but I don't clean my hair every time. For drying, I use a normal towel and let it air out, then brush and comb afterwards. Thank you in advance for any tips! I'm sorry if my hair type doesn't look very curly, but I promise it makes giant full spirals as it gets longer. I just would always straighten it in the past. ",

This has been a constant struggle for me despite trying new products (more products vs. less products, creams vs. lotions, mousse vs. gel, liquid oil vs. dry oil etc.), different methods (air drying, diffusing, plopping, scrunch &amp; pulse, shake &amp; rake, prayer hands, you name it), experimenting with protein vs. hydration, and anything else that seems like it might make a difference.\n\nI am really looking to enhance my natural wave pattern without weighing my hair down, but it seems like my hair ends up gritty and greasy, &amp; not “touchably soft” even if I use the smallest amount of product, plop, diffuse, sotc. My waves look awesome for a good 5 minutes after I finish my routine before the weight takes over &amp; makes everything look strung out.\n\nAs far as I can tell, I have 2b, low-porosity hair. I have very thick hair and fine individual strands. My hair is long, reaching my middle-lower back. My scalp isn’t particularly oily, but my ends are dry. I have lots of layers in my hair, and the underneath is thicker/more wiry, while the top layer of my hair gets frizzy &amp; bulks up like crazy.\n\nCurrently my routine looks like:\n\nWash (twice a week):\n\n\\* NYMN Tahitian Gardenia &amp; Mango Butter Curl Defining Shampoo &amp; Conditioner (I cleanse twice &amp; condition once)\n\n\\* Garnier Fructis Pure Clean Shampoo (used once a week to remove product build up)\n\n\\* Amika Hydrorush Hair Mask (used once a week for deep conditioning)\n\nStyle:\n\n\\* Ouidad Moisture Lock Whipped Curls (applied while hair is soaking wet in sections \\*just a little, about a silver dollar’s worth in all!\\*)\n\n\\* Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Heat &amp; Humidity Gel (applied right after while hair is still wet &amp; in sections \\*just a little, about a nickel’s worth for each 1/4 section\\*)\n\n\\* Hover diffuse before regular diffusing\n\n\\* Scrunch out the crunch with OGX Moroccan Argan Oil\n\nI refresh with Bumble &amp; Bumble Curl Refresh mixed with water in a spray bottle, scrunch, diffuse, oil the ends. I also sleep in a satin bonnet overnight.\n\nOut of frustration on my last wash, I only applied the Whipped Curls &amp; STILL my hair feels greasy &amp; dirty. I’m lost.\n\nI feel my biggest challenge is the low porosity part(?) &amp; getting my moisture just right, but honestly I am lost and am open to any and all advice.",

I'm a 24-year-old male, and I've heard that your mid-20s is a good time to start preventative retinol usage for aging.\n\nMy current routine consists of a simple cleanser and moisturizer specific for sensitive skin. My skin is so very sensitive I had to stop using a razor (I had to switch to an electric one) because I would get severe razor burns for days.\n\nI've heard that retinol can be a bit harsh, and I don't know what to buy to start. I was thinking of the 2% from The Ordinary, but I'm not sure it's the best option. Can someone help me?\n\nAlso, I should use it during my night routine after cleansing but before moisturizing, right?\n\nThanks to everyone who will answer.\n\nIf you need more info, just write the question in a comment.",

I wanted the blowout/voluminous look. \n\nLast night I spent 1 hour 30 mins (!!!) doing my hair with the shark and look how it looks the day after. Literally worse than if I hadn’t done anything to it. \n\nHere’s what I did (based on Reddit advice):\n1. Let my hair air dry like 40%, then used the shark dryer to dry the roots \n2. Separated hair into around 4 layers\n3. Added heat protectant, then a bit of tressame mousse to the whole length except roots (I think it’s the volume and lift one), then a bit of function of beauty texturising spray for straight hair (to each layer as I got to it)\n4. Used the curl attachment on very small pieces (1” or less) for around 20 secs on the hottest then 10-15 sec on cool shot (but the cool still feels really hot to me, anyone else??)\n4. Pinned the curls (but only until I got to the next layer, at which point I’d put it in a ponytail to separate it off)\n5. Hair spray when all done\n\nIt already almost completely fell out immediately, then at bedtime I put it into a really loose bun on top of my head and slept on a silk pillowcase. Woke up and combed with a wide tooth comb (my hair is so long it gets tangled if I don’t comb it, so sadly not combing is not an option).\n\nNow my hair feels dry and crusty from the product, NOT voluminous, not bouncy, and looks scraggly as if I never styled it. \n\nShould I just give up on the flexstyle? I was hoping I could just blowdry my hair with very little product and would still be able to comb it out but it’d still look voluminous a nice shape, but nope lmao. \n",

      "content": "My girlfriend has curly hair, her pattern being 3A with 3B. She recently went to a hair stylist which has over 13 years of experience with curly hair cutting and styling. Well, those 13 years did not do jack poop for my girlfriend. When she got out of there, her volume was nowhere to be seen, her curls, now waves. Long story short, she paid a lot for nothing. It's the third time in the city she tried getting someone to do her hair professionally and failed. It breaks my heart and it angers me to see her so devastated after so much trying. When we are at home, I do the styling. She washes and treats her hair with whatever is needed. Recently we even got into a ugly protein overload and we just went over it. What I ask of you, if you can, please, **help me understand how I can make her curls more curly**. Sadly, I don't make her hair be like those curls we see on TikTok, like every hair strand being curled to the root, jumpy and resilient. I will be detailing her routine below:\n\n**Shampooing:**\n\n\\-normal days: BIoderma Node A Soothing shampoo \n\n\\- clarifying shampoo: Paul Mitchell Awapuhi shampoo (once every 3 weeks)\n\nConditioner:\n\n\\- for every wash: Innersennse Color Radiance Daily Conditioner\n\nPurifying mask (when doing detox)\n\n\\- Bounce Curl Turmeric Purifying Hair &amp; Scalp Mask\n\nWhen curls don't last:\n\n\\-Curlsmith Bond Curl Rehab Salve\n\nWhen in need of moisture: \n\n\\-Briogeo Don't Despair, Repair deep conditioning mask ( 10-15 minutes under plastic wrap, heated with diffuser) \n\nWhen in need of protein\n\n\\- Ecoslay Matcha Boost with Quinoa &amp; Keratin, protein shake \n\nSTYLING \n\nHer hair is low porosity: water stays as droplets when using the spray bottle and her hair strand floats in a glass of water. \n\nThe order is this one: curl cream-mousse-gel-mousse. \n\nQuantity applied for each product: cream, a very small amount, pea sized, mousse, not too much either first time, about the size of a golf-ball, even smaller if the hair portion is smaller, gel, about half length of my pointing finger, again varies depending on the portion size. Finally, after sectioning and finishing to apply all products, mousse again, golf sized portion or a bit more, to scrunch in.  \n\nList of products used:\n\n\\-curl cream: **Ouidad Advanced Climate Control** \n\n\\-mousse: **Schwarzkopf Osis Volume&amp;Body Grip** \n\n\\-gel: **Boucleme curls redefined (super hold styler)** \n\nBrush used is **Volume EdgeLift** from Bouncecurl.\n\nHow I aplly them. \n\n1. Wet hair, using water spray bottle, one which shoots mist water. She is seated, head straight up. \n\n2. I section the hair like this:\n\nI use the brush's pointy tip to divide her hair right above her ear. The under part is the first big section, which I divide in another 3 or 4 sections. Each section is treated like this: \n\n1. Get wet\n\n2. Brush to detanlge\n\n3. Apply small amount of cream after rubbing very well in hands. \n\n4. Use brush, right under root, pull up and away from her head to create lift. Then with hand, I slightly make her lifter hair jump a bit to form curls (which sadly I did not ever form) \n\n5. Apply mousse, raking through hair then scrunching. (I listen for that squishy wet sound to see if its wet enough) \n\n6. Apply gel, prayer hand style or if too much hair, divide into 2 horizontal parts and use fingers, not raking, only for a bit. Scrunch in the end. \n\nAfter this big section, the next section is made using her eyebrows. The already done section i just put it through a satin scrunchy, not tightened it. When I get to the top section, which I always strive to be a rectangle of hair, I do it like this. \n\nI get it wet, brush it, apply cream to the whole part, and then do the exact same styling method. After I finish, she uses some mousse on her whole hair, upside down scrunching. She pats the extramoisture with a cotton shirt.  After this, she dries her hair with a wide diffuser upside down. Low heat always.  \n\n  \nFinal question: Should I just invest money in myself and get a course in curly hair cutting and styling or is there any other way I can make her hair be a reason for her to smile and be proud of ? **THANKS FOR TAKING YOUR TIME TO READ THIS, BE BLESSED WITH** ***ETERNAL CURLS.*** ",
