      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi all!\n\nI’ve been attempting to dye my hair blonde for over a year now with a stylist. I would say I started at about a level 5 dark brown, and I want to become a level 9-10 blonde.\n\nIn November 2024, I went just for a consult and showed inspo photos of an ashy level 10. I told her that I had previously boxed dyed my hair dark brown about 10 months prior, but with a test strand, she said she could get it to that level by summer 2025. My hair definitely was not at that point by the summer, and it still felt very brown.\n\nWe’ve done 6 sessions at this point. I just had another appointment on Friday, and I was very clear that I wanted to be as light blonde as she could possibly make me in that session. I again showed a few level 9–10 blonde inspo photos and explained that the last time I went (November), I left feeling unhappy because my hair was still too dark.\n\nBack in September, I left my appointment really happy and felt like we were making real progress toward blonde. But after November and now this most recent appointment, I feel like I’m sitting around a level 6. From September to November, it definitely became darker, and I'd say after my appointment on Friday, it's even darker than it was in November.\n\nMy question is how I should approach this with my stylist? I’m spending a lot of money, and each session takes about 5 hours, but I feel we are making no progress. I always tip well (around 35%), and I’m frustrated that I’m not getting the results I hoped for. Should I ask if she can fix it and bleach again? Or is it too soon to even do that? Part of me was just going to try to go to a different stylist, but I feel if I just spent this much money and I'm unhappy, I should just message her.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Trying to go from a level 5 brown to a level 9-10 blonde with a stylist for over a year. After 6 sessions, the past 2 have been no progress, and we're at about a level 6 brown now. Unsure how to approach this and whether or not I should message her.\n\n",

It bothers him a lot and although I've been encouraging him to embrace it and go for the silverfox look, he's not so adamant.\nAnyways, he's been looking for long-lasting products that will dye his beard, he's tried those mascara-like products and the beard powders too, all of them wash off with water/sweat. I just wanted to ask in general what products would you recommend? Is there any good dye which would last, because beard grows in like 2-3 days, right? Maybe some sort of salon treatment or other sort of product that would be helpful and long-lasting? \n\nThank you \nWould really appreciate any help that I can get. ",

      "content": "So, I have been using Epiduo and taking a contraceptive pill targeted towards acne for several years now (5 for Epiduo although I was only consistent in the last 2 years, and 2 years for the pill).\n\nThey have both helped a lot for certain, I used to have horrendous acne but I no longer get any whiteheads anymore. If I stop using my Epiduo for more than two days I get lots of whiteheads and my skin gets so much worse, as with the contraceptive pill although that may just be hormonal. but the point is, I know that my skin is definitely better off with them. And I have been taking them very consistently, there have only been a few rare occasions where I have forgotten but overall I have been incredibly consistent. \n\nHowever I still have spots, just not whiteheads. I have lots of red spots over my cheeks and I find that without Epiduo and the pill, they turn into whiteheads, and Epiduo works very well to remove the whiteheads once I start using it again, but it seems to have no impact on getting rid of my red spots. These aren’t scars as they appear spontaneously on the regular, more of them also pop up if I stop using Epiduo, I don’t pick my skin and I had the same ones on my forehead and chin but those went away quickly. Is there any reason for this or anything I can do to get rid of those? I wouldn’t want to add another active ingredient to my skin as Epiduo is harsh itself at times and so I don’t think that would be a good idea, but I also don’t want to stop the Epiduo in case the whiteheads come back.\n\nmy skincare routine: in the evening I wash my face with Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and then apply Epiduo, and in the morning I just rinse my face with water and apply Cetaphil moisturizing lotion.",

My hair will either be on its best behavior or look like a complete puffball and there’s no in between. \n\nRoutine: I’ve been using Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo and Conditioner to make my hair soft and it has worked, but I need something else to make the curls work better. I usually don’t wash out the conditioner otherwise my hair feels dry and frizzes faster. I’ll use Ouai Curl Cream, Argan Oil Curl Defining Cream, and Paul Mitchell Skinny Serum as an anti-frizz oil. Occasionally Chi Keratin Leave in Conditioner for extra softness. \n\nI hate diffusing my hair and I feel like my hair looks best when air dried so I let it be. I only comb my hair in the shower, never brush it. I’ve been looking into hair gloss/glaze as well, and a different cut so my hair doesn’t puff out so much. Some shampoos and conditioners make my hair feel sticky and itchy, and my curls will fall flat or frizz up. \n\nAny suggestions on different shampoos/conditioners/products would be super helpful!! ",

I never really had straight hair and when I brush my hair it almost doubles in size and again has lots of frizz. I have natural curly baby hairs that look like edges and when my hair is oily you can tell that the hair near my scalp has a curly/wavish pattern(i didn't include a photo since my hair isn't oily currently) . I found a solution to my hair, heatless curls! But if you know how they look, they don't look very natural and that has just been my way to cope with my hair. Is there chance i have curls? I have really long hair and I think the reason I don't have any curls is because my hair is heavy. Please tell me what you think my hair type is!(Btw I have only blow out my hair with no brushing and I washed it with shampoo and conditioner no gels or anything)",
