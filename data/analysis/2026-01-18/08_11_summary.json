I used to have really long hair, always in the same style since I was 6 because I hate going to the hairdresser's. Now I found a hairdresser who's amazing with autistic people and she showed me that if I don't brush my hair to death, I have curls! She also cut my hair into a curly bob and it looked amazing! I don't remember ever feeling as happy with anything related to my appearance. She recommended I use curl-specific products and she also gave me some tips for a curl routine, but I was a bit overwhelmed so the only piece of information I retained was using a diffuser to dry my hair (I used to always air dry), so that's the only thing I've got now.  \nIt's two days since I got my hair cut and I still love it, but of course it doesn't look nearly as good now as when my hairdresser styled it for me, and I have no idea how to get it to look as good on my own.  \nI really want to go out to get all the products necessary, the problem is there's so many! There's different types of conditioner, curl cream and curl gel (is that the same?), some spray type products, mousse, oils...and it seems that for every type of product, there's thousands of videos on youtube telling you how to use them but not two of them say the same thing. Also, so many brands. I live in Switzerland and some brands that get recommended here (I did a bit of snooping on here) aren't available where I live, but there are still enough for me to be completely lost as to which ones I should get.\n\nSo, I come to you with three questions:  \n\\- Which types of products do I need for what purpose?\n\n\\- What brands can you guys recommend\n\n\\- Is there anything else I need to know about my new curly life?\n\nThanks!\n\n(The rules state I should add a hair routine. So far mine is: wash, don't brush curls to death, use diffuser)",

      "content": "I’m back with another six months’ worth of empties. The items pictured are things that I finished between July 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025. I have ADHD and struggle to maintain routines, so finding products that I can stick to is key for me. But I did my skincare just about everyday last year, so I wanted to share the products that work for me. I’m acne prone, and prone to hyperpigmentation, but otherwise my skin is pretty normal these days.  I’m sorry the bottles are chopped up, I just hate wasting product.\n\nCleansers:\n\nSkin Rocks The Cleansing Balm—this is my favorite thing to use for a first cleanse. It melts as soon as it’s on my hands, feels really good on my face and can effortlessly remove a full face of makeup.\n\nSkin Rocks The Gel Cleanser—this is my go to second cleanse. It’s all cut up, but this was a jumbo 250 ml tube that i demolished. It leaves my skin clean, but not dry.\n\nSkin Rocks the Cream Cleanser—this was another 250 ml tube that I used mainly as a morning cleanse. It’s not as heavy duty as the other Skin Rocks cleansers, but it gets the job done and leaves my skin feeling fresh but not stripped before I go in with my other products.\n\nPai Skincare Lightwork Cleansing Oil—this was an old bottle of their Rosehip cleansing oil. My skin always feels great after using this, but I always need a second cleanse after this because I still feel oily after removing it. I especially love using this to remove eye makeup, because I don’t have to rub it in very much. However, it is difficult to travel with because the bottle leaks.\n\nVitamin C: I use a vitamin C/ antioxidant product every morning.\n\nAllies of Skin 35% vitamin C: this is my favorite product on the market, I strayed to The Antioxidant, but came back to this. The texture in this beautiful light oil and it gets rid of my pih immediately. I should note that I have a high tolerance for vitamin c and this product really irritated my friend’s skin.\n\nSkin Rocks The Antioxidant: this has a very low vitamin c percentage and offers a bunch of other antioxidants. The clinical results of this product were great and I loved the texture, so I went through three bottles of it, but ultimately switched back to the Allies Vitamin C because I wasn’t seeing any results and I don’t really need to avoid vitamin c. I think this is better suited to people who can’t tolerate vitamin c.\n\nHyperpigmentation Serum: I use a hyperpigmentation serum morning and evening.\n\nSkin Rocks The Hyperpigmentation Serum—the clinical results of this product were amazing and the reviews are glowing. Unfortunately, after four bottles I had to cut my losses on this one. It did nothing for either my pih or my melasma spot, although I love the way it feels on my skin.\n\nAllies of Skin Tranexamic and Arbutin Serum—I’ve used this before and liked it, it worked well on my pih and overall skin appearance, so it was my go to for awhile, but each bottle I use has a slightly different consistency and the color changes as I make my way through each bottle (the product either darkens over time or it isn’t well combined), so starting last month I’ve gone back to the Dr. Idris’s Hyperserum, which is my tried and true.\n\nOther serums:\n\nMedik8 Advanced Peptides-this was a new addition to my routine, I use it morning and evening and it has visibly smoothed out my skin. I absolutely recommend this for people who are starting to see lines. It cleared out the lines on my forehead as well as the horizontal tech lines on my neck.\n\nMist:\n\nPai Century Flower: this is the best mist I have ever used and I’ve been repurchasing this for over a decade at this point. Both the product itself and the spray are perfect and I use it multiple times during both my morning and evening routines.\n\nEye creams: these are tucked under the cleansers in the picture\n\nSkin Rocks The Eye Cream: this is fine, it applies well and it’s one that I can stick with. I have generic under eye dark circles, so there nothing saving me. This is moisturizing, but it moves a lot, so it sometimes gets in my eyes and makes my contacts blurry.\n\nAllies of Skin (not pictured): this was not moisturizing and didn’t do anything for my under eye area despite wonderful reviews. Also, when it was over I opened the bottle and found a chalky substance. So, I think Allies might need to work on their quality control.\n\nNight Serums: I use retinoids and acids on alternative nights.\n\nSkin Rocks The Retinoid 2 (the plain tube is the retinoid 2 refill) and Medik8 Crystal Retinal 10: these are very similar products with similar formulas (the Medik8 CR 10 is slightly more effective, but the Skin Rocks one is thinner and easier to apply). Neither is irritating. I’ve used both products for years to keep both acne and wrinkles at bay and they seemed to have worked. I mostly switch between them depending on which one is on sale and if I get bored of one—Skin Rocks ran several promotions on this product last year. I’ve since switched to Differin 0.1% (it’s too early to review this).\n\nAllies of Skin Mandalic Night Serum—this is a probably my favorite product from Allies, it’s a fantastic aha/ bha serum that keeps my skin clear, smooth, and glowy without any irritation. I’ve used this consistently for three years and don’t see myself stopping any time soon.\n\nMoisturizers: I’m over the top in this category :)\n\nSkin Rocks The Support Oil—this is a dream, I use it every morning under my moisturizers. It’s light, it absorbs quickly and keeps my skin soft and comfortable even on the driest days. Pro tip, when I’m sick, I apply this to my nose to help with the soreness.\n\nAllies of Skin Peptides and Antioxidants moisturizer—I use this more as a serum in between the support oil and skin rocks moisturizer (below). I think it does help to plump up my skin, but it wouldn’t be moisturizing enough on its own.\n\nSkin Rocks The Moisturizer—this is the god of all moisturizers. The light moisturizer was a little too light for my skin (it’s a gel texture), but The Moisturizer is just perfect in every way. Perfect consistency and really good at keeping my skin moisturized and feeling good. My skin loves this and I’ve noticed a visible improvement in my skin since I started using this.\n\nOther bits and bobs:\n\nSunday Riley CEO afterglow—I got this in a kit a while ago and used it as a night cream to finish it. It was moisturizing, but slightly irritating when first applied, and it was a really off putting yellowish color. It’s fine overall but it doesn’t really fit in my routine.\n\nOskia restoration oil—I also got this in a kit and used it as my night oil. It was too light for me. My go to night oil is Pai’s rosehip oil. The Oskia one felt good on my skin, but didn’t really do anything for me.\n\nSunscreen: this was the year I got really good at wearing sunscreen and found my dream sunscreen (Isdin Fusionwater Magic) just before the tariffs were implemented :/\n\nAnyway, I’d love to hear your thoughts or experiences with these products and please let me know if you have any advice for me! Thanks!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m looking for some advice regarding my current routine and ongoing redness/rashes.\n\nAbout a month ago, I developed red, itchy rashes on my cheeks, next to my nose. They appeared after 1–2 weeks of using Purito Oat-In Gel Cream, so I stopped it, thinking it might be the trigger.\n\nFor the past 2 weeks, I’ve been following this routine to calm my skin and repair my barrier:\n\nAM\n\n\t•\tRinse with water\n\n\t•\tCOSRX Propolis Toner (1 layer)\n\n\t•\tAestura Atobarrier Cream\n\nPM\n\n\t•\tLa Roche-Posay Caring Wash\n\n\t•\tCOSRX Propolis Toner (2 layers)\n\n\t•\tAestura Atobarrier Cream\n\n\t•\tLRP Lipikar Baume (only on red, itchy rash areas)\n\nResults so far:\n\nI do think things are improving slightly. My skin feels less tight, especially when I wake up. However, the redness is still there.\n\nOne thing I’m unsure about:\n\nWhen I apply Aestura Atobarrier Cream in the morning, after a few minutes my face starts to look a bit red. I’m wondering if thick/rich creams, especially in the morning, could worsen redness by trapping heat, which might slow down redness healing. I’ve read about this online but I’m not sure how true it is.\n\nI recently bought a gel-type moisturizer to test this theory: Jumiso D-Panthenol Cream, to see if a lighter texture helps.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\t•\tDo you think my current routine could still be aggravating my redness/rashes?\n\n\t•\tIs it possible that heavy creams (especially AM) can make redness worse by trapping heat?\n\n\t•\tWould switching to a gel moisturizer in the morning make sense in my case?\n\n\t•\tAny other recommendations or adjustments you’d suggest?\n\nThanks a lot for your help 🙏",

I know it doesn’t sound like a huge deal after years of acne and being taunted for my skin, im extremely insecure of my skin and this has been bothering me way too much.

For some reason in the past year or so I’ve gotten random small breakouts more than I ever did as a teen.\n\nCleanser: prequel oil &amp; gleanser\n\nMoisturizer: prequel half and half, FAB ultra repair cream on top, recently got cocokind revitalizing eye cream and find it soothing idk if it’s truly helping\n\n\\*Serum: none right now I had FAB barrier bounce serum but ran out and need a new suggestion. Do I need one?\n\n\\*SPF: tried neutrogena ultra sheer and it burned my eyes horribly, need suggestion for sensitive contact wearing eyes and won’t clog pores\n\n\\*Vitamin C: never used before, I bought prequel but read reviews it smells bad so haven’t used it yet\n\n\\*Exfoliant: I use FAB radiance pads and also bought the prequel milk peel but unsure if these do the same thing or what 😅\n\nI don’t use tretinoin or retinol. I have a bottle of  FAB retinol but didnt continue using because I need to find an SPF that works for me after the neutrogena failed.\n\nI’m open to all price points but something I can buy at target is preferred to Ulta/sephora as I just don’t frequent those stores.",

It’s frizzy and I am no longer mentally/financially capable of trying to maintain it, it turns out the same anyway. So, fine, it’s frizzy. Here’s the problem. I live in an area where it seems like a lot of girls are a lot more high maintenance about their hair (blowouts, daily heat-styling, lots of product etc), and I am pretty aware that wherever I go my hair is the worst-looking in the room my far unless I’m in a Walmart or something.\n\nThere’s also people who assume that I don’t know how to take care of it, and will give me unsolicited tips that I’ve already tried or are not helpful advice for my hair (for example lots of people think my hair is thick when really it’s just high-density). But i also understand that when I wear my hair this way, yea, it looks like I don’t know how to take care of it.\n\nSo here I am I guess looking for advice and reassurance.. not sure what kind of advice but does anyone else wear their natural frizzy hair out and about, and is not actively trying to fix it? Really really frizzy? What do people say about it? How do you deal with it in academic/professional settings? I have seen people say on here that they are embracing the frizz but where are y’all in real life lol!!\n\nRoutine: (it wouldnt let me post without this so just shampoo and conditioner",
