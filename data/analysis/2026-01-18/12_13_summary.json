I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m looking for some advice regarding my current routine and ongoing redness/rashes.\n\nAbout a month ago, I developed red, itchy rashes on my cheeks, next to my nose. They appeared after 1–2 weeks of using Purito Oat-In Gel Cream, so I stopped it, thinking it might be the trigger.\n\nFor the past 2 weeks, I’ve been following this routine to calm my skin and repair my barrier:\n\nAM\n\n\t•\tRinse with water\n\n\t•\tCOSRX Propolis Toner (1 layer)\n\n\t•\tAestura Atobarrier Cream\n\nPM\n\n\t•\tLa Roche-Posay Caring Wash\n\n\t•\tCOSRX Propolis Toner (2 layers)\n\n\t•\tAestura Atobarrier Cream\n\n\t•\tLRP Lipikar Baume (only on red, itchy rash areas)\n\nResults so far:\n\nI do think things are improving slightly. My skin feels less tight, especially when I wake up. However, the redness is still there.\n\nOne thing I’m unsure about:\n\nWhen I apply Aestura Atobarrier Cream in the morning, after a few minutes my face starts to look a bit red. I’m wondering if thick/rich creams, especially in the morning, could worsen redness by trapping heat, which might slow down redness healing. I’ve read about this online but I’m not sure how true it is.\n\nI recently bought a gel-type moisturizer to test this theory: Jumiso D-Panthenol Cream, to see if a lighter texture helps.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\t•\tDo you think my current routine could still be aggravating my redness/rashes?\n\n\t•\tIs it possible that heavy creams (especially AM) can make redness worse by trapping heat?\n\n\t•\tWould switching to a gel moisturizer in the morning make sense in my case?\n\n\t•\tAny other recommendations or adjustments you’d suggest?\n\nThanks a lot for your help 🙏",

      "content": "Hi! Not sure if this is the right sub for this kind of question, so please let me know if there’s somewhere more appropriate.\n\nI got a bob cut two days ago and I love it, but I’m struggling a bit with styling, especially creating a loose wave or bend for texture.\n\nWith my long hair, I usually used either:\n\n\t•\tAirwrap (wide barrel) for loose waves\n\n\t•\tCurling wand for a relaxed, undone look\n\nI haven’t tried the Airwrap on my bob yet. I’m tempted to use the thinner barrel, but I’ve noticed most tutorials don’t use an Airwrap at all. I’m guessing it might just create more of a blowout look? I’m worried that could feel a bit too polished or sculpted for the vibe I’m after.\n\nMy stylist (and most online tutorials) recommend straighteners, but I spent hours yesterday trying and I just cannot seem to get the knack of creating bends or waves with them. I’ve never been great at straightener curls and I’m feeling pretty stuck there.\n\nI’ve also seen a few people using curling tongs, which actually look quite straightforward. I like that you can get some grip and pull-down tension with a tong, unlike a wand where you wrap the hair around. I also think my current wand barrel is probably way too wide for this length.\n\nSo my question is:\n\n\t•\tShould I invest in a curling tong for a bob to create loose waves/texture?\n\n\t•\tIf so, what barrel size would you recommend? My hair sits just slightly above my shoulders.\n\nThanks so much!",
