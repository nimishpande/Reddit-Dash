I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m looking for some advice regarding my current routine and ongoing redness/rashes.\n\nAbout a month ago, I developed red, itchy rashes on my cheeks, next to my nose. They appeared after 1–2 weeks of using Purito Oat-In Gel Cream, so I stopped it, thinking it might be the trigger.\n\nFor the past 2 weeks, I’ve been following this routine to calm my skin and repair my barrier:\n\nAM\n\n\t•\tRinse with water\n\n\t•\tCOSRX Propolis Toner (1 layer)\n\n\t•\tAestura Atobarrier Cream\n\nPM\n\n\t•\tLa Roche-Posay Caring Wash\n\n\t•\tCOSRX Propolis Toner (2 layers)\n\n\t•\tAestura Atobarrier Cream\n\n\t•\tLRP Lipikar Baume (only on red, itchy rash areas)\n\nResults so far:\n\nI do think things are improving slightly. My skin feels less tight, especially when I wake up. However, the redness is still there.\n\nOne thing I’m unsure about:\n\nWhen I apply Aestura Atobarrier Cream in the morning, after a few minutes my face starts to look a bit red. I’m wondering if thick/rich creams, especially in the morning, could worsen redness by trapping heat, which might slow down redness healing. I’ve read about this online but I’m not sure how true it is.\n\nI recently bought a gel-type moisturizer to test this theory: Jumiso D-Panthenol Cream, to see if a lighter texture helps.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\t•\tDo you think my current routine could still be aggravating my redness/rashes?\n\n\t•\tIs it possible that heavy creams (especially AM) can make redness worse by trapping heat?\n\n\t•\tWould switching to a gel moisturizer in the morning make sense in my case?\n\n\t•\tAny other recommendations or adjustments you’d suggest?\n\nThanks a lot for your help 🙏",

      "content": "Hi! Not sure if this is the right sub for this kind of question, so please let me know if there’s somewhere more appropriate.\n\nI got a bob cut two days ago and I love it, but I’m struggling a bit with styling, especially creating a loose wave or bend for texture.\n\nWith my long hair, I usually used either:\n\n\t•\tAirwrap (wide barrel) for loose waves\n\n\t•\tCurling wand for a relaxed, undone look\n\nI haven’t tried the Airwrap on my bob yet. I’m tempted to use the thinner barrel, but I’ve noticed most tutorials don’t use an Airwrap at all. I’m guessing it might just create more of a blowout look? I’m worried that could feel a bit too polished or sculpted for the vibe I’m after.\n\nMy stylist (and most online tutorials) recommend straighteners, but I spent hours yesterday trying and I just cannot seem to get the knack of creating bends or waves with them. I’ve never been great at straightener curls and I’m feeling pretty stuck there.\n\nI’ve also seen a few people using curling tongs, which actually look quite straightforward. I like that you can get some grip and pull-down tension with a tong, unlike a wand where you wrap the hair around. I also think my current wand barrel is probably way too wide for this length.\n\nSo my question is:\n\n\t•\tShould I invest in a curling tong for a bob to create loose waves/texture?\n\n\t•\tIf so, what barrel size would you recommend? My hair sits just slightly above my shoulders.\n\nThanks so much!",

I had no other option so I bought minimalists salicylic acid and a tranexamic acid serums separately, but ever since then a pimple or two repeatedly. I know it doesn’t sound like a huge deal after years of acne and being taunted for my skin, im extremely insecure of my skin and this has been bothering me way too much. PLEASE GUYS SUGGEST ME AN ALTERNATIVE, what do you think could be possibly breaking me out?

Then I blow out my hair using the blow-dryer brush. Then I do the heatless roller/sock method (and let it stay that way for 20 minutes to even longer, depending upon the time I have). When I untie/unroll my hair, I do get a good volume, but it stays for like 15 mins (not kidding). I have even used Bblunt hair setting spray, but it does not help, and by the end of the hour my hair is back to its shapeless form. also this setting spray is sticky...makes my hair crispy if I use it in a generous amount. Any suggestions, girls? How do I have more volume (so that the two strands i have left, look good) and how do i retain that volume longer (like4-5hours)",

      "content": "Hi, I as my username says I have crazy wavy/curly hair, and that’s just the way it is. It’s frizzy and I am no longer mentally/financially capable of trying to maintain it, it turns out the same anyway. So, fine, it’s frizzy. Here’s the problem. I live in an area where it seems like a lot of girls are a lot more high maintenance about their hair (blowouts, daily heat-styling, lots of product etc), and I am pretty aware that wherever I go my hair is the worst-looking in the room my far unless I’m in a Walmart or something.\n\nThere’s also people who assume that I don’t know how to take care of it, and will give me unsolicited tips that I’ve already tried or are not helpful advice for my hair (for example lots of people think my hair is thick when really it’s just high-density). But i also understand that when I wear my hair this way, yea, it looks like I don’t know how to take care of it.\n\nSo here I am I guess looking for advice and reassurance.. not sure what kind of advice but does anyone else wear their natural frizzy hair out and about, and is not actively trying to fix it? Really really frizzy? What do people say about it? How do you deal with it in academic/professional settings? I have seen people say on here that they are embracing the frizz but where are y’all in real life lol!!\n\nRoutine: (it wouldnt let me post without this so just shampoo and conditioner",
