      "title": "[Shelfie] six months’ of empties",
      "content": "I’m back with another six months’ worth of empties. The items pictured are things that I finished between July 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025. I have ADHD and struggle to maintain routines, so finding products that I can stick to is key for me. But I did my skincare just about everyday last year, so I wanted to share the products that work for me. I’m acne prone, and prone to hyperpigmentation, but otherwise my skin is pretty normal these days.  I’m sorry the bottles are chopped up, I just hate wasting product.\n\nCleansers:\n\nSkin Rocks The Cleansing Balm—this is my favorite thing to use for a first cleanse. It melts as soon as it’s on my hands, feels really good on my face and can effortlessly remove a full face of makeup.\n\nSkin Rocks The Gel Cleanser—this is my go to second cleanse. It’s all cut up, but this was a jumbo 250 ml tube that i demolished. It leaves my skin clean, but not dry.\n\nSkin Rocks the Cream Cleanser—this was another 250 ml tube that I used mainly as a morning cleanse. It’s not as heavy duty as the other Skin Rocks cleansers, but it gets the job done and leaves my skin feeling fresh but not stripped before I go in with my other products.\n\nPai Skincare Lightwork Cleansing Oil—this was an old bottle of their Rosehip cleansing oil. My skin always feels great after using this, but I always need a second cleanse after this because I still feel oily after removing it. I especially love using this to remove eye makeup, because I don’t have to rub it in very much. However, it is difficult to travel with because the bottle leaks.\n\nVitamin C: I use a vitamin C/ antioxidant product every morning.\n\nAllies of Skin 35% vitamin C: this is my favorite product on the market, I strayed to The Antioxidant, but came back to this. The texture in this beautiful light oil and it gets rid of my pih immediately. I should note that I have a high tolerance for vitamin c and this product really irritated my friend’s skin.\n\nSkin Rocks The Antioxidant: this has a very low vitamin c percentage and offers a bunch of other antioxidants. The clinical results of this product were great and I loved the texture, so I went through three bottles of it, but ultimately switched back to the Allies Vitamin C because I wasn’t seeing any results and I don’t really need to avoid vitamin c. I think this is better suited to people who can’t tolerate vitamin c.\n\nHyperpigmentation Serum: I use a hyperpigmentation serum morning and evening.\n\nSkin Rocks The Hyperpigmentation Serum—the clinical results of this product were amazing and the reviews are glowing. Unfortunately, after four bottles I had to cut my losses on this one. It did nothing for either my pih or my melasma spot, although I love the way it feels on my skin.\n\nAllies of Skin Tranexamic and Arbutin Serum—I’ve used this before and liked it, it worked well on my pih and overall skin appearance, so it was my go to for awhile, but each bottle I use has a slightly different consistency and the color changes as I make my way through each bottle (the product either darkens over time or it isn’t well combined), so starting last month I’ve gone back to the Dr. Idris’s Hyperserum, which is my tried and true.\n\nOther serums:\n\nMedik8 Advanced Peptides-this was a new addition to my routine, I use it morning and evening and it has visibly smoothed out my skin. I absolutely recommend this for people who are starting to see lines. It cleared out the lines on my forehead as well as the horizontal tech lines on my neck.\n\nMist:\n\nPai Century Flower: this is the best mist I have ever used and I’ve been repurchasing this for over a decade at this point. Both the product itself and the spray are perfect and I use it multiple times during both my morning and evening routines.\n\nEye creams: these are tucked under the cleansers in the picture\n\nSkin Rocks The Eye Cream: this is fine, it applies well and it’s one that I can stick with. I have generic under eye dark circles, so there nothing saving me. This is moisturizing, but it moves a lot, so it sometimes gets in my eyes and makes my contacts blurry.\n\nAllies of Skin (not pictured): this was not moisturizing and didn’t do anything for my under eye area despite wonderful reviews. Also, when it was over I opened the bottle and found a chalky substance. So, I think Allies might need to work on their quality control.\n\nNight Serums: I use retinoids and acids on alternative nights.\n\nSkin Rocks The Retinoid 2 (the plain tube is the retinoid 2 refill) and Medik8 Crystal Retinal 10: these are very similar products with similar formulas (the Medik8 CR 10 is slightly more effective, but the Skin Rocks one is thinner and easier to apply). Neither is irritating. I’ve used both products for years to keep both acne and wrinkles at bay and they seemed to have worked. I mostly switch between them depending on which one is on sale and if I get bored of one—Skin Rocks ran several promotions on this product last year. I’ve since switched to Differin 0.1% (it’s too early to review this).\n\nAllies of Skin Mandalic Night Serum—this is a probably my favorite product from Allies, it’s a fantastic aha/ bha serum that keeps my skin clear, smooth, and glowy without any irritation. I’ve used this consistently for three years and don’t see myself stopping any time soon.\n\nMoisturizers: I’m over the top in this category :)\n\nSkin Rocks The Support Oil—this is a dream, I use it every morning under my moisturizers. It’s light, it absorbs quickly and keeps my skin soft and comfortable even on the driest days. Pro tip, when I’m sick, I apply this to my nose to help with the soreness.\n\nAllies of Skin Peptides and Antioxidants moisturizer—I use this more as a serum in between the support oil and skin rocks moisturizer (below). I think it does help to plump up my skin, but it wouldn’t be moisturizing enough on its own.\n\nSkin Rocks The Moisturizer—this is the god of all moisturizers. The light moisturizer was a little too light for my skin (it’s a gel texture), but The Moisturizer is just perfect in every way. Perfect consistency and really good at keeping my skin moisturized and feeling good. My skin loves this and I’ve noticed a visible improvement in my skin since I started using this.\n\nOther bits and bobs:\n\nSunday Riley CEO afterglow—I got this in a kit a while ago and used it as a night cream to finish it. It was moisturizing, but slightly irritating when first applied, and it was a really off putting yellowish color. It’s fine overall but it doesn’t really fit in my routine.\n\nOskia restoration oil—I also got this in a kit and used it as my night oil. It was too light for me. My go to night oil is Pai’s rosehip oil. The Oskia one felt good on my skin, but didn’t really do anything for me.\n\nSunscreen: this was the year I got really good at wearing sunscreen and found my dream sunscreen (Isdin Fusionwater Magic) just before the tariffs were implemented :/\n\nAnyway, I’d love to hear your thoughts or experiences with these products and please let me know if you have any advice for me! Thanks!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I have a bottle of  FAB retinol but didnt continue using because I need to find an SPF that works for me after the neutrogena failed.\n\nI’m open to all price points but something I can buy at target is preferred to Ulta/sephora as I just don’t frequent those stores.",

It’s frizzy and I am no longer mentally/financially capable of trying to maintain it, it turns out the same anyway. So, fine, it’s frizzy. Here’s the problem. I live in an area where it seems like a lot of girls are a lot more high maintenance about their hair (blowouts, daily heat-styling, lots of product etc), and I am pretty aware that wherever I go my hair is the worst-looking in the room my far unless I’m in a Walmart or something.\n\nThere’s also people who assume that I don’t know how to take care of it, and will give me unsolicited tips that I’ve already tried or are not helpful advice for my hair (for example lots of people think my hair is thick when really it’s just high-density). But i also understand that when I wear my hair this way, yea, it looks like I don’t know how to take care of it.\n\nSo here I am I guess looking for advice and reassurance.. not sure what kind of advice but does anyone else wear their natural frizzy hair out and about, and is not actively trying to fix it? Really really frizzy? What do people say about it? How do you deal with it in academic/professional settings? I have seen people say on here that they are embracing the frizz but where are y’all in real life lol!!\n\nRoutine: (it wouldnt let me post without this so just shampoo and conditioner",

Is Vaseline pretty much the standard no matter the skin type? That's what I've been using but I see my pores have some gunk in them... which is quite worrying to say the least.\n\nJust for clarity on my routine post laser, I'm using cerave foaming cleanser and vaseline. For sunscreen I'm using isdin mineral fusion fluid sunscreen. \n\nThe mineral sunscreen is really hard to wash off, but too much washing or rubbing is bad in the first week so I'm at a loss here too. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. \n\nAnd also for some reason my derm said to use retinol but I haven't done that... wondering if retinol is ok to use ..",

My whole face really just very slightly stings and looks red and irritated everyday.\n\nWhen I do my regular routine, I notice the skin around my nose and my nose itself burns, like i've scratched those areas and then squeezed lemon juice on them or something LOL.

I’m posting because I’m trying to better understand what’s going on with my hairline and would really appreciate hearing from others who’ve dealt with something similar.\n\nOver the past months, I’ve noticed progressive thinning along the frontal hairline, mainly at the temples. It doesn’t look like generalized shedding; instead, it feels more like the hairline itself is changing. Some areas still have fine, short hairs, while others look noticeably sparser.\n\nFor context, I’ve always had an M-shaped hairline since childhood, so temples aren’t new to me. What’s different now is that there’s actual loss and progression, which never really happened before.\n\nAnother thing that really worries me is the asymmetry, the left side is significantly thinner and the right side stayed almost unchanged until recently, only starting to thin in the last few months\n\nThat asymmetry is what makes this harder for me to interpret.\n\nI’ve already seen a dermatologist and had a trichoscopy, and I was told the pattern didn’t suggest scarring alopecia. While that was somewhat reassuring, I’m still unsure because the frontal area keeps changing, and I’ve read that conditions like frontal fibrosing alopecia or other cicatricial alopecias can be subtle early on.\n\nIn terms of treatment, I’ve only just started:\n\nFinasteride 0.5 mg (about a week in)\n\nPumpkin seed oil as a supplement\n\nI know it’s far too early to judge effectiveness, this is more about understanding what I might be dealing with.\n\nI’d really appreciate input from anyone who:\n\nhas had mostly frontal or asymmetrical hair thinning\n\nhas experience with frontal fibrosing alopecia or early scarring conditions\n\nwas initially told it wasn’t scarring but later got more clarity\n\nmanaged to stabilize something similar with treatment\n\nI’ll continue following up medically, but hearing real-world experiences would help a lot in deciding next steps (monitoring, second opinion, further exams, etc.).\n\nThanks in advance to anyone willing to share their experience or thoughts.",

      "title": "[Routine Help] Oily skin + Tretinoin",
      "content": "Oily skin + Tretinoin routine advice\n\nI struggle with oily skin and a strawberry seed nose because of my sebaceous filaments.\n\nI'm also curious if it's ok to just keep this routine and let the tretinoin work and have all these hydrating steps support it to balance out how the tret would dry me out.\n\nI was looking for advice on how to adjust my skincare routine.\n\nI asked AI and I got this response and was wondering how legit it is.\n\nQuestion: I want to check the products I use for compatibility with each other and also my oily skin.\n\nIn the morning, I use TIRTIR original milk toner, Aestura Atobarrier365 Hydro Essence, Aestura Atobarrier365 cream, and Skin 1004 Centella sunscreen.\n\nAt night, I double cleanse with Manyo pure cleansing oil, isntree yam root milk cleanser, then use the same toner and essence I used in the morning, then put cosrx snail mucin after that, then sandwich method .05 tretinoin gel with Real Barrier extreme cream, then after sandwiching I apply Aveeno Eczema Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Cream, La Roche Posay Cicaplast Balm B5, then slug with aquaphor at the end.\n\nAnswer: This routine contains some \"Hall of Fame\" Reddit favorites (Aestura, Cosrx, La Roche-Posay), but for oily skin, you are running a high risk of clogging your pores.\nYour routine is essentially designed for someone with extremely dry, dehydrated skin living in a desert. Since you have oily skin and concerns about \"strawberry nose\" (sebaceous filaments), this routine is likely working against you by trapping too much oil.\nHere is the breakdown of compatibility and risks.\nThe Major Flags\n1. The \"Lasagna\" Problem (PM)\nYou are applying 5 different moisturizing layers in the evening:\n * Real Barrier Extreme Cream (Under Tret)\n * Real Barrier Extreme Cream (Over Tret)\n * Aveeno Eczema Therapy\n * LRP Cicaplast Balm\n * Aquaphor\n * The Risk: This is total occlusion overkill. While \"sandwiching\" is good for Tretinoin, adding Aveeno + Cicaplast + Aquaphor on top creates a greenhouse effect. This traps heat and bacteria, which can actually worsen acne and prevent your sebaceous filaments from clearing out.\n * Tretinoin Gel Compatibility: You are using the Gel formulation. Tretinoin Gel is famously finicky; it forms a film. Layering heavy creams under it (like Real Barrier) significantly blocks absorption. Layering 3 heavy occlusives over it often causes the gel to \"pill\" (ball up like eraser shavings), meaning it isn't absorbing properly.\n2. The Strawberry Nose Conflict\n * Slugging (Aquaphor) on Oily Skin: While great for healing, slugging is the enemy of sebaceous filaments. Petrolatum traps the sebum in your nose pores. If you want your nose to look cleaner, stop slugging your nose.\n * TIRTIR Original (AM): As discussed, this is very rich. Using this + Essence + Aestura Cream in the morning is likely why you might look greasy by midday.\nOptimized Routine (Using what you have)\nYou don't need to throw these products away, but you should subtract steps to let your oily skin breathe and let the Tretinoin actually work.\nMorning: The \"Lighten Up\" Strategy\nGoal: Hydration without the grease.\n * Rinse with Water (Skip cleanser if you aren't sweating; your PM cleanse was heavy).\n * Toner: TIRTIR Original (Apply a light layer).\n * Essence: Aestura Hydro Essence.\n * Moisturizer: SKIP THIS.\n   * Why: The TIRTIR toner and Aestura essence are already moisturizing. Your sunscreen is the final layer. You do not need the heavy Aestura Cream in the morning for oily skin.\n * Sunscreen: Skin 1004 Centella (This acts as your AM moisturizer).\nEvening: The \"De-Clog\" Strategy\nGoal: Barrier support without suffocation.\n * Oil Cleanse: Manyo Pure Cleansing Oil (Great).\n * Second Cleanse: Isntree Yam Root Milk Cleanser.\n   * Note: Since you have oily skin, make sure you rinse this very thoroughly. Milk cleansers can leave a residue.\n * Hydration: TIRTIR Toner OR Snail Mucin.\n   * Why: You don't need Toner + Essence + Snail Mucin. Pick one or two. The Snail Mucin is great for Tretinoin hydration.\n * The Sandwich (Modified):\n   * Layer 1 (Buffer): Apply a thin layer of Aestura Atobarrier Cream (lighter than Real Barrier) or the Aveeno.\n   * Wait 10-20 mins: Let it dry.\n   * Layer 2: Tretinoin 0.05% Gel.\n   * Wait 20 mins: Let it dry completely.\n   * Layer 3 (Final): Real Barrier Extreme Cream.\n * STOP HERE.\n   * You do not need to add Aveeno OR Cicaplast OR Aquaphor on top of the Real Barrier. The Real Barrier cream is already an intense occlusive.\nWhen to use the \"Extras\"\n * LRP Cicaplast B5: Use this only as a \"spot treatment\" on nights you are not using Tretinoin, or if you have a specific irritated red patch. Do not use it all over your face every night; it is very pore-clogging for oily skin.\n * Aquaphor: Use this on your lips and around your eyes/nostrils (to protect them from Tretinoin migration), but do not put it over your T-Zone.\nSummary of Changes\n * AM: Drop the Aestura Cream. Rely on Toner + Essence + Sunscreen.\n * PM: Choose one final sealant (Real Barrier is the best one you have). Stop layering Aveeno + Cicaplast + Aquaphor on top of it.\n * Nose: Avoid putting the heavy creams (Real Barrier/Cicaplast/Aquaphor) directly on your nose to help with the filaments. Just use the toner and a light layer of Aveeno there.",

I would like some tips on how to trim the ends at home.\n\nNote: The hair in the photos is not in the best condition because I'm spending my vacation in a city that is dry and hot.\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. Wash and detangle on the same day (1-3 times) a week.\n2. Shampoo: Neutrox \"Curls and Waves\"\n3. Conditioner: Skala Curl Styling Cream\n4. Oil after washing: Salon Line \"S.O.S\" Curls\n5. Drying: Using a regular towel for a few minutes on the hair and then air drying.\n6. I don't use a satin bonnet before bed.\n\nThis is the routine I've maintained for a few years.\n\nBetween washes I don't do anything to my hair, I don't do any kind of styling.",
