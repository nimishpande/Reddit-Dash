      "content": "An update from my previous post a few months ago:\n\nI’m currently on 0.5mg of dutasteride and 5mg of minoxidil, still no side effects at all.\n\nJanuary 2024 - Although I could notice my temples getting bigger since 2019, this is where I started to notice my hair was getting very thin and it would only grow a few inches compared to the hair on the back or sides of my head.\n\nJune 2024 - In those 6 months it got really bad and I started to thin very rapidly, I was formally diagnosed with AGA and started only with 2.5mg minoxidil as I was very scared of side effects from 5ARls. (In hindsight I should’ve been more scared of the sides from oral minoxidil but I was ignorant). \n\nSeptember 2024 - Decided to bite the bullet and started with 0.5mg dutasteride every other day (skipped finasteride since I wanted the absolute highest chance of regrowth).\n\nDecember 2024 - Jumped to 0.5mg dutasteride daily (this is were I started to see drastic improvement)\n\nApril 2025 - Jumped to 5mg minoxidil daily, didn’t notice much improvement vs 2.5mg.\n\nJanuary 2026 - Still running the same stack since April, I am letting my hair grow this time (I thought I’d never have long hair again and I’m so thankful I’m able to now). I do notice the bottom “half” of my hair is a lot more dense than the top half, likely due to more hairs in anagen coming up vs when the top half grew out. \n\nI also have Acquired Progressive Kinking of the Hair, which makes my sideburns incredibly curly, it seems to be linked to aggressive hair loss but there is very little scientific literature on it. This did improve but only by about 15%.\n\nAside from that I have basically reversed all my hair loss excluding the hairline, (although it did thicken a bit) I am looking to get a small hair transplant in the future to get back to NW0.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions!",

Not totally sure though. I've heard i may need a clarifying shampoo, but im very uneducated about properly taking care of my curls, though I have tried with experimenting. Ive thought about olaplex, but ive seen a ton of reviews its absolutely ruined people's hair texture \n\nmy routine:\n\n\\- hair wash every other day \n\n\\- shampoo: Pantene Pro V daily moisture renewal \n\n\\- conditioner: Pantene Pro V daily moisture renewal \n\n\\- second conditioner: Hask organic oil repairing conditioner\n\n\\- brush out and let air dry, scrunch method\n\n\\- very recently ive been using argan magic intensive hair oil about once a week but havent noticed a substantial difference \n\n\\- my hair becomes incredibly frizzy and loses curl texture after brushing when its dry, but curls up immediately after a shower\n\nI feel kind of at a loss on what my hair needs. I see all this stuff about proteins and other elements, and I need to do more research, but im not sure where to look or even what my hair type actually is. \n\ncurious if anyone else would reccomend a clarifying shampoo, as im sure I have decent build up potentially. any advice would be great! tysm!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Occasionally I use a barrier cream on top of all of this, which is the experiment molecular mesh. I have been on this exact routine for about 5-6 months now. Recently I have also been using the l’oreal bright reveal peel for the past 2.5 weeks.\n\nI do work nightshift so I rarely wear any spf.

My spf I use is the beauty of joseon one.\n\nI would love any advice for what I should do for this! It affects my confidence a lot, especially in bright lighting it becomes very obvious to me.\n\nI feel like I’ve tried EVERYTHING under the sun and my skin just hates me. :( It is super reactive and sensitive to some stuff and it gets irritating to me :(\n\nHere is just some of the stuff I have tried\n\n\\-the ordinary azelaic acid 10% (broke me out like crazy)\n\n\\-the ordinary glycolic acid toner (damaged my skin barrier)\n\n\\-the ordinary salicylic acid 2% solution (broke me out)\n\n\\-panoxyl 4% and 10% foaming wash (both didn’t do anything after a 1.5 year of usage)\n\n\\-panoxyl clarifying exfoliant (did nothing)\n\n\\-basically all of the ceraVe cleansers, hydrating, foaming, acne, SA (the SA and acne one broke me out super bad while the other two just didn’t cleanse my skin enough and caused blackheads)\n\n\\-De La Cruz sulfur mask (didn’t do anything and ended up burning my skin)\n\n\\-la roche posay triple lipikar moisturizer (too sticky)\n\n\\-la roche posay purifying foaming cleanser (dried out my skin)\n\n\\-la roche posay hydrating cleanser was good but I liked the one I currently use better\n\nThank you for reading/helping!!! :)\n\n\\#productrequest",

The next day I took my shower only using conditioner, my hair felt rough as I put in the conditioner, but I ignored it and continued on, I'm unsure if that's normal though, just something I noticed.\n\nSome hours later, my hair had strands that refused to go down, had different flows in the sense that one part goes low while the other stays high? It's like the first photo, I'd say it resembles a poodle, that's how it usually looks for me, but my issue was my hair still felt rough. \n\nI jumped back in the shower for a second time, this time using shampoo to get rid of everything in it, then using my conditioner. Yesterday, my had good volume, it was 'organized' in flow (best way I could put it), overall it looked great, I'd say it might be the best I've seen it in a while, I was impressed because I didn't think my hair could look that good, but I have bad memory, so there's that, lol.\n\nI took my shower last night, doing my usual, now it's back to being poodle form. I don't understand what happened with my hair that made it look like yesterday. I don't know anything really about hair and wanted advice on this, I was kinda wondering if I could just make it better or keep it how it was yesterday.\n\nRoutine:\nAussie mircale curls conditioner.\nAussie mircale curls shampoo.\nAussie moisturizer.\nAussie leave in conditioner.\n\nI take a shower everyday, I use shampoo once or twice a week depending on how my hair feels on certain days, no specific time I do it, then I take turns using moisturizer and leave in everyday. One day moisturizer, next day leave in, and I air day. I don't use anything special like a bonnet, special pillowcase, or diffuser.\n\nThe first photo is today, the second was yesterday, and the third was five to six days ago.

When I left, even after two washes, the product was still in my hair, to the point where my hair looked extremely greasy, practically dripping, and it felt just as bad but the instructor told me I needed to leave the product in for 24hrs for it to really work. So I did. After 24 hours I got in a shower, I rinsed my hair for a while, really working my fingers through, then washed it, scrubbing my scalp and even through to the ends as hard as I could, five times. I even used Head and Shoulders and a scalp scrubber (one of those hard, pointy rubber ones). I used very hot water the whole time. My scalp is on fire. But the product is still in my hair! I look like a disgusting grease ball that doesn’t know how to bathe. And it feels just as bad. I’m so ashamed and embarrassed and can’t stop crying. How do I get this crap out of my hair!
