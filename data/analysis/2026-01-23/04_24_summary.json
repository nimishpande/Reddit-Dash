      "content": "An update from my previous post a few months ago:\n\nI’m currently on 0.5mg of dutasteride and 5mg of minoxidil, still no side effects at all.\n\nJanuary 2024 - Although I could notice my temples getting bigger since 2019, this is where I started to notice my hair was getting very thin and it would only grow a few inches compared to the hair on the back or sides of my head.\n\nJune 2024 - In those 6 months it got really bad and I started to thin very rapidly, I was formally diagnosed with AGA and started only with 2.5mg minoxidil as I was very scared of side effects from 5ARls. (In hindsight I should’ve been more scared of the sides from oral minoxidil but I was ignorant). \n\nSeptember 2024 - Decided to bite the bullet and started with 0.5mg dutasteride every other day (skipped finasteride since I wanted the absolute highest chance of regrowth).\n\nDecember 2024 - Jumped to 0.5mg dutasteride daily (this is were I started to see drastic improvement)\n\nApril 2025 - Jumped to 5mg minoxidil daily, didn’t notice much improvement vs 2.5mg.\n\nJanuary 2026 - Still running the same stack since April, I am letting my hair grow this time (I thought I’d never have long hair again and I’m so thankful I’m able to now). I do notice the bottom “half” of my hair is a lot more dense than the top half, likely due to more hairs in anagen coming up vs when the top half grew out. \n\nI also have Acquired Progressive Kinking of the Hair, which makes my sideburns incredibly curly, it seems to be linked to aggressive hair loss but there is very little scientific literature on it. This did improve but only by about 15%.\n\nAside from that I have basically reversed all my hair loss excluding the hairline, (although it did thicken a bit) I am looking to get a small hair transplant in the future to get back to NW0.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions!",

I feel like I’m so critical about my hair that I can’t tell what looks good anymore because im just staring at it for so long. I live in New England and I feel like winters are the worst. I feel like it makes my hair boring and flat and dry. \n\nI tried a new styling routine today and want advice on if I’m in the right direction or not or what even am I doing. Am I being overly dramatic and too much of a perfectionist or what.\n\nAlso a note I am getting a haircut next week but last time I saw someone they ruined my hair and I cried for like a month.\n\nRoutine;\n\nBrushed out my hair before the shower\n\nIn the shower double shampoo with all soft mega curls \n\nPut in all soft mega curls conditioner on hair only below my ears, clipped it up for about 10 minutes\n\nHalfway rinsed it out and brushed in the shower and then fully rinsed before getting out of the shower \n\n(This routine is slightly different than what I was doing before that wasn’t working)\n\nOut of the shower i re wet my hair, sectioned it above my ears and added very little leave in(ouidad frizz control),  Ouai curl cream, lots of mousse (NYM), very little gel diluted with water(NYM flash freeze) and then I used a bounce curl defining brush to brush style my curls in sections (hoping to avoid any middle parting in the back by doing this). After I brush style I added more mousse and then scrunched with a t shirt. I repeated this on all sections over my whole head and then I diffused starting by hovering on a cold setting, and then flipped my head upside down and diffused on medium heat then flipped my head side to side and then straight up. My hair was crunchy and then I scrunched it out with olaplex oil. so my areas of concern are my hair curled better in the back towards the top of my head and curled more around the top of my head but it seems to be falling flat and has light frizz (although I’m not sure I’ll be able to get rid of all frizz). I feel like I generally have more volume (could be just this New England winter) I also have not gone outside and probably won’t until tomorrow when I have to go to work. I sleep with a satin bonnet over a pineapple and if I refresh I do water and sometimes rizzos curl refresh spray, have no tried that with this new routine yet however.\n\nCurly hair is not for the weak it’s brutal out here lol",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I have the Peach slices snail rescue on me and the Peach Lilly Super Reboot masks but I'm hesitant to have him use it since I don't want it to hurt his face. \n\nHis skincare routine is washing his face in the shower everyday with bar soap and finishing off with cold water to close his pores. Then he puts on CeraVe lotion on his face. On weekends, he uses my Tatcha Rice Wash, washing with bar soap beforehand. \n\nWhat are some suggestions or products, particularly face masks you'd recommend? He likes doing them with me. Any other suggestions on products to add to routine would also be appreciated! Thanks a ton! 😊",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

It’s weird, almost like it gets too dry and too moist… I try lavender but it’s too harsh, some cerave moisturizer but it’s too much and makes it break out ( even when using a small amount ) and rose oil, which dries it out too much as well… My nose has been in a borderline irritated state for the majority of my life, lol \n\nIt’s like no matter what I do It gets all red and irritated and starts breaking out, as well as the surrounding area. It may partly be because I have such bad allergies and have to blow my nose all the time, but I do my best to mitigate the damage by using good tissues that aren’t rough, but it still only does so much \n\nI’ve never been to a dermatologist and honestly I’m trying to just avoid it if possible. I’m not looking for any concrete medical advice, just friendly suggestions and anything that might point me in a good direction \n\nI’m a little desperate honestly, I just turned 30, having a hard look in the mirror and finally pushing myself to get my health and general well being together again. I’ll place an order for whatever you guys think could help me out, and do my best to put it into practice \n\nThank you in advance for anyone who got this far and those who offer their help! 🤍",

I wash my scalp with the \"Twisty born to bounce curly shampoo\", then condition the hair with the \"Twisty wave me to the moon curly hair humectant conditioner\" and scrunch. Then I wait like 5 minutes before I rinse it out, scrunch again and leave my hair to air dry. Other than this, I don't don't do anything really.\nMy hair looks kinda good the day of washing and the following day but over the next days, it gets very weird and I don't like the way it looks. What should I do?\n\nIf you recommend any products, please, keep in mind that I'm a poor student and don't have a lot of money... Thank you so much!\n\nALSO sorry for the quality of the photos my phone camera isn't really good...",

In the rare cases they don't, my hair still looks like a squished mess. \nI also tried a very loose bun, or satin sheets and pillowcases, but to no avail.

I put a mask from garnier and leave it on for 5 minutes\n\n3. After i wash it i detangle it with a gentle brush, and spray in a leave in conditioner from Schwarzkopf (the purple one)\n\n4. I either diffuse it until its 80% dry or just dry my scalp and let it curl naturally\n\n5. I also often scrunch it gently with some hair oil\n\n I sometimes use creams or mouse, but they usually weigh down my hair so much and give it that greasy look.

      "content": "Hi y'all! I just recently started looking into how to properly take care of my hair and began trying out a curly hair routine a couple days ago. This is how it looked this morning after showering, putting in products, and diffusing. I know that it takes time for curls to reach their full form, but there's definitely room for improvement and I need some advice from the experts! First, here is my current routine/products I use:\n\n1.\t⁠Kristen Ess Extra Gentle Shampoo and Conditioner\n\n2.\t⁠Detangle with Wet brush, apply Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream\n\n3.\t⁠apply Curlsmith Hydro Style Flexi Jelly, flip head upside down and scrunch\n\n4.\t⁠apply John Frieda Frizz Ease Curl Reviver Mousse to roots and scrunch again\n\n5.\t⁠plop hair in t-shirt for a few minutes\n\n6.\t⁠diffuse until mostly dry, scrunch to break the gel cast, and put the hair near my part in a claw clip for a bit for volume\n\nSo far, I'm happy with the results of this routine, as my curls held their shape throughout the day, though my hair got a little less voluminous as time went on (and there wasn't too too much volume to begin with). The biggest thing I'm concerned about is that my hair looks dry and a little frizzy, especially towards the ends where it's more damaged, which I think is affecting the definition of my curls. I believe hair oil is a possible solution, so if you have any brand recommendations (preferably on the affordable side) or other ideas on how to fix it, let me know! Here's a list of other things I would love some advice on:\n\n\\- My roots and front pieces seem to have a very hard time curling, should I use more product there or a different method when applying product?\n\n\\- What's the best way to refresh curls after sleeping on them? There are a lot of contrasting opinions whether or not you should wet your hair and what products to use, which makes it very confusing!\n\n\\- I believe I have medium-to-high porosity hair. Should I use oil, and if so, when should I use it (before bed, to refresh hair, on wet hair, dry hair, etc.)?\n\nOk-- question tirade is over. Thank you in advance for your time and suggestions :)",

Cheese-whiz consistency stuff comes out when I squeeze them and they are incredibly difficult to get rid of. My routine for years has been neutrons makeup wipes and 10% benzoyl peroxide wash at night, followed by azelaic acid topical gel and occasional adapalene gel and clindamycin gel as needed. Tretinoin is too harsh for my skin and I have always been oily. Whether I wear makeup or not, the bumps persist. They are less noticeable in the morning and worse at night. Pimple patches and charcoal masks chill them out. The more I go at them, it seems the worse they get. I am SO sick of them. My dermatologist didn’t give me a straight answer about them and kept pushing hormonal birth control pills, despite my objection. I’m not looking for a diagnosis here, rather a general direction. I’ve explored them being milia, sebaceous filaments, and perioral dermatitis based on other posts and forums. The bumps didn’t onset until a few months after we started wearing masks every day at work during the pandemic. It could be coincidence, though. Can anyone give me a general direction or products to try? I’m open to anything at this point. \n\nHopefully my post follows all the rules, I did read them, and am open to feedback to get some help.",

I’ve never had this done before so I had no clue (I thought maybe it was a light exfoliation, like a facial product).\n\nI work as a professional model, and I have a big shoot in 2 days. My feet just started peeling yesterday and look like they’re about to get pretty bad. Is there anything I can do or am I screwed?? I’m going to start soaking them as much as possible in hot water and gently sloughing with a wet towel (no pumic or anything rough), and the applying Vaseline under my socks.\n\nIs there anything I can do before the shoot to make them temporarily presentable?? I don’t care if it ends up making it worse after, I just really need to presentable for the shoot and im freaking out lol!\n\nThank you",
