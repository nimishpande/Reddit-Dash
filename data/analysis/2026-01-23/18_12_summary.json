Not totally sure though. I've heard i may need a clarifying shampoo, but im very uneducated about properly taking care of my curls, though I have tried with experimenting. Ive thought about olaplex, but ive seen a ton of reviews its absolutely ruined people's hair texture \n\nmy routine:\n\n\\- hair wash every other day \n\n\\- shampoo: Pantene Pro V daily moisture renewal \n\n\\- conditioner: Pantene Pro V daily moisture renewal \n\n\\- second conditioner: Hask organic oil repairing conditioner\n\n\\- brush out and let air dry, scrunch method\n\n\\- very recently ive been using argan magic intensive hair oil about once a week but havent noticed a substantial difference \n\n\\- my hair becomes incredibly frizzy and loses curl texture after brushing when its dry, but curls up immediately after a shower\n\nI feel kind of at a loss on what my hair needs. I see all this stuff about proteins and other elements, and I need to do more research, but im not sure where to look or even what my hair type actually is. \n\ncurious if anyone else would reccomend a clarifying shampoo, as im sure I have decent build up potentially. any advice would be great! tysm!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

It’s so strange to me that retailers just seem to lump them together and you never know which one you are going to get. They are both great products and they should just list them separately?

I’m looking for help with my wavy hair because I feel a bit stuck and confused 🥲\n\nMy main issues:\n\nMy hair gets very producty and heavy really fast\n\nThe waves/curls look forced rather than natural\n\nIt’s curly/wavy underneath and at the nape, but almost completely straight on top\n\nIt looks especially bad at the roots\n\nLots of frizz and dryness\n\nMy waves don’t last, and I struggle with how to sleep/preserve them\n\nHair type/details:\n\nFine strands, medium density\n\nVery easily weighed down\n\nAround 2B underneath and 2A on top\n\nRoutine and what I have tried:\n\n1. Shampoo / Conditioner:\n\nI use a regular (non-clarifying) shampoo and a hair mask in the shower. No co-wash.\n\n2. Styling products &amp; application:\n\nTried Curl Cream (Curly Love) + Gel (Curly Love): applied all over soaking-wet hair before scrunching. Result: very weighed down, hard to control, took a lot of effort, and the hold didn’t last.\n\nTried Mousse (Umberto Giannini) only: applied all over wet hair before scrunching. Result: better wave shape, but hair looked very dry, messy, and chaotic.\n\nAfter applying products, I always scrunch and then scrunch again with a T-shirt to remove excess water.\n\n3. Drying method:\n\nI diffuse my hair until it’s almost dry. After that, I tie it into a loose bun with a scrunchie.\n\n4. Other helpful info:\n\nI sleep with a silk bonnet every night, but I still wake up with crunchy, heavy, messy hair.\n\nMy hair looks almost curly in the shower, but throughout the day it loses definition and turns into a tangled mess — it’s definitely wavy though, I promise 😅\n\nWhat I’m looking for help with:\n\nLightweight product recommendations (especially for fine hair)\n\nHow to reduce frizz without weighing hair down\n\nHow to avoid that “forced curl” look, especially at the roots\n\nThe best way to sleep/preserve waves so they last more than one day\n\nHow to refresh or style without brushing (brushing ruins everything 😅)\n\nAny tips, routines, techniques, or product recs would be hugely appreciated.\n\nThank you so much in advance and sorry for the long and annoying text wall. My mother was never around to help me learn this🤍",

It's like the first photo, I'd say it resembles a poodle, that's how it usually looks for me, but my issue was my hair still felt rough. \n\nI jumped back in the shower for a second time, this time using shampoo to get rid of everything in it, then using my conditioner. Yesterday, my had good volume, it was 'organized' in flow (best way I could put it), overall it looked great, I'd say it might be the best I've seen it in a while, I was impressed because I didn't think my hair could look that good, but I have bad memory, so there's that, lol.\n\nI took my shower last night, doing my usual, now it's back to being poodle form. I don't understand what happened with my hair that made it look like yesterday. I don't know anything really about hair and wanted advice on this, I was kinda wondering if I could just make it better or keep it how it was yesterday.\n\nRoutine:\nAussie mircale curls conditioner.\nAussie mircale curls shampoo.\nAussie moisturizer.\nAussie leave in conditioner.\n\nI take a shower everyday, I use shampoo once or twice a week depending on how my hair feels on certain days, no specific time I do it, then I take turns using moisturizer and leave in everyday. One day moisturizer, next day leave in, and I air day. I don't use anything special like a bonnet, special pillowcase, or diffuser.\n\nThe first photo is today, the second was yesterday, and the third was five to six days ago.

I know this is a slim chance, but does anyone know what brand of high lift *color* Toni and Guy used around 2016-2018? Or what a similar alternative would be? \n*I have tried googling quite a bit, and can not find any actual answers, either promo color photos for Toni and guy services, or promoted/advertised color products that appear to have no tie with Toni and guy. \n\nI have dark blonde/light brown hair that most hair stylists like to treat as darker, and are surprised when it lifts too much or my roots grow lighter than a shadow root. I dyed my hair with garnier box dye twice in high school and my hair looked great.. I had one stylist at Toni and guy just use the high lift color from the swatch book (or mix a couple of the colors if we wanted something in between) and sometimes toner and my hair looked perfect for years. It was also super healthy and took the color so well. She unfortunately left the industry, and each stylist I’ve had since does not want to use color on my hair. They’ve used normal lightener/developer/toner, and it has never turned out how I want it. I also usually get a lot of damage/sensitivity from this route. \nMy current stylist is better/the closest I’ve gotten, we do the low and slow route with traditional lightener and toner , but it’s still not right and I have some sensitivity issues still. I also want to be able to maintain it easier on my own, so I was wondering if I could just buy the same brand of color that they had back then? I’m trying to avoid just buying box dye, but I’m so frustrated at this point I might. \n\nThank you for any advice! \n",
