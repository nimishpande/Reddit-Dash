I've been over the moon about how good my hair looks now. I did want a haircut, just to clean up the sides. \nBut my hair was absolutely butchered. First pic is right before, second is when I got home from the curly hair salon. It looks awful, and barely curls anymore. She thinned out the top a ton, and my volume is gone. No point to this post other than just sharing my pain. Right back to insecure about my hair.\nRoutine is simple. Just shea moisture conditioner in the shower, then not your mother's curl talk cream then gel immediately after I get out. Then scrunch and let it air dry. Now that's not working anymore because of how she cut my hair",

I feel like I’m so critical about my hair that I can’t tell what looks good anymore because im just staring at it for so long. I live in New England and I feel like winters are the worst. I feel like it makes my hair boring and flat and dry. \n\nI tried a new styling routine today and want advice on if I’m in the right direction or not or what even am I doing. Am I being overly dramatic and too much of a perfectionist or what.\n\nAlso a note I am getting a haircut next week but last time I saw someone they ruined my hair and I cried for like a month.\n\nRoutine;\n\nBrushed out my hair before the shower\n\nIn the shower double shampoo with all soft mega curls \n\nPut in all soft mega curls conditioner on hair only below my ears, clipped it up for about 10 minutes\n\nHalfway rinsed it out and brushed in the shower and then fully rinsed before getting out of the shower \n\n(This routine is slightly different than what I was doing before that wasn’t working)\n\nOut of the shower i re wet my hair, sectioned it above my ears and added very little leave in(ouidad frizz control),  Ouai curl cream, lots of mousse (NYM), very little gel diluted with water(NYM flash freeze) and then I used a bounce curl defining brush to brush style my curls in sections (hoping to avoid any middle parting in the back by doing this). After I brush style I added more mousse and then scrunched with a t shirt. I repeated this on all sections over my whole head and then I diffused starting by hovering on a cold setting, and then flipped my head upside down and diffused on medium heat then flipped my head side to side and then straight up. My hair was crunchy and then I scrunched it out with olaplex oil. so my areas of concern are my hair curled better in the back towards the top of my head and curled more around the top of my head but it seems to be falling flat and has light frizz (although I’m not sure I’ll be able to get rid of all frizz). I feel like I generally have more volume (could be just this New England winter) I also have not gone outside and probably won’t until tomorrow when I have to go to work. I sleep with a satin bonnet over a pineapple and if I refresh I do water and sometimes rizzos curl refresh spray, have no tried that with this new routine yet however.\n\nCurly hair is not for the weak it’s brutal out here lol",

      "content": "Hi y'all! I just recently started looking into how to properly take care of my hair and began trying out a curly hair routine a couple days ago. This is how it looked this morning after showering, putting in products, and diffusing. I know that it takes time for curls to reach their full form, but there's definitely room for improvement and I need some advice from the experts! First, here is my current routine/products I use:\n\n1.\t⁠Kristen Ess Extra Gentle Shampoo and Conditioner\n\n2.\t⁠Detangle with Wet brush, apply Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream\n\n3.\t⁠apply Curlsmith Hydro Style Flexi Jelly, flip head upside down and scrunch\n\n4.\t⁠apply John Frieda Frizz Ease Curl Reviver Mousse to roots and scrunch again\n\n5.\t⁠plop hair in t-shirt for a few minutes\n\n6.\t⁠diffuse until mostly dry, scrunch to break the gel cast, and put the hair near my part in a claw clip for a bit for volume\n\nSo far, I'm happy with the results of this routine, as my curls held their shape throughout the day, though my hair got a little less voluminous as time went on (and there wasn't too too much volume to begin with). The biggest thing I'm concerned about is that my hair looks dry and a little frizzy, especially towards the ends where it's more damaged, which I think is affecting the definition of my curls. I believe hair oil is a possible solution, so if you have any brand recommendations (preferably on the affordable side) or other ideas on how to fix it, let me know! Here's a list of other things I would love some advice on:\n\n\\- My roots and front pieces seem to have a very hard time curling, should I use more product there or a different method when applying product?\n\n\\- What's the best way to refresh curls after sleeping on them? There are a lot of contrasting opinions whether or not you should wet your hair and what products to use, which makes it very confusing!\n\n\\- I believe I have medium-to-high porosity hair. Should I use oil, and if so, when should I use it (before bed, to refresh hair, on wet hair, dry hair, etc.)?\n\nOk-- question tirade is over. Thank you in advance for your time and suggestions :)",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "An update from my previous post a few months ago:\n\nI’m currently on 0.5mg of dutasteride and 5mg of minoxidil, still no side effects at all.\n\nJanuary 2024 - Although I could notice my temples getting bigger since 2019, this is where I started to notice my hair was getting very thin and it would only grow a few inches compared to the hair on the back or sides of my head.\n\nJune 2024 - In those 6 months it got really bad and I started to thin very rapidly, I was formally diagnosed with AGA and started only with 2.5mg minoxidil as I was very scared of side effects from 5ARls. (In hindsight I should’ve been more scared of the sides from oral minoxidil but I was ignorant). \n\nSeptember 2024 - Decided to bite the bullet and started with 0.5mg dutasteride every other day (skipped finasteride since I wanted the absolute highest chance of regrowth).\n\nDecember 2024 - Jumped to 0.5mg dutasteride daily (this is were I started to see drastic improvement)\n\nApril 2025 - Jumped to 5mg minoxidil daily, didn’t notice much improvement vs 2.5mg.\n\nJanuary 2026 - Still running the same stack since April, I am letting my hair grow this time (I thought I’d never have long hair again and I’m so thankful I’m able to now). I do notice the bottom “half” of my hair is a lot more dense than the top half, likely due to more hairs in anagen coming up vs when the top half grew out. \n\nI also have Acquired Progressive Kinking of the Hair, which makes my sideburns incredibly curly, it seems to be linked to aggressive hair loss but there is very little scientific literature on it. This did improve but only by about 15%.\n\nAside from that I have basically reversed all my hair loss excluding the hairline, (although it did thicken a bit) I am looking to get a small hair transplant in the future to get back to NW0.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions!",

      "content": "Okay so I was literally hovering over the \"Place Order\" button on Nykaa when my desi instincts kicked in like \"beta, have you checked other apps first?\"\nI'm SO glad I listened to that inner voice because y'all... the price difference for the SAME THREE PRODUCTS was ₹360. That's literally another full-size Minimalist product just... sitting there for free if you're smart about where you order.\n\nWhat I was buying:\n1. Minimalist 8% Glycolic Acid Toner (150ml)\n2. Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Serum (30ml)\n3. Minimalist Vitamin B5 Moisturizer (50g)\n\nThe shocking price breakdown:\n\nTIRA - ₹1,186 (THE CLEAR WINNER)\n1. Cheapest price\n2. FREE Minimalist tote bag as GWP\n\nNYKAA - ₹1,441\n1. ₹255 more expensive than Tira 😬\n2. Zero freebies but you'll be paying for lice pink packaging??\n\nMYNTRA - ₹1,321\n1. ₹135 costlier than Tira\n2. No GWP either\n\nBLINKIT - ₹1,428\n₹242 more than Tira BUT delivers in 14 minutes (see screenshot lol)\n\nAJIO - ₹1,546 💀\n1. Most expensive by FAR (₹360 more than Tira!)\n2. Had random GWPs like travel vouchers??? (for skincare???). There was a coupon but it straight up refused to apply\n\n\nThat ₹360 difference is literally the price of another Minimalist product. Do. The. Math. It took me 10 minutes to check all these apps and I basically got a free product out of it. Also I'm attaching all my cart screenshots because I know the skincare community loves RECEIPTS 📸\nIs anyone else this obsessive about price-checking or is it just my broke millennial energy?",

I wash my scalp with the \"Twisty born to bounce curly shampoo\", then condition the hair with the \"Twisty wave me to the moon curly hair humectant conditioner\" and scrunch. Then I wait like 5 minutes before I rinse it out, scrunch again and leave my hair to air dry. Other than this, I don't don't do anything really.\nMy hair looks kinda good the day of washing and the following day but over the next days, it gets very weird and I don't like the way it looks. What should I do?\n\nIf you recommend any products, please, keep in mind that I'm a poor student and don't have a lot of money...

For years I tried to make tret work because the internet (and basically every dermatologist ever) made it sound like it’s the best option no matter what. \n\nAfter years of irritation prone break outs, my skin is finally clear. Azelaic acid has been a game changer by just using it a few nights a week. My rosacea is calmer, PIE has improved a lot, and my skin feels super duper smooth.\n\nHere’s my question: are retinols actually worth incorporating for fine lines and anti aging when your skin is finally stable, or is this one of those “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it” situations?\n\nDo retinols meaningfully help with early fine lines, texture, and overall aging long term, or can sunscreen + a calm barrier + consistency do most of the heavy lifting?\n\nIf you think it’s worth it, what’s the gentlest way to do it without nuking my progress? Brand recs welcome, plus your honest verdict: worth it, or leave well enough alone? I need you guys to advise me before I self sabotage.",

( 👃 )\n\nI know I might be cooked here, but any advice or suggestions would honestly go a long way! 🙈\n\nMy primary concern is clearing up my face at the moment, especially my nose area, as that is where my biggest issues are with my face\n\nI’m quite the novice when it comes to skincare and general health, though I’m sure that’s apparent, but I’ve finally reached a breaking point where I’m doing my best to turn things around in my life\n\nMy nose in particular is highly sensitive. It’s weird, almost like it gets too dry and too moist… I try lavender but it’s too harsh, some cerave moisturizer but it’s too much and makes it break out ( even when using a small amount ) and rose oil, which dries it out too much as well… My nose has been in a borderline irritated state for the majority of my life, lol\n\nIt’s like no matter what I do It gets all red and irritated and starts breaking out, as well as the surrounding area. It may partly be because I have such bad allergies and have to blow my nose all the time, but I do my best to mitigate the damage by using good tissues that aren’t rough, but it still only does so much\n\nI’ve never been to a dermatologist and honestly I’m trying to just avoid it if possible. I’m not looking for any concrete medical advice, just friendly suggestions and anything that might point me in a good direction\n\nI’m a little desperate honestly, I just turned 30, having a hard look in the mirror and finally pushing myself to get my health and general well being together again. I’ll place an order for whatever you guys think could help me out, and do my best to put it into practice\n\nThank you in advance for anyone who got this far and those who offer their help! 🤍",

I can style it, wet it, use gel, blow-dry it — after a while it pops right back up. Because of this, my hairline looks weird and uneven, and honestly it makes me look way older than I am. People have literally told me I look 30, which hurts a lot at my age.\nAt school I get teased and sometimes straight-up bullied because of it. I know it might sound stupid to some people, but it’s really affecting my confidence. I feel embarrassed all the time and I avoid mirrors and photos. Hair is supposed to be a small thing, but when it’s on your head 24/7 and people comment on it, it becomes exhausting.\nSo I’m asking anyone who has dealt with cowlicks:\nIs there any real way to get rid of them, or is that impossible?\nAre there haircuts that actually work with two cowlicks?\nAny styling tricks, products, or routines that helped you?\nShould I grow my hair longer, keep it shorter, or just buzz it?\nI’m honestly just looking for advice from people who understand. I’m tired of feeling ashamed over something I didn’t choose. Any help or personal experience would mean a lot. Thanks",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

I clearly don’t have tight curls and would still say it’s more wavy than anything, but does anyone have any advice on what I should be doing and if I should even be doing a “curl” routine? The pic is after using Miss Jessie’s Pillow Soft Curls creme and OGX Coconut Miracle Penetrating Oil, it’s also diffused but not completely dry. When I let it air dry with just a little leave-in conditioner I always have some type of wave and texture, and sometimes I will even have ringlets, but this is the most defined I’ve ever seen it. Any and all advice is welcome and appreciated! Also, if it looks like shit and as if I’m trying to force a curl, PLEASE tell me 😂 Thanks! :) ",

My entire life I’ve had infuriatingly sensitive skin, on the odd whim that I wanted to try a fancy looking product in high school just for fun I would get home and it would turn my face bright red and burning.\n\nThere are very few things I can put on my skin. Anything with citric anything, vitamin C, etc will probably burn my skin. LRP Toleraine burns my skin. I got the Clinique 3 step set for very dry skin and the “very mild” cleaner burns my skin!\n\nMy entire life I’ve basically been using a body wash for babies as my face soap. And Aveeno body lotion. Thats it\n\nTried Clinique moisture surge a while back and it burned by skin a little but now it and the “smart clinical repair” seems to be doing fine\n\nI tried to give my skin a chance to get used to the Clinique 3 step but after the redness fades I just start to itch, and I woke up in the morning feeling itchy all over my face\n\nThis feels like an uphill battle\n\nIs there any particular reason I have to have a dedicated facial cleanser? The super gentle face and body wash for babies that I’ve been using for years has worked this far, though I was never trying to bother with any skincare routine\n\nI started bc my skin is always just a bit red and uneven, little bit of acne, and I’m getting some fine line wrinkles on my forehead and under my eyes at an oddly young age so I figured I should probably do something, but it’s proving to be frustrating\n\nWhat I have so far that definitely doesn’t burn my skin:\n\nClinique Moisture Surge (probably)\n\nClinique Smart Clinical Repair\n\nThe Ordinary Aloe\n\nThe Ordinary Squalane\n\nCosrx Snail Mucin\n\nNiacinamide (I do not remember what it was in or even what niacinamide does but I know it didn’t burn me so)\n\nI ordered a few more products from the ordinary, as well as a “super gentle cleanser” from Paula’s choice. If that doesn’t work I might give up on the cleanser and go back to baby soap lol\n\nBut I’m open to any and all advice \n\nI really want to start tret for the acne and wrinkles but at this point I’m terrified that I would just melt my skin off even at the lowest dose once a week ",

I waited 3-4 weeks for it to go away but it wouldn't even lighten so I was recommended Mederma scar gel by someone. I bought it and started rubbing it lightly on the pimple, did this for about about 7-9 days when I noticed that whole area getting discolored and looking burnt. I've since then stopped using Mederma completely. It's so prominent that I don't even have to circle it in the pictures :/\n\nHow do I fix this?? For reference, I'm 30M, drink a good amount of water.\n\nMy current routine in an attempt to make the discoloration go away:  \nNight time: Wash face -&gt; apply Vitamin C serum on the spot -&gt; Kojic Acid on the spot -&gt; moisturize\n\nMorning: Wash face -&gt; Vitamin C on face - &gt; Moisturize -&gt; sunscreen but most days i'm at home and inside so i skip this\n\nPlease help and let me know if there are any other things I should be using to even out the skin so it doesn't look like I have a burn spot in the middle of my forehead!!

I’ve recently started noticing more breakouts around my chin/lip/jaw area, it seems to be worse on the left side. (the first two pics are the left side and the last is the right) I used to only get this around my period but since maybe two months ago it’s always there, it gets especially bad on my jaw again on the left side.\n\nmy diet and sleep are okay, admittedly they could be better. i use kiehl’s ultra facial barrier skin hydrating cleanser (amino acids, squalane, and glycerin) 1-2 times a day depending on how my skins feeling, and then once every other week i use iS clinical warming honey cleanser, which is a gentle exfoliant with royal jelly and papaya enzymes, i kinda have been lacking on this one. after i cleanse i use the cosrx’s ceramide skin moisturizer (panthenol b5 &amp; hyaluronic acid). then i use mineral spf by glow screen. i used to exfoliate once a week with glycolic acid on a cotton pad for a month or two but i stopped after noticing some redness on my cheeks, it did seem to help with the chin acne tho. i also experimented with putting hyaluronic acid on a few minutes after the glycolic acid. i was quickly dissuaded by multiple derms on youtube so i stopped. \n\nany ideas on what’s going on here with my skin and possible solutions? should i try glycolic acid again? open to any suggestions thanks 🫶",

It would be helpful if someone who has personally undergone this treatment could share their experience.\n\nAlso, why isn’t subcision discussed as much? Most people seem to recommend CO₂ lasers, which usually give minimal results for depressed scars since they cannot lift them.

I was not able to communicate well with the stylist due to a language barrier and feel like it was also a miscommunication in general about what I wanted. I take responsibility for not getting what I envisioned, so I am just looking for direction. I have these photos for reference on what I was going for and photos of what the end result was I want to know if there is a way to achieve this look or something similar? I am worried about my hair pulling green now that it has been bleached if I were going to add/ask for a color or toner over it. Should I just wait this out? Should I ask for a root smudge or low lights or would something entirely different suit my skin tone? The roots are pretty close to my natural I have had lived in color/balayage and this was my first time back in the salon since May 2025. I am feeling anxious and just looking for some direction. Thank you in advance!",
