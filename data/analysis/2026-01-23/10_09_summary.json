      "content": "An update from my previous post a few months ago:\n\nI’m currently on 0.5mg of dutasteride and 5mg of minoxidil, still no side effects at all.\n\nJanuary 2024 - Although I could notice my temples getting bigger since 2019, this is where I started to notice my hair was getting very thin and it would only grow a few inches compared to the hair on the back or sides of my head.\n\nJune 2024 - In those 6 months it got really bad and I started to thin very rapidly, I was formally diagnosed with AGA and started only with 2.5mg minoxidil as I was very scared of side effects from 5ARls. (In hindsight I should’ve been more scared of the sides from oral minoxidil but I was ignorant). \n\nSeptember 2024 - Decided to bite the bullet and started with 0.5mg dutasteride every other day (skipped finasteride since I wanted the absolute highest chance of regrowth).\n\nDecember 2024 - Jumped to 0.5mg dutasteride daily (this is were I started to see drastic improvement)\n\nApril 2025 - Jumped to 5mg minoxidil daily, didn’t notice much improvement vs 2.5mg.\n\nJanuary 2026 - Still running the same stack since April, I am letting my hair grow this time (I thought I’d never have long hair again and I’m so thankful I’m able to now). I do notice the bottom “half” of my hair is a lot more dense than the top half, likely due to more hairs in anagen coming up vs when the top half grew out. \n\nI also have Acquired Progressive Kinking of the Hair, which makes my sideburns incredibly curly, it seems to be linked to aggressive hair loss but there is very little scientific literature on it. This did improve but only by about 15%.\n\nAside from that I have basically reversed all my hair loss excluding the hairline, (although it did thicken a bit) I am looking to get a small hair transplant in the future to get back to NW0.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions!",

      "content": "Before anyone says anything, yes, I understand the importance of SPF 50, I use it religiously everyday on my arms and face, but unfortunately, did not use it enough last Saturday at the beach and have learnt a valuable lesson. I am 30 weeks pregnant, I did NOT know that being pregnant can enhance the affects from the sun and if I knew this specifically, I would never have stayed at the beach for an hour and a half. UV was unfortunately 9, but 26 degrees.\n\nIm really wanting some not advice, but guidance. Any experiences? Any suggestions? Really just wanting to not feel alone during this. It’s been hard, being pregnant has been tough enough but this added on has crushed my confidence, lol. Been wearing airy elephant indian pants or just any long pants to cover really, even looking at it makes me want to cry,\n\non Day 6 since being sunburnt. The images below are taken today.\n\nFirst 4 days, absolute agony, crying, losing my mind, feeling like an alien, absolutely devastated over the damage of my legs.\n\nBeen to the doctor yesterday, she prescribed me Tricortone. I’ve applied twice to the parts that have been still a bit sore and need a little extra “help” with inflammation.\n\nThese are the things I have been doing:\n\nMild cold showers for the first 4 days, using shower head over my body, i’ve mainly been only burnt on my legs in the photos. Have had a couple oatmeal baths to really get some hydration back into there.\n\nAloe Vera - 100%, I don’t have a plant, but if you recommend me get one and it’ll 100% make a difference, which I doubt at this point, i’ll invest.\n\nHave been using aveeno oatmeal moisturiser/alternating with Vitamin E moisturiser on top.\n\nHave bought “Solosite” this morning and have applied once so far on the areas I believe have started to create small blisters.\n\nI have only had 3 1-2 cm’s blisters up until today. The small little bubbles im under the assumption are new blisters all forming over my body?\n\nHave been drinking 4-5 litres of water. Extra electrolytes, celtic salt, etc.\n\nThe doctor specifically told me yesterday that the purple on my skin is just under the skin bruising and that’s why it’s so purple on the surface, but I feel as if i’m needing a second opinion. Been told I don’t need a dermatologist, but considering it at this point.\n\nI’m thankful the painful limbs, muscles and aches have gone away as panadol was only just taking the edge off (can’t have neurofen during pregnancy), but this has been so worried. I’m wanting to do anything I can to help this.\n\nAgain, I understand the importance of sunscreen. I always wear SPF 50, everyday, but the Australian sun does NOT play and I am NOT experienced with being at the beach or even at the sun for extended periods of time. Im always scared of things like this happening as a pale white girlie. This has traumatised me lol. I’ve already asked my doctor my chances of sun cancer due to this, she says because this is my first ever bad burn, I need repetitive consistent exposure to be worried but i’m still going to get annual skin checks after this to be safe. This has genuinely never happened to me before.\n\nPlease and thank you in advance.",

I feel like I’m so critical about my hair that I can’t tell what looks good anymore because im just staring at it for so long. I live in New England and I feel like winters are the worst. I feel like it makes my hair boring and flat and dry. \n\nI tried a new styling routine today and want advice on if I’m in the right direction or not or what even am I doing. Am I being overly dramatic and too much of a perfectionist or what.\n\nAlso a note I am getting a haircut next week but last time I saw someone they ruined my hair and I cried for like a month.\n\nRoutine;\n\nBrushed out my hair before the shower\n\nIn the shower double shampoo with all soft mega curls \n\nPut in all soft mega curls conditioner on hair only below my ears, clipped it up for about 10 minutes\n\nHalfway rinsed it out and brushed in the shower and then fully rinsed before getting out of the shower \n\n(This routine is slightly different than what I was doing before that wasn’t working)\n\nOut of the shower i re wet my hair, sectioned it above my ears and added very little leave in(ouidad frizz control),  Ouai curl cream, lots of mousse (NYM), very little gel diluted with water(NYM flash freeze) and then I used a bounce curl defining brush to brush style my curls in sections (hoping to avoid any middle parting in the back by doing this). After I brush style I added more mousse and then scrunched with a t shirt. I repeated this on all sections over my whole head and then I diffused starting by hovering on a cold setting, and then flipped my head upside down and diffused on medium heat then flipped my head side to side and then straight up. My hair was crunchy and then I scrunched it out with olaplex oil. so my areas of concern are my hair curled better in the back towards the top of my head and curled more around the top of my head but it seems to be falling flat and has light frizz (although I’m not sure I’ll be able to get rid of all frizz). I feel like I generally have more volume (could be just this New England winter) I also have not gone outside and probably won’t until tomorrow when I have to go to work. I sleep with a satin bonnet over a pineapple and if I refresh I do water and sometimes rizzos curl refresh spray, have no tried that with this new routine yet however.\n\nCurly hair is not for the weak it’s brutal out here lol",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

Oral treatment helped stop the severe breakouts, but it left behind stubborn acne marks and visible pores. After moving countries, my acne flared up again quite badly possibly due to diet, environment or hormonal changes.\n\nMy family doctor prescribed **Cabtreo (Clindamycin 1.2% + Adapalene 0.15% + Benzoyl Peroxide 3.1%)**, which has helped stop active breakouts. However, my skin is currently **very irritated and dry**, even though the acne itself has improved.\n\n# Current routine:\n\n**AM**\n\n* La Roche-Posay Effaclar Cleanser\n* La Roche-Posay Effaclar A.Z Gel\n* La Roche-Posay Ultra-Fluide Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n* La Roche-Posay Effaclar Cleanser\n* Cabtreo\n* Cetaphil Moisturizer\n\nIn the past year, I’ve occasionally used **CeraVe Retinol Serum**, but not consistently.\n\nI’d love advice on:\n\n* Whether I should use **Cabtreo every night or reduce frequency**\n* What other products (if any) I should add to my routine?\n* How to improve texture, pores, and acne marks without worsening irritation?\n* I recently got **LRP Hyalu B5** and **Mela B3 Serum** from LRP along with my order, can I use them to soothe my skin, and if so, **when should I use them?**\n* Suggest me a gentle oil-free moisturizer.\n\nI’m still pretty naive when it comes to skincare routines and would really appreciate some guidance.

My partner is looking to do a face mask and I want to help him reach his skincare goals. He wants to keep his skin clear, avoiding pimples and blemishes. He consented to me posting on his behalf. I have the Peach slices snail rescue on me and the Peach Lilly Super Reboot masks but I'm hesitant to have him use it since I don't want it to hurt his face. \n\nHis skincare routine is washing his face in the shower everyday with bar soap and finishing off with cold water to close his pores. Then he puts on CeraVe lotion on his face. On weekends, he uses my Tatcha Rice Wash, washing with bar soap beforehand. \n\nWhat are some suggestions or products, particularly face masks you'd recommend? He likes doing them with me. Any other suggestions on products to add to routine would also be appreciated! Thanks a ton! 😊",

      "content": "I have been getting more and more of these bumps over the last 5 years. It started in late 2020 on my chin and has gradually spread to both my cheeks. Cheese-whiz consistency stuff comes out when I squeeze them and they are incredibly difficult to get rid of. My routine for years has been neutrons makeup wipes and 10% benzoyl peroxide wash at night, followed by azelaic acid topical gel and occasional adapalene gel and clindamycin gel as needed. Tretinoin is too harsh for my skin and I have always been oily. Whether I wear makeup or not, the bumps persist. They are less noticeable in the morning and worse at night. Pimple patches and charcoal masks chill them out. The more I go at them, it seems the worse they get. I am SO sick of them. My dermatologist didn’t give me a straight answer about them and kept pushing hormonal birth control pills, despite my objection. I’m not looking for a diagnosis here, rather a general direction. I’ve explored them being milia, sebaceous filaments, and perioral dermatitis based on other posts and forums. The bumps didn’t onset until a few months after we started wearing masks every day at work during the pandemic. It could be coincidence, though. Can anyone give me a general direction or products to try? I’m open to anything at this point. \n\nHopefully my post follows all the rules, I did read them, and am open to feedback to get some help.",

However, my face has gotten worse with more hyperpigmentations and new acne, and it has been really bothering me so I went ahead to see a GP. An actual dermatologist will cost too much for me at this point\n\nThey determined that my acne was likely a result of stress, and advised me to start using Differin on a daily basis, and prescribed me:\n\n1. Benzac spot treaments 5% benzoyl peroxide\n2. Clindamycin (Mycin Lotion)\n\nand told me to use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night as spot treatment.\n\nHowever, reading through this subreddit, I've seen a lot of advice thrown around to avoid using other actives with Differin as it can cause skin irritation and damage my skin barrier. So far, I do not feel any burning on my skin and only have had more pimples and hyperpigmentations as a side effect from Differin.\n\nI am very confused on what to do. On one hand, I feel like I should be listening to a doctor more than I listen to Reddit. But as it was a General Practitioner, and not a specialist, (Dermatologist) along with the general advice here, I also feel the tug to not follow through with the medication.\n\nWhat are your opinions on this? Is it a bad idea to use these 2 medications with Differin?",

So I did. After 24 hours I got in a shower, I rinsed my hair for a while, really working my fingers through, then washed it, scrubbing my scalp and even through to the ends as hard as I could, five times. I even used Head and Shoulders and a scalp scrubber (one of those hard, pointy rubber ones). I used very hot water the whole time. My scalp is on fire. But the product is still in my hair! I look like a disgusting grease ball that doesn’t know how to bathe. And it feels just as bad. I’m so ashamed and embarrassed and can’t stop crying. How do I get this crap out of my hair!

That's literally another full-size Minimalist product just... sitting there for free if you're smart about where you order.\n\nWhat I was buying:\n1. Minimalist 8% Glycolic Acid Toner (150ml)\n2. Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Serum (30ml)\n3. Minimalist Vitamin B5 Moisturizer (50g)\n\nThe shocking price breakdown:\n\nTIRA - ₹1,186 (THE CLEAR WINNER)\n1. Cheapest price\n2. FREE Minimalist tote bag as GWP\n\nNYKAA - ₹1,441\n1. ₹255 more expensive than Tira 😬\n2. Zero freebies but you'll be paying for lice pink packaging??\n\nMYNTRA - ₹1,321\n1. ₹135 costlier than Tira\n2. No GWP either\n\nBLINKIT - ₹1,428\n₹242 more than Tira BUT delivers in 14 minutes (see screenshot lol)\n\nAJIO - ₹1,546 💀\n1. Most expensive by FAR (₹360 more than Tira!)\n2. Had random GWPs like travel vouchers??? (for skincare???). There was a coupon but it straight up refused to apply\n\n\nThat ₹360 difference is literally the price of another Minimalist product. Do. The. Math. It took me 10 minutes to check all these apps and I basically got a free product out of it. Also I'm attaching all my cart screenshots because I know the skincare community loves RECEIPTS 📸\nIs anyone else this obsessive about price-checking or is it just my broke millennial energy?",

So far I have:\n\nPrequel Gleanser\n\nPrequel hypochlorous acid spray (this was recommended to me by an esthetician i went to for a facial)\n\nByoma balancing face mist\n\nByoma De-Puff and brighten eye gel\n\nI get super lost when it comes to which serums and toners are best for my skin type and concerns.

It’s weird, almost like it gets too dry and too moist… I try lavender but it’s too harsh, some cerave moisturizer but it’s too much and makes it break out ( even when using a small amount ) and rose oil, which dries it out too much as well… My nose has been in a borderline irritated state for the majority of my life, lol \n\nIt’s like no matter what I do It gets all red and irritated and starts breaking out, as well as the surrounding area. It may partly be because I have such bad allergies and have to blow my nose all the time, but I do my best to mitigate the damage by using good tissues that aren’t rough, but it still only does so much \n\nI’ve never been to a dermatologist and honestly I’m trying to just avoid it if possible. I’m not looking for any concrete medical advice, just friendly suggestions and anything that might point me in a good direction \n\nI’m a little desperate honestly, I just turned 30, having a hard look in the mirror and finally pushing myself to get my health and general well being together again. I’ll place an order for whatever you guys think could help me out, and do my best to put it into practice \n\nThank you in advance for anyone who got this far and those who offer their help! 🤍",

I have oily skin but I've always had clear skin even in my puberty phase, I always only got one acne whenever I'm about to get my period. It happened since March 2024 up until now January 2025. It has been recurring, it gets better but worsens whenever I'm about to get my period. Its a very tiring cycle and I don't know what to do at all. When I break out I would get tiny pimples &amp; about 5 painful acnes at the same time sometimes near my eyebrow too. \n\nMy current skincare routine is very simple, I cleanse my face using Numbuzin cleansing oil, followed up by Benton green tea cleansing foam dokdo toner, then I use RoundLab dokdo toner &amp; Laneige water bank blue hyaluronic gel moisturizer. I exfoliate using Paula's Choice 2% BHA toner once every three days. Is there anything that I should change in my routine? Any recommendation on what I can do maybe like taking supplements? Your help means a lot to me thank you",

      "content": "So for context, I’ve got wavy (2c ?) hair at the top of my head however the strands are pretty much just straight underneath that or maybe 1b/1c.\n\nI straighten my hair maybe 2/3 times a month, most of the times using a heat protectant (I just get lazy sometimes 😗). I get a trim I’d say every 6 months now and when I do I also get my hair thinned out as I have thick hair and a lot of it.\n\nFor a routine I’ll shampoo, condition (90% of the time) then smooth in some mielle (purple) leave in conditioner and Umberto Gianni curl jelly. Sometimes I’ll diffuse but if I’m going out I’ll let it air dry. I have also used the unberto Gianni curl cream but stopped as I felt I was doing too much to my hair and I get pretty similar results anyways.\n\nFor shampoo I rotate between garnier method of curls and wella elements renewing shampoo (the green one), I use their respective conditioners for that. Although i think the method for curls conditioner is actually a mask. I also use Paul Mitchell clarifying shampoo about 2-3 times a month.\n\nNow to the issue, lately (past few months) I’ve been losing a lot of hair when I wash it. It has wet frizz and feels strawy when wet. My curls don’t hold anymore either. I could have some form of 2c/3a mix the day I wash it but the next day it falls flat and looks a mess with pieces everywhere. It also gets quite oily and doesn’t last longer than 2 days at most\n\nMain Question\n\nI was contemplating a hair Botox, Brazilian blow dry or a K18 treatment to tame frizz and make it shinier again. However after a day long google search I am just as confused on what’s best than when I started looking. I will take any recommendations, suggestions, advice, or alternative solutions at all.\n\nI am also open to any product or styling advice 🙏\n\nWhat I don’t want\n\nI don’t mind my hair being straightened out by a treatment but I hate seeing the hair regrow tbh at the top when keratin is wearing off and therefore wouldn’t prefer it nor do I want keratin at all since I heard it just leaves it damaged and then you can’t have curls or straighten it\n\nWhat I have considered\n\nRoller sets (might give me curls with less frizz)\n\nHair Botox\n\nBrazilian blow dry\n\nK18 treatment\n\nHair glossing \n\nWhat I have tried\n\n\\- Will stop getting hair thinned out\n\n\\- only using leave in (hair became puffy with no definition and dry)\n\n\\- Used Camille rose moisture milk with jojoba oil to seal it in. Diffused hair till 80% dry and put it in pigtails. This made it kind of shiny and soft but it’s still not fully dry so will update tomorrow when it’s (hopefully) dry.",

What can i do for the rest which falls almost completely flat.\n\nRoutine:\n\n1) Shampoo, hair mask instead of conditioner(both dove), have always worked for me\n\n2) curl cream and gel (curl up), i apply it to my lengths comb it in and scrunch and pulse\n\n3) remove excess water with microfibre towel and then diffuse\n\nI do have bleached hair and also occasionally blow it out to straighten it, is it possible the damage has gotten too bad? But Finger curling the front bleached parts works well but i obviously cant do that for my whole head. The washed curls turn into waves while i diffuse and after an hour or so completely fall flat. Also i’m Indian idk if that would help somehow. \n\nAlso the photo is the same day as washing and the front curl was finger coiled just then.\n\nAny advice would be helpful, thank you",

It’s not very curly, but it’s hard to manage whilst postpartum. I really want to get my hair permanently straightened but I know I can’t on bleached hair. Do you think it’s best to do a big chop?
