My hair feels like it almost randomizes, some days like the 1st photo, some like tbe 2nd, sometimes straighter, sometimes curlier, but usually between the 1st and 2nd photo. 3rd 4th pics are my hair rn after a brush with today being hair wash day\n\nI know I have curls, I think maybe 2b? Not totally sure though. I've heard i may need a clarifying shampoo, but im very uneducated about properly taking care of my curls, though I have tried with experimenting. Ive thought about olaplex, but ive seen a ton of reviews its absolutely ruined people's hair texture \n\nmy routine:\n\n\\- hair wash every other day \n\n\\- shampoo: Pantene Pro V daily moisture renewal \n\n\\- conditioner: Pantene Pro V daily moisture renewal \n\n\\- second conditioner: Hask organic oil repairing conditioner\n\n\\- brush out and let air dry, scrunch method\n\n\\- very recently ive been using argan magic intensive hair oil about once a week but havent noticed a substantial difference \n\n\\- my hair becomes incredibly frizzy and loses curl texture after brushing when its dry, but curls up immediately after a shower\n\nI feel kind of at a loss on what my hair needs. I see all this stuff about proteins and other elements, and I need to do more research, but im not sure where to look or even what my hair type actually is. \n\ncurious if anyone else would reccomend a clarifying shampoo, as im sure I have decent build up potentially. any advice would be great! tysm!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Oral treatment helped stop the severe breakouts, but it left behind stubborn acne marks and visible pores. After moving countries, my acne flared up again quite badly possibly due to diet, environment or hormonal changes.\n\nMy family doctor prescribed **Cabtreo (Clindamycin 1.2% + Adapalene 0.15% + Benzoyl Peroxide 3.1%)**, which has helped stop active breakouts. However, my skin is currently **very irritated and dry**, even though the acne itself has improved.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n**AM**\n\n* La Roche-Posay Effaclar Cleanser\n* La Roche-Posay Effaclar A.Z Gel\n* La Roche-Posay Ultra-Fluide Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n* La Roche-Posay Effaclar Cleanser\n* Cabtreo\n* Cetaphil Moisturizer\n\nIn the past year, I’ve occasionally used **CeraVe Retinol Serum**, but not consistently.\n\nI’d love advice on:\n\n* Whether I should use **Cabtreo every night or reduce frequency**\n* What other products (if any) I should add to my routine?\n* How to improve texture, pores, and acne marks without worsening irritation?\n* I recently got **LRP Hyalu B5** and **Mela B3 Serum** from LRP along with my order, can I use them to soothe my skin and if so, **when should I use them?**\n* Suggest me a gentle oil-free moisturizer.\n\nI’m still pretty naive when it comes to skincare routines and would really appreciate some guidance.

My current under eye situation is super bad and I’ve been told my dermatologists that there is a large genetic component to this. This is very disheartening to hear especially because I’ve been working hard to make them brighter and plumper. I’ve been combining and alternating a routine that uses collagen serum (from Medicube), Vitamin C brightening under eye cream (Oli Henriksen) and a Hyaluronic under eye serum. I’ve been using these products consistently for 3-4 months. Will adding caffeine under-eye patches do anything or just increase the pile of useless product on my shelf. I’m sure these products are doing something for me and probably preventing my under-eyes from getting even worse, but I don’t know what to do to make them better.\n\nI’m attaching pics of my under-eyes for reference (They look slightly darker in real life).

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe have a really bad family history of hair loss on my mom’s side, including women. I was able to catch mine early and got decent results with finasteride, but my mom’s hair is thinning badly, similar to my grandmother’s. I understand that hair loss in women can be more complicated.\n\nLately, this has been affecting her emotionally a lot. She’s become afraid to even take a shower because of how much hair she sees falling out, and sometimes she cries because of it. Seeing her go through this honestly breaks my heart.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for what I could help her use? Would minoxidil or spironolactone be appropriate? Can they be used together? Or is there anything else she could try?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",

      "content": "Hi! I’m a junior high school student about to graduate, and I honestly have zero knowledge when it comes to skincare, makeup, and even hair care. I don’t really know what products are good for someone who’s just starting out or which ones are actually worth buying.\n\nI’m also the only girl in our family aside from my mom, so I don’t really have anyone to ask or learn from. I’d love to start with basic skincare first—something effective but also affordable. As for makeup, I want to keep it super simple for now. I’m mainly interested in learning how to use powder, blush, and lippie, just to practice and get used to it.\n\nI also wanted to ask about hair care. My hair tends to get frizzy/buhaghag, and I want to make it look straighter, smoother, and just healthier overall (not necessarily salon-straight). Are there any beginner-friendly and affordable hair products—like shampoo, conditioner, hair oil, or treatments—that actually help with straightening and making hair look really good? I’ve heard keratin conditioners and anti-frizz products help, but I don’t know where to start .\n\nHow did you guys learn when you were beginners? Do you have any tips, hacks, or beginner mistakes to avoid—for skincare, makeup, and hair? Like small tricks that made things easier for you or things you wish you knew earlier (especially in a humid country like the PH 😭).\n\nAny advice, routines, or suggestions would mean a lot. Thank you so much in advance ",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

When I started taking real care of my hair I realized I had curly hair and I was really happy about it. Then after an unfortunate haircut my hair never recovered.... Lately I'm seeing some curls on the front but the sides are quite flat, almost wavy at best. Overall I can't seem to figure out a way to give them a proper shape even if I haven't really changed my routine haircut, and I don't really know what to do for hair frizziness (I know curly hair is naturally more frizzy than other). I use shampoo and conditioner, on wet hair I put a leave on cream and just a bit of argan oil, and I add another drop when it's dry if needed. First two pictures are my \"prime\", then the day everything changed, and my hair today after washing. I'm sorry for the long post, I feel really bad about it and I feel helpless...  I used to cut my hair probably 3 max 4 times a year, now after about amonth (my situation now) I'm tired of the mess and I want to cut. Thanks to everyone that will read all this, I truly appreciate it",

Still oily, so i washed it for the third time 🥲 with clarifying, with redken mint shampoo and with elvital red one and it's still oily 😩 since then i have washed it everyday at least twice, except yesterday i didn't wash it because i felt like my hair needed a break, it was so dry from the roots. \n\nWashed it again today, i tried applying shampoo to dry hair, then wash it and then add shampoo twice. I feel like maybe it isn't as oily now? but it's still oily. Should i try this methid again tomorrow or the day after that? and because i have washed my hair so much past this week should i do some special treatments? I feel like maybe i have damaged it a lot 😬 or should i just get back to normal.",

I’ve been consistently using it and noticed I haven’t really had any breakouts except around my period. I want to get rid of the dots on my nose and improve brightness, and my upper lip always has dark spots (I use facial razors on my moustache and I think it makes me get pimples?? I always have dark spots there it’s so annoying). I’ve done research into the ordinary products and what not but I’m just scared to add anything new? I tried the Paula’s choice BA thing a few times and it definitely made me breakout and I was too scared to let my skin purge or whatever.

Currently using a Pantene shampoo for colored hair (because I have highlights), and the Aussie miracle curls conditioner. \n\nI always style on soaking wet hair, do a light leave in conditioner/detangler, oil on the ends (because my hair is DRY just like my skin), and either a combo between Aussie curl mousse and then gel, or Aussie curl mousse and  Miss Jackie’s multicultural curls cream. I normally use a wet brush when I get out of the shower, and rack my products through before scrunching. \n\nUsually air dry, sometimes diffuse - depends on how much time I have lol\n\nI look at pictures from my hair from 2 years ago, and it was BEAUTIFUL, defined, soft, touchable waves. It was like my whole head of hair was following the same pattern. I threw it up in a high pony when I slept with a satin scrunchie (still do now but with a bonnet), and yet it would always turn out amazing. Doing the same routine I’m doing now, just living somewhere different. I even see the same stylist!\n\nBut now when I do my hair, I feel like it always looks horrible. I follow the same routine with the only new addition I can think of being I plop it in a t-shirt for a bit after adding my products, but my hair looks for different. There’s stringy parts that aren’t curly, the hairs on the crown of my head bend in a weird way, and they’re in no way unified in their definition throughout like they used to be. They’re also straighter by my roots now? \n\nSince I’m living in a different spot I thought it could be the water, but it’s been well water in both places. Any chance it could just be plopping it for 10 minutes like I have been?\n\nIf anyone else has ever experienced this please help. I’m not sure what I can try but I’m up for anything! ",

It's like the first photo, I'd say it resembles a poodle, that's how it usually looks for me, but my issue was my hair still felt rough. \n\nI jumped back in the shower for a second time, this time using shampoo to get rid of everything in it, then using my conditioner. Yesterday, my had good volume, it was 'organized' in flow (best way I could put it), overall it looked great, I'd say it might be the best I've seen it in a while, I was impressed because I didn't think my hair could look that good, but I have bad memory, so there's that, lol.\n\nI took my shower last night, doing my usual, now it's back to being poodle form. I don't understand what happened with my hair that made it look like yesterday. I don't know anything really about hair and wanted advice on this, I was kinda wondering if I could just make it better or keep it how it was yesterday.\n\nRoutine:\nAussie mircale curls conditioner.\nAussie mircale curls shampoo.\nAussie moisturizer.\nAussie leave in conditioner.\n\nI take a shower everyday, I use shampoo once or twice a week depending on how my hair feels on certain days, no specific time I do it, then I take turns using moisturizer and leave in everyday. One day moisturizer, next day leave in, and I air day. I don't use anything special like a bonnet, special pillowcase, or diffuser.\n\nThe first photo is today, the second was yesterday, and the third was five to six days ago.
