      "content": "I fell in love with the Bounce Curl Brush when I purchased it for the almost perfect ringlets it gave me. But over the maybe 3yrs I've been using it, my hair has not grown an inch.\n\nI don't like the hair typing system, but just for reference:\nI have around 3c-4a hair.\nMedium density\nMedium porosity\nMedium strand thickness, although I've found some thicker strands &amp; some thin strands of hair in my head.\nMy hair is all Virgin, no dye or bleach. (Pictures I post with hair color is hair wax, which is an product overlay, not a dye)\n\nWhen I use the brush, I make sure my hair is FULLY DETANGLED with a wide tooth comb &amp; Tangle Teaser before styling with it. I'm positive it's not user error that there's lots of hair stuck on the brush &amp; that my ends are splitting. I find myself having to trim more often than most because my hair starts feeling rough.\n\nI only straighten my hair approximately 1-2xs a year in the Winter because I live in the South. I straightened my hair for my birthday in January &amp; decided since it was straightened, it would be easier to see any damage. I used the search &amp; destroy method to go through as many sections of hair as possible &amp; snip off damage. The amount of single strand knots, split ends, breakage &amp; even keyhole splits I had in my hair was insane.\n\nKeyhole splits in particular, I read, are mostly caused by mechanical damage, i.e. brush styling, high tension, pulling &amp; playing in your hair too much, etc. I'm almost certain most of this damage &amp; the breakage is coming from the Bounce Curl Brush &amp; I'm going to stop using it to see if this is the cause of the breakage. \n\nRoutine &amp; Products:\n\n1) Pre-wash detangle using a wide tooth comb on damp hair &amp; a light leave-in conditioner to provide slip.\n2) Shampoo with Tresemmé Rich Moisture. Clarify 1x a month or as needed with Paul Mitchell's Shampoo 2.\n3) Condition with the Tresemmé Rich Moisture &amp; on Clarify Shampoo days, I use Ouidad's Coil Infusion Triple Threat Deep Conditioner. \n3) On wet hair, I apply Camille Rose's Curl Love Moisture Milk as a leave-in in sections using my fingers.\n3) I section my hair and apply Camille Rose's Spiked Honey Mousse with my fingers. Then I take smaller sections that I want to style, make sure it's fully detangled with a pass through with a Tangle Teaser, then do one pass with the Bounce Curl Brush, using the tension &amp; tilt the brush into the divots as it's supposed to be used.\n4) I scrunch in a little bit of the Ouidad Curl Quencher Gel on styled sections (I didn't care for this too much but I'm trying to get rid of it lol).\n5) Hover-Diffuse blow dry my hair for about 20-30mins. Let the rest air dry.\n6) Scrunch out the crunch &amp; separate curl clumps with Mise En Scene Perfect Serum.\n\nFor bed, I pineapple with a scarf &amp; put on a bonnet.\nIn the mornings, I let my hair get some steam in the shower, take off the bonnet, shake, use a little serum, finger coil a few wonky strands if needed. I wash 1x a week.\n\nTL;DR: I feel like the Bounce Curl Brush's high tension styling causes breakage &amp; other forms of mechanical damage.\n\nWanted to know if anyone else felt the same way!",

      "content": "I’m a dev and a dad to a daughter who is currently battling some pretty persistent acne. I’ve spent the last few months watching her manually look up every single ingredient in her products on various \"pore clogging\" websites.\n\nTwo things bothered me:\n\nIt took her forever to type everything in.\n\nWhen I started looking into the data she was using, I realized a lot of these \"comedogenic scales\" are based on studies from decades ago.\n\nI decided to do a deep dive into more recent ingredient research to see what has changed. I've been compiling an updated list of ingredients that are often flagged but might not be as bad as once thought (and vice versa). I can post some of my findings if anyone needs to know more about it.\n\nAs an example some ingredients are fine if they are in singularity meaning it is not mixed with certain other ingredient/s but combined they create a big issue. So the tool is pretty smart it that sense as well as it looks for the major combos that if present can cause issues.\n\nAnother thing i noticed in my findings is that some ingredients are still ok with drier skin if they are present in smaller quantities but not ok for oily skin type.\n\nOne other thing i realized is that in the INCI standard way of listing the ingredients is a sorted order from highest to lowest meaning if in the list of 20 ingredients the first one in the list makes up the largest amount in the formula so sometimes a bad ingredient might be in a very non critical volume but some checkers can just list it. So i thought while listing them out we should also look at this criteria as well.\n\nSo short story I ended up building a small tool for her where she can just take a photo of the bottle and not just it highlights the ingredients if that is just what you need, but if you need detailed information then it also shares a lot of information as to why it has a MACR score (this is also my own coined term) LOL, but to be honest it is pretty smart system and it gives a score for all skin types.\n\nI'm happy to share the updated info I found or the tool itself if anyone is interested it is called Acne Safe Checker.\n\nBecause it is free so i am not selling it here. Just thought this will help anyone in the same situation as i see that the process has helped my daughter when she moved to proper checking everything. The acne is still there not completely gone but a whole lot better for sure now and she complains a lot less about breakouts.",

      "title": "Had curly hair all my life but now it’s straight?",
      "content": "So like the title says for some reason my hair has gone from a frizzy Hermione Granger mess to basically straight. Even when I use heat to curl my hair the curls fall out after a few hours and by the end of the day it’s basically straight with the absolute loosest of waves.\n\nUp until a few years ago I never did anything with my curls to enhance them simply because I didn’t know how and didn’t want to make my hair crunchy like when my mom would put product in my hair when I was little (I have what many hair stylists have called “baby fine” hair and I honestly love the softness that comes with such fine hair, so I don’t like the crunchy/texture/feeling that a lot of hair products give)\n\nFor a couple years I tried many products and tried the whole curly girl routine to try an enhance my natural curls but I could just never get a curl pattern that I actually liked. So I gave up maybe about a year ago now and figured that maybe the next time I have money to actually get my hair done by a stylist that I would go to a curly hair specialist that could actually teach me what I can do with my specific hair/curls that I have obviously not been able to understand yet.\n\nAfter giving up on the curly hair routine because it just felt like a lot of work for hair I didn’t even like I just started focusing on hydrating/healing/protecting my hair. After a few months I started noticing a difference in my hair feeling healthier and smoother, and then a few months ago I noticed that my hair is just basically straight now. I can still get it to curl when it’s still wet directly after washing it and scrunching so it will have same wave once it dries but the curls will always fall out later that day.\n\nAs for damage/protecting my hair, as evident by the pictures of my hair I obviously dye my hair which involves bleaching my roots every 3-4 months. Since my hair grows very slow and my hair holds onto the semi-permanent red/oraunge dye very well so I don’t need to touch up my hair very often, I also rarely use any heat on my hair, and I sleep with a bonnet+silky pillow case every night.\n\nI wash my hair every 1-2 weeks with Heritages shampoo and conditioner from Walmart and then I sometimes use OGX coconut milk serum if my hair is feeling a little extra dry and frizzy, I’ll apply it directly after washing my hair and while my hair is still damp and I’ll focus primarily of the ends of my hair. But that’s the only products I ever use on my hair besides a heat protectant when needed (and of course whatever I use to color my hair)\n\nIs it normal for hair to go straight after 39 years of curly hair? I’ve had no other life changes or new medical issues. Was my hair just never truly curly and just dried out? Was my hair maybe over hydrated? The only other thing I can think of is that this is the longest my hair as ever been and maybe because my hair is so incredibly fine it just can’t support the weight?\n\nAs an additional note, I lived in Utah in a dry climate for most of my life, but  now I live in Texas with a humid climate. I’ve lived in Texas for several years now so I don’t think it’s because of the climate.\n\nIf anyone has any insight to what’s going on I would also it ❤️",

I knew I was thinning but was unaware it was that bad. \n\nI had already been lurking here for awhile and made a doctor’s appointment for a finasteride prescription shortly after our trip. \n\nI started 1mg fin and topical rogaine 2x/day last January. \n\nOver the first month, I had no side effects, even a boost in sexual desire. \n\nAfter month two I started noticing sexual side effects. I thought it may be transient so I stayed the course. \n\nEventually, after month 3 I cut my finasteride dosage in half. My hair regrowth continued and my sexual performance improved, but it still hasn’t been perfect. \n\nWhat I have also noticed over this period is my desire continues to be there, but my need to masturbate has gone way down.\n\nThroughout the year, hair growth continued steadily, but there was a period where sexual performance went down again. \n\nSince then I’ve cut my finasteride dosage to half a 1mg tablet every other day… and for now that’s working. \n\nI’ve also had some scalp irritation using Rogaine, currently I only use it once a day at most, and definitely skip one or multiple days in a row. \n\nOverall, I’m glad I’ve started. I’ve regained confidence around my hair and will continue the treatment moving forward. ",

      "content": "*Sorry for the long text and all the pictures. It’s my first time on this sub, so I hope it’s okay here. (Please bear with me, English is my second language🙏🏻.)*\n\n**Quick summary :**\n\nBasically, I would love to achieve a slightly longer hairstyle and be able to retain volume without losing coverage on my forehead. As explained below, I struggle with my texture, so any suggestion/advice/opinion would help (haircut, products, knowledge...) I feel like my hair is a weakness, and I want to change that 😉\n-----\n\nSo, I cut and style hair for friends and family all the time, but I never figured out my own 😅. Every time I come close, the texture changes…\n\nFor most of my life, I had wavy hair. But the older I get, the curlier it becomes, and recently the change has been particularly noticeable. I’m actually excited about it — I love textured hair — but I’m completely lost right now.\n\n**About my hair:**\n\n• I think I have low density, coarse hair\n\n• I have a large, square forehead, which makes it hard to get a full-looking fringe. \n\n• My front section grows in the opposite direction -- *when I get a buzz cut there's a clear V-shape above my hairline where the hair changes direction*\n\nBecause of this, my hair naturally wants to stand up on top of my head, and I have to get it wet every morning to lay it back down. \n\nAs a teenager, when my hair was straighter, I would wake up looking like Syndrome from The Incredibles (included last picture just for fun😂).\n\nNow that it’s more curly, some days it’s giving Bob Dylan, some days Edward Scissorhands… and very rarely, it’ll look acceptable and I won’t touch it (picture 1 and 2 was one of those days.) *Still very messy, and the fringe is looking boneless 😬.*\n\n**Routine/Styling:**\n\nI’ve been meaning to grow my hair out a little — I think it would balance out my strong bone structure in a nice way — but every time it gets longer, I struggle. So for now, I just keep it short and style it like when it was straighter.\n\n• I wash it about 3 times a week\n\n• I use a mask. *currently, no conditioner*\n\n• When it’s wet, I lay it down and arrange it so it air dries nicely. For hold I either use matte paste when wet, or iI'll use powder later when it's dry. *At this point, it looks very flat and thin (picture 3,4 and 5)*\n\n• Once it’s dry, I rearrange it — with or without powder on my fingers (separate the strands, lift up the roots, etc.) *I add hairspray on windy days.*\n\n*I have no specific sleeping routine and I just refresh with water without adding products.* (Styled hair on picture 6,7 and 8)\n\nIt works for now, but I don’t actually love this flat hairstyle on me — somedays I feel like a playmobile and honestly, styling my hair is the worst part of my mornings…\n\nIn the past, I did try defining the curls with leave-ins or gel (although it’s been over a year, so it might look different now with tighter curls?) and it would always look weighed down and boneless, with my scalp showing — even with the smallest amount of product. Maybe my hair is just too thin to be in clumps 🤷🏻‍♂️.\n\n**Product list :**\n\nShampoo - Pantene (volume line)\n\nMask - Garnier Fructis (currently, the banana superfood one)\n\nMatte paste - Taft (molding styling clay)\n\nStyling powder and hairspray - Taft (volume line)\n\n-----\n\nOkay, that was all the important details, I think.\n\nSo basically, my goal is to get a longer, more free/natural-looking hairstyle, that compliments my texture. I would like to retain volume without losing coverage on my forehead. And if it could be low maintenance too, at least in the morning, that would be life-changing 😩.\n\nThanks for reading!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Nothing else in my routine has changed.\n\nThis is what I look for in my sunscreen \n 1. Works well under makeup (I only wear concealer under my eyes and light blush)\n 2.  High \"glow\" factor/dewy finish.\n 3. Budget-friendly.\n 4. Doesn't irritate or peel \n\nAfter going looking at some recommendations online, I’ve narrowed it down to these four, but I’d love to hear your experiences with them:\n 1.

      "content": "Photo after my first ever proper curly routine where I brushed sections and diffused! This is day 3 hair btw!! I have low porosity, thick hair, coarse hair. \n\nSo my hair has looked pretty dead for a while. I got a curly haircut 2 years ago. It looked amazing for a rlly long time but since I haven’t cut my ends, I have broken/split/damaged/dead strands throughout my hair, not just ends. I was gonna get a haircut from that place again but they’ve upped their prices since then and my partner thought I should invest in products instead. \n\nFor the last year the only products I used were the kinky curly cleansing shampoo, shea moisture curl and shine conditioner and curl enhancing smoothie, and a wide tooth comb. I’d only ever air dry my hair. It’s not like my hair look terrible but it looked damaged. \n\nSo I got a detangling brush, a bootleg bounce curl brush, hair dryer with a diffuser, and the fenty curl cream to replace the shea (all cheaper than the haircut somehow). The difference between the creams is massive. \n\nMy routine for this wash was, adding an egg, some olive oil and honey to the shea moisture conditioner and brushing that in and leaving it in with a plastic bag for 30 minutes. Then I used my usual shampoo and conditioner after, and then sparingly used the fenty curl cream, brushing it through sections. I diffused with no heat (10-15 seconds of heat for the rlly wet sections). My hair has never looked so defined, especially for this many days. I also slept with my hair pushed over my head (no hair tie or bonnet). I smell like a grandma which I honestly love but I don’t wanna make a concoction every time I wash my hair, and I can tell the conditioner without the stuff i add makes my hair feel worse. \n\nWhat products (deep or regular conditioner) would you recommend as a replacement? NEEDS to be available in Canada and not overpriced. My options are Amazon or Sephora. I’m considering Pattern/Fenty/Curlsmith (whichever is cheaper honestly) but idk which exact product will be right for me. I’d appreciate advice from people with similar hair!! I’d also like to know if I’m missing anything in my routine? (the cream acts as a slight gel as well, so maybe mousse or oil but it doesn’t feel as urgent)",

Since these are all properly tested this is more about texture finish and whether I’d actually want to use them daily. This is just my personal pref sharing here for girlies looking for some advice and honestly some feedback from the more seasoned players so here goes\n\ndot &amp; key vitamin c sunscreen\n\nThis is easily one of my top picks. Lightweight, spreads nicely, no white cast, and gives that fresh finish which already puts it above a lot of sunscreens. This is def my daily go to hg. \n\nderma co 1% hyaluronic sunscreen\n\nA really great option! v lightweight and hydrating especially if your skin tends to feel tight with sunscreens. Personally, I find it a bit too slippery on hot days. Not bad at all just not my fav\n\naqualogica glow+ dewy sunscreen\n\nThis is cute if you love a dewy look. Def my go to if i’m indoors but too precious to use daily. \n\nfixderma shadow\n\nv lightweight and disappears quickly which I like. But after using it for a couple of weeks it dried my skin. I always used a moisturizer before so it felt a bit weird but maybe its just me 😕\n\nlakme sun expert tinted \n\nI know a lot of people love tinted sunscreens, but I’m picky with them. The tint is fine I just dontt always want that extra layer on my skin. Not my cup of tea WNRP\n\n\nBioderma Photoderm Creme\n\nTHICC AF. I’d save this for extreme sun exposure (if I ever visit the beach ;_;). Feels a bit too much for everyday use\n\nAGAIN THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL PREF. Please don’t attack me in the comments i’ll cry. Would love to hear your thoughts and which one you use on a daily basis",

      "content": "I've had acne for my whole life and it's always fluctuating. But for now, I have pimples, whiteheads, closed comedones, and hyperpigmentation in all areas of my face (very frustrating). I also have dehydrated skin. I've cut down my routine to only washing my face, sometimes toner pads, and moisturizer. In the morning I wash my face with dove soap bar then I use s.nature aqua squalene cream and then sunscreen. In the night I wash my face with dove soap bar, sometimes toner pads (rarely), then mixsoon bean cream. However, I found out that the mixsoon bean cream isn't acne safe so I'm planning on ordering the Larocheposay cicaplast baume b5+. However, I also found out that the s.nature cream is not comodogenic so I want to switch it. I am looking for something not too heavy like a cream, but not too light because my skin is really dry. I also wear makeup so hopefully something that sits well under makeup as well. I've tried the vanicream moisturizing lotion and it is not hydrating enough because my skin feels tight no matter how many layers I apply. I also tried the illiyoon ceramide ato lotion and it feels too sticky for my liking and my skin feels suffocated. So please recommend any moisturizers for the morning that will hydrate my skin and will help my acne! \\[Also, if you have any acne treatment recommendations please name some!\\]",

The chemical peel we are doing is called the Perfect Derma peel. \n\nI was wondering if anyone has done this peel with acne prone skin and how your results were? Also any tips for getting through the week of the shedding would be greatly appreciated!

      "content": "I’m posting on behalf of my teen daughters (17 and 19). They both got chicken pox about three months ago, and now have some pox scars on their faces and bodies. We cared for them carefully and kept scabs moisturized and they didn’t pick at them, but there are a few pox nonetheless. They’ve both been using bio oil, and there is some improvement, but I’d like to buy them something more to help make sure their faces aren’t permanently scarred.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with Rael Miracle Clear with spiracles or have any other recommendations of products or routines to help the pox marks heal while they are still pretty new?\n\nBudget is somewhat of a concern but I will splurge for this for them. Thank you 🙏 I did try searching on the sub but everything I found was several years old.",

I am looking to buy one and would like recommendations. I found one on RachelSilk, but the reviews for that site are mixed and I am not sure I trust it. I found one on sleep with clementine but it is very expensive. Are there any other options out there?​\n\nRoutine:\n\nWash once weekly\n\nShampoo twice (cleansing and moisturizing)\n\nConditioner/comb through tangles\n\nHair mask/deep conditioning (hair was in a bad place so I figured more conditioning cant be bad)\n\nRinse\n\nLeave in conditioner (it's a 10 brand) scrunch\n\nApply cream, prayer hands\n\nApply foam with prayer hands\n\nScrunch gel (miss jessie pillow soft curls). Then I finger curl.\n\nLet air dry.",
