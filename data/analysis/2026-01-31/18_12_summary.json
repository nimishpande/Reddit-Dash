      "title": "Had curly hair all my life but now it’s straight?",
      "content": "So like the title says for some reason my hair has gone from a frizzy Hermione Granger mess to basically straight. Even when I use heat to curl my hair the curls fall out after a few hours and by the end of the day it’s basically straight with the absolute loosest of waves.\n\nUp until a few years ago I never did anything with my curls to enhance them simply because I didn’t know how and didn’t want to make my hair crunchy like when my mom would put product in my hair when I was little (I have what many hair stylists have called “baby fine” hair and I honestly love the softness that comes with such fine hair, so I don’t like the crunchy/texture/feeling that a lot of hair products give)\n\nFor a couple years I tried many products and tried the whole curly girl routine to try an enhance my natural curls but I could just never get a curl pattern that I actually liked. So I gave up maybe about a year ago now and figured that maybe the next time I have money to actually get my hair done by a stylist that I would go to a curly hair specialist that could actually teach me what I can do with my specific hair/curls that I have obviously not been able to understand yet.\n\nAfter giving up on the curly hair routine because it just felt like a lot of work for hair I didn’t even like I just started focusing on hydrating/healing/protecting my hair. After a few months I started noticing a difference in my hair feeling healthier and smoother, and then a few months ago I noticed that my hair is just basically straight now. I can still get it to curl when it’s still wet directly after washing it and scrunching so it will have same wave once it dries but the curls will always fall out later that day.\n\nAs for damage/protecting my hair, as evident by the pictures of my hair I obviously dye my hair which involves bleaching my roots every 3-4 months. Since my hair grows very slow and my hair holds onto the semi-permanent red/oraunge dye very well so I don’t need to touch up my hair very often, I also rarely use any heat on my hair, and I sleep with a bonnet+silky pillow case every night.\n\nI wash my hair every 1-2 weeks with Heritages shampoo and conditioner from Walmart and then I sometimes use OGX coconut milk serum if my hair is feeling a little extra dry and frizzy, I’ll apply it directly after washing my hair and while my hair is still damp and I’ll focus primarily of the ends of my hair. But that’s the only products I ever use on my hair besides a heat protectant when needed (and of course whatever I use to color my hair)\n\nIs it normal for hair to go straight after 39 years of curly hair? I’ve had no other life changes or new medical issues. Was my hair just never truly curly and just dried out? Was my hair maybe over hydrated? The only other thing I can think of is that this is the longest my hair as ever been and maybe because my hair is so incredibly fine it just can’t support the weight?\n\nAs an additional note, I lived in Utah in a dry climate for most of my life, but  now I live in Texas with a humid climate. I’ve lived in Texas for several years now so I don’t think it’s because of the climate.\n\nIf anyone has any insight to what’s going on I would also it ❤️",

Since these are all properly tested this is more about texture finish and whether I’d actually want to use them daily. This is just my personal pref sharing here for girlies looking for some advice and honestly some feedback from the more seasoned players so here goes\n\ndot &amp; key vitamin c sunscreen\n\nThis is easily one of my top picks. Lightweight, spreads nicely, no white cast, and gives that fresh finish which already puts it above a lot of sunscreens. This is def my daily go to hg. \n\nderma co 1% hyaluronic sunscreen\n\nA really great option! v lightweight and hydrating especially if your skin tends to feel tight with sunscreens. Personally, I find it a bit too slippery on hot days. Not bad at all just not my fav\n\naqualogica glow+ dewy sunscreen\n\nThis is cute if you love a dewy look. Def my go to if i’m indoors but too precious to use daily. \n\nfixderma shadow\n\nv lightweight and disappears quickly which I like. But after using it for a couple of weeks it dried my skin. I always used a moisturizer before so it felt a bit weird but maybe its just me 😕\n\nlakme sun expert tinted \n\nI know a lot of people love tinted sunscreens, but I’m picky with them. The tint is fine I just dontt always want that extra layer on my skin. Not my cup of tea WNRP\n\n\nBioderma Photoderm Creme\n\nTHICC AF. I’d save this for extreme sun exposure (if I ever visit the beach ;_;). Feels a bit too much for everyday use\n\nAGAIN THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL PREF. Please don’t attack me in the comments i’ll cry. Would love to hear your thoughts and which one you use on a daily basis",

      "content": "I fell in love with the Bounce Curl Brush when I purchased it for the almost perfect ringlets it gave me. But over the maybe 3yrs I've been using it, my hair has not grown an inch.\n\nI don't like the hair typing system, but just for reference:\nI have around 3c-4a hair.\nMedium density\nMedium porosity\nMedium strand thickness, although I've found some thicker strands &amp; some thin strands of hair in my head.\nMy hair is all Virgin, no dye or bleach. (Pictures I post with hair color is hair wax, which is an product overlay, not a dye)\n\nWhen I use the brush, I make sure my hair is FULLY DETANGLED with a wide tooth comb &amp; Tangle Teaser before styling with it. I'm positive it's not user error that there's lots of hair stuck on the brush &amp; that my ends are splitting. I find myself having to trim more often than most because my hair starts feeling rough.\n\nI only straighten my hair approximately 1-2xs a year in the Winter because I live in the South. I straightened my hair for my birthday in January &amp; decided since it was straightened, it would be easier to see any damage. I used the search &amp; destroy method to go through as many sections of hair as possible &amp; snip off damage. The amount of single strand knots, split ends, breakage &amp; even keyhole splits I had in my hair was insane.\n\nKeyhole splits in particular, I read, are mostly caused by mechanical damage, i.e. brush styling, high tension, pulling &amp; playing in your hair too much, etc. I'm almost certain most of this damage &amp; the breakage is coming from the Bounce Curl Brush &amp; I'm going to stop using it to see if this is the cause of the breakage. \n\nRoutine &amp; Products:\n\n1) Pre-wash detangle using a wide tooth comb on damp hair &amp; a light leave-in conditioner to provide slip.\n2) Shampoo with Tresemmé Rich Moisture. Clarify 1x a month or as needed with Paul Mitchell's Shampoo 2.\n3) Condition with the Tresemmé Rich Moisture &amp; on Clarify Shampoo days, I use Ouidad's Coil Infusion Triple Threat Deep Conditioner. \n3) On wet hair, I apply Camille Rose's Curl Love Moisture Milk as a leave-in in sections using my fingers.\n3) I section my hair and apply Camille Rose's Spiked Honey Mousse with my fingers. Then I take smaller sections that I want to style, make sure it's fully detangled with a pass through with a Tangle Teaser, then do one pass with the Bounce Curl Brush, using the tension &amp; tilt the brush into the divots as it's supposed to be used.\n4) I scrunch in a little bit of the Ouidad Curl Quencher Gel on styled sections (I didn't care for this too much but I'm trying to get rid of it lol).\n5) Hover-Diffuse blow dry my hair for about 20-30mins. Let the rest air dry.\n6) Scrunch out the crunch &amp; separate curl clumps with Mise En Scene Perfect Serum.\n\nFor bed, I pineapple with a scarf &amp; put on a bonnet.\nIn the mornings, I let my hair get some steam in the shower, take off the bonnet, shake, use a little serum, finger coil a few wonky strands if needed. I wash 1x a week.\n\nTL;DR: I feel like the Bounce Curl Brush's high tension styling causes breakage &amp; other forms of mechanical damage.\n\nWanted to know if anyone else felt the same way!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

What can I do to make it go back to it's original curl pattern?\n\nOther than straightening it last month I have never used any type of heat - never straightened it, never blow-dried it. Before I straightened it I washed it as usual but didn't apply any of my usual products to my clean hair except for a very small amount of the Syoss Invisible paste and let it air dry.\n\nThen when I straightened it I used Schwarzkopf Taft heat protestant spray and I used a lot of it (so much my hair actually ended up looking kinda greasy but I didn't care I didn't want to damage my hair, and I fixed the greasy look with dry shampoo afterwards).\n\nMy routine:\n\n- Scalp oiling 4 hours before hair wash with argan oil\n- shampoo 2x with Elseve Dream Long\n- Garnier hair food hair mask\n- Syoss intense plex deep conditioner\n- Elseve glycolic gloss treatment\n- squeeze as much water as I can out of my hair \n- Syoss intense plex leave in serum\n- rake through Syoss invisible paste\n- squish in Syoss curl control Mousse\n- leave to air dry loose or braided",

I don't mean the cross method, I was planning to apply TCA only on the cheek area with the gauze\n* Is **Jessner safe for my skin tone**?\n* Does **mandalic acid 40%** help with *deep* scars?\n* Overall, **which peel works best for my scars**?\n\nThanks in advance — I really appreciate any advice\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4zh2aj9ropgg1.jpeg?width=1120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67e02d89b8d4cdce843375850ab3cc2732ef3b5f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9zkdej9ropgg1.jpeg?width=1378&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b2ae2af43d98628de607fc0cb70af64e5fe0a13\n\n",

      "content": "Hello! I have been looking for a new daily moisturizer to use. I am currently using the Peach Slices Snail Mucin Deep Moisture Cream (I believe that's the full title), and while it feels great at first, shortly after applying, my skin feels tight again. I have an oily t-zone, although the creases around my nose are always dry no matter what. I want something to use all year round, because I value keeping a concise routine without introducing any new products to my skin too frequently. This is because I am currently taking spirinolactone to manage cystic acne I've had in the past, and while my skin is clear now, my skin is very sensitive. My current routine includes:\n\nAM: Vanicream facial cleanser, benzoyl peroxide (although I don't have any active breakouts right now, so I may stop using it as I don't want to damage my skin barrier and use a product if I don't have to), peach slices moisturizer mentioned above, and Blue Lizard Baby Sunscreen as its the only one to not make my skin burn\n\nPM: Vanicream, adapelene gel, peach slices moisturizer \n\nI want a moisturizer that is good for sensitive skin, not too expensive (not willing to spend over $25ish, especially for a small bottle), lightweight (many moisturizers make me look greasy, Peach Slices doesn't so far), and keeps the crease by my nose moisturized. For whatever reason, I am ALWAYS dry there lol, it ends up itching and getting irritated but nothing helps.\n\nFor reference, I have used CeraVe and Cetaphil moisturizers in the past, and I did not fall in love with them.\n\nThank you for reading and please suggest any moisturizers if you know of any! I am also thinking of incorporating Vitamin C into my morning routine to replace benzoyl peroxide, so please take that into consideration as well. Thank you!",

I’ve been using Azelaic Acid for about ~3-4 months, I used to use it twice a day but I’ve switched to AM only now because it felt like I was overdoing it and wasting the product. My PM routine is currently hydration-only, but I was thinking of adding the Anua 10% niacinamide and tranexamic acid serum to further help with the healing. Has anyone ever used the serum for this purpose? Is it effective or should I use another product (recommend one please )?\n\nMy routine is as follows:\nAM:\n1. Skin1004 Centella Ampoule Foam\n2. Skin1004 Centella Toning Toner\n3. Azelaic acid 15% cream\n4. Purito Seoul oat in gel\n5. Korean SPF50 sunscreen \nPM:\n1. Same cleanser and toner\n2. Skin1004 Centella Asiatica Ampoule\n4. Moisturiser same as AM.\n\n^ I also used to use TO glycolic acid 7% twice a week, but recently it irritated my barrier so I’m taking a break from it for a bit (had a mini heart attack because my PIE and its surroundings became really red and itchy, but thankfully faded back to normal after a few hours)",

Alongside the blemishes on my cheeks that never seem to leave. \n\nI’m 24, on BC, my full routine is as follows:\nAM, wash face with water, cleanse with Cerave blemish control cleanser followed by moisturising with Simple rich moisturiser. \n\nI do pretty much the same in the PM, if I wear makeup I remove it with a makeup wipe and a cotton pad with micellar cleansing water, then moisturise. \n\nAny ideas welcome, whether it be skincare or diet. I’d just like an even skin tone without the blemishes. \n\n\n\n",
