Bought a bunch of the stuff I saw recommended with a bit of help from my sister and this is right after the routine brush styling, diffused and all. Don’t think even after diffusing for that long got it all the way dry but I like the result!\n\nPic 3 for how the curls look up close!\n\nIf anyone has any extra tips or recommendations for my hair it’s greatly appreciated!! There’s quite some bouncy curls at my ends and back layers but the front doesn’t really seem to curl up as much.\n\nOverall I’m still really uneducated on this all in general apart from seeing more and more tiktoks pop up on my feed and would love some extra input!",

Additionally there were 3 PRP sessions: October 3 , November 14 and December 19\n\nIt’s been just over 4 months total and about 6 weeks since PRP #3. I’m so pleasantly surprised !

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Man, I’m telling you just buy these from [Costco.com](http://Costco.com) (as a nonmember) or buy legit ones. I can’t believe somebody would make a fake of a $15 package. It’s ridiculous. I’m so pissed I’m seven months into pouring a mystery fluid on my scalp. And it’s strange because I initially had a shedding without really changing my oral medication.\n\n\\*edit\\* the bleach test apparently isn’t consistent because some people will just dilute the formula so that it will pass. As well as they put that other ingredient in instead of minoxidil. Wow. so much effort to counterfeit $2 bottles. \n\nSo I’ve noticed lately that my hair stopped improving after I got the initial shed. I just opened up my new package from the same seller and it’s the same outdated packaging. The outside is I believe the new packaging, but the bundles are the old packaging that Kirkland doesn’t use as of over a year ago in discontinued all sale of.\n\nFirst, the lid wouldn’t screw on and I’m like what what’s going on OK this is super fishy like Kirkland doesn’t know how to make a bottle that can screw on? When you look at the text on the bottles it’s very different. The colorations are different hues by a small percentage like the yellow text has like a haze around it and a dark quality color on one and the other one it’s like Jimmy counterfeit printed it off their computer printer.\n\nThe bottles are also different sizes. One has two threads and the other has three threads, which is why they won’t screw together. The new bottles are also different size.\n\nFinally, we have the bleach test absolutely nothing it just made it clearer  EBAY purchased with lots of positive reviews. You have to remember that people don’t know anything and they will leave positive reviews, especially in the hair medication world without even confirming if it works or not. Like you know on Amazon, for example where they say, I haven’t even used it yet or it’s been a week, but it’s great and they leave five star reviews. Or like dating apps for example how they don’t work at all but for some reason, people pay for them and leave overwhelmingly positive reviews for something that doesn’t work for what it was made for. Lol. Reviews aren’t the end all.\n\nSee pics included.",

I feel like my hair has too much hold, to the point where if I pinch a curl at its root and point it out to the side, it don’t droop down from gravity it just holds its shape. It seems to get more stiff the longer it is dry. Because of this, I want to grow out my hair but I can’t because it ends up looking really chunky/boxy (like in the 3rd image, which isn’t even that bad but I don’t have photos of it longer on my new phone). This leads into the next question. \n\n3. What haircuts would suit me? I like the length of the 1st/3rd image maybe a bit longer and I might want to try a softer/more androgynous style\n\n4. I currently go to a salon that doesn’t know a ton about curly hair, but I don’t live close to any that do. Would I see significant improvement from finding a more curly hair focused stylist? \n\nThanks :p",

Something that will hold up to sweat, walking around in the Mexico sun, potentially getting in the pool (not fully submerging of course lol, but maybe getting a drop or two on my face), and will generally hold up during a day full of a lot of activities! I plan to get the E.L.F. grip primer (the blue one) if that changes anything! My skin type leans a bit more dry Id say! I plan to be wearing foundation, potentially concealer, blush, highlighter, etc! \n\nThere's so many options, it's hard to determine the pros and cons about each and it's all a little daunting as make-up shopping can be!

I last had it done 6mo ago so the base of my roots is my natural color and the blonde has definitely yellowed a bit. \n\nAnyway, I’m torn between coloring to match my roots or just continuing the blonde. I’ve been many colors over the years, but always go back to blonde. \n\nI’d love to try a color closer to my roots, but my hair pulls pretty red and I prefer non red toned browns. As for the blonde, I prefer more neutral to cool as warm leans too yellow for me and I feel like I can always see the subtle green when I go more ashy. I’m pretty familiar with what I like when it comes to blonde, but am lost if I go in the direction of my natural color. \n\nIt’s also about shoulder length, but my ends are quite frazzled after 6mo of no trims so I’ll go back to my long bob. \n\nI usually go every 9-12wks depending on the color.

I have been thinking about it for a while, but I am just getting paranoid I won't like them. Sometimes I will lay my front hair over my forehead and picture how it would look cut and I quite like it, but I really won't know until I try it. My hair is also thin and straight so this could either make or break the look. My question is, if I get them cut and don't like it, will there be ways to hide them discreetly/grow it out into curtain bangs or something? Any tips or advice related to wispy bangs will be very helpful. Many thanks :)",

I’ve read it could be a too much protein issue (this shampoo and conditioner have protein), under hydrating issue, or over hydrating issue. I also have a a clarifying shampoo that I use about every 3 washes or so because the water I have is very hard. Currently doing the pineapple method and bonnet for sleeping, and in the morning I damp and scrunch in a little gel (mostly because the front pieces lose any texture they had 😂) \n\nWould appreciate any advice or help, thank you!!",

      "title": "[Acne] Winlevi and Topical Spironolactone",
      "content": "Winlevi is not the same as topical compounded spironolactone cream.\n\nPlease do not refer to them interchangeably.\n\nThis is a thread I created to discuss the carrier anhydrous topical gels used in Winlevi and compounded topical Spironolactone.\n\nWinlevi contains mineral oil, a product labeled as non-comedogenic but is an occlusive that typically does not wash away with dry skin friendly soaps or double cleansing. I can’t speak on it from an oily skin standpoint.\n\nMy compounded topical Spironolactone 5%, dapsone 5%, niacinimide 2%, contains Wo6 anhydrous topical gel.\n\nI started on it in October, and was aware right away that the niacinimide was probably going to be a problem for me as I have used that molecule by itself and it left me with burns. I’ve avoided it in every product since, which is extremely hard to do these days. Decided to toughen it up as the cream cost $120 and it was not doubled up in any of my other skincare. Well, it burned me. Highly suspect. On top of the burns, I had noticed a growing number of closed comedones like never before along with the same number of thin skinned pustules I’ve been left to experience after rounds of accutane and up to 200mg oral spironolactone along with tretinoin for years. I stopped using it for about 3 weeks in which I had to use a barrier cream full of zinc and mineral oil to heal those burns, comedomes of course worsened regardless of double cleansing. I had completely cut out squalane from my routine right before the burn incident as I was suspicious it could be contributing to the pustules. At the same time, I got rid of a cream I had that used dimethicone to try and reduce comedomes. The cost of the comedomes outweighed trying to get through the outdoor workload post accutane. So now, I am here. I have used other products with silicone (hello makeup primers) and they most assuredly are a culprit of acne for me.\n\nGuess what? That Wo6 ingredient on my gritty, disgusting, filmy, compounded cream is full of pretty much dimethicone and two other silicones. Rubbing it into my skin would make the bright white cream film up grey on my fingertips, and it was not even easily spreadable. Hours would pass and I could scrape it off my face with my fingernails like I recently applied it. Very occlusive and honestly I fully believe that the silicone chains do not allow the spironolactone to piggyback on them and absorb into my skin. \n\nI called my doctor to request she write me a new script after 4 months of trying her first spironolactone cream script. The compounding pharmacy already told me that they could not tell me if they can even get a silicone, mineral oil, and beeswax free carrier gel. My doctor has to negotiate it is what they said. \n\nDoctor sent in for my request to be compounded (Spironolactone 5%, Dapsone 5%, no silicones/beeswax/mineral oil). Someone along the line misconstrued the information into Use Mineral Oil but forgo the others. I corrected the pharmacist and she asked me if they irritated my acne. Girl, they’re causing my acne. What are people using to wash their face? Dish soap? On a drug that needs to be on for basically 24hrs to work. Anyways, she told me it would be glycerin based and that it would only last a month so for $83 I bought 1/4 of the amount I previously did. I could probably do 1/16 of the amount I had before now that I have received the new batch. Application of new compound is extremely noticeably better! My skin drinks it up like water, it’s spreadable, leaves no trace on my skin in less than 30 seconds, does not feel alchoholy at all. Upon inspection of the label the first ingredient is NOT glycerin, it’s “Versa Gel Base.” There are multiple versa gels on the market with different formulations. I hope and believe based on feel that I did receive VersaGel ME, which is the mineral oil free version. \n\nIt is Hydrogenated Polyisobutene (and) Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer (and) Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer.\n\nI am hopeful it works out and that this is the end of healing 15 years worth of acne (I’m 25 :/). I hope that this post helps other who are in the same struggle point as myself.",
