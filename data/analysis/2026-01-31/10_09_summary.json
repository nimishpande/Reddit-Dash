Additionally there were 3 PRP sessions: October 3 , November 14 and December 19\n\nIt’s been just over 4 months total and about 6 weeks since PRP #3. I’m so pleasantly surprised !

No amount of expensive skin care made it better so my derm prescribed tretinoin. \n\n1st attempt I tried RX tretinoin (0.025) but gave up quickly due to peeling and redness. My skin felt worse than ever.\n\n2nd attempt I started low and slow.  Started July 2024 with OTC Ordinary Granactive Retinoid. Did every 3-4 nights working slowly up to nightly.  When I say slowly I mean slowly— it took about 5 months to work up to daily.  This allowed me to be consistent without an inch of dryness or peeling.\n\nNext in January 2025 I moved up to their next strength OTC product — Ordinary Retinal 0.2%. Repeated slow ramp up.  Started every 3-4 days working up to daily. Great experience. No peeling no redness. This took 4 months.\n\nIn April 2025 I started 0.025 RX.  Repeated slow ramp. In August 2025 I moved up to 0.05%— again slow ramp.\n\nToday, Jan 2026 I’ve worked up to every other night with 0.05.\n\nI find the products below work well especially if you allow time for each product to absorb slathering on the next.  Not long, really just a minute or two.\n\nWhy does this work? Because Tret performs best when you’re consistent. If this means less days with less strength but used consistently vs starting a stronger formula but quitting than less strength is best.\n\nMy current routine:\n\nAM: Rinse face w water only 2x a month, if no Tret night before Medicube Aha wipes Tir Tir milky toner Medicube PDRN milky toner Ordinary hylauronic acid with GD Molecules Vit C La Roche Posay Toleriane Moisturizer\n\nPM Tretinoin Night : Wash w La Roche posay lipikar soap Medicube PDRN milky toner Pea size tretinoin all over face / half pea size on neck (whatever remains goes on hands) La Roche Posay toleriane moisturizer (dime size ) mixed w La Roche Posay cicaplast (1/2 dime size)\n\nPM non Tretinoin Night: Wash w La Roche posay lipikar soap Tir Tir Milky Toner Medicube PDRN milky toner Naturium Peptide serum La Roche Posay toleriane moisturizer (dime size ) mixed w La Roche Posay cicaplast (1/2 dime size) Vanicream big tub (dime size) mixed with 4drops Marcuja oil",

      "content": "Man, I’m telling you just buy these from [Costco.com](http://Costco.com) (as a nonmember) or buy legit ones. I can’t believe somebody would make a fake of a $15 package. It’s ridiculous. I’m so pissed I’m seven months into pouring a mystery fluid on my scalp. And it’s strange because I initially had a shedding without really changing my oral medication.\n\n\\*edit\\* the bleach test apparently isn’t consistent because some people will just dilute the formula so that it will pass. As well as they put that other ingredient in instead of minoxidil. Wow. so much effort to counterfeit $2 bottles. \n\nSo I’ve noticed lately that my hair stopped improving after I got the initial shed. I just opened up my new package from the same seller and it’s the same outdated packaging. The outside is I believe the new packaging, but the bundles are the old packaging that Kirkland doesn’t use as of over a year ago in discontinued all sale of.\n\nFirst, the lid wouldn’t screw on and I’m like what what’s going on OK this is super fishy like Kirkland doesn’t know how to make a bottle that can screw on? When you look at the text on the bottles it’s very different. The colorations are different hues by a small percentage like the yellow text has like a haze around it and a dark quality color on one and the other one it’s like Jimmy counterfeit printed it off their computer printer.\n\nThe bottles are also different sizes. One has two threads and the other has three threads, which is why they won’t screw together. The new bottles are also different size.\n\nFinally, we have the bleach test absolutely nothing it just made it clearer  EBAY purchased with lots of positive reviews. You have to remember that people don’t know anything and they will leave positive reviews, especially in the hair medication world without even confirming if it works or not. Like you know on Amazon, for example where they say, I haven’t even used it yet or it’s been a week, but it’s great and they leave five star reviews. Or like dating apps for example how they don’t work at all but for some reason, people pay for them and leave overwhelmingly positive reviews for something that doesn’t work for what it was made for. Lol. Reviews aren’t the end all.\n\nSee pics included.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

But once it’s detangled, it’s smooth for a bit &amp; then re-tangles SO quickly 😭 lol it’s like my hair sticks to itself almost - besides braiding it, silk pillowcase &amp; leave in conditioners, any advice on how to detangle without damaging &amp; keep it tangle free more often? It’s mainly tangle free only briefly in the shower/when braided.\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. I use Trader Joe’s tea tree tingle shampoo (&amp; I’ve tried shea moisture retention shampoo) and sometimes Aussie girl apricot conditioner other times the Trader Joe’s tea tree conditioner \n\n2. I don’t use gel nor mousse usually but I’ve tried the doux mousse which is really nice but does make my hair appear thinner/less voluminous.\n\n3. I let my hair air dry\n\n4. I do use satin pillow case when possible.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nthin, 2B wavy hair that tangles so easily and re-tangles quickly after detangling. I wash every day/two, and detangle gently with conditioner, but it only stays smooth/knot-free briefly.

      "content": "I have 2B curls/waves, very tangle-prone, thin strand, easily weighted down, hair that’s mainly so easily getting knotted to the point where I’ve had to cut off knots on occasion in the past. I wash my hair daily or every other day with shampoo/conditioner. I try to detangle as gently as possible w/ conditioner, starting at the ends, in the shower. But once it’s detangled, it’s smooth for a bit &amp; then re-tangles SO quickly 😭 lol it’s like my hair sticks to itself almost - besides braiding it, silk pillowcase &amp; leave in conditioners, any advice on how to detangle without damaging &amp; keep it tangle free more often? It’s mainly tangle free only briefly in the shower/when braided.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nthin, 2B wavy hair that tangles so easily and re-tangles quickly after detangling. I wash every day/two, and detangle gently with conditioner, but it only stays smooth/knot-free briefly. Looking for ways to prevent tangles &amp; detangle w/o damage beyond braids/silk pillowcases/leave-ins.\n\nAlso open to styling techniques too (worth noting my hair gets weighed down easily, but also won’t detangle w/o some slip)!\n\nThank you!!",

      "content": "I have a little over shoulder length 3c hair and the longer it's gotten the more tangled it gets. It is fairly thin and tangles easily. By the end of the day it is frizzy. I sleep with a satin bonnet on a satin pillowcase but still have crazy tangles the next morning when I wash it. I have tried to pineapple the hair but haven't noticed any differences. Should I put something in my hair the night before to make it more slippery so that it doesn't get tangled? I am looking for a fairly cheap product or maybe even a light oil that won't make it greasy. My fear is that I am loosing more hair than I need to.\n\nMy routine is this:\n\nI wash my hair almost every day (I know it's sounds crazy). It's truly the only way to manage it and make it look good. It is impossible to keep it looking good overnight. I am not looking for any advice on how often to wash it. My hair is not super dry so I am not concerned that the washing is causing negative effects. I sometimes use shampoo but also sometimes do a co-wash only. I use a brand called J and L Naturals for their shampoo bars and use Shea Moisture Hair Masque for the conditioner. I brush through my hair after the conditioner has been sitting for a few minutes. I wash it all out. I use Prose curl cream for styling. I scrunch it with a microfiber towel and let it air dry. I don't have a diffuser/ hair dryer as I try to avoid heat products, but am willing to purchase one if that will help with volume and frizziness. ",

I feel like my hair has too much hold, to the point where if I pinch a curl at its root and point it out to the side, it don’t droop down from gravity it just holds its shape. It seems to get more stiff the longer it is dry. Because of this, I want to grow out my hair but I can’t because it ends up looking really chunky/boxy (like in the 3rd image, which isn’t even that bad but I don’t have photos of it longer on my new phone). This leads into the next question. \n\n3. What haircuts would suit me? I like the length of the 1st/3rd image maybe a bit longer and I might want to try a softer/more androgynous style\n\n4. I currently go to a salon that doesn’t know a ton about curly hair, but I don’t live close to any that do. Would I see significant improvement from finding a more curly hair focused stylist? \n\nThanks :p",

But as I said, I've been really into self-care and \"spa-like\" products/scents/feelings.

Other than rent, groceries, regular adult payments, etc, and the odd massage here and there (that my new work benefits now cover), I don't spend a lot of money on things. So I'm willing to spend a little bit on Aesop or some other \"small luxuries\" if they are worth it!! What do you guys think??
