      "title": "Before &amp; After Cutting Length and Dyeing My Hair",
      "content": "Hi! I’m sharing my current curly hair routine and would love any feedback.\n\nHair &amp; Background:\n\nI have medium-density curly hair. I recently cut my hair from mid-back length to a medium length (just above the trapezius/collarbone area) and also had it professionally dyed. I don’t chemically straighten my hair.\n\nWash Schedule:\n\nI wash my hair every 2–3 days. Between washes, I thoroughly rinse my hair with water only.\n\nCleanse:\n\nOn wash days, I start by rinsing my hair thoroughly with water. I then use VIONA 2% ketoconazole shampoo, applying it mainly to my scalp, letting it sit briefly, and rinsing thoroughly. About once a month, I use AG Care Balance &amp; Boost Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo instead.\n\nCondition &amp; Treatments:\n\nAfter shampooing, I condition with SheaMoisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Shine Conditioner, applying it to mid-lengths and ends and rinsing it out fully. Every 1–2 weeks, I use AG Care Nourish Snow Mushroom Moisture Mask in place of regular conditioner, leaving it on for a few minutes before rinsing. About once a month, I also use AG Care Balance &amp; Boost Apple Cider Vinegar Conditioner.\n\nLeave-In &amp; Styling:\n\nImmediately after turning off the shower, while my hair is still very damp, I apply my leave-in and styling products. First, I use AG Care Fast Food Leave-On Conditioner (about a half baby-carrot sized amount), scrunching it into my hair and up toward the roots. Then I apply AG Care Re:coil Curl Activator, using about 1–2 pea-sized amounts, and scrunch again.\n\nDrying:\n\nI diffuse my hair, spending time diffusing all the way down to the scalp to maximize curl definition and spring.\n\nSleep Routine:\n\nI sleep on a silk pillowcase. I used to sleep with a silk bonnet, but found it compressed my curls too much overnight. Since my hair is shorter now, the pillowcase alone has been working better for preserving curl shape.\n\nNotes:\n\nSince cutting my hair shorter, my curls feel noticeably bouncier, springier, and more alive. My hair is much easier to manage and control at this length, and my curl pattern really shows up better overall. I’m really happy with how light and healthy it feels now.\n\nOpen to any routine feedback or styling suggestions. Thanks!",

I’m so pissed I’m seven months into pouring a mystery fluid on my scalp. And it’s strange because I initially had a shedding without really changing my oral medication.\n\nSo I’ve noticed lately that my hair stopped improving after I got the initial shed. I just opened up my new package from the same seller and it’s the same outdated packaging. The outside is I believe the new packaging, but the bundles are the old packaging that Kirkland doesn’t use as of over a year ago in discontinued all sale of. \n\nFirst, the lid wouldn’t screw on and I’m like what what’s going on OK this is super fishy like Kirkland doesn’t know how to make a bottle that can screw on? When you look at the text on the bottles it’s very different. The colorations are different hues by a small percentage like the yellow text has like a haze around it and a dark quality color on one and the other one it’s like Jimmy counterfeit printed it off their computer printer.\n\nThe bottles are also different sizes. One has two threads and the other has three threads, which is why they won’t screw together. The new bottles are also different size.\n\nFinally, we have the bleach test absolutely nothing it just made it clearer  EBAY purchased with lots of positive reviews. You have to remember that people don’t know anything and they will leave positive reviews, especially in the hair medication world without even confirming if it works or not. Like you know on Amazon, for example where they say, I haven’t even used it yet or it’s been a week, but it’s great and they leave five star reviews. Or like dating apps for example how they don’t work at all but for some reason, people pay for them and leave overwhelmingly positive reviews for something that doesn’t work for what it was made for. Lol. Reviews aren’t the end all. \n\nSee pics included. ",

Additionally there were 3 PRP sessions: October 3 , November 14 and December 19\n\nIt’s been just over 4 months total and about 6 weeks since PRP #3. I’m so pleasantly surprised !

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

I pair it with a whitening facial cleanser along with Epiduo gel which I use as a spot treatment on pimples, and also Kiehl’s ultra moisturizing cream as an overnight moisturiser. \n\n  \nMy active acne itself is mostly gone with a few cysts here and there, but it’s the redness and PIE that has been persistent for almost 2 years now. \n\n  \nPlease, can someone give me product recommendations on what actually worked?

      "content": "I (29F) am so lost on creating a skincare routine that works for me. For background, I have struggled with acne, eczema, or both on my face pretty much constantly since my mid teens. I’ve seen the dermatologist plenty and did accutane around age 19-20. For a couple years after that my skin was pretty consistently clear. \n\nAside from that, the only time in my adult life that I haven’t struggled with some amount of acne was during my pregnancy and early postpartum with my now 1 year old. I started using a locally made beef tallow balm on my face during my pregnancy due to an eczema outbreak and not wanting to use steroid while pregnant if I could avoid it and… my skin was gorgeous and amazing and perfect!! It kept the eczema totally under control with zero prescription use and I had nice smooth gorgeous clear skin. Now I’ve been dealing with clogged pores and breakouts again. It’s not any particular area of the face, I’ve had some breakouts pretty much all over. Not terrible, but enough to be a hit to my confidence. \n\nI brought it up to the esthetician that does my eyebrows recently and she said everyone she sees that uses tallow looks great for 6-9 months then starts seeing breakouts because it’s an occlusive. She asked about the rest of my products (I’ve only been using Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and the tallow) and said that cleanser plus the tallow is just resulting in a lot of buildup over time. She suggested some PCA Skin products (the creamy cleanser and skin rebalance) which I’m willing to try even though they are more expensive than I’m used to, but I guess I’m just afraid to pull the trigger. \n\nNothing ever seems to work for me on a continuous basis and I’m afraid to leave the tallow behind because since I’ve been using it I’ve noticed if I skip it even for a day my stubborn eczema spots flare. It’s the only thing that has controlled my eczema so well, including prescriptions. During my teen years I tried several of the expensive dermatologist recommended lines of product to no avail, and since accutane I have stuck with the very gentle products at the recommendation of the dermatologist. \n\nI guess I’m just looking for thoughts and advice about what might best keep both the acne and eczema at bay. Preferably a very simple routine as I don’t have time or money for a 12 step extravaganza with my 1 year old running around. TIA!",

      "content": "I’ve always had really good skin. I tend to run dry, never oily and I only ever got an occasional pimple that would go away easily with salicylic acid spot treatment.\n\nIn the fall I started using a low dose tretinoin and hydroquinone from Agency for anti aging and to help fade some hyperpigmentation and not long after that I started breaking out around my mouth and chin. They aren’t whiteheads or normal pimples its more like a ton of small textured bumps and congestion.\n\nBut now im getting actual whiteheads in the same area and also around my nose and between my eyebrows and forehead and it feels like im getting one or two new ones every day.\n\nI stopped all my other skincare and now im only using la roche posay purifying cleanser cerave moisturizing cream and de la cruz sulfur.\n\nI stopped tretinoin mid December and its now the end of January but my skin still isnt getting better which is why im so confused.\n\nI went to a derm and she wants to give me aklief said its targeted for acne but she didnt really explain whats going on with my skin. I asked if its ok to start that with this going on and she said yes but im scared it will make things worse.\n\nI dont know if this is still purging or if I damaged my skin barrier or if I somehow triggered acne I never had before.\n\nHas anyone been through something like this or had this happen after tretinoin for anti aging? did aklief help or make it worse? any advice would be appreciated because this has been really frustrating and confusing.",

I’ve had Nexplanon in the past and it did the same thing to me. Just a lot of hormonal forehead and chin acne that’s constantly there. Without BC, I don’t normally have acne issues, only a few pimples on my period.\n\nMy current routine that’s always kept my skin clear but isn’t the best because idk what to use-\n\nWipe all over my face with a wet cotton round and then moisturize all over, once in the morning and once at night.\n\nI feel like I should be using a cleanser, maybe a toner, a different moisturizer, etc. but I’m not sure what to use because there’s so many products out there. But now I really need a better routine with this new acne.\n\nMy skin type is combination but mostly it’s oily, especially in my t zone, and dry cheeks and dry areas around my lips. It’s also pretty sensitive, gets clogged easily, and gets irritated from new products(hence my current simple routine).\n\nAny advice or recommendations welcome, thanks!\n\nEdit: after looking through this sub, I’m going to buy Beauty of Joseon dynasty cream, green plum toner, and green plum cleansing gel, and possibly try adapalene gel on my forehead where my most acne is. Any thoughts?",

I have quite sensitive skin so I’m cautious about putting too many things in my routine, niacinamide broke me out quite a bit when i used it so i gave up. Would it be worth starting a low % retinol? \n\nIf you have any recommendations for switching up my cleansers or moisturisers please let me know 🙏🏻 i feel like I should finally take the time to have an actual functional routine rather than the easiest things I can get my hands on…\n\nFor context im 21 F and only wear makeup if im going out + avoid putting concealer or foundation on as i dont want it to make me break out 😔",

I notice my hair tangles VERY easily and when I’m detangling it looks like I’m losing half my hair. Even when I’m in the shower I have wet frizz. I’ve read it could be a too much protein issue (this shampoo and conditioner have protein), under hydrating issue, or over hydrating issue. I also have a a clarifying shampoo that I use about every 3 washes or so because the water I have is very hard. Currently doing the pineapple method and bonnet for sleeping, and in the morning I damp and scrunch in a little gel (mostly because the front pieces lose any texture they had 😂) \n\nWould appreciate any advice or help, thank you!!",

After seeing so many curly hair videos and just other people with hair similar to mine at school, I’m starting to realize that maybe washing/styling it so often isn’t good for my hair, but I’m not sure how else to keep it looking good. I’m not sure if my wording on this made any sense, so I’ll give a timeline of how my hair looks throughout the week:\n\nSunday: wash day, routine: wash with OGX coconut curls shampoo and conditioner and fight a war trying to detangle, style with not your mothers leave in spray, bounce curl brush, and not your mothers gel\n\nMonday: looks pretty good, some ringlets but mostly pretty wavy and neat\n\nTuesday: getting kind of tangled and messy, but still a good amount of ringlets and not looking too bad\n\nWednesday: getting way more tangled and messy, less ringlets and waves are getting puffy\n\nThursday: looks gross and soooo tangled, i usually just put my hair in a messy bun. Wash day and I do the same as Sunday. \n\nFriday/saturday: same as Monday/tuesday\n\nBtw I sleep with a bonnet and use the pineapple method\n\nAny tips appreciated!!!",

I've been getting some new growth in (not that I need it) because I'm starting to go grey, so my hair is changing over (mid 30s). I think this is contributing. \n\nSo, I'm looking for hair gloss recommendations! I saw Redken has the bond inside and crystal clear gloss, but for those with more experience than me - what are your tried and trues?\n\nRoutine\n\n\\- Shampoo: Biolage Ultra hydrating (not every shower - but when my hair needs a reset - my hair is very dry).\n\n\\- Conditioner: Paul Mitchell Deep Moisture conditioner (my hair really inhales this one in)\n\n\\- Leave Ins (light to heavy): Paul Mitchell One Conditioner, As I am Curl Cream, Pattern Gel.\n\n\\- Deep Condition: Shea Butter/Aloe/Vitamin E\n\n\\- I sleep with it up in a pineapple with a satin/silk scrunch. sometimes I wrap it in a scarf too.\n\nAny and all advice appreciated! THANK YOU",
