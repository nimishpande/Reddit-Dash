Since these are all properly tested this is more about texture finish and whether I’d actually want to use them daily. This is just my personal pref sharing here for girlies looking for some advice and honestly some feedback from the more seasoned players so here goes\n\ndot &amp; key vitamin c sunscreen\n\nThis is easily one of my top picks. Lightweight, spreads nicely, no white cast, and gives that fresh finish which already puts it above a lot of sunscreens. This is def my daily go to hg. \n\nderma co 1% hyaluronic sunscreen\n\nA really great option! v lightweight and hydrating especially if your skin tends to feel tight with sunscreens. Personally, I find it a bit too slippery on hot days. Not bad at all just not my fav\n\naqualogica glow+ dewy sunscreen\n\nThis is cute if you love a dewy look. Def my go to if i’m indoors but too precious to use daily. \n\nfixderma shadow\n\nv lightweight and disappears quickly which I like. But after using it for a couple of weeks it dried my skin. I always used a moisturizer before so it felt a bit weird but maybe its just me 😕\n\nlakme sun expert tinted \n\nI know a lot of people love tinted sunscreens, but I’m picky with them. The tint is fine I just dontt always want that extra layer on my skin. Not my cup of tea WNRP\n\n\nBioderma Photoderm Creme\n\nTHICC AF. I’d save this for extreme sun exposure (if I ever visit the beach ;_;). Feels a bit too much for everyday use\n\nAGAIN THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL PREF. Please don’t attack me in the comments i’ll cry. Would love to hear your thoughts and which one you use on a daily basis",

      "title": "Had curly hair all my life but now it’s straight?",
      "content": "So like the title says for some reason my hair has gone from a frizzy Hermione Granger mess to basically straight. Even when I use heat to curl my hair the curls fall out after a few hours and by the end of the day it’s basically straight with the absolute loosest of waves.\n\nUp until a few years ago I never did anything with my curls to enhance them simply because I didn’t know how and didn’t want to make my hair crunchy like when my mom would put product in my hair when I was little (I have what many hair stylists have called “baby fine” hair and I honestly love the softness that comes with such fine hair, so I don’t like the crunchy/texture/feeling that a lot of hair products give)\n\nFor a couple years I tried many products and tried the whole curly girl routine to try an enhance my natural curls but I could just never get a curl pattern that I actually liked. So I gave up maybe about a year ago now and figured that maybe the next time I have money to actually get my hair done by a stylist that I would go to a curly hair specialist that could actually teach me what I can do with my specific hair/curls that I have obviously not been able to understand yet.\n\nAfter giving up on the curly hair routine because it just felt like a lot of work for hair I didn’t even like I just started focusing on hydrating/healing/protecting my hair. After a few months I started noticing a difference in my hair feeling healthier and smoother, and then a few months ago I noticed that my hair is just basically straight now. I can still get it to curl when it’s still wet directly after washing it and scrunching so it will have same wave once it dries but the curls will always fall out later that day.\n\nAs for damage/protecting my hair, as evident by the pictures of my hair I obviously dye my hair which involves bleaching my roots every 3-4 months. Since my hair grows very slow and my hair holds onto the semi-permanent red/oraunge dye very well so I don’t need to touch up my hair very often, I also rarely use any heat on my hair, and I sleep with a bonnet+silky pillow case every night.\n\nI wash my hair every 1-2 weeks with Heritages shampoo and conditioner from Walmart and then I sometimes use OGX coconut milk serum if my hair is feeling a little extra dry and frizzy, I’ll apply it directly after washing my hair and while my hair is still damp and I’ll focus primarily of the ends of my hair. But that’s the only products I ever use on my hair besides a heat protectant when needed (and of course whatever I use to color my hair)\n\nIs it normal for hair to go straight after 39 years of curly hair? I’ve had no other life changes or new medical issues. Was my hair just never truly curly and just dried out? Was my hair maybe over hydrated? The only other thing I can think of is that this is the longest my hair as ever been and maybe because my hair is so incredibly fine it just can’t support the weight?\n\nAs an additional note, I lived in Utah in a dry climate for most of my life, but  now I live in Texas with a humid climate. I’ve lived in Texas for several years now so I don’t think it’s because of the climate.\n\nIf anyone has any insight to what’s going on I would also it ❤️",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice on how to handle a recent experience.\n\nI went to a pop-up med spa run by a nurse for acne and chickenpox scars that I had for over 10 years. The med spa was literally a small single room and the nurse was all by herself. It was in the same space shared by tattoo artists, hair salons, tax accountants, things like that. I had microneedling, subcision, and TCA CROSS done. The TCA CROSS helped a small scar near my nose, but the microneedling and subcision didn't seem to help at all, even after two sessions about 6 weeks apart.\n\nDuring the second session, I developed a hematoma on my right temple from the subcision, and the procedure was much more painful than the first time. It's been about 3 weeks since that second session, and I still don't see meaningful improvement overall. One of the TCA cross scars is still highly pigmented three weeks after.\n\nWhat made the experience more uncomfortable for me was that the provider made several unsolicited comments about my appearance that I didn't ask for, so things like saying my one of my eye bags looked puffy, suggesting lymphatic issues, mentioning that my jaw looked recessed and that I might need jaw surgery, and asking if I'd had a rhinoplasty. None of this was related to why I was there, and it left me feeling uncomfortable.\n\nIs it normal for these treatments to show no results for older scars? \nIs a hematoma from subcision something that happens, or is it a red flag?\nAre these unsolicited appearance-related comments like this common or appropriate in med spa settings?\nWould you go back to the provider, ask for a refund, or just move on?\nShould I see a dermatologist or acne-scar specialist next instead?\n\nHow would you handle this situation?",

      "content": "I have 2B curls/waves, very tangle-prone, thin strand, easily weighted down, hair that’s mainly so easily getting knotted to the point where I’ve had to cut off knots on occasion in the past. I wash my hair daily or every other day with shampoo/conditioner. I try to detangle as gently as possible w/ conditioner, starting at the ends, in the shower. But once it’s detangled, it’s smooth for a bit &amp; then re-tangles SO quickly 😭 lol it’s like my hair sticks to itself almost - besides braiding it, silk pillowcase &amp; leave in conditioners, any advice on how to detangle without damaging &amp; keep it tangle free more often? It’s mainly tangle free only briefly in the shower/when braided.\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. I use Trader Joe’s tea tree tingle shampoo (&amp; I’ve tried shea moisture retention shampoo) and sometimes Aussie girl apricot conditioner other times the Trader Joe’s tea tree conditioner \n\n2. I don’t use gel nor mousse usually but I’ve tried the doux mousse which is really nice but does make my hair appear thinner/less voluminous.\n\n3. I let my hair air dry\n\n4. I do use satin pillow case when possible.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nthin, 2B wavy hair that tangles so easily and re-tangles quickly after detangling. I wash every day/two, and detangle gently with conditioner, but it only stays smooth/knot-free briefly. Looking for ways to prevent tangles &amp; detangle w/o damage beyond braids/silk pillowcases/leave-ins.\n\nAlso open to styling techniques too (worth noting my hair gets weighed down easily, but also won’t detangle w/o some slip)!\n\nThank you!!",
