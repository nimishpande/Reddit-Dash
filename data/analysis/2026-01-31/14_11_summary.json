Additionally there were 3 PRP sessions: October 3 , November 14 and December 19\n\nIt’s been just over 4 months total and about 6 weeks since PRP #3. I’m so pleasantly surprised !

Since these are all properly tested this is more about texture finish and whether I’d actually want to use them daily. This is just my personal pref sharing here for girlies looking for some advice and honestly some feedback from the more seasoned players so here goes\n\ndot &amp; key vitamin c sunscreen\n\nThis is easily one of my top picks. Lightweight, spreads nicely, no white cast, and gives that fresh finish which already puts it above a lot of sunscreens. This is def my daily go to hg. \n\nderma co 1% hyaluronic sunscreen\n\nA really great option! v lightweight and hydrating especially if your skin tends to feel tight with sunscreens. Personally, I find it a bit too slippery on hot days. Not bad at all just not my fav\n\naqualogica glow+ dewy sunscreen\n\nThis is cute if you love a dewy look. Def my go to if i’m indoors but too precious to use daily. \n\nfixderma shadow\n\nv lightweight and disappears quickly which I like. But after using it for a couple of weeks it dried my skin. I always used a moisturizer before so it felt a bit weird but maybe its just me 😕\n\nlakme sun expert tinted \n\nI know a lot of people love tinted sunscreens, but I’m picky with them. The tint is fine I just dontt always want that extra layer on my skin. Not my cup of tea WNRP\n\n\nBioderma Photoderm Creme\n\nTHICC AF. I’d save this for extreme sun exposure (if I ever visit the beach ;_;). Feels a bit too much for everyday use\n\nAGAIN THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL PREF. Please don’t attack me in the comments i’ll cry. Would love to hear your thoughts and which one you use on a daily basis",

      "content": "Man, I’m telling you just buy these from [Costco.com](http://Costco.com) (as a nonmember) or buy legit ones. I can’t believe somebody would make a fake of a $15 package. It’s ridiculous. I’m so pissed I’m seven months into pouring a mystery fluid on my scalp. And it’s strange because I initially had a shedding without really changing my oral medication.\n\n\\*edit\\* the bleach test apparently isn’t consistent because some people will just dilute the formula so that it will pass. As well as they put that other ingredient in instead of minoxidil. Wow. so much effort to counterfeit $2 bottles. \n\nSo I’ve noticed lately that my hair stopped improving after I got the initial shed. I just opened up my new package from the same seller and it’s the same outdated packaging. The outside is I believe the new packaging, but the bundles are the old packaging that Kirkland doesn’t use as of over a year ago in discontinued all sale of.\n\nFirst, the lid wouldn’t screw on and I’m like what what’s going on OK this is super fishy like Kirkland doesn’t know how to make a bottle that can screw on? When you look at the text on the bottles it’s very different. The colorations are different hues by a small percentage like the yellow text has like a haze around it and a dark quality color on one and the other one it’s like Jimmy counterfeit printed it off their computer printer.\n\nThe bottles are also different sizes. One has two threads and the other has three threads, which is why they won’t screw together. The new bottles are also different size.\n\nFinally, we have the bleach test absolutely nothing it just made it clearer  EBAY purchased with lots of positive reviews. You have to remember that people don’t know anything and they will leave positive reviews, especially in the hair medication world without even confirming if it works or not. Like you know on Amazon, for example where they say, I haven’t even used it yet or it’s been a week, but it’s great and they leave five star reviews. Or like dating apps for example how they don’t work at all but for some reason, people pay for them and leave overwhelmingly positive reviews for something that doesn’t work for what it was made for. Lol. Reviews aren’t the end all.\n\nSee pics included.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice on how to handle a recent experience.\n\nI went to a pop-up med spa run by a nurse for acne and chickenpox scars that I had for over 10 years. The med spa was literally a small single room and the nurse was all by herself. It was in the same space shared by tattoo artists, hair salons, tax accountants, things like that. I had microneedling, subcision, and TCA CROSS done. The TCA CROSS helped a small scar near my nose, but the microneedling and subcision didn't seem to help at all, even after two sessions about 6 weeks apart.\n\nDuring the second session, I developed a hematoma on my right temple from the subcision, and the procedure was much more painful than the first time. It's been about 3 weeks since that second session, and I still don't see meaningful improvement overall. One of the TCA cross scars is still highly pigmented three weeks after.\n\nWhat made the experience more uncomfortable for me was that the provider made several unsolicited comments about my appearance that I didn't ask for, so things like saying my one of my eye bags looked puffy, suggesting lymphatic issues, mentioning that my jaw looked recessed and that I might need jaw surgery, and asking if I'd had a rhinoplasty. None of this was related to why I was there, and it left me feeling uncomfortable.\n\nIs it normal for these treatments to show no results for older scars? \nIs a hematoma from subcision something that happens, or is it a red flag?\nAre these unsolicited appearance-related comments like this common or appropriate in med spa settings?\nWould you go back to the provider, ask for a refund, or just move on?\nShould I see a dermatologist or acne-scar specialist next instead?\n\nHow would you handle this situation?",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Also trying to figure out how to fix my eyebrows. My goal is to let it grow out for a very long time ",

I’ve had acne for a long time and I’ve been on multiple prescriptions — in the past, l ymecycline + Epiduo cleared my skin insanely fast (like within a couple of weeks), but eventually it stopped working and things slowly got worse again. Right now I’m back on l ymecycline and I’ve been prescribed a tretinoin 0.025% combo cream (used nightly, pea-sized), but my main issue at this point isn’t even active spots — my skin is mostly flat, but covered in red and dark marks that look inflamed, get worse after cleansing, heat, or being in warm rooms, and make my face look constantly angry and shiny. I’ve been told this might be PIE (post-inflammatory erythema) rather than normal acne, which would explain why exfoliants don’t seem to help. I cleanse daily (gentle cleanser on face, 10% benzoyl peroxide wash on my back/chest in the morning which actually seems to calm redness there), use SPF and sometimes BB cream, but I’m stuck in this loop where my skin feels sticky, reactive, and worse after washing. I keep feeling like my routine “isn’t strong enough,” so I’ve been tempted to add things like glycolic acid, but I’m worried about making inflammation worse, especially while on tret. My back and chest seem more straightforward and tolerate BP well, but my face just won’t calm down, and the marks aren’t fading. NHS derm wait is 8–10 months, which I honestly can’t deal with mentally, so I’m also considering private options like IPL or vascular laser (VBeam/PDL) for redness. At this point I don’t care about discomfort — I just want something that actually works. Based on all this, what would you do differently: add/remove actives, change timing, stop exfoliating completely, push for laser, or consider something like isotretinoin again? I’m looking for realistic but effective next steps, especially from anyone who’s dealt with PIE or stubborn post-acne redness that just wouldn’t go away.",

      "content": "I have a little over shoulder length 3c hair and the longer it's gotten the more tangled it gets. It is fairly thin and tangles easily. By the end of the day it is frizzy. I sleep with a satin bonnet on a satin pillowcase but still have crazy tangles the next morning when I wash it. I have tried to pineapple the hair but haven't noticed any differences. Should I put something in my hair the night before to make it more slippery so that it doesn't get tangled? I am looking for a fairly cheap product or maybe even a light oil that won't make it greasy. My fear is that I am loosing more hair than I need to.\n\nMy routine is this:\n\nI wash my hair almost every day (I know it's sounds crazy). It's truly the only way to manage it and make it look good. It is impossible to keep it looking good overnight. I am not looking for any advice on how often to wash it. My hair is not super dry so I am not concerned that the washing is causing negative effects. I sometimes use shampoo but also sometimes do a co-wash only. I use a brand called J and L Naturals for their shampoo bars and use Shea Moisture Hair Masque for the conditioner. I brush through my hair after the conditioner has been sitting for a few minutes. I wash it all out. I use Prose curl cream for styling. I scrunch it with a microfiber towel and let it air dry. I don't have a diffuser/ hair dryer as I try to avoid heat products, but am willing to purchase one if that will help with volume and frizziness. ",
