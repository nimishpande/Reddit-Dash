      "content": "**The first pic up there is a before / after of the same thigh, but honestly it's hard to tell if anything is changing, or if it's remaining the same.**\n\nI've had these scars mainly on my upper legs for the past 3 years due to a bad waxing incident. I've waxed a few times after, until my derm told me that I should use laser since they shouldn't wax repeatedly / retraumatize the skin there.\n\n**I tried the following in the past 3 years:**\n\n\\*AmLactin (no change)\n\n\\*Vitamin C (no change)\n\n\\* Salicylic acid (increased presence of red bumps when used as a body wash)\n\n\\* Aloe gel (no change)\n\n\\* Laser hair removal (unsure yet, went through 3 sessions so far, spaced 6-8 weeks apart, started in September, with my most recent session being in late November)\n\n\\* Foliculitis cream (recommended by derm; did nothing)\n\n**I'm currently doing the following (1.5 months roughly):**\n\n\\* Medspa salicylic acid pads (every morning)\n\n\\* Aloe gel application (some mornings after salycylic acid pads)\n\n\\* Glycolic acid body wash from Ordinary (every night in shower)\n\n\\* Polyester exfoliation glove from CVS (every other night in shower)\n\n\\* Pat-dry of thighs after shower (every night)\n\n\\* Gold bond retinol age renewal cream (every night)\n\nToday, an ingrown hair came out and left this bright red bump as I was exfoliating (third picture). Could something deeper be wrong with my skin? I feel like new bumps pop up randomly sometimes and may be making my skin worse, but it's hard to tell. \n\nI'm not sure if there is something I can do, or if I may be stuck with these for the rest of my life. Any tips are appreciated, thank you!",

I have massive ugly cheeks that runs in my dad's family but mine are very bad, and my long sides helps hide how deep my head is from my side profile and helps hide my side profile as its very fucking ugly. Also dont say grow a beard, the only beard I can grow is a neck beard, If I go bald life is totally over for me its suicide women my age hate me as of now, imagine if I went bald. Ive been trying to get into a relationship for two years now and not even a date has occurred.\n\nI think my hair is just very dehydrated (hopefully) i need to learn how to treat long hair as ive always wanted long hair since I was a child but my parents always shamed me for it and forced me to have short hair all my life.",

      "content": "Until ~3 years ago I never had acne. Not in my teens, not in early adulthood. I washed my face with water, used nothing, and my skin was fine.\n\nAround 24, after some recommendations, I started using skincare products (cleansers, moisturizers, SPF, later “acne treatments”). Around the same time residency stress kicked in. That’s when acne started — mostly forehead / hairline, inflammatory but not severe.\n\nOver the past years I’ve tried everything:\ndifferent cleansers, moisturizers, SPF, azelaic acid, retinoids (including Aklief), simplified routines, “barrier repair”, diets, supplements, stress management. Nothing truly worked long-term. At best it fluctuated, at worst it got more persistent. Treatments never gave clear control — sometimes they even seemed to maintain the problem.\n\nWhat I’ve noticed looking back:\nwhenever my routine was chaotic or minimal (especially summers, fewer products), my skin was calmer. The more “correct” and consistent the routine became, the more constant the breakouts felt.\n\nI’ve recently stopped all actives, and now I’m doing a proper zero-therapy trial: washing only with water, no products, no treatments, nothing — just to see my real baseline again.\n\nI know this won’t magically cure everything, but at this point I want clarity more than constant intervention. If my skin was fine for years without products, I want to see what happens when I truly leave it alone again.\n\nNot looking for miracle advice — just sharing my experience and seeing if anyone else with late-onset, treatment-resistant acne has noticed something similar.\n",

It started about two years ago and has progressively gotten worse.\nI know I’m at an age where hormones can shift, so I suspect it may be hormonal acne (though I’m not 100% sure). I’ve been taking a hormone balance supplement, but I haven’t seen much improvement. This has honestly been really hard on my confidence, I haven’t felt this insecure about my skin since middle school, and it’s painful to look in the mirror.\nMy acne is mostly on my cheeks. I also have blackheads on my nose, but my main concern is the acne and the hyperpigmentation left behind after breakouts. I feel like I’ve tried everything, but nothing fully clears it. \nCurrent simple routine: \nAM: Rinse with water, moisturizer, sunscreen\nPM: wash with youth to the people superfood cleanser, apply azelaic acid, moisturizer. I have combination skin. I’ve included some photos of the products I’m currently using for reference.\nI’ve also tried toners like Paula’s Choice exfoliating toner and Byoma Hydrating Milk Toner, but neither seemed to help, so I just keep my routine simple now to avoid using any products that may break my skin out further. \nAs for my lifestyle, I eat fairly healthy, stay hydrated, and only drink alcohol on occasion. I do vape sometimes, which I suspect may be affecting my skin barrier. \nI would really appreciate any insight on whether I should make any routine adjustments or ingredient changes. I have seen a dermatologist in the past, but she prescribed me winlevi, which broke my skin out horribly, and I haven’t returned since. I do plan on scheduling an appointment soon though. Thank you for reading!! \n\n\n",

I’ve watched some tutorials and I’m able to get my hair into a pretty secure French twist with it, but it pulls way too tight on my hair and hurts my head. It’s ridiculously secure when I do it but it’s just way too tight. I’ve tried not twisting my hair as tightly but then it just falls out. Does it make a difference if you use the pin horizontally or vertically? I can’t figure out how to make it comfortable but I’ve been dying for claw clip alternatives since those give me headaches. I’m also wondering if maybe my French pin is too small and maybe I need a longer/wider one? I’m a newbie with these so I have no idea what I’m doing lol. \n\nRoutine: wash with head and shoulders shampoo and condition with a basic Pantene conditioner, then I put mousse in my hair and braid it into two Dutch braids and air dry. I sleep with a satin bonnet with the braids or if I’ve taken the braids out a loose bun. ",

As of right now my routine is wash with NYM  curl talk shampoo, use NYM conditioner afterwards from mid length (like ear level) down to the ends and comb through in the shower. Then once out of the shower I use NYM curl talk mousse, about two golf ball size pumps. At this point my hair is dripping (wondering if this is the issue - too much water weighing it down). Praying hands, scrunch with my hands, then scrunch with a tshirt. I follow that up by pixie diffusing. I dry it 90% with the diffuser then I find it falls a good amount in the rest of the time its drying. The first picture is after diffusing, and my texture will certainly fall more throughout the day. As far as day two hair, I wet my hands and scrunch just to bring back some of the texture that may have been lost while sleeping, but even that texture will fall through the day as well. I am frustrated with my hair :/ is there something I am doing wrong?",

I scrunch it while towel drying but leave it alone to air dry after that and don’t do anything else to it. I don’t add curl cream or any leave in conditioners because I hate the feeling of stuff being left in my hair. My hair also gets greasy really quickly so I don’t know if that’s a problem with the products I’m using or what, it might be the conditioner or just my pillows. Any tips are welcome, my hair might also be damaged from bleaching it but that was a few months ago as you can see from the grow out at my roots. ",
