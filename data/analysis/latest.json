I like the kinda wild hair I’ve been rocking lately.\n\nRoutine \\* loves curl shampoo and conditioner. Use the curl butter around a quarter size amount after wash, leave in for 5ti 10 minutes and rinse out. \n\nAround 15 pumps of the Davines leave in. \n\nSometimes I’ll use the Davines curl serum but I’m on the fence, as I don’t like the crunch and just like my hair silky soft so sometimes I’ll nix it. Diffuse upside down scrunch hair to the scalp for extra volume.\n\nI’m on the fence about serums and gels still. I feel like my hair isn’t as soft when I use them and the style has to be reset every day so what’s the point? I kind of like just letting my hair be really soft, and letting it do its thing until wash day. It may be a lil frizzy, but I think I like it that way unless there is a way to get a lot of volume with gel. I think I have 2c hair, or a mix of Irish curls.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I guess it’s helped but my skin is peeling and everything I put on my face burns but if I put nothing my skin is dry as can be.\n\nTried so far:\n\n\\\\- Vanicream daily moisturizer (it’s fine but doesn’t feel like it last)\n\n\\\\- Vanicream moisturizing cream (Makes my skin feel really oily and possibly been breaking me out)\n\n\\\\- Aveeno calm and restore face moisturizer (burns when I put it on)\n\n\\\\- Cetaphil face wash (still broke out while on it)\n\n\\\\- COSRX Vitamin E Vitalizing Face Sunscreen SPF 50 (love this stuff want to keep it)\n\nWhat worked well for acne prone skin, that like to be tight and dry along with winter weather not helping conditions?\n\nWould prefer cost be reasonable doesn’t have to be budget(I appreciate the savings though).\n\nAnother question which do you prefer western or asian beauty products?",

I tried the slide test and it was smooth which would mean low porosity I guess. Some people said just doing an observation test is best so I tried that. It took about a minute to get fully wet with no manipulation. It takes quite a while to dry naturally too. It is also quite shiny so (I think?) it is safe to assume I have low porosity hair.\n\nRight now I use Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus curl and shine shampoo with the Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus curl and shine conditioner to tighten my curls and wash it about 3-4x per week. Now I want to grow my hair out more to shoulder length. The end goal is a wavy wolf cut style. The problem with my current shampoo is that it makes the curls too tight whereas I want something that will make my hair more loose and wavy to reach my intended style. After looking online I found the Bumble and Bumble Surf Shampoo &amp; Surf Conditioner however it is rather expensive and I don't know if its right for my hair.\n\nI saw some people saying I should be looking for shampoos that fit my hair porosity rather than style however I am seeing way too many opinions on this and I don't know which to follow. I don't know much about hair at all and no one in my family has hair like mine so it would be helpful to know what to look for.\n\nSome extra information in case it is required: my hair is longer on top ranging from 7-15cm and slightly shorter in the sides. The ends of my hair curl and coil whereas the the base of my hair is quite wavy and tends to sit. I'm 21 and male.\n\nI really don't know much about hair or what to do with it so any advice is welcome. If more information is needed then let me know.\n\nBased off of this What shampoo and conditioner would be best for me? Or at least what should I be looking for. ",

I've also been diagnosed with Hydradenitis (but it's pretty mild).\n\nI recently (about a month ago) switched to LRP Toleriane Double Repair as my PM moisturizer and feel like it might have contributed to a worse than usual breakout I'm currently trying to fix.\n\nAM: \n* Skinceuticals Glycolic Renewal Cleanser\n\n* Paula's Choice Vitamin C + Glutathione (2-3x a week)\n\n* Elta MD UV Clear \n\n\nPM: \n* Skinceuticals cleanser\n\n* Differin OTC (every other night)\n\n* night moisturizer- LRP now, but over the years have also tried first aid beauty, TO's moisturizer, Vanicream, Biossance squalane oil, Elta MD night cream, and once on the rec of a friend with psoriasis thinking maybe my skin was just horrifically dry, Kiehls Midnight Recovery cream (waaaay too rich). \n\nI give every new product a couple of months but feel like I always get worse breakouts than if I don't use moisturizer (eek) or just use the sunscreen as a moisturizer. When I do that, stuff calms down (but my face feels dry, so I don't think this is ideal.) I think a lot of this is due to the niacinimide and zinc in the sunscreen.\n\nCan anyone recommend a moisturizer that vibes well with deep cysts, and also has zinc and/or niacinimide in it?",

While I am aware it’s probably genetic I’m willing to try anything that may help.\n\nOther causes may be sleep, I’m a stomach sleeper and do have trouble sleeping although do get an avg of at least 7-8 hours\n\nI also get pretty bad hayfever and my room is very dusty. I take Vitamin D and have a healthy diet and exercise daily. Any help is appreciated ( I also currently use a coffee eye serum that does mask it slightly but turns white and noticeable after some time) (( I’m also male so makeup probably isn’t my answer))",
