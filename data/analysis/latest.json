      "content": "I feel like people still think anti-aging skincare is only for people in their 40s or 50s, but honestly starting early has been one of the best decisions for my skin. I started taking skincare seriously in my mid-20s, and the difference now is very noticeable.\n\nUsing a simple routine with an anti-aging serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen has helped keep my skin smoother, more hydrated, and way more even in tone. It is less about fixing wrinkles and more about preventing damage before it becomes permanent.\n\nIngredients like niacinamide, peptides, ceramides, snail mucin, and hyaluronic acid focus on barrier repair and collagen support. When your barrier is healthy, your skin automatically looks younger and brighter.\n\nThe biggest change I noticed was texture. My skin feels bouncier and less dull, even when I am tired or stressed. Consistency matters more than using ten different products.\n\nIf you are in your 20s and think anti-aging skincare is not for you yet, trust me, future you will be very thankful you started early.\n\nCurious to know, when did you all start using anti-aging products and what made you begin?",

      "content": "Looking for any ideas, product recommendations, or routine tweaks to get this frizz back under control.\n\nTo give a little perspective, first pic is current and the second pic was taken a little over a year ago. I still use the same gel and leave-in conditioner for both of these pics.\n\nDamaged my hair by tying it back in a low ponytail and wearing a hat most days for the last couple years, and only doing the full curl routine like twice a week. I also had some significant shedding last year so I got on finasteride and minoxidil earlier this year which is why I think I'm seeing more short flyaways around my scalp than normal. Hair is also way more matte than it used to be.\n\nOutside of just not pulling my hair back as much and as tight by using silk scrunchies instead of tight hair ties, any recommendations for some tweaks to my routine?\n\nRoutine:\n\n* Wash every 6-7 days with Ouidad Cleansing Oil Shampoo.\n   * Every three washes I will instead use Malibu C shampoo with a dab of aussie miracle curls shampoo to cleanse the hardwater and silicons.\n* Condition with Cantu Argan Oil Leave-In Conditioning repair cream and then rinse.\n* 1.5 pumps of Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-In Conditioner.\n* Around 4 pumps of Ouidad Climate Control Gel - I have to use a lot to keep the frizz in check.\n* Scrunch out some of the moisture with a microfiber towel.\n* Diffuse on low heat with Dyson diffuser for about 15-20 minutes to about 70-80% dry.\n* Around 3 hours later carefully crunch out cast with Olaplex Bonding Oil or some Morraconoil Argan Oil (mostly just cup my ends and press it against scalp for a second or two)\n* On days that I want a quicker routine for work if I don't have meetings or presentations, I just swap the gel for some Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream and don't worry about diffusing. Gets me like 70% of the results as above, but with less active time.\n* As needed I deep condition with Ouidad Moisture Lock Mask.\n\nI use a silk pillowcase and I have tried pineappling at night and have even tried a silk beanie, but I have never been able to really refresh my curls to the point I think they look acceptable. One of the reasons I tied it back so much. My hair is fine/medium fine with low density.",

Ive been through the highs and lows and am having such a hard time with controlling my emotions. What are some things that have helped better your mental health? Recommend books, tips, or anything.\n\nIm an emotional and boredom eater so some tips on how to tackle that bad habit would be great. Ive went on a weight loss journey before and ended up losing 80 pounds but this was before my kids. This time around I’m having a hard time and weight has seemed to gain on me fast. I think this has a lot to due with my first pregnancy. I was diagnosed with HG (severe morning sickness) and never gained a pound instead i loss 30 pounds that pregnancy. I think my body and cravings come from the fact I’ve lost so much nutrients and barely ate anything over the year. Even with my twins I was somewhat sick but didn’t have an appetite. \n\nWith postpartum came minor hair loss. It’s not too bad but I can tell a difference. My hair is more thin than it use to be.",

I just got an early Christmas gift from my mum and it's the Dyson Supersonic Nural. \n\nShe came to visit a few weeks back and brought her own Supersonic (non-Nural model) and I was really impressed with the results. She said she would get me one, I begged her not to, but she did it anyway. \n\nIt was just delivered a few minutes ago and I feel like it must be faulty. The buttons to control heat and airflow are incredibly mushy. There is essentially zero tactility to them, with the heat control button being worse that the airflow button. In fact the heat control button is so mushy that it actually hurts my thumb trying to engage the button because it requires sohch force to press down. The airflow button has no *click* but it works with much less force than is required for the heat button. The top Nural button is also mushy. \n\nI did play around with the settings on my mums non-Nural model. I don't remember if the buttons had any click or feedback, but I do remember that they were very easy to press. \n\nIs this normal or have I been given a faulty unit? It was brand new, sealed in both it's original packaging and it's transportation packaging. It's from a reputable seller in the UK (Argos) so I don't believe it's a knock off etc. ",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

My mom doesn’t like them either, even though many people tell me they look great. I just can’t stand them short. I usually end up wearing a loose high ponytail with a clip at the elastic to lift my curls (not a tight ponytail).\n\nI’ve been straightening my hair for 2–3 years after a keratin treatment. I didn’t trim much + undiagnosed trichotillomania - I guess- (I used to play with my split ends for hours), which caused uneven length. My hair is now the longest it’s ever been, and I want to avoid past mistakes.\n\nI noticed some breakage this week (probably from not drying it properly).\n\nMy question: (ik it’s not recommended BUT) is it possible to get healthy curls back (later) without cutting my hair if I straighten it once a week (medium heat, heat protection), trim regularly, and take good care of it for the next year/year and a half until it’s longer?\n\n# Current routine if someone’s interested (not perfect ik):\n\nGarnier Papaya shampoo + mask/leave-in\n\nCurl gel (professional brand)\n\nDiffuse + some air drying because I don’t take my time\n\nDetangle in the shower\n\nCurly brush for styling\n\nMicrofiber towel\n\nStyle on dripping wet hair\n\nSleeping on a \"satin\" bonnet\n\nI don’t have a refresh routine\n\n(I used ai to correct my text)\n\n(Some pictures of my hair)",
