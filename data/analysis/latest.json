I've been over the moon about how good my hair looks now. I did want a haircut, just to clean up the sides. \nBut my hair was absolutely butchered. First pic is right before, second is when I got home from the curly hair salon. It looks awful, and barely curls anymore. She thinned out the top a ton, and my volume is gone. No point to this post other than just sharing my pain. Right back to insecure about my hair.\nRoutine is simple. Just shea moisture conditioner in the shower, then not your mother's curl talk cream then gel immediately after I get out. Then scrunch and let it air dry. Now that's not working anymore because of how she cut my hair",

      "content": "Okay so I was literally hovering over the \"Place Order\" button on Nykaa when my desi instincts kicked in like \"beta, have you checked other apps first?\"\nI'm SO glad I listened to that inner voice because y'all... the price difference for the SAME THREE PRODUCTS was ₹360. That's literally another full-size Minimalist product just... sitting there for free if you're smart about where you order.\n\nWhat I was buying:\n1. Minimalist 8% Glycolic Acid Toner (150ml)\n2. Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Serum (30ml)\n3. Minimalist Vitamin B5 Moisturizer (50g)\n\nThe shocking price breakdown:\n\nTIRA - ₹1,186 (THE CLEAR WINNER)\n1. Cheapest price\n2. FREE Minimalist tote bag as GWP\n\nNYKAA - ₹1,441\n1. ₹255 more expensive than Tira 😬\n2. Zero freebies but you'll be paying for lice pink packaging??\n\nMYNTRA - ₹1,321\n1. ₹135 costlier than Tira\n2. No GWP either\n\nBLINKIT - ₹1,428\n₹242 more than Tira BUT delivers in 14 minutes (see screenshot lol)\n\nAJIO - ₹1,546 💀\n1. Most expensive by FAR (₹360 more than Tira!)\n2. Had random GWPs like travel vouchers??? (for skincare???). There was a coupon but it straight up refused to apply\n\n\nThat ₹360 difference is literally the price of another Minimalist product. Do. The. Math. It took me 10 minutes to check all these apps and I basically got a free product out of it. Also I'm attaching all my cart screenshots because I know the skincare community loves RECEIPTS 📸\nIs anyone else this obsessive about price-checking or is it just my broke millennial energy?",

      "content": "Hi y'all! I just recently started looking into how to properly take care of my hair and began trying out a curly hair routine a couple days ago. This is how it looked this morning after showering, putting in products, and diffusing. I know that it takes time for curls to reach their full form, but there's definitely room for improvement and I need some advice from the experts! First, here is my current routine/products I use:\n\n1.\t⁠Kristen Ess Extra Gentle Shampoo and Conditioner\n\n2.\t⁠Detangle with Wet brush, apply Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream\n\n3.\t⁠apply Curlsmith Hydro Style Flexi Jelly, flip head upside down and scrunch\n\n4.\t⁠apply John Frieda Frizz Ease Curl Reviver Mousse to roots and scrunch again\n\n5.\t⁠plop hair in t-shirt for a few minutes\n\n6.\t⁠diffuse until mostly dry, scrunch to break the gel cast, and put the hair near my part in a claw clip for a bit for volume\n\nSo far, I'm happy with the results of this routine, as my curls held their shape throughout the day, though my hair got a little less voluminous as time went on (and there wasn't too too much volume to begin with). The biggest thing I'm concerned about is that my hair looks dry and a little frizzy, especially towards the ends where it's more damaged, which I think is affecting the definition of my curls. I believe hair oil is a possible solution, so if you have any brand recommendations (preferably on the affordable side) or other ideas on how to fix it, let me know! Here's a list of other things I would love some advice on:\n\n\\- My roots and front pieces seem to have a very hard time curling, should I use more product there or a different method when applying product?\n\n\\- What's the best way to refresh curls after sleeping on them? There are a lot of contrasting opinions whether or not you should wet your hair and what products to use, which makes it very confusing!\n\n\\- I believe I have medium-to-high porosity hair. Should I use oil, and if so, when should I use it (before bed, to refresh hair, on wet hair, dry hair, etc.)?\n\nOk-- question tirade is over. Thank you in advance for your time and suggestions :)",

In the rare cases they don't, my hair still looks like a squished mess. \nI also tried a very loose bun, or satin sheets and pillowcases, but to no avail.

I put a mask from garnier and leave it on for 5 minutes\n\n3. After i wash it i detangle it with a gentle brush, and spray in a leave in conditioner from Schwarzkopf (the purple one)\n\n4. I either diffuse it until its 80% dry or just dry my scalp and let it curl naturally\n\n5.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

I wash my scalp with the \"Twisty born to bounce curly shampoo\", then condition the hair with the \"Twisty wave me to the moon curly hair humectant conditioner\" and scrunch. Then I wait like 5 minutes before I rinse it out, scrunch again and leave my hair to air dry.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

No instant glow, no overnight “glass skin” moment though, i finished the bottle and ended up restocking another because it did exactly what I needed it to do.

      "content": "I suffered some raised hypertrophic scarring in September 2022 on my arms and have been unable to fully get rid of them or make them less noticeable. At first, I went to a dermatologist who recommended laser treatments, which I got in Fall 2023 and Spring 2024, but those did not lower the scars at all. Then, I was given some injections in Spring 2024, which only flattened them slightly but they still remained fairly visible. I also tattooed over the scars in Summer 2024, but that undid the work of the injections and the scars are still visible even through the tattoos. \n\nRight now, I am looking mainly for a method that involves flattening the scars so that the tattoos I already have and possibly some extra makeup can make the scars have less visibility. So what are the best methods at this point to flatten raised hypertrophic scars? Are there any cheap methods that work effectively on scars that are 3+ years old, or would this require an expensive cosmetic or medical procedure? I have heard of silicon scars sheets recently, but none of the dermatologists I consulted recommended this to me, and I do know about their effectiveness or how to use them properly. I would appreciate some helpful insight.",

      "content": "hi! i’ve needed hair help for a while but i live in a smaller town and can’t seem to find a good hair stylist, so i’m coming to the experts of the internet :3 \n\ni just realized last year i have a curl pattern. i cut my own hair for over 10 years, and it used to be very long (\\~3 ft), but i decided last year i would like to have shorter hair. i went to a professional and had it cut to above my shoulders with long layers. i did notice it shrank a lot after i washed it myself, but i assumed the professional hair stylist knew this too. \n\ni just got another haircut and wanted to go a bit shorter, and oh boy, it is short. she also gave me bangs when i only asked for a trim up there. it’s fine, it’ll grow out, but i need help styling it now. i hate using heat but i feel like now i have to. i attached photos of my hair today. \n\nlooking for suggestions as to how i should ask for my hair to be cut next time, and if i should get longer or shorter layers to help the curl pattern. i like the layers because it feels lighter and my hair is very very thick. also, how i may adjust my routine (below) to help. \n\nmy typical hair routine: \n\n1. wash (shampoo, rinse, condition, rinse) with “not your mothers” anti frizz set \n\n2. towel dry (100% cotton, pat dry)\n\n3. wrap/plop with a cotton t-shirt for 10-20 min \n\nsometimes i’ll add a curl mousse (aussie brand; i just learned about these last year so unsure if i’m doing it correctly). i just use a small amount and scrunch it in then, pat dry a few more times with the towel, then wrap. \n\nwhat i just did before these photos: \n\n1. wash \n\n2. towel\n\n3. mousse \n\n4. wrap\n\n5. light blow dry while scrunching \n\n6. blow dried bangs with cylinder brush &amp; added a bit of hairspray because they want to part in the middle\n\nit’s dry in the photos but i think i used too much mousse because it looks… crunchy? but also frizzy?? pls help!! thank you!!",
