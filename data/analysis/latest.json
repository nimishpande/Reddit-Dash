      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I hate the idea that my looks are gonna \"deteriorate\" or whatever (even though I belive that older people are equally as beautiful, I just don't see myself continuing to be able to love myself which is an issue in of itself, I know). I know it's natural and will happen regardless but I would like to slow it down as much as possible. \n\nI really care about good quality products and want to make sure I get the best things I can, but I know nothing about any of this stuff. Does anyone have recommendations for products that would help with anti aging? I've been looking into SPF stuff but I don't know what else to look into or what products with SPF would be good.\n\nIf anyone also has any other suggestions for anything related to anti aging that would be wonderful as well :) ",

      "content": "My skin was totally clear until sixth grade. And ever since then I have had extremely deep and painful cystic acne all over my face. I went to a dermatologist whilst my face was full of deep red acne and the dermat said that in my age (14) it is normal and hormonal. She prescribed me ahaglow facewash and zitmoist as mousturizer. That was all. \n\nMy experience with both was very bad. Bad in the sense that neither of it did absolutely nothing for my acne. The facewash felt too drying for me and the zitmoist gel felt like nothing. It was not at all hydrating or moisturizing. \n\nI switched to a more hydrating moisturizer (Johnson's milk+rice cream) and a different gentler cleanser (Neutrogena extra gentle cleanser). I would say in terms of hydration these were better but my acne was still super bad. \n\nThen I began researching into skincare and nutrition. I cut down on dairy especially milk and sugar. And I decided that I had to use an active to target my acne. I ended up buying the Cosrx BHA serum. I used it for nearly 1.5 years and it did help with my acne to some extent. But it works extremely slow. Took me about 6 months to notice a reduction in my acne. I started using plum gel moisturizer also and Joy 5.5 hydrating gel face wash. \n\nAfter that I used tranexamic acid and alpha arbutin serum from minimalist for all the scars that had formed on my face. I absolutely love alpha arbutin for scars and hyperpigmentation. And for the active acne I started using The Ordinary glycolic acid. I had high hopes for it but it did not do anything for my acne. 😭 It had absolutely zero effect anywhere either on my face or body😢\n\nAnyways this is my current routine now which for me has been working absolutely fabulously. I only get a few acne during my periods, they are like surface level white heads and they just dry out in a day and pop on their own and don't leave scars. So I'm not really bothered by them. I'm very happy with how my skin looks and I'm going to stick to this routine.\n\nMy skin is by no means perfect. I have quite a few icepick scars from the acne plus there is hyperpigmentation as well. But imo those are part of my natural skin and this is just how I look and I'm totally okay with it. Acne is tough to live with, I know. You just have to be patient and find the products that works for you. It took me more than a decade to get here and who knows it might come back later too. But believe you me acne is not going to stop my life, nor has it ever😇\n\nCURRENT ROUTINE\n\nAM \n\n1. Simple barrier care replenishing cream cleanser\n2. Aziderm 10% gel \n3. Cosrx snail mucin. \n4. Cerave moisturizing cream \n5. UV Doux silicone sunscreen gel spf 50\n6. Foxtale lip balm\n\nPM \n\n1. Simple barrier care replenishing cream cleanser\n2. Benzac AC 5%\n3. Cosrx snail mucin\n4. Cerave moisturizing cream \n5. Boroline on lips\n\n",

      "content": "\nHi skincare Reddit — I could really use some help!\n\nToward the end of last year, I started breaking out a lot more, so I decided it was finally time to take better care of my skin. I went to a dermatologist, explained that my main goals were reducing acne/pores and maybe slowing early wrinkles, and they started me on tretinoin in December 2024. At that point, I only had very basic skincare knowledge. I did some research and tried to introduce it slowly, but looking back, I think they started me on a pretty strong dose (0.01%) and also had me add vitamin C in the mornings.\n\nThe first few weeks were okay, but then the peeling, redness, and burning started. When I asked about it, my dermatologist said it was normal purging and would settle within 6–12 weeks. So I pushed through… but it just kept getting worse. By August/September (8–9 months in), my skin was the worst it had ever looked. I also started getting these tiny under-the-skin bumps that weren’t whiteheads and just wouldn’t go away.\n\nI started digging through forums, got a second opinion, and the new dermatologist told me to stop tretinoin completely and focus on rebuilding my skin barrier. I’ve been doing that since August and have gotten really into Korean skincare because of its focus on barrier repair. My skin has definitely improved, but those little bumps still won’t disappear, and overall it still feels worse than before I ever started tretinoin.\n\nSo I guess my biggest question is: did I totally mess up my skin? How long does the barrier actually take to repair? And is there anything else I can do?\n\nI really enjoy skincare now and would love to slowly reintroduce gentle retinols or other actives at some point, but I’m not sure when it’s safe to start again. I’ll definitely be avoiding tretinoin for now and sticking to milder options.\n\nOne last thing — I still get a hot, red face toward the end of the day, which never happened before tretinoin. Not sure if that’s normal. I sleep on a washed silk pillowcase and don’t press my phone to my face, so I’m running out of things to adjust.\n\nI’ve attached photos with dates for context.\n\nThanks in advance ",

I would love some advice on how to make it more consistently lean into the more wrapped/defined curls.\n\nI believe I have medium porosity hair, as water does bead up some when first getting it wet. Takes a good couple minutes to get it fully soaked. Here are the products / routine I am using currently.\n\nI am washing my hair every 3-4 days depending on what’s going on/ how it’s looking.\n\nStep 1- Get in the shower, soak my hair and use a light detangling spray. Currently using the Marc Anthony Grow Long spray. Brush out my hair completely with a denman type wet brush.\n\nStep 2- Shampoo and condition hair. I was using the Kristin Ess curly S &amp; C, but recently just switched to Rizos Curl Biotin S&amp;C\n\nStep 3- Still in the shower, apply Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Cury Envy Cream. Brush through my hair, and then while under the water scrunch my hair with a bit more cream in my hands.\n\nStep 4- Get out of the shower, get dressed, and scrunch some of the excess water out of my hair with a micro fiber towel.\n\nStep 5- Prayer hands apply Cantù Wave Whip Curling Mousse. Scrunch in if needed but usually try to avoid that.\n\nI do not do any diffusing / drying of my hair, which I know I’ll get some flack about. But I’m a working mom of 2 and never have the time to do it given how thick my hair is.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions on what I could do differently without adding a ton of extra time to my routine that would be amazing. Open to product recommendations or answering questions to help determine what I should do.",

My skin has been irritated for a couple years (yes I know I should’ve gone to a dermatologist) and I’ve been trying to figure out what is irritating my skin. I’ve eliminated and tried many products but I can’t seem to figure out the issue. Recently I realized that most products in my routine have niacinamide. After doing some research, I realized that experience aligns with those who are sensitive to niacinamide (bumps, redness, face flushing, etc.). My routine is now niacinamide-free, but I’m wondering how long it takes for skin to recover because I don’t want to buy or throw away any products unnecessarily if some other ingredient or product is the issue. Any help or advice would be appreciated!",

Ever since then i’ve realized i am experiencing hair loss and scalp issues. My scalp tends to be very itchy &amp; flaky. I’m  not only dealing with my scalp being very flaky i also have thick White patches of dandruff on my scalp as well.Upon finding out about the issues i was  having I decided to research the symptoms i’m having with hair loss &amp; my scalp. When looking into some suggestions that could possibly help with my hair loss &amp; scalp a lot of people with almost the same symptoms im having recommended Nizoral Anti dandruff shampoo due to having a good outcome using their products . The individuals that posted reviews under the Nizoral products stated they noticed a big difference since using their products They also noticed the shampoo was controlling their dandruff also mentioning that they no longer have the urge to itch their scalp. So I decided to get the Nizoral Anti Dandruff Shampoo using it almost daily &amp; the Nizoral pre-shower build up to exfoliate my scalp once a week and it seemed to be working okay for a couple months….. I did notice the white patches of dandruff on my scalp weren’t as thick as before but other than that i didn’t see a difference at all . my scalp was still very flaky and would be extremely itchy after using the shampoo.  \n\nLast week as routine I was using the Nizoral anti dandruff shampoo as i’ve done plenty times before. after applying the product my scalp felt like it was burning/on fire so i began to rinse it out buttt my scalp was still burning afterwards for a few minutes. \n\nSince then I have been looking for a new product/treatment to help my scalp/hair and I came across Nioxin. I did some searching around and found their Scalp recovery 3 step kit. I looked at their reviews &amp; Individuals that are dealing with similar scalp issues using the Nioxin scalp recovery product were seeing a difference in there scalp and very happy with the outcome but there were not many reviews or videos on this specific product . I did buy their scalp soothing serum two days ago sadly store I went to had sold out of Nioxin’s Scalp Recovery shampoo &amp; conditioner. After applying the Nioxin scalp recovery serum I got an instant relief kind of like a cooling sensation also my scalp has not been itchy after one use of Nioxin’s scalp serum don’t get me wrong my scalp will itch here and there but no where near to how much it would itch before I felt like I could finally have a little bit a peace in mind w/o my scalp feeling almost constantly itchy to a point where i wanted to dig at my scalp. I did order their Scalp Recovery shampoo &amp; conditioner after having a good experience with the serum I also was thinking about getting there Scalp Exfoliator hair treatment but before buying all their products I would love to hear more about others experience using this product due to scalp issues please let me know I am struggling to find something that works for me and really would like to find a product/ solution for my scalp/hair.",

I usually blow-dry every 3–4 days. My main concerns are styling flexibility and avoiding heat damage and hair fall (FYI the hostel water is pretty hard — does that matter?).\n\nI'm a total noob at this and terms like *ionic tech*, *ThermoProtect*, etc. are confusing. I found two options from Reddit suggestions:\n\n**Philips Foldable Hair Dryer BHD356/10 (2100W)-**\n\n**Philips Hair Dryer BHD321/06 (1600W)-**\n\nMy budget is a**round 2000-3000 rupees**.
