      "content": "It doesn't matter how much product I use, how little or more conditioner I use, if I flip my hair side to side when diffusing or just diffusing in general the SAME shit happens:\n\n1. It's always flat at the top and all the hairs clump together\n2. I get ropey waves\n\nSeparating them does nothing other than turn them in skinnier ropes waves and it just looks like I have dreads.\n\nI know my hair can not do this, as it's happened before, and that's because it was the 2nd day, I steamed my curls in the shower and ran my wet hands through them. Unfortunately no photo since it was a once in a lifetime experience I'm sorry.\n\nI don't know why we need to submit a routine just for basic help considering nobody knows wtf products we use if we're not from the US but hey! here you go:\n\n1. Sulkin volumising conditioner (protein) or garnier watermelon conditioner \n2. Redwon teatree shampoo (clarifier) or garnier watermelon shampoo\n3. vo5 megahold gel\n4. sometimes a leave-in conditioner on the ends\n\nOther methods I've tried:\n\n1. Scrunching conditioner in the shower upside down (no)\n2. Only using gel on the ends/mids (no)\n3. Not diffusing my hair (no)\n4. Diffusing my hair (no)\n5. Deep conditioning my hair (no)\n6. Not conditioning my hair at all, just shampoo &amp; gel (no)\n7. Separating my curls when wet or dry (no)\n\nWhat can be done üò≠",

I visited a dermatologist who suggested polynucleotides, microneedling, and HydraFacials. I‚Äôve decided to skip the polynucleotides for now but am keen to go ahead with HydraFacials and microneedling.\n\nHer plan was: HydraFacial followed by microneedling 2 weeks later, for 4‚Äì6 cycles. That would take me roughly to March, after which I‚Äôd need to maintain.\n\nI‚Äôm committed for the long run and happy to sustain treatments as needed, but I‚Äôm conscious of budget (wedding expenses!) and want to avoid overcommitting to something that could snowball in cost.\n\nMy question: Does anyone have tips for streamlining this approach while still getting excellent results? For example, spacing treatments out more, reducing the number of HydraFacials early on, or any other strategies to get some great results. I want to respect my dermatologist‚Äôs advice but adapt it realistically for my schedule and budget.\n\nAny insight or experience would be so appreciated. I‚Äôm ready to start now and build up to great skin by next summer!\n\nThank you!\n",

      "content": "Hello everyone!   \n  \nI started using topical min last year when my hair was in a pretty bad shape. It got so bad so fast. I'm thinking it was a combination of diffuse thinning + stress? So anyway, I hopped on topical min for a year, I feel like it helped a little?   \n  \nUnfortunately I dropped my phone in the sea where I had most of my progress pictures month by month. But yeah, you can see what my hair looked like when I started min in August 2024. And the next picture is from August 2025. It was drastically thicker and more volume overall. But as expected, min did as much as it could and growth stopped at some level.   \n  \nI'm 30 now and always had long hair most of my life, so my goal is to have the hair I had at 25. I gave myself a buzz cut on 1st of August this year and added %0.1 topical fin, 3x / week dermastamps at 0.6mm and keto shampoo.   \n  \nRest of the pictures with short hair are from today, after being on the new regimen for 3 months. I feel like I'm experiencing great increase in volume &amp; baby hair popping up all over.   \n  \nObviously its different hair length but it's shorter, so it must show the scalp even more? \n\nI took the pictures in the same room, at the same spot and time of the day to have the same natural light.   \n  \nIs this regrowth or am I imagining it? What do you guys think? Before anyone asks, I've experienced zero sides so far. at some point in the future I could switch to pills as well. ",

      "title": "What are out thoughts on this?",
      "content": "Curious as to what our thoughts are on this as curlies. Given that dry brushing is verboten, how would we have dealt with our hair back then? And is there something we can learn from the Victorian routine that would help increase our hair health today in general? We all know that washing regularly isn't good for the hair, but it's the detangling part that needs to be done, when wet and with a ton of conditioner.\n\nDiscuss!\n\n----------------------‚Äê----------------\n\nVictorian Hair Care: Why They Washed Less‚Äîand Looked Incredible\n\nFlip through any 19th-century portrait and you‚Äôll spot it immediately: women with thick, mirror-like hair twisted into gravity-defying styles. Waves that fall just so. Shine that almost glows through sepia. The twist? Most of them weren‚Äôt washing their hair very often‚Äîsometimes not for months.\n\nThat choice wasn‚Äôt laziness. It was strategy.\n\nBack then, the soaps on hand were heavy-duty, made with lye‚Äîthe same harsh alkali used to scrub floors and clean wool. Great for grease; terrible for long hair. A single wash could strip away protective oils, leaving hair dry and fragile. For men with cropped cuts, the damage was tolerable; you could trim and start over. For women whose hair often reached the waist or beyond‚Äîand who were expected to keep it for life‚Äîrepeated washing was a recipe for breakage.\n\nSo Victorian women built a different routine.\n\nNightly brushing wasn‚Äôt a romantic myth; it was a rule. About a hundred deliberate strokes with a boar-bristle brush. That brush choice mattered: the slightly rough bristles lifted dust and flakes while sweeping natural scalp oils‚Äîsebum‚Äîdown the entire length of the hair. Instead of shampoo doing the conditioning, biology did. The result was cleaner roots, nourished ends, and a consistent, natural gloss without water or soap.\n\nThe famous volume and architecture of their hairstyles wasn‚Äôt smoke and mirrors either. They used ‚Äúrats‚Äù‚Äîsmall pads made from saved hair combings or soft fibers‚Äîto create lift and fullness. Styles were not only pretty; they were protective. Pinned up, hair was shielded from soot, smoke, weather, and friction, which helped it stay healthier longer.\n\nActual washes were occasional and intentional‚Äîmaybe monthly, sometimes less. On wash day, water had to be heated; rinses might include eggs, beer, herbs, rainwater, or vinegar to soften and add shine. Drying waist-length hair took ages and care, often by the fire or in sunlight, because wet hair is at its weakest. No wonder wash day was an event, not a routine.\n\nPeriod beauty guides treated all this like science. They detailed how to section hair, the angle of the brush, the pace of each stroke, and‚Äîcrucially‚Äîhow to keep the brush clean. In a world where a woman‚Äôs hair was rarely cut and was bound up with ideas of health, status, and respectability, hair care wasn‚Äôt vanity. It was social currency.\n\nSo they brushed. Every night. For years.\n\nIf that sounds surprisingly modern, it is. Today‚Äôs dermatologists often suggest easing up on shampoo frequency, and the ‚Äúno-poo‚Äù crowd argues that over-washing fuels oiliness by stripping the scalp. Victorians got there by observation: you can‚Äôt change the chemistry of your soap, but you can change your habits. They chose a method that worked with natural oils instead of fighting them.\n\nThe Victorian playbook in a nutshell:\n\n Fewer washes with gentler rinses.\n Consistent, thorough brushing with boar bristle to redistribute oil.\n Protective styling to reduce daily wear and environmental damage.\n Patience and ritual over quick fixes.\n\nNot dirt. Not neglect. Just a different kind of wisdom‚Äîone that trusted routine and nature to do what a bottle often can‚Äôt.\n\nTheir hair was their crown‚Äîand they learned how to keep it shining.",

      "content": "Hello everyone! I am 25F and I am worried my current (newish) skin routine is absolutely destroying my skin. I have honestly never struggled with acne or textured skin in my entire life. To be truthful, I‚Äôm honestly blessed with fairly decent skin and never had to any intense routines.\n\nMy previous routine was extremely simple, I only washed my face with CeraVe Foaming Cleanser when I wore makeup and then moisturized with CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion. That‚Äôs it.\n\nI wanted to venture out and see if I could have my skin looking even better, and have my makeup look nicer as well, since I do have pretty dry skin with occasional hormonal breakouts. \n\nMy new routine is:\n1. Mixsoon Bean Oil Cleanser\n2. Mixsoon Centella Cleansing Foam\n3. *Occasionally* Glycolic Acid as toner \n3. Bubble Cosmic Silk Toner\n4. Mixsoon Bean Essence\n\nAm I just overloading my face with product? I‚Äôm not sure whether to think it‚Äôs my skin purging, or it‚Äôs just not reacting right. I have been doing this routine for about a month now and my skin has been continuously breaking out and becoming more textured like bumps and stuff.",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

Huge mistake. \n\nFirst of all, nowhere on the packaging have they mentioned that this is a tinted sunscreen, I went and bought this completely unaware of this. \n\nSecond, once you apply this on your face it will give you the worst white cast you've ever seen, it might put Casper the ghost to shame, it's so hard to blend and it will take you a very long time to get it to settle down. You have to pay attention to areas like your eyebrows and the corner of your lips to make sure this is blended otherwise someone might mistake it for unblended concealer.\n\nAfter probably 20-30 minutes it will start looking somewhat normal on your face. \n\nI would not recommend this to even my worst enemy. \n \n",
