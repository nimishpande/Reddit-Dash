And she prescribed me some gel, creams, acids(BHA if you call that, idk) etc. and that literally helped my skin so much. \n\nPlease visit the dermatologist. Don't experiment with different products if you have acne-prone skin. \n\nI have oily, acne-prone skin. I suffered so much because of experimenting. \n\nYes, there are many scars left still, but i believe on my dermat treatment. It should be clear by next year or so.",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

After a few weeks, I decided to start with 1.25mg of oral fin and 5% topical min in late August. September was a bit of a messy routine due to my father going back and forth to the hospital ICU. Also, I'm adding a derma roller and then switching to a stamp once a week. Kinda surprised with the result just now.

I've been taking biotin supplements to try to get some regrowth. My hair is pretty fine.

Conditioner is aussie 3 minute miracle curls. I use different styling products but in these pics I used some curl cream and some deva curl strong hold gel (watered down into a spray). Air dry. I also have Aussie mousse that I sometimes use. I have a silk pillow case and don't usually refresh the hair much. I am also interested in protective hairstyles I could do on day 2/3. I know putting my hair in a bun/pony tail is probably not good for it.\n\nI've had so many different routines in the past and they always seem to stop working eventually.

Since then my curls couldn’t hold any shape so I always end up straightening them every week in order to look « decent » at work. I started to take care of my curls again mid October and this is the progress I made so far🥰 I feel more and more confident wearing my not-so-perfect curls everyday and looking forward to grow them longer!\n1st pic is my curls today, 2nd pic was two months ago when I stopped straightening my hair and the 3rd one was when they were freshly bleached and straightened.\n\nHere’s my routine:\n- Shampoo and Condition with Arganicare Coconut line\n- I use a coin amount of Lola Cosmetics Dream cream as a leave in conditioner \n- I finish my routine by scrunching my hair,put them up in a cotton t-shirt and let them air-dry. \nI don’t use gel because I hate the crunchiness . In the beginning of this journey I styled my curls with a brush but found out it made my curls lose all their shape so I just detangle with my hands in the shower while I still have conditioner on before rinsing.\nMy routine is nothing crazy but it works for me and I am happy to share it with you guys☺️",

I started on 2.5 mg of dutasteride daily for the first six weeks, and then switched to 0.5 mg. I did this as a loading phase to get to the 0.5 mg serum concentration based on my understanding of its accumulation in the blood and tissues.\n\nI’ve had no side effects other than the elimination of my acne, which I’ve struggled with since my early teenage years. I don’t believe I’ve had a single pimple in over five months, where before I had at least 4 to 5 on my forehead at any time. My hair has come back extremely thick and dense, and even darker than it was before. I always had blonde hair, but now it’s coming in very dark blonde/light brown. Happy to answer any questions.\n\nFirst three are after photos, and second three are before photos. It is in the same order: left temple, right temple, center hairline.",

Sometimes it calms down, but for the most part it’s almost always oily with whiteheads that can be scratched off but leave red marks, bumpy, and shiny. It looks gross, as if I don’t wash my face but I do. It’s not itchy or painful. I’ve tried vanicream face wash, la roche tolerine for oily skin face wash, YTTP kale face wash, and cerave SA cleanser. For moisturizer, I’ve tried Purito oat cream calming gel moisturizer, cookie kind water moisturizer, skin fix water cream, vanicream daily face moisturizer, la roche double repair moisturizer, cetaphil daily moisturizer for all skin types, and no moisturizer at all. Still, nothing helps, and some products have made it worse. My routine is really simple, as it used to be much more extensive, but I feel that my old routine was irritating my skin over all. I’m ashamed to be looked at by even family members. I avoid going out because of it sometimes.",

      "content": "I’ve always had quite problematic skin where I developed keratin plugs under skin, especially on my chin, but it wasn’t too bad.\n\n5 months ago I went through a very stressful situation which led to getting cystic acne almost every single day, which left my face covered in PIE that doesn’t go away. I panicked, I didn’t know what to do so I started Treclin, then read about antiobiotic resitsnace so I stopped, I tried BP 5%, then Azelaic acid (skinoren) for a couple weeks, and lastly Differin starting in September.\n\nI used Differin for a month and used Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume on a wet skin. I woke up one day with irritated face so I decided to take a break and just use Bioderma and that’s it, which didn’t help. I was getting scaly skin snd the cysts were coming, every day. My face was so oily.\n\nThen it got better and I restarted Differin again, used it twice a week for 2 weeks and one day woke up with severely dehydrated tight skin. Differin started to work at minimising the cystic acne, however my skin was extremely dehydrated and oily. I took a one week break where I introduced the Aveeno oat serum and used the LRP toleriane sensitive cream on top. My skin was getting better. I then switched to TO amino acid serum because aveeno was clogging my pores.\n\nAfter a week I decided to use Azelaic acid (Finacea) instead of Differin because I was thinking that because Differin did so well in such a shirt amount of time, the Azelaic acid might be enough, and also help me with the scars that just take ages to clear.\n\nMy skin now has a crawly feeling near nostrils and chin, and I also have bumps on my chin, which I suspect is early PD, it doesn’t itch but I can feel something is wrong. My face is dehydrated again and I’m worried that I won’t be able to treat my acne because I can’t put anything on my skin.\n\nI’m worried to try Accutane because that can flare PD and dry my skin more. I am desperate, I am not sure what I can do!\n\nLeaving my skin alone will just cause the cystic acne to come again…\n\nTL;DR: Developed cystic acne due to stress, tried too many things, ultimately differin and my barrier collapsed. Now I don’t know what to do because I can’t use anything on my face. I probably developed perioral dermatitis because I have small bumps on chin and also sides of bridge of nose, nasolabial folds. Please help!!",

      "content": "Sorry for the creepy picture :,) I would really appreciate some skincare advice.\n\nI‘m 28f a lot of allergies and neurodermitis since childhood (don’t carry symptoms of the latter anymore), I have the typical ashy skin and dark circles under the eyes and everything is always clogged. It gets slightly better when I eat reallllly clean but not significantly enough to make me want to do it.\n\nWhen I work out too much my skin gets worse, sugar and alcohol are obviously also no gos but I don’t consume a lot of either. I‘ve tried countless products, no products, lifestyle changes but nothing seems to help.\n\nWhat feels worst to me is that no matter how healthy a life I live, I look unhealthy in the face and I feel like people treat me accordingly when I‘m not wearing makeup outside. Can anyone with similar medical conditions/skin issues give me tips on how to acquire a healthy looking teint? The only time I look somewhat rosy is in the deepest winter/with the highest fever.\n\nThe acne might increase from sleeping on the side, but I‘m already washing my pillowcase often and use a second encasing for the pillow to uh imprison the mites so I wouldn’t know what else to do.\n\nMy face looks oily in the photos because I applied some face oil I just found in the fridge lol. It’s normally very dry in winter and oily?sweaty! in summer. Usually I use fragrance free face cleanser for atopic skin and neutrogena hydrosomething cream in the evening, just water in the morning before I apply my 50+spf cc cream.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Detangle while conditioning, leave in conditioner, curl cream, Scrunch and finger curling after wash. Diffuse after wash with low heat and low speed.\n\nI just recently started diffusing and using a bonnet. The bonnet seems to have reduced my bed head hair and diffusing has brought some extra volume to my hair. I was messing around with the heat and fan settings but hot and high fan made my hair dry really fast and according to ChatGPT (not the best source ik) low heat and low fan seem to work well for my hair.\n\nI never knew about detangling hair until recently and about curly hair having to have to have this much maintenance so any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nProducts: as I am cowash, Camille rose leave in, ms Jessie’s pillow soft curl creams. Aunt Jackie’s curl custard. I’d like any products recommendations as well because I was using Cantu and Miele before but from what I’ve heard from my friends, they suck since their formula changed. They didn’t do much until I switched to my new products. I’ve heard mixed opinions on shea moisture but I do use one of their scalp conditioner. \n\n(Update I’m currently using as I am leave in and aunt Jackie’s curl custard until they run out. The leave in has coconut and idk if that’s good for my hair type and sometimes it feels weird compared to when I tried out the Camille rose leave in) also I’m using Camille rose shampoo and conditioner for my Monday wash days. I’ve been forgetting to use my bonnet lately but I’m gonna try to remember more from now on, I’ve heard satin pillow cases are good but don’t know where to get. ",
