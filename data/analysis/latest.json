      "content": "I’ve dealt with stubborn breakouts for most of my teens years since 12/13 ish and I tried everything on the surface… cleansers, tret, antibiotics, facials, lasers, all of it. Nothing created lasting change. \nI wanted to share this because I wish someone had told me sooner. So I also could have saved all my savings🥲\n\nMy skin only started changing when I focused on the gut side of things. I didn’t do anything extreme. I just slowly added:\n\n• more balanced fiber each day (a mix of inulin, resistant starch, psyllium, baobab)\n• more water\n• short walks after meals\n• less snacking all day\n• cutting whey and artificial sweeteners\n\nIt took a few weeks, but my skin became calmer, less inflamed, and I stopped getting those deep, angry breakouts. The texture also evened out way more than I expected. And love the feeling on not having to worry about a new pimple everytime I wake up😭😅",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I grew up where it is super dry and moved to a very humid area 5 years ago. I was honestly shocked to find that my hair was actually curly and not just a bit wavy. It's literally been 5 whole years of fighting the humidity, trying to style my hair the way I did growing up, accepting that my hair needs to be treated differently in the humidity, and then doing TONS of trial and error with products and methods and everything. But... I think I may have finally figured it out!\n\nPhoto order:\n\n* Pics 1–2: From about a month ago, feeling absolutely shocked at the curls.\n* Pics 3–4: Years 1 and 3, when I first discovered the curls but was still fighting it.\n* Pics 5–6: Years 4 and 5, embracing the curls stage, but still figuring out the right products and techniques.\n\nI’m still learning, but I finally feel like I’m working with the humidity instead of against it.\n\n(reposting cause I forgot to include my routine, adding below)\n\n# Current Routine\n\n**Wash Day**\n\n* **Shampoo:**\n   * First wash: *Suave Keratin Shampoo*\n   * Second wash: *Kérastase Genesis Shampoo*\n* **Conditioner:** *Kérastase Genesis Conditioner* on ends, fully rinsed\n\n**After Shower (on soaking wet hair)**\n\n* **Leave-In:** *Curlsmith Frizz Control Duo Conditioner* on ends\n* **Heat Protectant:** *Nexxus Heat Defense Spray* throughout\n* **Mousse (at roots):** Currently alternating between:\n   * *John Frieda Frizz Ease Dream Curls Curl Reviver Mousse*\n   * *Curlsmith Invincible Volume Hair Mousse*\n* **Distribution:** Brush products through, part hair, finger-separate large clumps, then scrunch until curls form\n* **Microfiber Towel:** Scrunch to damp using *The Perfect Haircare* towel\n\n**Styling**\n\n* **Gel:** *Curlsmith In-Shower Style Fixer* — applied with praying-hands method, then scrunched\n* **Drying:** Diffuse for a few minutes (mostly scrunch-diffusing up to roots) to set the gel, then air-dry the rest of the way\n\n**Finishing**\n\n* **Hairspray:** *SexyHair Big Spray*, lightly at the roots and around frizzy sections\n* **Break Cast / Soften:** Once fully dry, scrunch out the crunch with *Verb Ghost Oil*\n\n# Refresh Routine\n\nI definitely have NOT figured out a great refresh yet. Right now I just spray my hair damp and scrunch as needed. This re-activates the gel, which can make it crunchy again, so sometimes I use a bit more oil to break the cast.\n\n**Would love refresh tips if anyone has suggestions!**",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI went to the dermatologist today because I wanted to start finasteride. I’ve been using minoxidil for over half a year now with good results. In the Netherlands minoxidil is available without a prescription, but finasteride isn’t.\n\nI intentionally waited to start finasteride because my partner and I had a desire to have children. Now that this is no longer a concern, I figured it was time to finally begin.\n\nHowever, the dermatologist refused to prescribe it. He said that very recent research (&lt;1 year old) showed worrying results regarding male breast cancer as a side effect. According to him, depression was still “manageable” because they could monitor that, but the breast-cancer findings caused him — and apparently the entire medical team in my region — to completely stop prescribing finasteride.\n\nHe also mentioned hearing at a conference about a finasteride topical lotion that includes 15% minoxidil, which he suggested as an alternative. That sounded like overkill to me and honestly made me question his knowledge a bit. He also said there was no difference between dutasteride and finasteride in terms of side effects or their frequency, which added to my doubts.\n\nObviously I assume a doctor should know more than someone like me who gathers info online, but the whole consultation left me feeling like he might not be fully informed on hair loss treatments.\n\nMy question to you all:\nHas anyone heard about this supposed recent study linking finasteride to increased male breast cancer risk? I can’t find anything about it anywhere.\n\nThanks in advance.",

I didn't put the ice pack directly on the skin but put it on my pants (this was on my leg). Now, I'm left with a huge scar that's kinda big and pretty dark. I went to the derm and they said it's an ice pack burn (never heard of it before) and gave me tret. It's been slowly lightening but idk if my scrubbing and putting scar fading creams are making it darker/worse. Do you have any products/routine/habits you recommend if you were in a similar situation? It's so ugly and I want to cry thinking about it bc I don't want to live the rest of my life with this thing.

Has anyone experienced this \"flat red dot\" reaction to Rare Beauty or Merit blushes?\n2. Does this look like contact dermatitis, rosacea, or fungal acne?\n3. Does anyone have any active ingredient step suggestions that could help correct this?\n\nAny advice is appreciated! Thanks",

One other time, I ended up with curls but only 2/3 of my hair fell out that time so I had some length. \n\n1- I do not know how to make these curls do individual and weigh them down. Is that even a thing I can hope for at this point? \n\n2- I am a Special Education Teacher and avoid biting my nails ….. so I’ve started spinning my hair when nervous, especially in the back. I don’t want a mullet and I’m afraid it’s getting there. Is this mullet-y?\n\n3-What type of cut can I ask for to make it even up more…. I’d like to have a curly bob in the beard future…. Maybe that will take a long time since it’s so curly though. \n\n4- I’m teaching elementary now and have to go out for recess. What is the best hat for the winter that will not ruin my curls? \n\n5- is there an elongation method for my hair? Can I twist it at night or something? What would that be called? \n\nRoutine- I wash it every other day with curl enhancing shampoo/conditioner. Daily- I spray it down. I use a leave-in conditioner, then a strong mousse, then use my hands to push the curls up. Next, I use a comb to part it and sometimes a little bit of gel to keep the part longer. \n\nPlease, take note of the images. Some are at the beginning of today’s work day (the bottom dries so fast and frizzes up but the rest doesn’t) and the other is after work. ",

The lighting in my photo isn’t great, but it’s a deeper red in the light rather than the the ashy cool-toned copper I was hoping for (second slide). I was weighing the options between toning it or using a semi-permanent glaze. I think I’m going to go with the glaze at this moment (feel free to sway my opinion). I was hoping someone could recommend a good brand of glaze and if you knew a good color that would help me achieve more of what I was aiming for. \n\nThanks in advance and happy holidays ☺️",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin?

His skin has some dark sun spots due to the nature of his work/job.\n\nFew days ago he used the pilgrim 10% vitamin c serum and he really liked it, says it gave him some kind of result, but personally I'm skeptical about this brand and so got him the deconstruct niacinamide + alpha arbutin serum but we did not see much changes in his skin after using this serum. So I'm confused if I should just get him the pilgrim serum again or any other serums. And any other suggestions or recommendations would also be thankful.\n\nPS: I did got him to use sunscreen everyday now so his skin looks good not completely repaired.",
