I use Bear shampoo and Tresemme Smooth &amp; Shine conditioner. Haven’t oiled my hair in months.\n\nNow I’m starting to think this salty water has been slowly killing my hair. Will this cause hairfall or long-term damage? Is there anything I can do to prevent more damage now?

With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I currently don’t have any, so I’m open to starting from scratch. I could say my skin is not very sensitive but I dont know if it's very strong as well.

In the summer I don’t really have this problem so I am thinking that the colder, dryer temperatures have something to do with this. I don’t want to give up using tret altogether because of its anti-aging benefits (and I do think it helps with my acne) but I’m not sure what to do.

Historically that worked well for me and my hair would dry like in the last 4 photos attached.\n\nHowever, I bleached my hair in 2020 and rebleached to touch up a few times until I let it grow out. I then bleached it again in 2022 and rebleached it a few times until I dyed it back to brown. I haven’t used any heat, bleach or dye since that point but my hair has never been the same. I asked a hairdresser if the bleached could have caused this, but she said it’s been too long since then and my hair should have repaired.\n\nThe first two photos are of my hair recently and my curls are weighed down and lifeless and my hair generally looks like it has less volume and thickness than before, even though my hair has always been thin and fine.\n\nFor context, my hair doesn’t grow longer than what is picture so I have cut my hair only a few times in my life, which I do myself to trim and shape.\n\nI would really appreciate any advice, whether that’s I need to chop it all off and start over or if I need to look at protein treatments. My hair has left me feeling unhappy for quite sometime, so any suggestions are helpful!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "Im writing this is desperation.\n\nI had problem skin for a while, nothing CRAZY major but outside of my norm. June 2025 i got SICK of it and quit skincare cold turkey, I feel like my skin needed a reset for a while (also i was just upset lol)\n\nA month-ish ago i had a red dry spots on my face recently (which I assumed were dry spots) so I started using this Geek &amp; gorgeous hydration station moisturizer 2 weeks ago, at first i started using it solo to see if im sensitive to one of the ingredients, but ive noticed i am getting VERY oily mid-day the day after I apply it. (the red spots were gone btw)\n\nAlso started using it with a cleanser a few days ago and same thing. \n\nApart from the oily film, i am getting a few CC's on my chin.\n\nI live in a humid place, the humidity never drops below 60% and it can rise up to like 85% every evening...\n\nI dont believe this moisturizer is the sole culprit but it really doesnt make it better, worse actually.\n\nI dont get why since this is a light gel-cream moisturizer, not a heavy cream. \n\nI maybe spit-balling here but i did read that this moisturizer is very humectant heavy, does it correlate to my problem and the humidity maybe? [Check out the ingredient list here](https://incidecoder.com/products/geek-gorgeous-hydration-station).\n\nNormally i have pretty alright skin, not too dry but not too oily, sensitive at most, I get pimples every now and again. Before I started using this moisturizer I did get a little oily but not NEARLY as bad.\n\nPeople who live in a hot and humid climate, do you even use moisturizer? what do you use? I really wanna quit it again cuz whats the point using something if it sucks haha \n\nI would REALLY appreciate the help &lt;3",

I’ve had acne breakouts since I was around 14, and I still deal with the scars and marks they left behind especially on my back, chest, and arms.\nMy main concern now is the uneven tone and texture of my skin from these old acne scars and pigmentation spots. I’m also getting married soon, so I’d really love to even out my skin and get it looking clearer, smoother, and more radiant before my wedding day.\nWhat can I do at home as i can't afford to get it sorted professionally to help fade these acne scars and hyperpigmentation?
