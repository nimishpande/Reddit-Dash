But with my new routine it comes out bangin’ everytime!\n\nMy Routine:\n\nShampoo and condition with prose custom hair care. Brush through conditioner with tangle teaser comb. Apply prose curl cream on wet hair. I use the “define” bounce curl brush (absolute game changer) to style in sections. Using prayer hands method I apply gel after styling each section. I use the ouidad heat and humidity gel but I also liked the one I got from prose. Scrunch everything together and plop in a microfiber towel. Allow to dry - air drying is best but I also diffuse if I need it to dry quicker. Then scrunch out the crunch with an oil if I have time. I’m using the olaplex bonding oil. \n\nOverall, I think the bounce curl brush and mastering a gel cast have made the biggest difference. I’m slowly figuring out how to get my curls to last multiple days but I’m still looking for tips! I’m putting my hair in a pineapple overnight and using silk pillowcases. I have a bonnet but I kind of hate doing it lol. ",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Some background: I'm a 30-something-year-old woman who has been battling acne since I was 14. It got so bad that even after spending 3 hours a day trying to get my makeup to cover it, many days I still felt like I couldn't leave the house. It was awful. I felt like I couldn't say yes to anything unless I had a way to do my makeup before anyone could see me. Camping with friends was out of the question--that was something I used to love. Going on an early mountain bike ride with friends? Sure, but I'd make sure to wake up 4 hours before so I could put my makeup mask on first. Sometimes that meant dragging myself out of bed at 2 or 3 am. I would even do this horrible 3-hour makeup routine if I knew I had to do something as simple as sign for a package that day. It was exhausting. I tried so many things in an effort to fix it--salicylic acid, going for months without wearing any makeup, changing my pillow case every night, eating gluten-free, dairy-free, keto, paleo, AIP, you name it. Nothing helped. Finally I stumbled upon a couple of Reddit posts whose authors were talking about how spearmint tea cured their acne. I thought to myself, what do I have to lose? I like mint tea... I'll try it for a few months and see if it helps. I emptied 2 tea bags into 16 oz of boiling water, let it cool, and drank it every day for the last 3 months. It took about 2 months for me to see a difference, but now I am 99% acne free and have been for a whole month! I have never gone that long without a horrible breakout in all the years I've been suffering with acne. I'll still get a tiny whitehead every now and then, but I never get any of the deep and painful cysts that I used to get all the time anymore. I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to all of the Redditors who inspired me to try this tea!! Finally, I am free!",

I love the ziziphus mask, and whenever I see my curls looking messy, I immediately make it. First, my scalp gets cleaned and it removes dan- druff and fun-gi from the hair and scalp. I have sebo-derm, and I feel like it soothes my scalp and reduce the problems. I'd be lying if I said it gets rid of it 100%. It does calm it down and might remove it, but it eventually comes back. I use it once every two weeks❤️\n\nRoutine: I washed my hair with water only then I mix 6tbsp of Ziziphus, 3tbsp Amla powder ,4tbsp Aloe Vera powder, brahmi powder 5tbsp, Bhrjintaj 5tbsp, 4tbsp of Shikakai powder I mixed all these with hibiscus tea. I waited 30m till I saw ziziphus bubbles spread everywhere. U should leave it 30m so the ziziphus becomes more effective 👍🏻. I put 2 drops of Indonesian Cajeput essential oil, after 30m I put the mask on my wet hair then I cover my hair very well and leave it for 15m then I washed it only with co wash I used the co wash 3 times to make sure my hair is clean and no ziziphus stuck in my hair.\n\n\nStyling products: Inhasi leave in spray frangece free, Lola From Rio gel, brush with bounce curl volume brush and diffuse with Dyson Nural. \nHave u ever tried a ziziphus in ur hair or face?

There’s a lot of products out there right now that promises to do this and that - the majority seems to be aimed at a younger demographic, with very few anti-aging, age-defying lines. Stripped of marketing, 1) does older hair need its own formulation 2) can or has it been done? ",

I feel like my result is way brighter and more “fiery” than what I wanted, and I don’t think it suits me at all. I feel like a hot cheeto 😭😭. My stylist did mention it would fade, but I’m panicking because I don’t think it’ll fade dark enough to match the inspo.\n\nPart of me wants to abandon ship lol and go back to the salon to ask for something like pic 5, but I really don’t want to bleach or lighten my hair any more.\n\nDo you guys think this red will fade down to something close to the inspo pics within a week? And if not, is it possible to get from where I am now to picture #5 without bleaching again? Thank you for your help! ",

(products that’s go together, skin cycling, things like this as well)\n\nI just want to open an App, go to the proper day, and go thru a checklist created using all my products, devices, routines.

I usually use tsubaki hair shampoo and conditioner (I made sure the one I use doesn’t have keratin) Skala cream and then hairspray because I don’t have much options here in Japan and I use a diffuser with my hair everyday because it’s easier to dry and Japan’s climate is a bit difficult to deal with (humid in the summer and currently very dry in the winter) \n\nI plan on getting a routine hair cut soon and there’s two treatment plans offered that I’m debating to do at all because my hair is kinda heat damaged from the few times I’ve straightened it recently (my fault because I haven’t bought a protectant yet) and I wanna do the treatment to revitalize my hair. The first one offered is Olaplex from No. 1 to 7 and the other one is this non protein Japanese exclusive called Aujua five step treatment. Both are said to help with damaged hair but my hair is virgin and the only damage I have is from heat. \n\nI’d like some advice on what to do, whether to get the treatment done or something else I could do to repair my hair. I don’t know how to ask for advice from a hair stylist here in Japan so I decided here could be the best place. ",

      "content": "My boyfriend’s on his self-improvement journey and that includes finding a good routine for his hair. I’m planning to gift him some products for his birthday to experiment as well as just help him out in general.\n\nSo far my research says that his hair is 2C to 3A, but please let me know if I’m wrong.\n\nHis routine is pretty basic, just double shampoo (Nizoral &gt; L’Oreal Hyaluron Plump Shampoo) and conditioner (Tsubaki Premium Moist &amp; Repair Conditioner).\n\nHe washes his hair normally, doesn’t scrunch or anything. He blow-dries his hair directly, no products after. He uses a fine comb (claims that it looks better when it’s “straighter”).\n\nHe’s trying to grow it out right now to see his options (he likes the look of flows). The photo attached is his hair with no products on, after combing.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. What styling products are best for his hair type (for both a straighter look and a curlier look)?\n\n2. What does the quality of his hair look like so far? Is it dry or damaged, or is it just not living to its full potential yet?\n\n3. Any haircut suggestions for this type of hair? And should he keep growing it out?\n\nAny suggestions are greatly appreciated. (Please don’t be mean)",

Then Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion. I’ve also used medicine mud mask before but even that doesn’t get rid of the black dots on my nose completely. I’ve also tried Paula’s choice BHA and that didn’t work either. Any advice is appreciated 😭",
