      "content": "We got back from a family holiday and I was shocked by some family photos where the camera made me look like my grandpa. I knew I was thinning but was unaware it was that bad. \n\nI had already been lurking here for awhile and made a doctor’s appointment for a finasteride prescription shortly after our trip. \n\nI started 1mg fin and topical rogaine 2x/day last January. \n\nOver the first month, I had no side effects, even a boost in sexual desire. \n\nAfter month two I started noticing sexual side effects. I thought it may be transient so I stayed the course. \n\nEventually, after month 3 I cut my finasteride dosage in half. My hair regrowth continued and my sexual performance improved, but it still hasn’t been perfect. \n\nWhat I have also noticed over this period is my desire continues to be there, but my need to masturbate has gone way down.\n\nThroughout the year, hair growth continued steadily, but there was a period where sexual performance went down again. \n\nSince then I’ve cut my finasteride dosage to half a 1mg tablet every other day… and for now that’s working. \n\nI’ve also had some scalp irritation using Rogaine, currently I only use it once a day at most, and definitely skip one or multiple days in a row. \n\nOverall, I’m glad I’ve started. I’ve regained confidence around my hair and will continue the treatment moving forward. ",

      "content": "I fell in love with the Bounce Curl Brush when I purchased it for the almost perfect ringlets it gave me. But over the maybe 3yrs I've been using it, my hair has not grown an inch.\n\nI don't like the hair typing system, but just for reference:\nI have around 3c-4a hair.\nMedium density\nMedium porosity\nMedium strand thickness, although I've found some thicker strands &amp; some thin strands of hair in my head.\nMy hair is all Virgin, no dye or bleach. (Pictures I post with hair color is hair wax, which is an product overlay, not a dye)\n\nWhen I use the brush, I make sure my hair is FULLY DETANGLED with a wide tooth comb &amp; Tangle Teaser before styling with it. I'm positive it's not user error that there's lots of hair stuck on the brush &amp; that my ends are splitting. I find myself having to trim more often than most because my hair starts feeling rough.\n\nI only straighten my hair approximately 1-2xs a year in the Winter because I live in the South. I straightened my hair for my birthday in January &amp; decided since it was straightened, it would be easier to see any damage. I used the search &amp; destroy method to go through as many sections of hair as possible &amp; snip off damage. The amount of single strand knots, split ends, breakage &amp; even keyhole splits I had in my hair was insane.\n\nKeyhole splits in particular, I read, are mostly caused by mechanical damage, i.e. brush styling, high tension, pulling &amp; playing in your hair too much, etc. I'm almost certain most of this damage &amp; the breakage is coming from the Bounce Curl Brush &amp; I'm going to stop using it to see if this is the cause of the breakage. \n\nRoutine &amp; Products:\n\n1) Pre-wash detangle using a wide tooth comb on damp hair &amp; a light leave-in conditioner to provide slip.\n2) Shampoo with Tresemmé Rich Moisture. Clarify 1x a month or as needed with Paul Mitchell's Shampoo 2.\n3) Condition with the Tresemmé Rich Moisture &amp; on Clarify Shampoo days, I use Ouidad's Coil Infusion Triple Threat Deep Conditioner. \n3) On wet hair, I apply Camille Rose's Curl Love Moisture Milk as a leave-in in sections using my fingers.\n3) I section my hair and apply Camille Rose's Spiked Honey Mousse with my fingers. Then I take smaller sections that I want to style, make sure it's fully detangled with a pass through with a Tangle Teaser, then do one pass with the Bounce Curl Brush, using the tension &amp; tilt the brush into the divots as it's supposed to be used.\n4) I scrunch in a little bit of the Ouidad Curl Quencher Gel on styled sections (I didn't care for this too much but I'm trying to get rid of it lol).\n5) Hover-Diffuse blow dry my hair for about 20-30mins. Let the rest air dry.\n6) Scrunch out the crunch &amp; separate curl clumps with Mise En Scene Perfect Serum.\n\nFor bed, I pineapple with a scarf &amp; put on a bonnet.\nIn the mornings, I let my hair get some steam in the shower, take off the bonnet, shake, use a little serum, finger coil a few wonky strands if needed. I wash 1x a week.\n\nTL;DR: I feel like the Bounce Curl Brush's high tension styling causes breakage &amp; other forms of mechanical damage.\n\nWanted to know if anyone else felt the same way!",

As explained below, I struggle with my texture, so any suggestion/advice/opinion would help (haircut, products, knowledge...) I feel like my hair is a weakness, and I want to change that 😉\n-----\n\nSo, I cut and style hair for friends and family all the time, but I never figured out my own 😅. Every time I come close, the texture changes…\n\nFor most of my life, I had wavy hair. But the older I get, the curlier it becomes, and recently the change has been particularly noticeable. I’m actually excited about it — I love textured hair — but I’m completely lost right now.\n\n**About my hair:**\n\n• I think I have low density, coarse hair\n\n• I have a large, square forehead, which makes it hard to get a full-looking fringe. \n\n• My front section grows in the opposite direction -- *when I get a buzz cut there's a clear V-shape above my hairline where the hair changes direction*\n\nBecause of this, my hair naturally wants to stand up on top of my head, and I have to get it wet every morning to lay it back down. \n\nAs a teenager, when my hair was straighter, I would wake up looking like Syndrome from The Incredibles (included last picture just for fun😂).\n\nNow that it’s more curly, some days it’s giving Bob Dylan, some days Edward Scissorhands… and very rarely, it’ll look acceptable and I won’t touch it (picture 1 and 2 was one of those days.) *Still very messy, and the fringe is looking boneless 😬.*\n\n**Routine/Styling:**\n\nI’ve been meaning to grow my hair out a little — I think it would balance out my strong bone structure in a nice way — but every time it gets longer, I struggle. So for now, I just keep it short and style it like when it was straighter.\n\n• I wash it about 3 times a week\n\n• I use a mask. *currently, no conditioner*\n\n• When it’s wet, I lay it down and arrange it so it air dries nicely. For hold I either use matte paste when wet, or iI'll use powder later when it's dry. *At this point, it looks very flat and thin (picture 3,4 and 5)*\n\n• Once it’s dry, I rearrange it — with or without powder on my fingers (separate the strands, lift up the roots, etc.) *I add hairspray on windy days.*\n\n*I have no specific sleeping routine and I just refresh with water without adding products.* (Styled hair on picture 6,7 and 8)\n\nIt works for now, but I don’t actually love this flat hairstyle on me — somedays I feel like a playmobile and honestly, styling my hair is the worst part of my mornings…\n\nIn the past, I did try defining the curls with leave-ins or gel (although it’s been over a year, so it might look different now with tighter curls?) and it would always look weighed down and boneless, with my scalp showing — even with the smallest amount of product. Maybe my hair is just too thin to be in clumps 🤷🏻‍♂️.\n\n**Product list :**\n\nShampoo - Pantene (volume line)\n\nMask - Garnier Fructis (currently, the banana superfood one)\n\nMatte paste - Taft (molding styling clay)\n\nStyling powder and hairspray - Taft (volume line)\n\n-----\n\nOkay, that was all the important details, I think.\n\nSo basically, my goal is to get a longer, more free/natural-looking hairstyle, that compliments my texture. I would like to retain volume without losing coverage on my forehead. And if it could be low maintenance too, at least in the morning, that would be life-changing 😩.\n\nThanks for reading!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

For the longest time, I used the Beauty of Joseon sunscreen. However, recently it has started to peel/pill specifically around my eyes. Nothing else in my routine has changed.\n\nThis is what I look for in my sunscreen \n 1. Works well under makeup (I only wear concealer under my eyes and light blush)\n 2.  High \"glow\" factor/dewy finish.\n 3. Budget-friendly.\n 4. Doesn't irritate or peel \n\nAfter going looking at some recommendations online, I’ve narrowed it down to these four, but I’d love to hear your experiences with them:\n 1.

      "content": "I trusted a licensed doctor and a reputable aesthetic clinic in the Philippines and ended up worse off, both financially and medically. I am posting this to warn others before they make the same mistake.\n\nDr. Alexis Divinagracia is an ENT surgeon who runs Clinica Divinagracia in Mandaue, Cebu. She brands herself as a specialist, but I am extremely disappointed with the results of the acne surgery (extractions). She pushed a multi-session package and charged me ₱6,000 per session, which is a high premium for this type of beauty service, but the quality was poor.\n\nI was very patient and followed her recommended skin care protocol, completing three full sessions over the course of nearly three months. Dr. Divinagracia told me that a series was necessary for clinical results, so I stayed committed and strictly followed all her post-procedure aftercare instructions. Unfortunately, my skin is now in worse condition than when I started.\n\nWithin 48 hours of every single session, my skin flared up with painful, inflamed breakouts in the exact areas that were extracted. I waited well past the healing window of the final session to judge fairly, but the results were consistently bad, leaving me with deep inflammation and dark marks (PIH) that were not there before.\nDr. Divinagracia seems to have many certificates on her wall rather than actual experience. She pushed a three-session package on me for a total of ₱18,000. At this price point, you expect medical-grade precision, not aggressive extractions that damage the skin barrier.\n\nTo be fair, the Clinica Divinagracia environment is very clean. However, being clean does not fix poor results or a lack of skill. If you are looking for actual skin care results and value for your money, I would suggest other beauty clinics.\n\nFor visibility and to help other victims find this post, I am quoting how the clinic markets itself. Based on my experience, these claims are false and were used to extract money while causing real harm to my skin.\n\n\"As an aesthetic clinic with both surgical and nonsurgical treatments, Clinica Divinagracia offers the latest innovations in medical and surgical aesthetics locally and abroad.

I then thought it looked too stringy so I put some more mousse in my hairs and scrunched the mousse into the ends. I then diffused for about 30 mins.

      "content": "Photo after my first ever proper curly routine where I brushed sections and diffused! This is day 3 hair btw!! I have low porosity, thick hair, coarse hair. \n\nSo my hair has looked pretty dead for a while. I got a curly haircut 2 years ago. It looked amazing for a rlly long time but since I haven’t cut my ends, I have broken/split/damaged/dead strands throughout my hair, not just ends. I was gonna get a haircut from that place again but they’ve upped their prices since then and my partner thought I should invest in products instead. \n\nFor the last year the only products I used were the kinky curly cleansing shampoo, shea moisture curl and shine conditioner and curl enhancing smoothie, and a wide tooth comb. I’d only ever air dry my hair. It’s not like my hair look terrible but it looked damaged. \n\nSo I got a detangling brush, a bootleg bounce curl brush, hair dryer with a diffuser, and the fenty curl cream to replace the shea (all cheaper than the haircut somehow). The difference between the creams is massive. \n\nMy routine for this wash was, adding an egg, some olive oil and honey to the shea moisture conditioner and brushing that in and leaving it in with a plastic bag for 30 minutes. Then I used my usual shampoo and conditioner after, and then sparingly used the fenty curl cream, brushing it through sections. I diffused with no heat (10-15 seconds of heat for the rlly wet sections). My hair has never looked so defined, especially for this many days. I also slept with my hair pushed over my head (no hair tie or bonnet). I smell like a grandma which I honestly love but I don’t wanna make a concoction every time I wash my hair, and I can tell the conditioner without the stuff i add makes my hair feel worse. \n\nWhat products (deep or regular conditioner) would you recommend as a replacement? NEEDS to be available in Canada and not overpriced. My options are Amazon or Sephora. I’m considering Pattern/Fenty/Curlsmith (whichever is cheaper honestly) but idk which exact product will be right for me. I’d appreciate advice from people with similar hair!! I’d also like to know if I’m missing anything in my routine? (the cream acts as a slight gel as well, so maybe mousse or oil but it doesn’t feel as urgent)",

I can now say my breakouts are pretty minimal and my skin isn’t as oily but every single pore on my face is clogged with sebaceous filaments, my pores are very large, and I do have a few acne scars all over my face. \n\nI have been going back and forth about doing a chemical peels or microneedling and after talking with my esthetician we have decided that chemical peels would be best to do first. The chemical peel we are doing is called the Perfect Derma peel. \n\nI was wondering if anyone has done this peel with acne prone skin and how your results were? Also any tips for getting through the week of the shedding would be greatly appreciated! I know that picking and pulling are big No Nos so I am planning on getting some manicure scissors and alcohol in a spray bottle but that’s really all I know of what I need to get so any help would be greatly appreciated!

      "content": "I recently found out that DevaCurl has a lawsuit against them related to increased fall out (I’m late to the game I know), I have been using their products for \\~12 years and always struggled with this, but never attributed it to them. I loved the way my hair looked using their stuff but the amount of fall out I had was concerning. I got rid of all those products and heard good reviews about the Kerastase Genesis Serum as a treatment, so I bought it, but despise using it because it makes my hair feel filthy.\n\nI prefer the way my hair looks in the summer/high humidity and struggle to style it in the winter because it looks so flat. I like my style to be somewhere between defined and voluminous, leaning more towards frizzy/messy. With all of the new products I've purchased, I am not liking the way my hair looks at all and I'm pretty sure it’s in moisture overload.\n\nI added 3 pictures to this post: 1st is my hair now, 2nd is using DevaCurl products but it was winter so it was flatter and it was right after I got a glaze to try to tone out the color, 3rd is using DevaCurl in the summer/humid weather. I would love some advice about how I can improve my hair (other than getting a haircut), what I can do about my permanent middle part, and how I can incorporate some more protein based products into my routine/product recommendations. All of my products and style routine steps are listed below!\n\nHair info:\n\n\\- Growing out color because of damage to my curl pattern (even though I prefer the way it looks with color)\n\n\\- Definitely need to get a haircut to add some layers and remove weight\n\n\\- My hair grows in straighter at the root and curls up a little ways down\n\n\\- My middle part is permanently engrained in my head\n\n\\- I have low-medium porosity hair with good elasticity\n\n\\- I think my curl pattern is between 2C &amp; 3A (I don’t really know) with the hair at the nape of my neck being much curlier than the top because it has never been colored\n\nProducts:\n\n\\- Living Proof Perfect Hair Day shampoo\n\n\\- Ouai Medium Hair conditioner\n\n\\- Rizo’s Curls Curl Defining Cream\n\n\\- Ouai Curl Creme\n\n\\- Curlsmith Hydro Style Flexi Jelly\n\n\\- Verb Ghost Oil\n\nStyle routine:\n\n\\- Wash 1x/week\n\n\\- Double shampoo (1st wash with a scalp brush, 2nd with just my fingers)\n\n\\- Apply conditioner and detangle (avoid conditioner on my roots)\n\n\\- Wrap hair with a microfiber towel so its not dripping wet\n\n\\- Re-wet face framing pieces with water\n\n\\- I mix whichever curl cream I feel like using with my gel in my hands and apply it from the ends to mid-shafts\n\n\\- Style with the Bounce Curl brush\n\n\\- Apply more gel all over my hair and scrunch\n\n\\- Diffuse dry\n\n\\- Scrunch in oil to break up gel cast\n\n\\- Sleep with a pineapple ponytail ",

The second picture is the result of her toning my hair, I immediately said it was way to dark and didn’t like it so she told me to come back and remove the toner so it’s within the 24hr window. Unfortunately the 3rd picture is what it looks like now even after a toner removal. This is still so dark and I do not like the color. Can anyone please give me advice?
