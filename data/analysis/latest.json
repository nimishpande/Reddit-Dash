I found this routine on tiktok, usually they don't go well but this one made me feel so great about my hair. I did use a hair mask on this specific day, it was Camille Rose cocoa and mango butter mask.\n\nI then sectioned my hair into 3 sections, went through the first section with a small amount of curl cream, then with the bounce Curl brush, I applied mousse after and then gel (still in that first section) after I did that , I proceeded to dry that section.\n\nAfter the first section I rinsed and repeated the above for the next section, and then once again repeated for the last top section. I found it cut down on drying time because the sections were smaller. Maybe each section took no more than 5 minutes to dry. Also easier on the neck and able to achieve volume easier. It sounds like a lot but I promise it was easier than plopping you head over for an eternity.\n\nThis will be my permanent routine as long as it continues to do me right. I am pretty excited. \n\nI wash my hair twice a week only. Rest of the time I just let her do her thing. If it looks too bad then I will put her up, but I find",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "This is a cautionary tale.\n\n  \nI have skin of steel. I never react to anything, ever. Salicylic acid, physical exfoliants, vitamin C, retinoids, going straight to bed with seven layers of sunscreen and bug spray on my face because I'm too lazy to wash my face: nothing.\n\n  \nRegular routine: salicylic cleanser rubbed into face with a washcloth followed with face lotion with added SPF in the morning. Salicylic cleanser alternating with vitamin c exfoliant followed by a hydrating gel in the evening, except one night a week where I do salicylic cleanser followed by retinol cream and hydrating gel.\n\n  \nI recently decided to simplify my routine and swap the salicylic and vitamin c cleansers with a single, all purpose gentle cleanser. I've also been trying to save money and wanted a product that I could pick up any any old drugstore so I wouldn't have to deal with shipping or stock-outs with buying specialty products online. Did some googling, found a gentle cleanser within the brand I've been using with reviews talking about how gentle it is and how it's perfect for people with sensitive skin and did I mention it is really gentle?\n\n  \nEnter Niacinamide.\n\n  \nAccording to Google and Tik Tok and seemingly every beauty article under the sun, this spiteful little devil of an ingredient is anti-inflammatory, strengthens your skin barrier, improves your skin's appearance, and all the while it is super gentle and perfect for people who have sensitive skin or skin conditions. I do not have sensitive skin, I have never spot tested new products, and I definitely wasn't going to do so for a product that was marketed for sensitive skin. That would be silly.\n\n  \nI used the new cleanser four times. First skin was itchy, then itchier, then hot, then feeling and looking like an angry sunburn by the fourth time. Did a quick comparison of the ingredients with every other product I've ever used in my life (many) and lo and behold this is the first time niacinamide has ever touched my face. An itchy arm after a belated spot test confirmed my suspicions. It's been five days, my face is still painfully burnt and in a cruel twist is now reacting to everything, including plain water.\n\n  \nCurrent routine: morning and night, splash cool water on face, slather on the Vaseline until I shine like a diamond and feel like a greased pig, wallow in self-pity.\n\n  \nMoral of the story: ALWAYS SPOT TEST NEW PRODUCTS, no matter how impervious your skin might appear to be. And listen to your skin when it's telling you it's upset.",

      "content": "Hey all, \n\nSearched around this subreddit and online and couldn't find any good examples of this happening with oral minoxidil, but has anybody else gotten facial Pili Multigemini (compound hair growth) from oral minoxidil? I have relatively thick facial hair, and started oral minoxidil roughly a year ago at 2.5mg, once a day.  I haven't noticed these elsewhere on my body, just on my face. \n\n\n\nI used to get these compound hairs once every couple of months, but now I've been finding them after shaving 1-3x per week. They almost always end up becoming ingrown hairs/turning into zits if I don't pluck them, and I've been shaving with a Norelco OneBlade which generally doesn't leave any ingrown hairs/irritate my skin at all. I wash my face with a silicone scrubber in the shower (helps exfoliation), apply moisturizer 1x per day. At night I wash my face and apply 0.5% tretinoin cream 2-3x weekly. I've had this skincare routine for years, so nothing's really changed on that front. \n\n\n\nThese aren't particularly bad or anything, but I'm wondering if anybody has any advice on how to deal with them, or if they've also experienced dealing with these. Overall oral minox has been pretty good for me, I tried finasteride a few years ago, had some bad side effects, but aside from extra body hair/ear hair and these, no negative side effects on minoxidil. \n\n\n\n(Photo taken from elsewhere on Reddit, I never seem to remember to take a photo of these whenever I pull them).

For context, I've been buying from Myntra for many years and even part of their Insiders program.\n\n  \nMy pre-paid order from Myntra was supposed to be delivered 2 weeks ago. They initially sent me a wrong product. To my surprise, their app had no option to return it so I had to fight with the customer executive to raise an exchange request (which is already hard to reach because of their dumb chatbot).\n\n\n\nThey sent me the same wrong product again a week later. Now they're saying the product doesn't have a return policy so they can't process any refund, nor are they responding to any requests for a return.\n\n  \nI ultimately had no choice but to complaint to Consumer Helpline but the Myntra team immediately lied there as well and closed the ticket saying they already did the exchange. What's the point of an exchange if you're just going to send something useless again?\n\n  \nI understand this could be a scam from the seller itself that keeps sending users the wrong product but I'm extremely disappointed at how Myntra chooses to handle such requests and further refuse to refund any money or take back the wrong product I haven't even opened.\n\n  \nPlease be cautious when spending big amounts on Myntra. I'm glad it was approx Rs. 500 order I can forget as a reminder to never use Myntra again but if it was a big amount I'd have been mentally exhausted with how useless their customer support is.",
