Not sure if this is a reliable indicator of my actual hair porosity.\nThe area I live in has what is considered very soft water so i have not worried about it affecting my hair.\n\nI have tried no shampoo routines and curly friendly routines but my hair just always seems to look like the picture below. Lots of frizz and no definition.\n\nI have not used any heat or chemical treatments on my hair but i have started noticing that some parts of my hair that used to be tight ringlets have gone completely straight and limp (cant see it in the photo, thet are hiding at the bottom) and this has gotten me worried that the rest of my hair is set to follow.\n\nAny suggestions on how to fix my frizz and strange straight limp strands will be appreciated!\n\n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

No white cast \nBut one thing is noticed is after 30-45 mins of applying this makes my skin super dull, so much dull that my friends asked didn't I wash my face in the morning :( \nIn terms of tan protection I would give this 6.5/10. I did experience slight tanning after applying this (But not more than reequil matte sunscreen, coming to that in a bit) but this made my skin dull so I am using this as a body sunscreen now \n\n\n2) Isntree hyaluronic sunscreen \nThis has been my biggest regret :( \nThe finish is super oily and greasy (It's muchh more than dewy) It literally feels like I dipped my face in grease bucket. Although it didn't make my face dull, but it did make my face super oilyyy \nIn terms of tan protection I would give this 9/10. Did not experience tanning after applying this, but this did make my face look more of a \"Sweaty\" apperance.\n\n\n3) Reequil matte sunscreen - \nOkay this is exactly where I'm confused, the sunscreen itself is pretty neat. It gives that velvety kinda finish to my face. It surely blurs out all the open pores. It definitely gives a white cast, which eventually settles down after 15-20 mins. The white cast kinda gives a glow to my face lol. Overall after 1 week of usage I thought I found my HG sunscreen but here's the thing. \nIn terms of tan protection I would give this 0/10. Initially when I applied it gave me a glow on my face I thought it would definitely protect me from tanning too, but this is where I was sooo wrong, THIS gave me the WORST tanning ever. After 1 week of usage I noticed my skin got soo much tanned :( \nNow for getting rid of that tan I need a lot of time :(\nIt's a shame because this sunscreen was soo good for my oily skin, I loved the finish that it gave me. But sadly gonna throw this one out :( \n\n\nNow I need some recommendations from you guys for my next sunscreen \n\nUV doux - Heard the finish is similar to reequil matte, but please tell me how's the protection of that sunscreen \nLoreal invisible resist sunscreen - Heard a lot about this sunscreen, how's the overall finish and protection?\nRecommend something that has a matte finish and good tan protection.

      "content": "Until ~3 years ago I never had acne. Not in my teens, not in early adulthood. I washed my face with water, used nothing, and my skin was fine.\n\nAround 24, after some recommendations, I started using skincare products (cleansers, moisturizers, SPF, later “acne treatments”). Around the same time residency stress kicked in. That’s when acne started — mostly forehead / hairline, inflammatory but not severe.\n\nOver the past years I’ve tried everything:\ndifferent cleansers, moisturizers, SPF, azelaic acid, retinoids (including Aklief), simplified routines, “barrier repair”, diets, supplements, stress management. Nothing truly worked long-term. At best it fluctuated, at worst it got more persistent. Treatments never gave clear control — sometimes they even seemed to maintain the problem.\n\nWhat I’ve noticed looking back:\nwhenever my routine was chaotic or minimal (especially summers, fewer products), my skin was calmer. The more “correct” and consistent the routine became, the more constant the breakouts felt.\n\nI’ve recently stopped all actives, and now I’m doing a proper zero-therapy trial: washing only with water, no products, no treatments, nothing — just to see my real baseline again.\n\nI know this won’t magically cure everything, but at this point I want clarity more than constant intervention. If my skin was fine for years without products, I want to see what happens when I truly leave it alone again.\n\nNot looking for miracle advice — just sharing my experience and seeing if anyone else with late-onset, treatment-resistant acne has noticed something similar.\n",

      "content": "**The first pic up there is a before / after of the same thigh, but honestly it's hard to tell if anything is changing, or if it's remaining the same.**\n\nI've had these scars mainly on my upper legs for the past 3 years due to a bad waxing incident. I've waxed a few times after, until my derm told me that I should use laser since they shouldn't wax repeatedly / retraumatize the skin there.\n\n**I tried the following in the past 3 years:**\n\n\\*AmLactin (no change)\n\n\\*Vitamin C (no change)\n\n\\* Salicylic acid (increased presence of red bumps when used as a body wash)\n\n\\* Aloe gel (no change)\n\n\\* Laser hair removal (unsure yet, went through 3 sessions so far, spaced 6-8 weeks apart, started in September, with my most recent session being in late November)\n\n\\* Foliculitis cream (recommended by derm; did nothing)\n\n**I'm currently doing the following (1.5 months roughly):**\n\n\\* Medspa salicylic acid pads (every morning)\n\n\\* Aloe gel application (some mornings after salycylic acid pads)\n\n\\* Glycolic acid body wash from Ordinary (every night in shower)\n\n\\* Polyester exfoliation glove from CVS (every other night in shower)\n\n\\* Pat-dry of thighs after shower (every night)\n\n\\* Gold bond retinol age renewal cream (every night)\n\nToday, an ingrown hair came out and left this bright red bump as I was exfoliating (third picture). Could something deeper be wrong with my skin? I feel like new bumps pop up randomly sometimes and may be making my skin worse, but it's hard to tell. \n\nI'm not sure if there is something I can do, or if I may be stuck with these for the rest of my life. Any tips are appreciated, thank you!",

I have massive ugly cheeks that runs in my dad's family but mine are very bad, and my long sides helps hide how deep my head is from my side profile and helps hide my side profile as its very fucking ugly. Also dont say grow a beard, the only beard I can grow is a neck beard, If I go bald life is totally over for me its suicide women my age hate me as of now, imagine if I went bald. Ive been trying to get into a relationship for two years now and not even a date has occurred.\n\nI think my hair is just very dehydrated (hopefully) i need to learn how to treat long hair as ive always wanted long hair since I was a child but my parents always shamed me for it and forced me to have short hair all my life.",

I’ve watched some tutorials and I’m able to get my hair into a pretty secure French twist with it, but it pulls way too tight on my hair and hurts my head. It’s ridiculously secure when I do it but it’s just way too tight. I’ve tried not twisting my hair as tightly but then it just falls out. Does it make a difference if you use the pin horizontally or vertically? I can’t figure out how to make it comfortable but I’ve been dying for claw clip alternatives since those give me headaches. I’m also wondering if maybe my French pin is too small and maybe I need a longer/wider one? I’m a newbie with these so I have no idea what I’m doing lol. \n\nRoutine: wash with head and shoulders shampoo and condition with a basic Pantene conditioner, then I put mousse in my hair and braid it into two Dutch braids and air dry. I sleep with a satin bonnet with the braids or if I’ve taken the braids out a loose bun. ",

The reason I bought this is because I want to address my redness and hyperpigmentation, and it indeed removed my hyperpigmentation but it really takes time. Lots of TikTok videos show that the hyperpigmentation would just be gone within a week, and I have to say, it’s not that magical. Aside from that, the texture likes a silky gel, which I like.\n",
