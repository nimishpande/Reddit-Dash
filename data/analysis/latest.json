I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

But now that I’m about to be 26 I’ve noticed fine lines on my forehead so I wanted to start using a retinol to fix it. However upon my research I’ve learned that if I want to use a retinol then I need to also use an oil based cleanser and a water based cleanser and a AHA? Exfoliate and a moisturiser as well. I’m just worried that if I start using all of these things suddenly it might start to ruin my skin?\n\nAlso I’ve found it very hard to find products to use because they all say which to use based on problems with the skin ie “use this exfoliation for acne prone” or “only use this with dry skin” so basically I was just wondering if there’s anyone else with just normal non complex skin with a retinol skincare routine that didn’t harm your skin or cause unwanted problems?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice on what to do/use x",

After years of constant breakout my skin finally became acne free with only a few acne scars on my face. VERY UNFORTUNATELY the company has discontinued this and I’ve frantically searched everywhere online and it’s out of stock everywhere. I had no other option so I bought minimalists salicylic acid and a tranexamic acid serums separately, but ever since then a pimple or two repeatedly. I know it doesn’t sound like a huge deal after years of acne and being taunted for my skin, im extremely insecure of my skin and this has been bothering me way too much. PLEASE GUYS SUGGEST ME AN ALTERNATIVE, what do you think could be possibly breaking me out? I would’ve visited my dermatologist but im in college in a different city currently, please please suggest me alternatives, should i stop using tranexamic acid? or salicylic? ive posted the formulation of the serums in the succeeding slides.",

I wouldn’t say my skin is sensitive, but definitely reactive.\n\nI recently had a really bad perioral dermatitis flare up and striped all my skincare back to get cleanser and moisturiser. I’m finally back in a good place to start my actives again and since I need a re-stock anyways, I’m think of trying something new as my previous routine/products just didn't seem to work for me.\n\nI’m looking to re-introduce azelaic acid and a retinal. I used to use Finacea 15% and while I liked the results it was maybe too much for my skin, I’m looking into the Theramid Azid because it’s still 15% but it has more ingredients to keep the skin calm. I also used differin but because I’ve stopped so long ago I wanted something gentler so I can slowly pace myself back up and the Medik8 Crystal 3 looks really promising.\n\nI currently have a hydrating/barrier serum I’m trying out, the Avene Cicafate+ which I’m liking so far, but early days.\n\nShould I be incorporating more? Everyone always talk about exfoliation but I’m not sure I really need it as AZ and Ret are already quite strong and can be irritating, and they do also resurface the skin. Is this necessary in my routine? My skin hates BHA’s so if I did add this it would be a mandelic acid serum.\n\nI’ve also heard people recommending sulfur for rosacea but that just feels like an extra step and more potential irritants being introduced. Has it made much of an impact in anyone’s skin that it would be worth a try to add in as a mask?\n\nI feel like I need everything and the kitchen sink, and looking at my potential shopping list it just looks like way too much. I want to keep it fairly simple but effective.",

But today I only used a leave-in conditioner spray, left my hair in a towel for a bit, diffused it again, and finished with some hair oil. My hair feels less frizzy and more curly than when I use curl cream. Can someone help me with my hair routine? I’m trying to train my curls and learning how to use a Bounce Curl brush.\n\nI currently use Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, Pantene conditioner, Boots leave-in conditioner, and curl cream.\n",
