I think I do a pretty great job However, I still go get pedicures. I think I can do a great job at home but it does hurt my back 😅. \n\nI just feel like no matter where I go, the pedicures I get are such a disappointment. Am I a perfectionist? Not exactly, but I would hope you’d do a better job than me. \n\nEvery single time: \n- Cold water\n- Cut, scraped, or pinched\n- Polish on my cuticles\n- Constantly fixing the paint job after the fact\n\nI’m always polite and tip well. $10 for a $50 pedi. I never say anything about this stuff. But like - come on? I hate shelling out my hard earned bucks for such a consistently awful experience. \n\nIs it that the people can’t see? They don’t care? \n\nI’m literally currently leaving an appt with a scrape on my toe from the nail file… I think that’s the third appt in a row where I’ve left bleeding. \n\nI’m about to buy some of those magnifying glasses so I can start doing my pedis at home. \n\nAnyone else???",

Some products have heat protectant claims \"up to X degree\" on their label, while other products with the same silicones do not. Could I just use the product without those claims on the label? Is it just marketing? Are there silicones that are better heat protectants than others?",

      "content": "I don’t know what to title this but wanted to share. I’ve been into skincare pretty steadily for about 9 years or so. I have super sensitive, dry, hormonal skin, I’m 41. So moisturizing is everything.\n\nAfter years of trying so many types of products, I had to take a step back because I couldn’t get my skin to be calm. Hydrated but just a lot of congestion and flare ups.\n\nI scaled way back to just tret, moisturizers that my skin loves, and spf. Occasionally layering other hydration but very few exfoliating products. Instead favoring extremely gentle manual exfoliation with a washcloth. I have always used aquaphor or LRP B5 baume as my occluding product.\n\nMy skin has been calm lately so I decided to just try Vaseline about 5 days ago. I figured my skin is ok with aquaphor it should be ok. And yes. Yes it was. It works soooooo much better than aquaphor!! Like a noticeable softness. I had read rave reviews but then also have tried other things with rave reviews and it went quite badly for whatever reason that my skin didn’t like it.\n\nI am so pleasantly surprised that I wanted to share for anyone else that wondered if it really was that good. Thanks for listening to my ted talk. :)\n\nThings I currently use:\n- obagi tret (0.1). I know it’s bougie but it has worked so much better than any other tret I’ve used. \n- Naturium peptide moisturizer has honestly been a dream. My skin loves this\n- Shiseido (I think) stick SPF\n- Elemis balm makeup remover \n- Panoxyl 4% benzoyl peroxide hydrating face wash \n- occasional add ons: Violette FR boum boum milk, byoma milky toner, LRP B5 Baume, hypochlorous acid \n\nDon’t mind the I’m sure many spelling errors. My skin is clear with some chin redness, but otherwise soft and I am often mistaken for much younger 🤷🏻‍♀️",

I realised my oily skin can only handle very gentle and lightweight products. While I\nlook for labels like “lightweight”, “gel-based” on my products, I’ve realised “Non-comedogenic” is the one label that closes the deal for me.\n2. I always look for \"Clinically Proven” and not just “Clinically tested” products.\n3. I always check if there are reviews that point out results. Good or bad.\n4. I keep my routine very minimal. Layering too many products doesn’t do me any good.\n\nFinally, here’s the routine I follow: I use the Novology Deep Clearing Cleanser twice a day. It\nused to have a mild fragrance which I was initially wary of but it didn’t irritate my skin so I\ncontinued using it. When I restocked it last time, I noticed they’ve actually removed the\nfragrance too now. I’ve tried a bunch of moisturisers - all products that clear my checklist\nabove have worked well for me. And when I step out, use the Minimalist sunscreen. For the\noccasional breakouts, since the Novology cleanser worked well for me, I tried their Spot\nCorrector too and it gave shockingly good results so I started keeping it on me at all times.\nDoes anyone else have their own checklist for the products they use?",

I’ve always had issues with frizz and getting my hair to cooperate, but I feel like it’s finally time to ask for help, lol. \n\nHere is my routine: \n\n1. I wash my hair every other day. In the shower I use Pantene pro-v repair and protect shampoo. Once that’s washed out I use Monday curl define conditioner, and I brush it through my hair with a wet brush. I let it sit while I soap/shave and washing it out is the last thing I do before I get out of the shower. \n\n2. I dry it with a microfiber towel until it’s just damp, then I use Jamaican black castor oil leave in conditioner from the body shop. I get a blueberry/grape sized glob, rub it on my fingers, and then do my best to spread it through my hair without running my fingers through it to mess up the curls. \n\n3. Once it’s all spread through I scrunch my hair up with my hands for a bit, and then I let it air dry. I don’t brush or comb my hair unless I’m in the shower with conditioner in it. \n\n4. I typically only use the leave in conditioner when I’m planning on going out somewhere, but I get frizz whether or not I use it. I’d really love to see my hair with more defined curls, especially at the top of my head, with less of the frizz of course!! Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ",

Currently trying Garnier's Curls Method because it was kinda \"all in one package\" and not too expensive :\n\n- Shampoo on scalp (#1)\n- Conditionner / Mask (#2) on ends and let sit for a few minutes, brush through then rinse it off\n- Spraying the little bottle thingie (#3, don't know what kind of product this is ?), scrunch, air dry.\n- Once dry, tuck them in a satin bonnet (note that I'm sleeping with a cpap mask) and go to sleep\n- Wake up to the frizzy mess I'm used to.\n\nThey say the #3 spray is supposed to be used every 48h hours on dry hair between washes, but I've read about daily refreshing curls, sometimes on wet hair, or adding other products (and basically doing as told by the bottle doesnt hold for the night anyway). Basically this looks very good on wash day but I'm looking for how to refresh them. I'm gonna try putting my hair in a pineapple for the night but they're not the longest yet so I don't know how's that gonna hold.\n\nThanks you for any insights you can give me !!\n\n\n",

I also haven’t been outside more, actually spending more inside.\n\nI got the tatcha eye cream a month ago to help with dryness there, which has helped a lot. I just added the ordinary hyaluronic acid, cerave night cream, and reintroduced the peach slices snail rescue to my routine.I just noticed today that my freckles have gotten larger, none of them are new though just larger.it may have been over time but I pluck my eyebrows often and I just noticed this. \n\nMy concern is the new additions to my routine, are any of these known to do something like this? They are significantly larger. I don’t mind the way they look, however I’m concerned with the increase.\n\nCould this be a form of skin purging? I know that happens when new products are introduced, right now my pores are larger because of it, which I know is normal because it’s happened before.",
