I can’t believe the difference just one cut and the right products and techniques make.  I had no idea my natural texture could create actual ringlets, I’m still blown away. I am excited to see what it will look like once my curls fully recover from years of heat styling, I’m also tempted to grow it lol longer!\n\nRoutine: \nI’m not sure what shampoo/conditioner was used however she used Aveda nutri plenish styling treatment foam and curl gelée in soaking wet hair prior to brushing it with a curl brush to disperse the products. She then scrunched it to create the clumps and I sat under a radiator dryer until it was 90% dry. She then added a bit of the Aveda texture tonic and a touch more gelée at the ends before slowly diffusing until completely dry (hair flipped upside down and then to each side carefully). At the very end she gently broke the cast et voila! \n",

      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

My forehead, cheeks, and chin don't breakout or cause issues unless i'm not properly cleaning my makeup off or near my period. Yet, my nose has consistent issues. I have a lot of blackheads and some whiteheads. The whiteheads on my nose also don't pop (I know you're not supposed to do that, but they have been on my nose for so long..like years). Does anyone have products recommendations or advice on how to get rid of them? \n\nHere is my current routine-\n\nMorning: Cleanse with the La Roche Posay Foaming Face wash, then I use Good Molecules Niacinamide Serum, Kiehls Better Screen UV Serum for sunscreen, then finish with Lubiderm Daily Moisture Lotion. \n\nNight: Double cleanse using the DHC deep cleansing oil and La Roche Posay Foaming Face wash, every other night I use the Naturium BHA liquid exfoilant, and then I use the CeraVe Moisturizing Cream ( I plan to change this, I'm just waiting to finish using the jar I have). \n\nFor some more context: I have been on Accutane in the past, it has been several years so i'm unsure if this relevant, but even with the Accutane I feel like my nose has always been problematic. I'm also open to using over the counter topicals like Differin, but i'm just not sure sure it would be helpful or if I would have to switch out different products. \n\nApologizes for the long text, but thank you for the help!

      "content": "I’m a 19 year old female who’s been struggling with mild acne for a few years. I’ve seen improvement over the years, but my acne is still very persistent. My birthday is coming up, and it’s becoming increasingly embarrassing to still have acne as a young adult. I want to change &amp; improve my skin for the better — there’s just so many different products, ingredients, and rules and I’m unsure of the best way to care for my skin.\n\nI attached some pictures of the new routine I’ve curated so far. There are some products I currently use (micellar water, moisturizers, &amp; retinol) but a lot of new products I want to incorporate.\n\nI’ve been doing research on which types of products to use, the correct order, and the suggested concentrations based on my skin type. This is in addition to making dietary changes as well (more water, less sugar &amp; oily foods).\n\nAlso I have been to the dermatologist, who prescribed retinol among other products (the only product I’ve continued using is retinol).\n\nPlease, please, please let me know of any changes I can make that’ll help me see better results. Also, if you’ve used any of these products &amp; have feedback or recommendations for other brands. I know all skin types are different, but I would still love to hear feedback.\n\nIf pictures of my face are needed, I will happily provide them.\n\nThanks!!",
