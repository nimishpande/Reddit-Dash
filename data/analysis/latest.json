      "content": "The first clip is from 2024, and I considered that a good hair day. The second clip (black shirt) is from today’s hair wash. I went to a curly hair stylist that helped me blend my layers together more. I’m due for a hair cut soon to add shape back into my hair. When I started my hair journey back 2021, I tried everything, from brush styling to the bowl method and spending a lot of money on too many hair products. Then one day I just started a simple routine with 1-2 styling product (that’s how I learned what my hair likes.). I noticed since my hair is fine, I need texture styling products. I had to learn to love my hair, since my hair has so many patterns. I used to be so envious of people with perfect curls/waves. My straight bottom hair used to be my biggest insecurity about my hair. Once I started noticing more people that had hair like mine, it helped me accept my hair. And taking pictures along the way while trying to figure it out, helped majorly and keeping track of which products work and didn’t work. If you have been on your curly/wavy hair journey or just started, don’t stop. I know it can be frustrating, but keep going, it’s worth it. \n\nRoutine: \n\n1. Shampoo - Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat (wash x2 since I wash every 2-3 days) \n\n2. Conditioner - Giovanni 50:50 Balance \n\n3. Wet plop for about 10 minutes \n\n4. Take my hair out of towel and shake my head side to side, then take my fingers and shake my hair roots that are stuck to my scalp. \n\n5. Scrunch Not Your Mother’s Beach Babe Foam, one side at a time. Making sure I get the back of my head ask well. then wait 10-15 minutes. Then defuse with hair dryer. ",

Most of the comments promote shaving your head and how it takes you from zero to hero\n\nI have been shaving my head since I was 18 (razor shaved) and I have grown over the years to dislike it. People insist that it makes 0 impact when dating but I disagree. You can still find someone, and a lot of people actually are attracted to it, but it generally becomes harder. People also talk about how it males you look younher, but I've never noticed thism when I wear a hat people think I am in my 20s. Without it people think I am like 35+ (and I have good skin). Rocking the bald head vs hat is day and night.\n\nThe worst part is people get attacked when talking about using meds instead of just shaving their heads. And I am not talking about the bald subreddit (which is suppose to be bald positivity subreddit, which I support. Its good to have those safe spaces). But other ones like malehairadvice and dating\\_advice subreddit.  \n",

I was actually close to booking with Smile but then I also saw Pure Line. Their consultation setup and the way they handle meetings felt like a big plus. Also the fact that they only do one operation per day is an important advantage. I asked both Smile and Vera for a video call with the doctor, but they said the doctors are very busy, so that wasn’t possible.\n\nClose friend of mine highly recommends Vera Clinic. His results look good but he only had mid scalp area so I’m not sure how their hairline design would be. To be honest, before checking Reddit, I was much closer to Vera or Smile. They're look very professional and thousands of Google reviews with a 4.9 rating felt reassuring. After reading Reddit, though my opinion changed a bit but I’m still not fully sure.\n\nIf anyone here has experience with one of these clinics, or can help me think this through, I’d really appreciate it",

It kinks and waves back up\n\n•\tIf my hair gets wet, it gets very frizzy unless styled properly\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\n•\tI usually air-dry/towel-dry\n\n•\tI don’t use heat often\n\n•\tI only shampoo my hair using Herbal Essence Honey shampoo. I don’t put any creams/gels etc in my hair. I don’t currently use a conditioner.\n\n•\tI’m open to shampoo, conditioner, leave-ins, curl creams, gels, etc.\n\nI’m currently considering brands like Amika, but I’m totally open to other suggestions.

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "I started taking my skincare more seriously about two years ago, and a year ago introduced tretinoin into my routine to help with texture and anti-aging. Looking at photos of myself two years ago, my pores and sebaceous filaments are not nearly as big or noticeable as they are now, and my skin was a lot more even of a texture. I feel like no matter what I do, they only get worse. \n\nI have pretty dry, mildly acne-prone, and flaky skin that gets irritated extremely easily. I react really poorly to most skincare- I get dry flaky patches, redness, itchiness, tightness, painful burns, or I break out. \n\nMy pores are so huge, and prominent in places they weren't before. What can I do? I've been slowly troubleshooting and adding new things to try and help, but I'm at my wits end. \n\n  \n**Current routine:** \n\n  \nPM: Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil (start on dry skin, then emulsify with water). I only started double cleansing about a month ago, it's the newest thing I've added. \n\n Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser\n\n Byoma Milky Toner (on damp skin). Wait for toner to dry 15-20 minutes\n\nEvery other day, Tretinoin .025% Wait for tretinoin to dry 15-20 minutes \n\nVanicream Moisturizing Cream \n\nEgyptian Magic around eyes and lips\n\nOn days I don't use tret, I slug with Vaseline.\n\n\n\nAM: Rinse with water \n\nByoma Milky Toner (on damp skin)\n\nSkinAqua Super Moisture Milk UV 50+ or Anua Zero-Cast Moisturizing Finish Sunscreen\n\n  \nI've tried the Ordinary's niacinamide, but it was too much on my skin with the tret.\n\n  \nAny and all advice welcome!",

      "content": "I just wanted to share with everyone on here what finally helped me with my hair loss.\n\nBackstory, I’m 33F, I started shedding a ton of hair in 2021 when I was 29. Went to the doctor, had labs done, everything came back normal and they said it was either post Covid hair loss or as my dermatologist said “sometimes hair just falls out” 😐\n\nThroughout the past few years, I’ve tried everything, tons of different vitamins and supplements, shampoo and conditioners, scalp serums, and I even did over five rounds of PRP scalp injections, which is both painful and expensive. Some things worked a little bit for a short period of time, but then the hair shedding would always come right back. I had all but given up, until I saw this product on Amazon called Mary Ruth’s liquid morning multivitamin + hair growth. It’s pretty expensive, but I said F it what do I have to lose? I’ve been using it every day for about three months now, and I can honestly say within the first month my hair was shedding way less. Now I only get normal shedding when I’m brushing my hair right after I shower. No more constantly, pulling out loose hairs throughout the day or my entire brush being covered in hair just from brushing it once. I usually keep my hair in a short bob since that was helping it fall out less, I haven’t gotten a haircut in almost 4 months and this is the longest I’ve been able to grow my hair in years without it all falling out!\n\nAnd no, I am not affiliated with this brand in any way this is a completely 100% honest review. If you’re struggling to find something that works for you I highly recommend trying it! It is absolutely worth the money (plus it actually tastes really good too). \n\nAs a sidenote, I’ve also been using Nioxins shampoo and conditioner for thinning hair, so that might have also helped!",

      "content": "recently I’ve started cutting my boyfriends hair at home as he hasn’t found a barber who cuts his hair how he prefers. He always prefers a mullet / shaggy look to fit his face and style, but somehow his stylist always cuts it too short or gives him a wavy fringe. \n\nso far, he really likes the cuts i’ve been giving him (pics 2, 3, and 4 show the haircut i do from the side and front view, no styling products added just water and brushing it out), but he’s trying to find ways to style it so it stays well maintained, his hair gets less greasy, and it looks less frizzy / puffy. without styling, his hair looks weighed down and very shiny (photos 1 and 5 show examples).\n\nmy questions are:\n\n\\- what type of products would be good for his hair type to avoid build up / fizziness? I was thinking blow drying the hair and adding pomade due to oily hair?\n\n\\- should he invest in a clarifying shampoo due to excessive oil buildup?\n\nfor context:\n\n\\- He has a wavy hair pattern almost, I’d say between 2A 2B hair type.\n\n\\- His hair gets veeery greasy, I think some factors that might contribute to this are 1) washing it too often, and 2) not using a clarifying shampoo (he sometimes just uses what shampoo is currently in the shower, no conditioner or styling products to follow up)\n\n\\- He has never applied heat to his hair, nor color\n\n\\- His hair is very rarely styled, and if it is, he probably just brushed it down to help tame the frizz. he prefers wearing beanies and hats due to not knowing what method of styling works for him.\n\nAny advice would really be appreciated!! I love styling my boyfriend’s hair, and i really hope to find something that works for him!",
