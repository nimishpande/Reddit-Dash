I just wanted to share my like day 3-4 hair maybe! I know the curls are not defined on this specific day of my hair wash schedule by any means, and I have not perfected my refresh routine, but I want to say that I really dig voluminous hair looks. I want to look like a 🦁 haha! \n\nRoutine: Wash with Mielle rosemary shampoo and random generic Pantene conditioner. \n\nIn really wet hair, rake either Mixed Chicks Curl Sculptor thinned out with water and Aussie gel on top and scrunch. Try to comb crown of head backwards/horizontally and apply those products and scrunch for more volume. Avoid middle part as much as you can. Then, for this look in particular I guess: mix just a little bit of the The Doux Texture mousse/foam, The Doux Honey mousse/foam, Herbal Essences mousse, John Frieda mousse, and Dollar Tree Spa Luxury extra hold mousse. I mix them all together and rake from roots to end and then diffuse however I want, especially upside down for more volume. \n\nAnd then I actually ended up putting my hair in a curly bun with a side part. And the next day after when I took it down, I retouched/rewet my hair leave in conditioner from Dollar Tree and put some The Doux texture mousse around face framing and Dollar Tree coconut hair oil and CHI hair oil and hairsprayed with some Aussie hair spray for hold!\n\nMedia: 1) Hair down after refresh 2) Curly bun with side part before hair refresh day (ignore crusty ass makeup hehe)",

Now it looks like the hair of an angel!\n\nI'm still having issues though, since the mousse I use requires me to only put in a small amount of it, (lest my hair get weighed the hell down) I end up not being able to actually form a gel cast on my hair. Despite a good chunk of my routine being hover diffusing on low heat.\nI feel like I'm missing out on some definition by not having a gel cast.\n\n\n\nAnother problem is that Im not actually sure how to use hair oil? The benefits of protection from dryness and less moisture loss are super enticing though.\nI just put a bit on the ends of my hair after putting leave in conditioner to hopefully preserve some definition. \n\nBut some people say you're supposed to scrunch out the cast with oil? I can't exactly do that in my situation.\nAnd others say doing this actually evaporates the oil when it comes in contact with the heat of the diffuser. So I'm kind of at an impasse.\n\n\n\nRoutine: After soaking in the shower, spray a bit of Camille rose leave in conditioner and scrunch the ends with a tiny amount of hair oil (not sure if I should use it before or after) \nthen apply Pattern mousse only on the ends and mids so the hair isn't weighed down.\n\nFollowing this, begin hover diffusing on low heat to hopefully make a cast. As well as gently cupping the roots to make some lift.\nThen afterwards, begin hanging head upside down and swaying to all different sides while cupping on medium heat.\n\nEither dry completely or leave semi dry to air dry the rest.",

She also has a double crown so her hair on top grows in an awkward direction. \n\nI really want to do right by their curls but feel very out of my depth!\n\nHair routine is just child’s farm curly shampoo and conditioner and occasionally their leave-in conditioner too.

      "content": "Hi! I have been trying to figure out what to do with my sometimes-straight-sometimes-curly hair for years and I feel like I have reached a point where I might go insane soon so here I am desperately asking for some help. \n\nMy hair behaves differently depending on where I am (probably has to do with humidity? dry air = flat and staticky hair). No matter what though, it is always completely flat around the crown of my head. I got deep layers in hopes of getting rid of this issue but surprise: it didn't work. Here is my routine:\n\n1. Wash daily with a sulfate-free shampoo (once a week I do a harsher cleanse with a drugstore shampoo with SLS)\n2. Apply conditioner (right now I'm using the Garnier papaya one but I constantly try different ones)\n3. While my hair is dripping wet I gently rake my fingers into my roots and shake the hair so that it clumps together\n4. Then I flip my hair upside down and scrunch the water out with a microfiber towel\n5. Plop for about 5-10 minutes\n6. Let it air dry\n7. Put it in a pineapple ponytail with a silk scrunchie when I go to bed\n\nI attached pictures of what it looks like in the morning. As you can see I don't use any styling products because my hair is already so thin that it gets weighed down extremely easily. Also since I have to wash my hair daily because of how quickly it gets oily, I would prefer not to have a 10-step routine to follow everyday 😭. But I am open to suggestions! Any tips on what I could improve or change would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",

I'm just looking for a place that's trustworthy and does good, natural work.\n\nMy budget is mid-range, I guess? I know you get what you pay for, but I also don't need the most famous celebrity doc.\n\nHas anyone actually gone through with this locally and have experiences to share? Which doctors or clinics in LA would you actually recommend? And maybe more importantly, are there any I should definitely avoid?\n\nWhat was the consultation process like? Did you feel pressured or was it informative?\n\nHow did you decide between FUE and FUT?

I was wondering if it's the unfiltered water (i have a water filter at home) so I started drinking packaged water, this hasn't helped. For skincare I used some fancier products that were recommended to me after I got a facial in Spain(August) and since they've ran out like 7 weeks ago I've just used a basic cleaner and a random face cream (which both haven't had an effect on my skin). I also feel like those typical white pimples (which you can pop) form way faster than before.\n\nMy friend recommended me the \"Nø Liquid Refiner/ Liquid Peeling\" which I've used like 3 times but it has dried my skin a lot (I've used it once a week).\n\nLittle background: I'm 20, I've been having spots since I was 12 but never this bad and especially never on my cheek area, I've had them on my temples and my chin but both never this bad. \nI'm also a really extreme skin picker (if you have any tips with that let me know please I really can't stop) and I've been under extreme stress since the move (uni/moved out from home etc) every help is dearly appreciated my confidence is really suffering from this! :(",

Did not unpack yet.\n\nI have the Curl Girl Nordic Curl Refreshner for the 2, 3, etc day, but it would not do what combing is supposed to do.\n\nMy hair tangles as a sonofabitch.\nWhen I was deep in depression several years ago, I had to cut off my long hair short because it became matted and impossible to comb through.\n\nMy hair also doesn't really look all that curly on third day (like on this photo).\n(Added some \"fresher\" first day/second day after sleeping with wet hair photos for comparison).\n\nIt is currently dyed with henna (impressed how it colored the grey roots). But it kinda looks lifeless as the result.  \n\nI bought a hair mask because my hairdresser recommended it to me (Curl girl Nordic Hair mask protein treatment, was standing for 30 minutes with Chatgpt deciding which mask and line to take) but I don't like applying it since 6 minutes waiting with wet cold hair makes the whole washing the hair procedure even more long and unwanted.\n\nI also bought several untangling brushes.\nAre there any brushes/combs/combing methods acceptable for curly hair on second/third etc day?",
