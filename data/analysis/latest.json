      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I realize I should’ve started years ago, but better late than never right?\n\nI just turned 40 this year, and I currently have the most basic of basic routines. I know there are things I can do to improve my overall skin health though. So I figured the experts in here can help point me in the right direction as far as products and first-hand knowledge!\n\nFor a reference point, I don’t have acne or discoloration issues, I avoid the sun like it’s a death ray, I try to stay hydrated, and I use nightly cream applications of vitamin C and pea peptides.\n\nI guess what I really want to know is, what key things do I need to add/change to my routine to help flesh out the missing pieces? Also, what are some good cleansers I can use? In addition, any anti-aging suggestions are welcomed!\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "title": "3/3 for this gel!",
      "content": "Okay my last time updating about pretty curl girl strong hold gel 😅\n\nThis is the 3rd time I've styled with it. It's fragrance free and concentrated. 100ml/3.5 ounces lasted me 3 styles, 3rd being today.\n\nThe last two times, I could wake up and untie my hair with satisfaction for 4 days. Sometimes I restyle on the 4th, typically after 5 or later if it's like the weekend and I won't be going anywhere. Refreshing has never worked for me, just causes frizz and I don't like adding more product to my hair between washes except to my bangs if they get really messy from sleeping weird.\n\nI don't think I get flaking from this product (i have scalp issues that I've went to doctors about for 10 years now to no avail, seeing a new person next month but not holding my breath). I feel like the cast is strong but flexible. I'm currently pedestrian-only in a windy country I'm foreign to as I just moved here and my licence is not valid. My hair survives well those first 3 days. I think day 5 wouldn't look so great but I don't know. Unsure about day 4. I guess it depends.\n\nI absolutely HATE doing my hair so it's nice to worry about it a little less with this fantastic gel, I just wish it came in a large amount like the curlsmith I was using does lol.\n\nIf I miss a spot or just dont like how a section turned out, I rewet it, add a little more gel, scrunch/finger coil and diffuse again. I'll do this as late as the day after wash/diffuse day.\n\nRoutine is either curlsmith hydrating shampoo/conditioner OR double clarify followed by amika protein deep conditioner OR bumble &amp; bumble cowash (purple label); redken united leave in or redken acidic curl bonding 16% (one area of my hair is extremely low porosity and dries within 2 minutes so the acidic bonding helps but I was told not to make it make main product i just use it for 2-4 weeks then go back to the united leave in), if using acidic bonding, i spray thermal protection as well (was using chi but switching to indola), and then the gel. I try to put all my product in after showering but I have a hard time detangling in or out of the shower (with conditioner) so I do my best before adding product, plopping in a hair turban for 10-30 minutes (depends on how ugh I'm feeling about getting it done lol) and the I detangle/style again at my vanity, adding a little more gel and water to places I typically miss when bent over in the shower adding the product (the roots in the back usually). I have so knock off bounce curl brush i define with after redistributing product with my tangle teezer.\n\nI can never really get my bangs how I want but I don't wanna experiment with them too much because that just leads to me cutting more hair lmao. Unsure if they're even cut okay. They were fine at first but after a few washes, the line where they're divided at look a bit uneven but I don't see any missed hairs to pull back down where they belong 🤷‍♀️ in this pic my bangs are not totally dry so I haven't spread them out yet. If i do it too early it gets stringy which leads to frizz. I use a bonnet and silk pillowcase but they don't really help with bangs. If i put them in the bonnet, it's the same as if I tie them up. They're in a different direction. So i leave them pushed down at the root with the bonnet. (Like the elastic is ON the top of bangs).\n\nWhen my hair is COMPLETELY dry and satisfactory, I oil my scalp with a jojoba mix of rosemary and castor. Trying to thicken it up after it all fell out from stress in 2018 :/ was 4x thicker than now and about 5 inches longer. Had to cut off a lot of growth due to using innersense gel. I want my hair back at my waist 😭\n\nIf it matters (according to my old curly stylist it does) I'm black, Filipino, indigenous american Indian, Spanish and white. Dominance is Spanish and black but apparently I just look like \"some kind of islander\" 😂 ",
