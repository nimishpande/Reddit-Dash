And she prescribed me some gel, creams, acids(BHA if you call that, idk) etc. and that literally helped my skin so much. \n\nPlease visit the dermatologist. Don't experiment with different products if you have acne-prone skin. \n\nI have oily, acne-prone skin. I suffered so much because of experimenting. \n\nYes, there are many scars left still, but i believe on my dermat treatment. It should be clear by next year or so.",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi! \n\nI would like to start oiling my hair and I need some advice on the following: should I even do it? What's the best oil for my hair and expectations? How to oil it? (Skip paragraphs about my hair and hair care, if you don't need that information to give me advice)\n\nSo a little bit about my hair - I have straight,  fairly thin hair, natural colour. When I was a baby I had black curly hair, but with time, it has lightened to dark blonde/light brown colour and it has straightened completely. It cannot hold a curl for the life of me. My hair is around my waist length now, and it has been growing fast. It's been getting thicker too (not sure if it's bc of supplements or new shampoo conditioner). But the only issue I have - it's frizzy and although it feels soft, it can sometimes look a little bit like hay. There is not much shine to it. Also, my scalp I would say, is on the oily side.\n\nSo first question, if I want to increase the shine, maybe strengthen my hair, would oiling help? And would it be okay to do even with my scalp being quite oily already?\n\nNow when it comes to hair care, or my hair routine, this is the usual - I shampoo it and I use a silicone scalp massager to get the shampoo to reach every root, and to clean all of my scalp. I rinse and then squeeze out as much water from my hair as I can. I then lather in the conditioner, focusing mainly on the ends and avoiding the scalp. I put my hair up for a bit (1-2 minutes), while conditioner is sitting in my hair. Then I rinse the conditioner out. After I come out of the shower, I towel dry my hair and I add a hair serum, starting from the ends up. Once a month, I use a scalp scrub, to really clear out the pores. And maybe once every two months, I do an ampoule of hair \"filler\" treatment (l'ador hair fill up, korean). And I do, unfortunately, end up air drying my hair. I know I need to stop that xD.\n\nNow with all of that information, do you have any recommendations of what hair oil should I use for my hair? I want it to become shinier and less frizzy, but I also don't want to have my hair start thinning again, so what could I use?\n\nAnd most importantly, how should I use it? During my research, I got very confused, because everyone seems to do it differently, so I guess it depends on hair type. That's why I'm providing as much information that could help.\n\nThank you for advice! And sorry for such a long post 🙈\n\n",

I got a cut and it helped a lot. the ends were perfect and clean. Until the breakage started again and I am losing even more hair. i have invested in every good hair product, brand and method and still my hair is just snapping off every day. i am losing more and more hair and i am afraid i will have none in three months as i have lost half already. what should i do?

On a little shopping spree high, I walked into Ulta for the first time and I was instantly greeted by the manager and she was extremely helpful but she was a really fast talker and well.. I got lost and was too embarrassed to ask her to repeat herself (I know, I’m working on the spine part😂) Well, long story longer, I bought these products (everything she recommended lol) but i am not sure when i should use them (in the morning? at night? both?) especially with me working 6pm- 4:40am..

It’s really starting to get to me mentally.\n\nBasic info:\n• Age/sex: 26, male\n• Location: UK\n• Back acne for: ~2 years\n\nTreatments (past + current):\n• Lots of oral antibiotics as a teenager\n• Currently on oral antibiotics again from my GP for the back acne\n• Adapalene gel at the moment\n• Previously used tretinoin (helped a bit but didn’t clear it)\n• Was on isotretinoin (Accutane) about 10 years ago for facial acne – I didn’t have back acne back then. My derm is now suggesting Accutane again.\n\nLifestyle / hygiene:\n• Eat fairly clean, exercise regularly\n• Shower straight after workouts\n• Change into clean clothes after sweating\n• Wash bed sheets 1–2x per week\n• Use a gentle cleanser on my back (no scrubs)\n• Not using moisturiser on my back at the moment – some moisturisers seemed to break me out\n• Sometimes my back feels itchy after washing, so I’m worried I might be irritating my skin barrier\n\nExtra context:\n• I sweat a lot – even when I’m sitting still and not hot, my armpits/back/chest get sweaty\n• My recent blood tests showed higher oestradiol (E2)\n• I take finasteride for hair loss (DHT blocker)\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n• Has anyone had similar back acne + sweating + hormones/finasteride, and what actually helped you long-term?\n• For those who went on Accutane for body/back acne, did it help the back specifically?\n• Any body washes/moisturisers you’ve found that don’t make things worse, especially if your skin is easily irritated/itchy?\n• For the scars and dark marks, did anything help on the back or was it mainly time + stopping new breakouts?\n\nI’ll attach pictures of my back in different lighting.\n\nI know nobody can diagnose me here – I’m just trying to get real experiences and see what’s worth discussing further with my derm.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Help.\n\nSkin type: Oily and acne-prone skin \n\nMy previous skin care routine was\n\nAM/PM:\nCetaphil oily face cleanser\nPonds hyaluronic moisturizer\nA Clindamycin and nicotinamide gel\n\nI stopped the clindamycin gel because it would become less effective. During this time,  I noticed the moisturizer was making me breakout so I stopped it and it was fine for some time.\n\n I switched to azelaic acid, this helped me but my skin felt dry.\n\nSo I added Sebamed Clear face care gel to my routine but nothing changed, I'm still getting painful acnes. \n\nI need some new recommendations that will work for me. \n\nI'm fairly new to skincare, and all this has happened in the span of 4-5 months. I've got no idea what to do. Any help is appreciated.\n\nIf you want any specific information, please ask away as I don't know what is relevant or irrelevant. ",

Potentially they came from Kiss.... but I am really unsure, and havent found an exact match. \n\nThey are maybe a C curl, definitely not a D curl. I would estimate that at their longest, maybe 11-13 mm? They are slightly cat eye, slightly doll shaped, as the ends taper inwards ever so slightly on the outer corners. \n\nI love them, and I cannot find them anywhere!!! They come in a pack of 7. I love that they have a fullness to them without being over filled or bushy (I use them for every day looks). I have been searching high and low for a week, and have had no luck. \n\nOpen to suggestions of similar looks OR if you might know the actual brand/where I can get them in Canada. If you have suggestions I prefer: slight curl, this level of fill/criss crossed hairs, invisible band (but can deal with thin black band), shorter lashes - 11-13mm, but can deal with maybe 14 if its onky in the ends as those get trimmed off anyway! Thank you in advance :) \n\n",
