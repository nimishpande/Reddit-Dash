(No conditioner used), use brush for curly hair to detangle the most you can.\n\n2.\t⁠After shower when the hair is still wet, divide the hair in 2 parts, left and right area, and each of those in 3 subparts: front, middle, back. So 6 parts in total.\n\nUse hair clips for this.\n\n3. Start with one of the 6 parts, and grab a smaller amount of hair from it, that is easier to manage and apply Skala curl cream and Etniker curl gel in all that piece of hair, the curl patterns starts to appear automatically\n\n4. Now define every curl from that amount of hair definitively by rolling them on your finger and releasing carefully. One by one. (do not put much tension, not so tight).\n\n5. After finishing with that amount of hair, grab other manageable amount of hair from the 1st part, and repeat.\n\n6. Do the same for the next 5 parts.\n\n7. At the end, dry the hair with diffuser around 15 minutes. Diffuser is so important!\n\n8. When going to sleep or laying in bed for any reason, use a Satin anti frizz Hat (important also)",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "Long post 🫣\n\nSorry in advance for blocking my features. I normally show my full face and have never had an issue until last week. Before I get into my skin details, I want to explain why.\n\nLong story short, I had an issue with a Reddit user (blackjack714) who started acting weird after I commented on a post. I trusted my gut and deleted my photos. After that, things escalated. I tried to warn people in Blackhair subreddit, but my post was taken down and not allowed to stay up (tried posting twice, and then they went as far to filter me so I can't tell my story). I am not trying to start drama, I just want to warn others to be careful. That situation is why I am covering my features now.\n\n\\*\\*Note: the first 4 photos are just close ups so you can see the beginning of my journey. Follow the rest of the photos from left to right\\*\\*\n\nNow, onto my skin and hydroquinone experience.\n\nI used \\*\\*Clear Essence Platinum Medicated Fade Creme with Sunscreen (4 oz)\\*\\* from \\*\\*October 3 to November 18, 2025\\*\\*. The ninth slide shows when I stopped using it. At that point, I felt like it stopped working and was taking too long around the perimeter of my face. Looking back, I actually wish I had continued longer or switched to something slightly stronger. When my melanin came back, my skin looked much better overall, but some stubborn areas could have benefited from more time. Because those areas were not fully corrected, the hyperpigmentation returned once my melanin came back. It wasn't a lot of hyperpigmentation, but it was definitely the stubborn areas that was around the perimeter or the ones that you notice in the photos.\n\nMy skin now looks close to the last photos. Those last photos are actually my original before photos. I took them when I first started school, and the only reason I had them was because I was practicing mewing\n\nWhen I first started hydroquinone, I made a big mistake. I applied it to my entire face. That was the worst thing I could have done. I ended up with uneven patches of light and dark skin everywhere. Some areas became much lighter than expected, which caused hypopigmentation. I genuinely started to look crazy, and I did not notice how bad it was until my fiancé pointed it out.\n\nAnother thing I want to mention is that my undereyes barely lightened at all. So I had very dark undereyes while the surrounding skin was getting lighter, which made me look constantly tired. My upper lip was also dark. I have always had a shadow there, and it is the area I hate the most.\n\nOnce I switched to spot treating, everything changed.\n\nI know everywhere online says not to spot treat with hydroquinone. I read it too. But I am telling you now, you \\*can\\* spot treat. If you have dark skin, please listen to this part. Spot treating helps prevent hypopigmentation. Hypopigmentation can fade over time depending on your melanin production, but while it is happening, you will look very uneven. Always.\n\nThis method does work, but darker skin tones need to be extra careful. Hydroquinone can cause bright patches very quickly if it is used incorrectly. You have to monitor your skin closely.\n\nFor dark skin, I recommend using hydroquinone only on stubborn areas. Think under the lips, undereyes, or specific dark spots that are not catching up with the rest of your face.\n\nIf you are spot treating or treating larger areas, only apply hydroquinone to the darker skin until everything evens out. Do not apply it to already even or lighter areas. This helps prevent hypopigmentation and uneven results. It truly works this way. Take weekly before and after photos so you can actually track progress instead of guessing.\n\nWhen spot treating, use a q tip and do it under bright white lighting so you can be precise.\n\nUndereyes take the longest to improve. If you do not see progress after about four weeks, stop treating that area and the skin directly below it. Over treating can make dark circles look worse. The goal is an even tone, not lighter undereyes. Once you stop hydroquinone in that area, your skin will gradually return to its normal shade and blend better.\n\nRight now, I am using \\*\\*tazarotene and azelaic acid\\*\\*. If you saw my last post, just know I have accepted defeat when it comes to my pores. And yes, if you saw my older photos, my skin used to be almost perfect. School stress really took a toll on my skin. I also believe hair products contributed to the breakouts around my hairline, which caused inflammation and hyperpigmentation in that area.\n\nHopefully this helps someone with deeper skin tones who is considering hydroquinone or already using it. Be careful, be patient, and please do not apply it everywhere like I did.\n\nP.S. I actually really like tazarotene and azelaic acid, by the way. Tazarotene is working on the rest of my hyperpigmentation fast. I am talking noticeable improvement by the third use, which honestly shocked me.\n\nI also think the azelaic acid is finally helping my undereyes 😲, which hydroquinone never did for me. I know undereyes are always the slowest area to treat, so I am being patient with it. That is why I am kind of working backwards now. I am focusing on blending and evening everything out instead of trying to force lighter skin where it does not want to lighten.\n\nJust wanted to add that in case anyone else is dealing with the same stubborn areas.",
