Sometimes less is more!\n\nRoutine: \n1. Panoxyl (once every 2-3 days) for 30 seconds, then rinse.\n2. Pat face with towel until damp\n3. Vanicream for sensitive skin (once a day)\n4. That’s it! That’s my routine :)\n\nI’m breaking out slightly right now, because I’ve been sick and wearing a mask at work. But, I’ve come a long way to say that THIS is a breakout!!

(*Depending on hair type*) the hair near the scalp is usually lower porosity because it’s newer and healthier, while the mid lengths and ends naturally get more porous over time from everyday wear, washing(esp frequent washes), brushing, the sun, heat damage, dying/bleaching hair, friction or just the ends being older. It is possible for hair from root to tip to be fully low porosity but for that to happen the hair would have to go through little to no damage in its lifetime of growing, for many people it’s inevitable that the porosity will change. \n\nWhen I only used lightweight, silicone-free products for my “low porosity” hair, my hair was a MESS, very damaged, and lots of breakage. My ends stayed dry and frizzy constantly, but once I started using heavier conditioners, masks, and leave ins especially with silicones, my hair completely changed for the better. Tbh once I stopped stressing about porosity and just focused on what my hair actually needed (oily scalp dry ends) is when my hair as a whole improved! \n\n*If anyone has also struggled with this too i can give some product recommendations in the comments on what’s worked for me!! lmk!*\n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I wind up with a bloody crator type wound on the tip of my nose. And you can imagine how much more embarrassing that is and looks than if i just had a small hair that no one would notice.

But I usually don't air dry cause it gets frizzy and I just brush it out when it's wet. I wanna try to atleast see if my hair is anything other than straight so I can take care of it better, but I don't know ANYTHING about products and stuff like that. Is there anything I can do to test or see if I have any type of pattern at all?\n\n1st picture is when I was younger, don't know if that's good for anything and the other 3 are pictures that are clear enough of my hair and what it usually looks like on days I don't straighten it or have it up.\n",

I probably am wrong on that but I want your help with this Basically should I moisturize after using Stridex, if so what Moisturizer should I use ( and is the sun screen I listed fine? Never really tried it seems to be recommended thought ) and should I have another treatment for my acne along with the Stridex, and should I be applying my Stridex right after using my Vicky face wash?\n",

She was confused why I wanted it short and I explained my curls don't puff up right if my hair is too long. She had me facing away from the mirror until she was nearly done. I couldn't tell anything was wrong due to my hair having been pulled straight from me letting it grown too long until I slept on it and tried to puff my hair up this morning. She cut it way past what I showed and now my hair is all over the place with one side being jagged and one side being nearly completely flat.\n\nI don't know if I just play the waiting game if it will fix itself my hair is wrong. She didn't layer it correctly, she didn't blend my bangs, and cut several inches past where I showed.\n\nI have a new product I was going to use and I don't even know if there's a point anymore you can't see the curls my hair looks like a bunch of cowlicks.\n\nI've never had my hair cut this badly. I'm scared to throw a beanie over it and possibly ruin the curls forming. IDK WHAT TO DO. Is there any products y'all recommend to help with hair curl growth or something?

      "content": "Hey I’m new to this subreddit and just looking for help on how I should do my hair. I recently moved for college to a very humid climate from a very dry climate where I was able to straighten my hair and keep it straight so I don’t really know what I’m doing lol. I also change shampoos often, but I’m currently using a Pantene one with no parabens or sulfates and I use a kerastase conditioner. I don’t have a set hair wash routine so I just wash my hair when I feel like it and sometimes use conditioner without shampoo. I use a not your mother’s curl mousse and gel and scrunch those into my hair. Before today I used to scrunch my hair before the gel was set but then that made my hair look wet even when it was dry( first picture). So this morning I showered and tried waiting until it was dry but it didn’t stay curly very well, I feel like my hair gets weighted down easily(last two pictures). In general I feel like my hair is curlier when it’s wet and dries less curly. My bangs and roots also don’t curl and the back section of my hair doesn’t either but I think that’s because it’s longer(I have layers). My hair also doesn’t stay curly throughout the day and rarely into the next day even when I wear a bonnet to sleep.  I used to use a diffuser but mine broke so now I just air dry it. Last thing lol is I’m pretty sure I have high porosity hair so it dries really quickly. Any advice on products or how to do my routine would be super helpful 🙏🙏, sorry this post is so long.",
