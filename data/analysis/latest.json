The accutane is doing its work while i am on month 4.\n\nRight now, my skincare consists of: CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, La Roche-Posay Toleraine Sensitive Riche Moisturizer, and SkinCeuticals Physical Fusion UV Defence SPF 50 Skin Tinted Sunscreen. I use all these products in the morning and then at night (except the sunscreen).\n\nI was wondering if this is a good skincare routine for my milia and skin while on accutane?\n\nI was looking into other products and considered switching to: CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser, La Roche-Posay HYALU B5 EYE SERUM WITH HYALURONIC ACID + 10% COMPLEX for undereves only (no moisturizer in this area), La Roche-Posay Sensitive Creme (not under the eyes), and keeping the same sunscreen.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Does anyone have recommendations?\nAlso I live in Canada if anyone can find products there or that I could order to there.",

      "content": "I don‚Äôt really know how much  scalp is ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù to show but I try to show as little as possible. The first 3 pictures are what my hair looks like on a good day. I tried showing my bathroom lighting as well as more natural lighting. As you can see it‚Äôs very frizzy. I‚Äôm told it doesn‚Äôt look good/could look better but idk how to style it cause whenever I try to style it like videos on YouTube or try methods I read from the wiki where you just scrunch it then let it air dry or use a diffuser then scrunch it after it just looks like my entire scalp is showing so I might be doing something wrong or using the wrong products. The last 2 pictures are what it looks like when I attempt that. Side note I was thinking of trying texturing powder. Now I think it‚Äôs gotta be how I style it cause I think my hair is fine but many people tell me it's thick but I personally think it's due to how much volumizing I do but there is the possibility of me just doing or using something wrong like I said.\n\nRoutine:\nI'll use this routine 6 out of 7 days of the week with the seventh day being my shampoo day and the only significant difference is I use ‚Äúhask argon oil shampoo‚Äù before everything else.\nI use two conditioners I swap between every other day. One I use is ‚Äúliving proof full conditioner‚Äù and the other is a protein focused conditioner called ‚Äúcurl smith multitasking 3 in 1 conditioner‚Äù and I‚Äôll just rake those in my wet hair. Then like I said I‚Äôll use the living proof one day then the next I‚Äôll use the other instead.\n\nPost shower:\nAfter the shower I‚Äôve tried many things but the most consistent thing I‚Äôve been doing is I‚Äôll use ‚ÄúKristen ess lightweight leave in conditioner‚Äù and use the praying hands method for apply that going mid to ends, then I‚Äôll comb my hair down with an oval brush. Then I use a small amount of ‚ÄúAussie instant freeze hair gel with jojoba oil and sea kelp‚Äù rub that in my hands apply from roots to ends raking in then scrunch my hair at the ends and shake my head up and down gently to make it more natural.\n\nDrying and styling:\nThen I‚Äôll sit and wait for it to be completely dry then scrunch it and my scalp will show really bad especially at the crown and hairline probably because of how short my hair is (due to being in the military I can‚Äôt grow it out so growing it more isn‚Äôt an option at the moment). After that I‚Äôll use a hair pick to pick at the roots to mid lengths to help separate them and volumize it to make it look like the pictures. I know that this is likely the culprit to my issue but I don‚Äôt know how I should style it otherwise as the alternative is I look like I raided a crack shack. \n\nAny recommendations on what I should do differently to avoid showing too much scalp but not creating so much frizz or any products I should try like texturizing powder and if I should replace certain products with ones you recommend?",

      "title": "Dr Dennis Gross daily peel - universal vs ultra gentle",
      "content": "Hello!\n\nJust noticed that there were not any answered posts about the Dr Dennis Gross daily peels here and since I am an inconsistent user searching for some answers myself, thought I‚Äôd share my experience with you girlies ü•π\n\nSo they come in three types - ultra gentle, normal/universal, extra strength. I‚Äôve tried the first two types. Since I have sensitive skin I never thought of trying the extra strong ones. I would suggest to go for the normal one unless you have super sensitive skin (which I do) - then try the ultra gentle ones first.\n\nNow these are a two step routine thingy - steps are basically opening the pack and rubbing the cotton pad soaked in the essence on your face lol. So you wash your face, do first step (exfoliation), after couple of minutes do the second step (anti-ageing) and wait another two minutes before moisturizing.\n\nFirst off, yes, they are expensive. I have only gotten them by paying frens who have visited the States. But the only person I know IRL who uses them regularly is my best fren and she swears by it because she‚Äôs a PCOS girlie with angry skin. So I tried them and I am glad I did - even as someone who sucks at consistency, I do really like the effect it has on me even if I can use it for a few weeks on end. You can buy a ziploc pouch, cut each pad in half, and preserve the other half inside the package and ziploc for the next use. Cuz duh they‚Äôre expensive. \n\nSecondly, don‚Äôt start every day at first. Let your skin get used to it. When I used the orange peel for the first time I overexfoliated like a dumbass. Do it once or twice a week depending on how sensitive your skin is I guess at first. \n\nThird, don‚Äôt overdo rest of your actives. The peel pads contain Citric Acid, Lactic Acid, Malic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Retinol, Tocopheryl Acetate etc. Basically retinoids, AHA/BHA are already there in the peels so it might be wise not to use other exfoliants or strong acids in your routine if you‚Äôre using this! I didn‚Äôt realise this and coupled the peel with a cleanser that had AHA BHA PHA and my skin got so dry üò≠\n\nNext - ensure you use sunscreen! I can‚Äôt stress this enough. Because you _will_ get sunburnt if you don‚Äôt. I made this mistake once inspite of the packaging begging me to use sunscreen. Don‚Äôt be like me lol.\n\nLastly - MOISTURISE! The peel uses strong ingredients especially if you have sensitive skin like me so please for the love of god moisturise your skin girlllllll. I use 1.5-2x my usual moisturiser when I use the peel pads. \n\nAnyways, this was not a paid Dennis Gross advert lol. But I will try to be consistent and share the effects of the ultra gentle peel once I‚Äôve used it regularly for like a month or so. This is one of the only products where I‚Äôve felt a difference immediately after using it - almost feels like make up lol. The first set of photos is post using the normal peel and second set is using the ultra gentle peel. The rest of the steps were the same (washing face with a gentle cleanser like cetaphil then peel and then centella toner by skin1004 followed by bioderma sensibio pink moisturiser). Of course the quality of my skin is worse in the second set because the photos are taken months apart xD But I still wanted to share them for reference in case it might help somebody. ",

      "content": "Are alkaline solutions the only way to penetrate hair by lifting the cuticles or does hot water work as well?  Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",
