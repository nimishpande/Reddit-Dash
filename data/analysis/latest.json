      "content": "My darling beautiful 4 year old has started puberty early (medically diagnosed) This of course is accompanied by body odour. It’s kinda hard to manage, she obviously runs around like a four year old but unlike a teen it doesn’t even cross her mind to re apply after becoming hot and sweaty. We try to shower daily but those with four year olds know the battle. I desperately don’t want her to be the smelly kid in school. (She also has autism and Poland syndrome so already has things to mark her as different, and now this 😭) \n\nI need a deodorant that seriously works, like will last all day without needing to re apply. Works after running around outside in SoCal weather wearing a polyester Spider-Man costume. \n\nIt also needs to look fun. Again getting her to wear deodorant is a serious battle, I can tempt her if it’s something fun looking. (Also I kinda hate applying something to her that looks like it’s marketed to 30 year olds women) \n\nFinally it needs to be “cool”. If she does have it in her school bag and another kid spots it the brand is considered “cool”. I don’t care if I have to spend stupid money. Even if it’s tried and true but it’s like old lady deodorant it’s no good. \n\nI feel sad and stressed about this situation. Of course I don’t let any of this on to her. We all remember we the stinky kid at school. She is the most beautiful being in the world to me and she is kind and gentle and sweet. I just really want to prevent this one other thing marking her out as different. \n\nAny recommendations will be greatly appreciated. ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I use whatever cleanser and moisturizer is most economical and I sometimes cave and buy curology when I start getting deep painful acne on my chin or around my mouth.\n\nI’d say I have both dry and oily skin. The skin on my forehead and cheeks tend to be dry while my chin and around my mouth tends to get oily. \n\nI do consistently have whiteheads around my chin and mouth that I have no idea how to get rid of, as well as blackheads on my nose. \n\nI rarely wear makeup aside from the occasional eyeliner, mascara, and very rarely blush. (Depending on how dull I look on a given day)\n\nI’m not sure if it’s worth mentioning, but I do play a sport that causes me to be really gross and sweaty, and then I have an hour and a half drive home from practices- so any suggestions on what I should do if that’s causing some of this would be great. \n\nI’d love ideas on what I should incorporate into my routine in order to clean up my skin and keep it hydrated and glowy. I’d be willing to spend a decent amount on skin care if it’s necessary but I also love a bargain when it’s possible! I’ll be at both Sephora and Ulta in the upcoming days if there’s anything at either of those stores I should keep an eye out for.\n\nI have scrolled through this sub for the past hour trying to come to my own conclusions but this is honestly very overwhelming! My mom literally uses dial soap to wash her face so I guess you could say that skin care wasn’t a topic that was covered in our house. TIA!",

      "content": "I’m looking for impartial advice about my curly hair.\n\nI grew up never being taught how to care for curls (I was always told to brush it), so I kept my hair very short most of my life. A stylist recently told me I have strong natural curls and recommended growing it out for \\~6 months. I’m about 4 months in.\n\nI’m having a hard time telling whether what I’m seeing now is a normal curly grow-out phase that just needs shaping—or whether my curl pattern/head shape genuinely works better with short hair. I’ve gotten mixed feedback in real life, which makes it difficult for me to evaluate clearly.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n1. Is this current length/shape a normal curly grow-out phase that will pay off if I keep going?\n\n\\- Or does my curl pattern/head shape honestly suit short hair better?\n\n2. If the answer is “keep growing”, should I be doing maintenance shaping (sides, neckline, around the ears) to keep it looking intentional?\n\n3. If the answer is “cut it”, is there a shorter curly style that still works with my natural texture rather than against it?\n\nPhotos are anonymized. I’m genuinely open to either outcome—I’m just looking for curl-informed, impartial feedback.\n\n**Routine**:\n\nI shampoo and condition daily using Paul Mitchell Shampoo Two and Paul Mitchell Detangler conditioner.\n\nAfter showering, I do not towel dry. I let my hair air dry.\n\nWhile my hair is still damp, I apply a light Moroccan oil and DevaCurl cream using my hands. I apply both by scrunching the hair upward while my head is upright, letting the curls form naturally as they hang.\n\nI live in a humid area, so the products are mainly to control frizz.\n\nI do not currently use any protection while sleeping (no bonnet, scarf, or satin pillowcase), and I do not have a refresh routine on non-wash days.\n\nIf there’s anything else I should include for routine context, let me know.",

Over the past few weeks/months, I’ve developed a sudden cluster of very small, uniform white heads on my forehead (mostly between the brows and upper forehead, inner cheek (the cheeks next to the nose) They appeared pretty quickly and seem to spread in clusters rather than as individual pimples. They can be a tad itchy and tingly. It started 4 months ago with really small cluster itchy spots that have a lot of whiteheads but it disappeared so I didn’t think much. It comes back in those areas I mention continuously throughout the months but it wasn’t itchy anymore, but in the same areas the whiteheads seem to fill up over and over again. I thought I had a broken skin barrier so I stopped using actives and stuck to the purito oat in moisturizer. It helped for a little bit so I thought that was the case but then I woke up yesterday with more flare ups. Could this be fungal acne or something else?",

I don’t want my nice shark getting broken or stolen. Any recommendations? Google suggested the tideway, any thoughts on those? \n\nRoutine: shampoo (2xweek), condition, leave-in, all shea moisture manuka honey &amp; mafura oil. Style with curlWOW cream and shea moisture gel, comb it all through to apply. Styling I microplop with microfiber towel, diffuse to set, and then air dry. My hair is prone to dryness and frizz, though lately it’s been very sleek and soft. Don’t wear any protection to sleep, no refresh routine.\n\nThanks!",

Small pimples keep coming back, and even when they heal, they leave dark marks that take forever to fade.\nI’ve been using tretinoin 0.05% for about a month now (3x a week), along with benzoyl peroxide (spot treatment), a niacinamide + salicylic acid face wash, and a basic hyaluronic moisturizer. I recently started taking Evion 400 as well. I trim my beard (don’t shave).\nI know tretinoin takes time, but honestly, it’s hard to stay patient when your skin looks worse before it looks better. Some days I feel like I’m doing everything right and still not seeing “clear” skin. The marks, uneven texture, and occasional breakouts really mess with my mental state.I’m not looking for miracle cures — just realistic expectations and advice from people who’ve been through this:\nHow long did it actually take for your skin to clear on tret?\nWhen did the “glow” start showing up?\nAny mistakes you wish you hadn’t made early on?\nWould really appreciate hearing real experiences.\n\nThanks for reading 🙏🏻 ",
