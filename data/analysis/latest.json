The difference is astounding. I've never had legs or arms or an ass this smooth, my husband literally can't stop feeling me up and tbh neither can I. I have strawberry legs and while this routine hasn't done much for that, I am STUNNED by the way these products have completely transformed my skin. Did everyone know about this and didn't tell me for like 30 years?! Idk but I hope if anyone else is having rough bumpy/dark areas and ingrown hairs, that this helps them. I didn't think this level of smoothness was possible for my skin! 🥳",

Longer bangs are non negotiable, and I also don’t want any fades or tapers because I’m so bored with getting those over and over again. I just want something that can keep some length on the sides and back, while also feeling a bit more tidy or clean. I’ve tried looking all over Google, but nothing really seemed like it would suit me or my head shape.

Any advice/tips on a low effort routine? Or help to figure out my curl tupe so i have a starting place? Does hair get curlier with age? \nI'm wearing my hair in an almost permanent bun because i have no idea how to style it. 🫠\n\nI bleached the sh*t out of my hair a few years ago and while I was trying to focus on repairing my hair and scalp health my previously thought wavy-ish hair is growing back in a defiant spiral/ringlet pattern, that is refusing to be or stay straight. My baby hairs are like springs sticking out from my head. The slightest moisture in the air and the hair body developes really loose sprial waves and the baby hairs are ringlets again. \n\n**the photo is from a wash day, after wrapping my hair, bowdrying upside down then sectioning. This is the level of curl I am getting when activly trying for straight hair.\n\nI go to gym 3-4 times a week. Currently I wash my hair once a week with the Dr. For Hair Folligen Silk shampoo and Treatment. I use the UNOVE Heating Guard before I blowdry my hair. I will also use hair oil the Mise-en-scene Perfect Serum is the best ive found for my hair in terms of both mousture and reducing frizz.\nThe way I currently dry my hair is wrapping my hair in a cotton hair wrap, after that flip my head upside down dry till 90%, then flip upright section my hair and round brush straight. This is what i was taught growing up. \n\nI sleep with a silk bonnet but I move around a lot so it often slips off. I have found it useful because the hair at my neck is extremely fine compared to the rest and used to break a lot. \nOtherwise my hair is both thick in volume and the strands, to the point where I warn hairdressers, they initially dont believe me and then are making surprised remarks are the shampoo bowl. \n\nI have tried to do a curly routine before the bleach issue but I know I was doing something wrong because after sleep and gym it loses it's shape, it didn't really feel clean and was generally super frizzy. I was trying to do a hair cast thing?¿ There is noticeable shrinkage when I previously tried a curly routine, like below shoulder blade length becoming collarbone length.\n\nTLDR; Please Help! I am clueless about my hair. After decades of styling my hair straight and damging it, my hair refuses to be straight.\nWhere do i start? \nHow do i make a low effort routine?\n\nThank you for any help!!",

      "content": "Took me a while, but I think I’ve finally figured out how to make my Dyson styling actually work — especially on my curly (2C/3A) hair.\n\nThis is the exact order I follow:\n\n• On damp hair, I apply a damage-repair leave-in. Currently using the Redken ABC leave-in.\n\n• Then I layer a small amount of L’Oréal Paris Hyaluron leave-in for extra moisture and the L’Oréal Extraordinary Oil serum for smoothness and shine.\n\n• I let my hair air dry a bit before using heat. If I’m in a hurry, I rough dry slightly first.\n\nFor styling:\n\nMost days, I either use just the round brush attachment for a simple blowout, or just the paddle brush if I want it straighter and sleeker.\n\nToday, I first used the paddle brush attachment to smooth everything out and create a base. After that, I switched to the round barrel attachment for volume and a soft 90s-style blowout.\n\nI work in smaller sections — around 3 seconds on high heat, followed by 4 seconds of cool shot to set.\n\nThe most important step: hairspray after finishing each section. I used Schwarzkopf Taft Ultra. That’s what actually makes the style last without making it stiff.\n\nPeople at work have been asking if I style my hair every day, but I don’t. I do this once a week and it lasts till my next wash.\n\nSharing pictures because this might be my best Dyson day so far.",

Now main issue is, I used Cerave for years as moisturizer but I am noticing this is actually giving me painful red bumps on my cheeks.  I stopped using it to make sure it is the actual culprit. But now I don't know what to choose as moisturizers in this cold freezing winter. My skin is really dry and starts peeling sometimes. Cant tolerate any products with fragnance.

I LOVE my hair and style it with a curl defining gel and a foaming moose after my showers, before I defuse my hair. Here’s my question, I want to curl my hair with a curly iron for a fancy event coming up, but it’s in between my hair wash days (I wash and restyle my hair every 3-4 days depending.) I try not to deviate from this schedule too much and like to keep my hair dry if I’m not explicitly washing and restyling it. If I already have my styling products in my hair for a few days, is it ok to curl my hair with heat, or will this dry my hair? Let me know if this question doesn’t make sense haha. I don’t curl my hair often since I love my natural curls, so I’m not sure what’s safe or not for my hair. I DO NOT want to damage my natural curls too much (I know that curling them with heat will hurt them a little, but I wanna make sure I don’t fry them to the point of no return yk?) Any advice will be appreciated! 🙏🙏 add ons about my routine in case it’s important: I have a silk pillowcase, I pineapple my hair to sleep, and I switch between inersense hydrating shampoo and conditioner and deva curl’s low-poo conditioner",

      "content": "Since winter has started, I’ve noticed my skin completely change. Usually in the summer or warm weather it’s oily and in the winter it’s dry. Recently though it’s been much much dryer than usual out of nowhere. I like to keep a pretty basic routine as I break out extremely easily with products. I would stay using a richer cream but I find they seem to constantly break me out, clog my pores and make my skin look duller. However, I find lighter weight moisturizers don’t provide enough hydration for what I need and my face feels tight within an hour again.\n\nBelow is my routine and I’ll also attach some photos of my skin currently.\n\nAlso, as for product suggestions. I don’t have a budget or cap. \n\nAM:\n\n• Wash face with water\n\n• Mad Hippie Vitamin C Serum\n\n• Cerave Moisturizing Lotion\n\n• Elta MD UV clear SPF\n\nPM:\n\n• Prequel Glycerin Cleanser\n\n• Cerave Moisturizing Lotion",
