      "content": "Early male, 20s. I have two toned lips but nothing really helped with that pigmentation, so I'm not gonna talk about it and I made peace with it. I'll review the spf and non-spf ones separately:\n\n#SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Chaptex spf 15 🟢\n\n- My derm prescribed me this when I had extremely dry and cracked lips (turned out to be cheilitis)\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, no fragrance, doesn't taste bitter, has humectant (D-Panthenol)\n\n- Has only spf 15. I see most people suggesting to use at least spf 30 or higher. I wish they made a spf 30 version\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##2. NMFe spf 40 🟢\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, has slight fragrance (I like it), has humectant (aloe vera extract)\n\n- It tastes bitter, that's the only complaint I have\n\n- Overall: 9.5/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##3. Sebamed spf 30 🔴\n\n- Has slight fragrance (didn't like it), very expensive, wasn't that moisturizing\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##4. Minimalist spf 30 (not in the picture) 🟢\n\n- Super cute packaging (but the lid broke after a few months 🥲), fragrance free, has humectant (Hyaluronic acid)\n\n- it's waxy, not quite easy to spread\n\n- Overall: 8.5/10. Will probably repurchase.\n\n___\n\n___\n\n#Non-SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Vaseline lip therapy Creme Brulee 🔴🟢\n\n- The caption under it says *for deliciously kissable lips* which hurts even more because it reminds me I have no-one to kiss 😭💀\n\n- It smells exactly like the Vaseline lip therapy cocoa butter one, it's very hard to differentiate the smell. Quite moisturizing, love the smell obv\n\n- Little heavy on the pocket (probably because it's imported?)\n\n- Overall: 8/10 (subtracted 1 for the caption). WNRP\n\n___\n\n##2. Vaseline skin protecting jelly (indian version) 🟢\n\n- Almost every Indian household has it lol. It's good, does its job\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##3. Vaseline BLUESEAL pure petroleum jelly (imported) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT! I wish they sold this here in India everywhere instead of the skin protecting jelly\n\n- I bought it from Amazon but I was skeptical initially because of the picture the seller put on Amazon lol.\n\n- It's AMAZING! Seals the moisture very well and I also use it for slugging in the night. It's smoother and more buttery compared to the Indian version we get\n\n- I don't use it on the lips alone, I'll be mentioning my current routine which is helped me the most at the end of the post\n\n- Overall: 11/10. WRP! HG\n\n___\n\n##4. Nipcare 🔴\n\n- Bought it at the expense of weird looks from the pharmacy guy (didn't know it is used by lactating mothers for sore nipples)\n\n- It smells really awful (Lanolin, can't complain), didn't really do much for my lips and it's also not easy to spread it\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##5. Laneige Lip sleeping mask (berry) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT 🐐 helped me so much with my dry lips. Not a big fan of that smell but it doesn't bother me. Leaves a white film on lips and I rub the entire thing off in the morning after waking up and there you go, plumpy soft lips!\n\n- It's probably a little overpriced but it lasts really long so can't complain ig\n\n- Overall: 10/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##6. LRP Cicaplast B5 baume 🔴\n\n- I didn't know you can also use it as a lip balm until I read some of the comments here but it didn't do anything for my lips and they felt even more dry in the morning \n\n- it's good as a barrier repair cream tho, helped me with redness and irritation near nose corners when I increased my tret frequency \n\n- Overall: 0/10 for lips, 8.5/10 for barrier repair\n\n___\n\n##7. Vaseline lip therapy tin (cocoa &amp; original) 🟢\n\n- It was a pain in the a*s to open the packaging but I bought the original one recently and it was super easy to open. Glad they changed its packaging (not sure about the cocoa one tho)\n\n- It's thick, does its job as an occlusive\n\n- Both of them are good. The cocoa one smells heavenly but I personally found the original one to be better.\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##8. Vaseline lip care total moisture (tube) (not in the picture) 🟢🔴\n\n- I love the smell, it's amazing! Very glossy finish and hydrates well. Affordable!\n\n- Hard to apply with that spherical base and I don't like touching it \n\n- Overall: 7/10. WRP\n___\n\n##9. Nova ayurvedic cream 🔴\n\n- My grandma suggested me this one. It's good with the hydration part but the fragrance is veryyy heavy and the lips kinda burn initially after application \n\n- Overall: 3/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##Current routine:\n\nAM: NMFe\n\nPM: Laneige lip sleeping mask + Vaseline BLUESEAL \n\nThis routine helped me so much with dry lips. But not applying lip balm for even 1 day makes my lips dry again. My derm suggested that I use lip balm at least thrice a day and asked me to reapply whenever they felt dry. \n\n___\n\n##HONORARY MENTION: Brillare natural coconut lip balm \n\nWHAT DO I EVEN SAY? Hate is a strong word and I hate this lip balm with a passion. The texture of it is ugly af, it literally sticks to my finger. It smells like shit. I have tried applying it only once and was weirded out with the texture but still wanted to try and apply. This idiot doesn't even spread, it's that thick and sticky. THE WORST LIP BALM I'VE EVER SEEN 🏆",

I don’t diffuse because I avoid using heat on my hair.\n\nThe hair on the nape of my neck and around my ears is ringlet type curls, but the hair from the crown of my head is just kinda vaguely wavy.

This was particularly evident on my shoulders, back, as well as chest. I've been fortunate that my face has remained mostly clear, with only \\~1 pimple every few weeks or so. Beginning November, I added in 25mg/day oxandrolone (anavar), which is a mild DHT-derivative oral AAS. This seemed to slightly increase the frequency of new pimples--not to a great extent, but noticeable to myself. I've included some pictures of my back. Honestly, it looks worse IMO in person...but, if you zoom you should be able to see some bigger pimples on the lower back, and many small red bump-like marks around. I'm not sure how mild or moderate this would be considered.\n\n\\-Current Routine:  \nAM - Shower with Dial antibacterial soap on face, body (loofa brush for back), followed by 4% benzoyl peroxide creamy wash on face, shoulders, chest, back.  \nStridex 2% salicylic acid pads lightly on face, and over problem areas (shoulders, chest, back).\n\nPM - Shower with Dial antibacterial soap on face, body etc. Sometimes I will follow this with another 4% benzoyl peroxide wash if I think my skin can tolerate it.  \nStridex 2% salicylic acid pads again lightly on face, and over problem areas.  \nStarted to include aloe vera-based facial moisturizer on face and a little on shoulders, traps, chest, neck just to mitigate irritation.\n\n\\-My diet is PRECISE and very low-fat, \"clean\" food. I NEVER eat out. I NEVER eat any greasy food. I don't drink any alcohol. I eat plenty of vegetables, some fruits. I take a variety of health supplements (fish oil, curcumin, D3/K2, Zinc, Ubiquinol, Vit C, NAC, greens powder, L-Glutamine, Magnesium glycinate, Nattokinase, Astragalus). The only dairy I eat is fermented--i.e., fat-free greek yogurt. No cheese or anything like that in my typical diet. I sleep 7-8 hrs nearly every night.\n\n\\-2 weeks ago added high dose pantothenic acid (B5) at \\~2-3g/day, as this has been purported as sort of bro-science remedy for AAS-induced acne. Additionally, I ordered 3 months worth of 10mg generic Accutane from an overseas pharmacy source. This is to attempt a very low-dose isotrentinoin treatment, specifically if my acne progresses and becomes worse. Would likely start as low as 10mg every other day, which is a very low dose from my understanding. This is a back up.\n\n\\-I understand my acne is fairly mild at this point. HOWEVER, I don't plan on staying at 150mg/wk testosterone. My plan is to titrate my dosage to upwards of 300mg/wk, which I've delayed doing in fear that my acne will go full blown at that point. I'd like to get this totally under control before I begin increasing the anabolic load.\n\nIs there anything else you would recommend? I also don't know if using a moisturizer is actually a good idea considering AAS-induced acne is largely caused by increase sebaceous oil production; wouldn't that mean I'm over moisturized to an extent? Thus, wouldn't using stridex pads/benzoyl peroxide dry the skin out enough to bring it down to normal? Adding moisturizer back on top of that would seem to just add more of something to clog my pores? That's just my logic, which I admit could be totally flawed.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

It started with mild irritation on one side and now feels slightly sore/burning, especially when my lips rub together.\n\nThere’s no oozing, crusting, or open sores. I don’t usually have issues in this area and haven’t changed toothpaste, lip balm, or face wash recently.\n\nRight now I’ve applied a thin layer of **Boroline**, but I’m unsure whether I should leave the area alone instead. I won’t be able to see a dermatologist until later this week.\n\nI’m **not looking for a diagnosis**, just skincare guidance:\n\n* Is it better to avoid products entirely when lips are irritated?\n* Are occlusives okay, or can they worsen irritation in this area?\n* Any common triggers around the lip area I should watch out for?\n\nThanks!",

The part I’m struggling with the most is the super short top layer that feels very blunt? Like there’s a bob sitting on top of my longer hair? And the top layer feels like it’s got half my hair in it.\n\nI’m wondering if this is a live and learn situation or if there’s something I can ask for in a salon to make these results more livable as they grow out. Tips for living with it also welcome!\n\nFor reference, I have fine, dense hair that’s mostly straight. I usually wear it blown out with a blowout brush and I wanted more layers to achieve the coveted Dyson look. First two photos are with salon’s styling, last three photos are after rough drying.",

I’m not too sure how to go about sorting it out so I was hoping someone with similar skin to me can point me in the right direction 😁\n\nI suspect my skin is overcompensating, as I don’t normally produce much oil but I am producing a lot at the moment. The skin around my mouth feels really horrible, almost quite tight. The product I use are:\n\nMorning:\nCeraVe Hydrating Oil Foaming Cleanser\nSimple Hydrating Light Moisturiser (with niacinamide)\n\nEvening:\n\nCeraVe Hydrating Oil Foaming Cleanser\nSimple Hydrating Light Moisturiser (with niacinamide\n5% benzoyl peroxide \n\nOccasionally:\nLa Roche posay cicaplaust baume (probably 2x per week)\n\nIf anyone shares these problems and can point me in the right direction I would be very grateful, thank you 🙏 \n\n\n",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

I started dying my hair about 4 - 6 years ago and since then she’s been on a journey, I started with simple highlights,I’ve split dyed it, bleached it myself, bobbed it, let it grow for a year, got bangs, bleached it again, dyed it black myself, gotten extensions, gotten wefts sew ins, everything, now my hair “won’t lift” and I have a blue shadow root from the grow out of my last black at home dye job. When my hair dresser first dyed it blue. I hated it. So I dyed it a darker blue by myself at home. With splat. (Don’t yell at me I know it was wrong) now I want to just go back to black and leave it nice and simple. But I’m not sure how I want to do it? I have a weird messy layers kind of cut going on with some very over grown curtain bangs. I’m not sure if I should chop it all and start over or let it grow and try and take extra care of it. What’s everyone else’s opinion, I’m so relaxed abt what my hair looks like that I’ve never stopped to think about what style suits me best, or how to even take care of it. My hair is dry frizzy and unhappy. I just don’t know what’s my next step. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!!",
