      "content": "Hi everyone, K. Hoe here.\n\nI've been quiet on Reddit for the past several months, but hearing what's been going on in this space has made me claw right back on here.\n\nThis 2-minute rant comes inspired by a post I ran into yesterday, that mentioned how 10-year-olds are already worried of wrinkles on TikTok.\n\n??????????????\n\nAs someone that's worked in this space and specifically dealt with consumer psychology, I want to further give my two cents on that.\n\nIf you're a parent, this should make your blood boil.\n\nShay Mitchell just released a skincare line specifically **targeted** at kids - with the main visuals being two little kids that can't be older than 6-7 with sheet masks.\n\nI thought I had a higher tolerance bar for BS like this, but seeing someone - nevermind an influencer with a huge reach - prey on kids like that has made me ballistic. It’s predatory marketing disguised as \"empowerment\" (on top of being a little too perfectly timed given Black Friday shopping frenzy happening in 2 weeks)\n\nEvery single inch of this \"project\" is designed to pull kids into the same dopamine-driven consumer loop so many adults are already in.\n\n* it promotes hyper consumerism\n* it sets sick standards IN CHILDREN for monetary gain\n* it literally cancels out any (hopefully) rational values we spent YEARS setting in our kids\n\nI could never. ever. EVER be able to live with myself if I'd have to market products to kids.\n\nOn top of that, once an influencer normalizes this, these things can echo far and wide, and they impact those around us, which in turn impacts the environment around us - which in turn impacts *us* and those *close* to us.\n\nKids will copy kids. Parents will get pressured. And so on repeat until it's normal to see a seven year old talking to, potentially *your child*, about stuff like “anti-aging”\n\nSomeone else is trying to define standards for *your* kids - **for profit** \\- before your child even knows what a standard is.\n\nWe need to let kids be kids, play, run, fall of a bike, roll in mud, have a proper childhood, and grow up without worrying about crap like this.\n\nI'm not a psychologist, but I say this with a high level of certainty: once a kid learns to look at their face as something that needs fixing, they will *never* see themselves the same way again.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Stripped of marketing, 1) does older hair need its own formulation 2) can or has it been done? ",

      "content": "First 2 pics are from 2021, last one is my current hair. I’m just wondering if anyone might have some advice on what’s going on!\n\nBefore I started CGM in 2020, my hair was a frizzy, undefined, dry mess. I didn’t know I had textured hair at all; I thought it was just sad and damaged. I was using Dove Intensive Repair (I think?) up until I started experimenting with curly products and suddenly I had amazing ringlets and waves. \n\nIn 2020 I was using primarily Shea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine shampoo, conditioner, and curl enhancing smoothie. So lots of protein! I would also mix in some other haircare brands with gels, mousses, etc. and I would use a lot of cream. At that point my hair loved it and never got weighed down.\n\nFast forward to today, the slightest bit of protein ruins my hair, and my waves are continuously loosening. I stopped using anything with protein altogether. This last time I washed my hair I figured that I *must* need some protein, because things just aren’t making sense. I put in some AG Recoil after the shower (which has protein about halfway down the ingredient list), and my hair is so sad and sticky and limp. Otherwise, my hair still feels and looks much better when I use my regular moisturizing products (which are no longer strictly CGM). However, I’m still concerned about my texture.\n\nCould this be a hormone thing, or my hair just changing over time? Could it be length? \n\nAnother thing I’m curious about is the fact that I learned how to treat my hair wavy/curly (scrunching, less brushing, using products, diffusing, etc.) at the same time I stopped using sulphates and silicones. I almost wonder if those weren’t necessarily making my hair dry and pouffy, but just the fact that I didn’t know how to style it. Before learning anything to do with CGM, I used to vigorously rub my hair with the towel out of the shower (with zero product). I know, it’s so bad!\n\nSo in general, I’m confused about the changes in my hair and its behaviour. I would say it’s high porosity, and I have fine, medium, and coarse strands all over my head. Most of it is medium though. I’m thinking perhaps I need to let go of how my hair used to behave, and that maybe I need way less products now? It’s hard to change my mindset after years of heavy products doing amazing things on my hair, and now it’s getting flatter and flatter even when I use light products.\n\nRoutine\n\nShampoo: Garnier Honey Water shampoo (this is brand new for me and has sulphates which have been working better so far)\n\nConditioner: Garnier Honey Water conditioner (this is CG friendly, and I love it!)\n\nAfter shower: Garnier Honey Water cream and Innersense I Create Hold gel. Sometimes I’ll use Carina Organics Sweet Pea leave in and John Frieda Dream Curls gel.",

      "content": "i’ve had acne since middle school, and i am now in college. it’s generally not cystic, but my skin is constantly inflamed because i compulsively pick/pop any little bump or pimple i get. i’ve been trying to stop forever, and genuinely the only thing that works is not having anything to pick at. i went to the derm years ago and they prescribed doxycycline and a topical (i don’t remember the name) that smelled and felt like rubbing alcohol. didn’t do any good. i’ve tried basically every drugstore brand: cerave, cetaphil, laroche posay, nutrogena, etc. the only thing that has ever worked was curology but it was too expensive and stopped working after a year. even the smallest dose of tretinioin dries out my face so bad i look like a snake shedding skin and it’s genuinely disgusting. i’m currently trying panoxyl, and it seems to help but can’t compensate for my picking. it’s gotten to the point where i hate to be in public because i look like a leper. i’ve never met or seen anyone whose acne looks like mine, so i will take any advice. if you know how to stop picking, if you’ve had or seen acne like mine and a product worked, anything. also my skin is somehow both violently oily and violently dry at the same time in the same places. my skin will be peeling off all over but the skin will feel oily and greasy to the touch.\n\ncurrent routine is panoxyl 10% bp foaming wash and i leave that on for three minutes at night, followed by the salicylic acid toner from panoxyl. then in the morning i just use the good molecules lightweight daily moisturizer. if i really feel like i need to wash my face i just use the curology gentle cleanser or the peach and lily hydrobubble deep foaming cleanser",

I finally have a gym membership for it, a local poo facility is available, and I've successfully gotten someone to teach me. Cool, right?\n\nWell, now I have a bunch of questions in regards to skincare. I have dry skin, and am prone to seborrheic dermatitis. I get those nice oily patches on my forehead and on my cheekbones when I have a breakout.\n\n2x month (or like every other week) I like to use a dermapen to microneedle. It's very shallow at .60 needle length. 4x a year, I DIY a TCA 12% Peel. I am really happy with doing these things. Don't lecture me, it works for me.\n\nMy questions come for how to work around swimming with this schedule. For the peel, obviously no swimming for at least 3 weeks (or until peeling and redness are fully gone). But, for shallow miccroneedling, how much time is appropriate?\n\nAnd, that got me to thinking about exfoliation. I use The Ordinary's Azaleic Acid 2-3x a week, and will occasionally use Paula's Choice 1x a week (if I'm really congested.) If I apply the night before, am I ok to swim again in the evening?\n\nWill applying vaseline to skin or any type of occlusive help? My skin is already prone to dryness. How can I protect it from the chlorine while swimming? Any tips and tricks?\n\nThank you all!",

      "content": "In my younger years, going without washing my hair was no problem for me. Now I work a blue collar job, I've got my head next to running car's tail pipes for like a quarter of the day and I end up smelling like exhaust by the end of the day, so I feel like I have to wash my hair every day! I know it's not great for my hair, but I don't really know what else to do. I'd try dry shampoo but then I'd have to brush it out and brushing my hair while it's dry always makes it so much more frizzy. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nPer the rules of the sub, I must include my routine (thought I don't know that it's really relevant to the post) so here's what I use.\n\n- As I am Cowash most days\n- Kristin Ess Clarifying Shampoo once a week, immediately followed by Mielle Rosemary Mint Hair Masque\n- Kristin Ess Curl Shampoo and Conditioner on days that I don't use anything that hasn't already been listed. (This is a new addition to the routine, and still kinda in the experimental phase. I had been trying a few different products from Shea Moisture but none of them were really working out for me)\n- A customer at work today recommended As I Am leave in conditioner because we've got basically the same hair except his is in much better health, so that's going in the routine starting today\n- I've been using a microfiber towel to get my hair from \"wet\" to \"damp\" before brushing, but the previously mentioned customer recommended switching to using an old t-shirt (and I'm gonna switch back because I used to use old t-shirts and my hair was in much better shape back then)\n- After Brushing I apply Kristin Ess softening oil to the ends of my hair at the suggestion of my gf to reduce frizz.\n\nIf anything I've mentioned in my routine raises some eyebrows, please say something! I'm at my wit's end trying to get my hair back to how it used to be!",

Currently, I’m dealing with 2 deep pimples on my forehead, which is unusual for me.\n\nInitially, I would wash my face in the morning with Vanicream cleanser, apply BP/CLI, and then apply the Vanicream moisturizing sunscreen. I was having a lot of initial issues with dry skin, so I recently (3 weeks ago) started buffering the morning application of BP/CLI with VaniCream face moisturizer (non-sunscreen version). This has helped a lot with dryness. At night, I wash my face with the same cleanser, apply Vanicream moisturizer, then tretinoin 0.025%, then another layer of moisturizer.\n\nIs this buffering limiting the effectiveness of BP/CLI (or tret)? I use a pea-sized amount of both BP/CLI and tret. I also started taking spironolactone 50mg around the same time I started this routine; I’m wondering if I just need to request an increased dosage to start seeing improvements in my acne :( feeling frustrated, and any advice helps!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
