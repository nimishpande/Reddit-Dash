      "content": "My hair goes through a decent amount of curl shock when it gets cut. I want to keep it trimmed and healthy, but I got into a bad habit of getting my hair cut right when it starts to look really good, and seeing multiple different stylists 😬 2 hair cuts ago, my hair still hadn't recovered after a month. I managed to make little cuts myself and things were looking good (see last post :) \n\nThough it looked good, it was super uneven, so I went and got it cut again 😅 I went to my casual but badass friend who has really similar hair. She did my hair 4 times ago, and it grew out the BEST. So I went back to her. I always get a quick dry cut with no styling, so to be fair, the 1st picture isn't indicative of her technique, but just to show what I was working with.\n\nMy hair has been getting dry and frizzy quicker than normal. I was having a hard time styling it and the curls kept falling. I was worried I got another bad cut. Last night I gave it some extra love! Here is my routine:\n\nPaul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo on the scalp, NYM green tea shampoo on the ends. Squish to rinse. Then I brought back my fave DC, Curls Blueberry Bliss. Kept it on for 5 min. Combed it and squished to rinse. The curl clumps were INSANE! Added a tiny bit of NYM conditioner and rinsed, just for slip. MORE SQUISHING. Glazed on some Kinky Curly Knot Today leave in. \n\nI ran a wet brush through my face framing pieces to smooth them out. My hair is really fine. Spritzed with water. Smoothed in my #1 fave, Treluxe Styling Serum. Then slicked the clumps between my hands with Umberto Gianni Curl Jelly. Some gentle squishing. It was looking like a bit too much product, so I spritzed in more more. Maybe. Little too much lol. It is a delicate dance, water and product, but I ended completely frizz free. At the last second, I scrunched in a tiny bit of Curlsmith Featherlight Protein Cream. \n\nI know thats a lot, but my hair needed it! I diffused on high as long as I could. Pic 1- after hair cut 2nd- 90% dry 3rd/4th - curls in their fluffed and filtered glory. My hair is sooo soft, clean, and well defined. I'm in heaven! ✨️",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I don’t know what products or shampoos and things are best for my hair. My whole family has wavy or straight hair except my biological father who had almost Afro curly hair. I took after him but my hair isn’t as curly. My mom never knew what to do with my hair either so my childhood was filled with hours of straightening, just leaving it in a bun/ponytail or using products that chemically straightened my hair. I haven’t done any of that since I was about 16 however. I’ve let my hair do its thing since but I have no idea how to maintenance it. My hair curls nicely by itself on the lower layers but when it comes to the crown of my head, it seems to just frizzle and give up. \n\nMy Routine: I use the rawsugar brand of shampoo and conditioner (Restore and Clarify one), and have a leave in conditioner (By Marc Anthony) I put in after, typically letting my hair hair dry. I don’t have silk pillowcases or bonnets. I’m not even sure how to properly do all that 😅 I treated my hair as if it was wavy I guess. So I’m kinda starting fresh as I have no idea how this works. So any tips or advice would be awesome! ",

The pieces above my ears are way less curly than the rest so when I put my hair in front it looks so weird. My curls constantly roll together into huge clumps.

I can't seem to feel comfortable with them no matter what routine or tip or trick I try.\n\nWould someone who has mastered their curls be willing to message me and try to help me out? I need to talk to someone who knows a lot about curly hair\n\nMy routine:\n\nI start when Im fresh out of the shower. I make sure my hair is really wet and section off the crown. I put a little bit of leave in conditioner and curl cream (I found that doing both works best for me) then brush style small sections with the Bounce Curl volume brush. I then do the same with the crown, going for a no part look but my hair isn't voluminous or short enough to actually pull it off. I then use mousse and gel on the entire head. I air dry for about 5-15 minutes then diffuse (hovering for about 5-10 minutes then pixie diffusing). I go to bed with the gel cast and shake/scrunch it out in the morning. I don't refresh in between wash days because it makes it ten times worse.",

      "content": "I started wearing full face of makeup like 4 or 5 times a week a few months ago, so I began to use oil cleanser to wash off the makeup. I recently noticed my skin being really red around my forehead, nose, chin and cheeks more than usual. I usually have fairly clear skin with a little redness around my nose and cheeks with some bumps on my forehead, but it has gotten so much more prominent. I have stubborn pimples and red dots on my forehead and cheeks that wont clear up (and these types of things usually clear up in a day or two for me).\n\nNow everytime I do my skincare at night after double cleansing my face (oil cleanser and foam cleanser), when I put on my skincare, my skin feels so even drier, hot and just tight. I currently use roundlab dokdo toner, hadalabo premium lotion and roundlab birch moisturizer.\n\nIs there alternative way to remove like a 'full face of makeup' without an oil cleanser and what are some products you would recommend to fix dehydrated skin?\n\nSIDE NOTE: The amount of times I wear a \"full face\" may seem crazy idk, but i just really enjoy doing my makeup and a full face to me is like blush, powder, concealer, contour and mascara (heavy waterproof one, so I have only found oil cleansers to really help remove all of it :( ).\n\nOther side note: I did recently move from the west to east coast of Canada, and my room is always very hot because of the lack of AC, so I always have my fan going... so I was wondering maybe if that had anything to do with my dry skin too....\n\nAny advice is appreciated,, thank youuu",

There are so many tutorials on the internet which make it so confusing to decide what to follow and what to avoid.\n\nMy current routine:\n\nI oil my hair a few hours before washing (amla+ rosemary+ argan oil mixture). Then I use the Loreal hyaluron shampoo + conditioner. After shower, I use a Leave in conditioner to detangle and use the Loreal professional techni art hair mousse. I let my hair air dry. After its dry, I scrunch it with Argan oil or serum.\n\nI would also like to know what curl type I have since Ive gotten conflicting opinions.\n\nAny suggestions/ recommendations would be appreciated!",

I've struggled with this mop since I was a kid when my mom brushed it out and then had short styles as soon as she let me cut it when I was around 16 years old. I left it short (and cut it myself) for most of my life, but have been growing it long the last 10 years... I'm not fully sure why since I'm so dissatisfied with it, but I think also because I've gained a lot of weight after some psychiatric issues and I always promised myself if I lost the weight, I'd lose the hair too - that would be my prize. \n\n**I would love ideas how to firm up the curls or make it not look like it looks now in the absolute easiest way possible**. It gets very frizzy (I don't mind some frizz tho), but it's the partial stringy curls that drive me crazy. I DO box dye my hair because I have very little money to spend on myself and not dyeing it monthly is *not* an option. \n\nI know myself and I will not spend a lot of time on my hair. A very solid 90% of the time, my hair is up in a bun because it looks like this. Do I even have options? 😭\n\nRoutine: Wash &amp; condition with L'Oreal Ever Strong Sulfate-Free Thickening duo, scrunch w/ Miss Jessie's Coily Custard, air dry preferably/diffuse usually... also not usually parted in the middle",

Back in my teen years I tried every product and technique (thanks to OG YouTube) to get any kind of curl — and oh man, the results were awful. To be fair, I had absolutely no clue what I was doing and zero knowledge about hair care ahaha\n\nEventually I gave up and started heat-curling my hair almost every day for years. \n\nFast forward to now — I’m 28 and haven’t used any heat tools for 2–3 years, but I always do some kind of heatless curls method (my hair takes “shape” super easily and keeps it for days, if that makes sense).\n\nPIC 1: Hair air-dried with my normal routine (some kind of moisturizing serum, leave-in conditioner, and hair oil — I gently brush between each step to spread the product). It’s basically a bird’s nest. Straight but also so poofy and frizzy. Honestly could be cast as Hagrid.\n\nPIC 2: Next-day hair after my “heatless curls” method (aka a loose bun with a big scrunchie).\n\nPIC 3-4-5: Wash day (today). After seeing a post here — and still secretly hoping I might have a hidden wavy pattern — I decided not to brush after washing. I just sprayed some moisturizing stuff and scrunched in my leave-in conditioner. Air-dried (about 90% dry in the pics)...\nWHAT IN THE WORLD?? DO I ACTUALLY HAVE WAVY HAIR?!\n\nI’m so excited!!!! But I have no idea what to do next. I’m looking for any advice on how to build a routine and make the most of these waves. I know nothing. This is literally day one for me and I’m ready to learn \n\nWould also love product recs — affordable stuff I can find easily in Canada would be amazing!\n\nOther info:\n\n- My hair is very thick and there’s a ton of it\n\n- It’s always been dry and frizzy so I usually stick to hydrating products\n\n- I got highlights done (once) a few years ago, nothing else color-wise\n\n- I’ve got a couple split ends so I know it’s trim time, but honestly it’s pretty healthy despite it looking like a horse’s dinner\n\n**** I'm an autistic burned-out girlie that gets easily overwhelmed with online interaction so I promise I'll read every/any comment but may not be commenting a whole lot myself",

If theres any other waxing brand that doesn’t necessarily need a wax melter feel free to tell me about that too. Thank you very much for any help!",

I think I have fungal acne on my forehead (it’s super itchy) and closed comedones on my cheeks.\n\nI’ve been using a salicylic acid cleanser (2x a week), BHA toner, and azelaic acid cream (from Paula’s Choice), but nothing seems to help. I’ve also tried extracting them with removal tools because yellow stuff comes out when I do — but it never fully goes away. I heard you’re supposed to extract them since my skin is oily and congested… but honestly, I have no idea anymore.\n\nMy skin doesn’t react well to harsh products, so I’m super confused about what to try next. Every product on TikTok has mixed reviews, some people swear by it, others say it ruined their skin. Do anti-dandruff shampoos actually work for this? Should I try Differin?\n\nI’m honestly so tired of dealing with this. Any advice, routines, or gentle products that actually help sensitive, acne-prone skin would mean the world right now. 🙏",

      "content": "Hi!!! I have a dilema. (45)F\nI have extremely dry and tight skin (and when I say tight, I don't mean in a youthful \"I have so much collagen\" way, I mean in a parched earth, devoid of all moisture kind of way).  I use tretinoin which occasionally causes some irritation and additional dryness and flakiness. But, I have my routine down now I think. Well, I thought...\n\nIn the evening, I cleanse, red led light mask, snail mucin essence, tretinoin, peptides, then a THICK ass layer of Glysolid glycerin cream (my newest holy grail of moisturizers). When I wake up in the morning my skin feels plump and well moisturized. I do not wash my face again in the morning because the layer of Glysolid maintains the moisture throughout the day and helps me to not get flaky under my foundation. I don't want to wash off all that yummy moisturizer just to have to apply a sucky daytime/under makeup moisturizer that doesn't work as well and turns me back into a lizard by noon. And Glysolid is just way too thick and absorbs way too slow to apply in the am to then immediately apply foundation. \nSo my AM routine is simply sunscreen, then makeup.\n\nMy issue is that I just bought a vitamin c serum and would like to incorporate it into my morning routine. I know that you need to apply it to a clean face.\nSo all that said... \nAny suggestions on the lightest cleansing possible that would still allow good vitamin c absorption? Could I just use a cleansing wipe? Micellar water? Must I go full soap and water? I don't think my skin can handle an additional wash each day.\nAnd any suggestions on a thick rich moisturizer that wears well under foundation? Preferably that doesn't cost $100.\nOr should I just give up on the vitamin c serum altogether?  I am kind of thinking this is the best option for me because my routine is working too good for me right now to mess with it. Do I really need it? Do you all see amazing results? Results so great that you would never consider to stop using it? I would really love to hear your thoughts. \n\nSide note: Once I use up all the snail mucin, I probably won't repurchase. I bought it for skin barrier protection and I find that it doesn't work all that awesome. Suggestions for barrier protection are also welcome!\n\nThanks all for your expertise, and sorry for the rambling!",

My head constantly feels itchy, and it hurts for me to shower sometimes because some portions of my scalp feel raw. But even after I do wash my hair, there are small flakes stuck to my wet hair. I feel I can’t wear certain colors of clothing and I’m constantly checking my shoulders to make sure there is no dead skin.\n\nI currently use Pantene as my shampoo/conditioner, and use Tea Tree leave in conditioner. I was my hair max 3 times per week. I have a scalp scrubber and will scrub my hair for a little over 5 minutes and let it sit with the product before rinsing. I also probably use heat maybe once or twice a week? I have a Dyson air wrap, or I just braid/pull up my hair. I don’t know what I am doing wrong? Is there any suggestions you guys have?
