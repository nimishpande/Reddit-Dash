      "title": "[B&amp;A] Forehead Closed Comedones &amp; Blackheads Progress",
      "content": "**Background** (feel free to skip this part): I had been suffering with closed comedones for years, starting since i was about 22 (I am now 26). When it first started, I admittedly did not have any skincare routine aside from the obvious facial cleanser (micellar water + face wash).\n\nThe first time I tried to get rid of them (2023), I was introduced to tret which fucked me up. I introduced a moisturizer with it and was using the sandwich method but fast forward a few months and my closed comedones were worse than ever (no pics since they are on my old phone). I used it as much as people were recommending (can’t really remember how many x a week now since its been so long) but i guess it damaged my skin barrier enough that my whole forehead was covered in clusters of closed comedones.\n\nAfter that, I was focused on just repairing my skin barrier and tried every ‘barrier repair’ moisturizer and every ‘non-comedogenic’ moisturizer in existence with no results. \n\nThe only thing that helped was monthly facial extractions - which was not ideal because I would be left with post extraction marks that took 1-2 weeks to go away, after which i was welcomed by more closed comedones (though never as bad as the tret aftermath) - and repeat.\n\nI know BHAs and AHAs are widely talked about here but after my tret experience, I was very reluctant to try any acids on my face in fear of damaging my skin barrier so I just kinda lived with it, getting monthly facials for god knows how long.\n\nI finally got tired of it and decided to buy Paula’s Choice 2% BHA, which is highly recommended on this sub, and the results have been amazing. I am beating myself up for not trying this sooner and for letting myself suffer for years before this.\n\n**Progress:** First pic is not anywhere close to what the worst of my skin has looked like but it’s the only one I have - keeping in mind this is 1 month after a facial extraction. Second pic is now - 2 weeks into Paula’s Choice BHA (using 1x/week). I know its annoying when people post pictures in different lighting but I took the first pic at some random place and can’t really replicate the same lighting - but hope it gives you the idea.\n\nI know its not yet perfect but for 2 weeks progress… I am shocked. As you can see, there are still some small bumps (blackheads/cc’s or whatever they are) but not obvious enough for me to feel the texture when i touch my face - which was my biggest anxiety trigger. Gonna keep this going and probably gonna slowly increase the frequency until I’m using it about 3x/week or every other day but I am for the first time seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n**Problem / Advice Needed**: I have been using a very lightweight non-comedogenic gel moisturizer (Skin Game Kind Watery Moisturizer) because I had always assumed it was comedogenic ingredients in cream moisturizers that clogged me up worse (e.g. think Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Moisture Cream). Now since using BHA, my skin is very very dry and it’s not that I have any issues with it right now but I’m pretty sure this won’t be good in the long run(?) - so any suggestions are more than welcome! I have also been thinking of adding an AHA (recently bought the COSRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid) but not sure if it’s a good idea.. please let me know what you think 😭",

      "content": "I just started trying to take care of my hair texture about 2 weeks ago and I stopped abusing it with flat irons and bleach/color recently but as my title suggests I’m way out of my depth, I was never taught how to take care of my hair properly, only chemical processing and heat styling since I was 8 and I only recently learned my hair type was not what I thought it was. Basically any tips, tricks, or advice from anyone here that has the same or similar hair type as me or anyone familiar with working with my hair type would be much appreciated.\n\nPhoto #1 was before I quit the constant bleaching and hair dye \n\nPhoto #2 is day one trying to bring out the curls \n\nPhotos #3 &amp; #4 are from today \n\nClearly something is happening cuz it’s curling’s heck of a lot more than when I started but I also am not feeling very confident with my natural hair texture so far and feel like I’m doing something wrong. \n\nMy routine currently is using the not your mothers curl talk line \n\nIn the shower:\n\n\\-I wash my hair/scalp every 3-4 days with NYM curl talk bond repair shampoo. About a half dollar amount\n\n\\- then I use the NYM curl talk 3 in 1 conditioner. About a quarter size amount \n\nAfter shower: \n\n\\- I apply NYM curl talk leave in conditioner (just a 2-3 spritz).\n\n\\- then I follow with about a golf ball amount of NYM curl talk mousse and scrunch it in once I work it thru my hair. \n\n\\- lastly I use a dime size of NYM curl talk sculpting gel and work it thru my hair and scrunch with a cotton t-shirt once dry I re-scrunch out the crunchy bits. \n\nRefresh days: a half dollar size of mousse on damp hair, re-scrunch, let dry then I scrunch out any crunchy bits. \n\nI try to diffuse on low heat when I have the energy but I get dizzy holding my arms up so long so I tend to air dry most days, and I do sleep with a silk pillow case (I don’t use bonnets because don’t like the sensory of something on my head while I sleep)  \n\nFor additional relevant detail/context, I have fine hair, medium density and high porosity.",

I was never taught how to care for curls 😅 so i straightened every day and damaged them pretty bad. also bleaching my hair made it even more damaged. \n\ni usually never wear it naturally because its unpredictable, and the ends are so dry it irritates my neck. i know my hair is curly and not just wavy, it used to curl so much more. but lately they are loose, flat at the scalp, and sad looking. \n\nall i use is water and leave in conditioner (after washing). sometimes it looks good, most of the time its a hot mess. this is my hair 80% dry, i dont have any good photos of it curly because i hated it for so long.. \n\nwhat products do yall recommend? preferably drug store dupes because im on a budget. also i can only wash my hair every few days due to disability, so i need a curl routine that i can refreshen in the morning without a wash. my hair type is naturally on the oiler side, so i avoid oilier products \n\nwhat im looking for: more defined curls, less frizziness, less dry ends, more volume at the roots ",

      "content": "have been on 1mg fin since january of 2023 and was on topical min from february of 2023 to august of 2024, saw amazing progress like all of my hair grew back. i then switched to oral min in august of 2024 (5mg) as it was getting annoying applying topical min to longer hair as well as concerns with a cat. I lost some of my gains but in retrospect i should’ve stayed on it and my hair looked great still. So in april of 2025 i switched back to topical min( grave mistake) as i thought the oral min was making me lose all my hair, i then went on to shed soooo much hair and realized you really can’t be on topical if you have pets as you will be stressing about it all the time. in mid july i switched back to oral min and my hair has not been growing back. at a loss of what to do and wish i never screwed with my stack. don’t know if i should hop on dut or go for a transplant, can’t tell if my hair is still minituarizing or if it’s just a minoxidil shed. \n\nit’s insane to me how i grew all of my hair back and hair loss was out of my head for so long and now it’s at the forefront again\n\nat a loss of what to do right now it’s been basically 5 months back on oral min and i don’t see any ré growth is happening or it’s hard to tell and i also feel like in the back of my head that the fin isn’t working, any of you guys have a story similar to this?",

I have tried ‘embrace’ shampoo and conditioner.  \n\nRoutine\n1. Currently I’m using the CPR curly range which I love and have nothing bad to say about the shampoo and conditioner. \n2. But the curl CTRL defining crème I find too heavy for the curls and becomes quite dry and tangled by day 2/3 and find I have to wash my hair more than I’d like to get rid of the product. 3. The method I also use is scrunching and plopping then clipping the roots for extra volume. \n4. I haven’t tried bonnets or silk pillows yet!\n\nDoes anyone have products they recommend and methods?

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
