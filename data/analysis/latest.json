      "title": "21M | Androgenetic Alopecia Returned After Treatment — Is There Any Way to Stop This Long-Term Without Going Broke?",
      "content": "MY HISTORY\n\nI’m a 21M. My hair fall started when I was 20, during the 3rd year of my degree. People around me started pointing it out, saying I was getting bald and that my scalp was visible.\n\nI went to a dermatologist who is quite well-known. He diagnosed me with androgenetic alopecia (Stage 3) and told me that with treatment, I’d get my hair back within 6 months. The treatment eventually continued for 11 months.\n\nDuring this period, I used:\nMinoxidil\nFinasteride\nTopinate solution\nHair supplements\nAround month 7, my hair fall stopped. My hair became thicker and I genuinely felt like I got my hair back. Treatment was completed (stopped) in sept 2025.\n\nPRESENT SITUATION:\nBut now, 4 months later, the hair fall has started again. I can see my scalp clearly in the mirror. I wash my hair 3 times a week, and every time I do, I see a bunch of hair clogging the drain — sometimes actual clumps.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\n\nAlmost everyone in my family is bald:\nMy father\nMy uncle\nMy older cousins (father’s side)\nThey all have androgenetic alopecia. One of my cousins faced this very early, tried everything — multiple dermatologists, minoxidil, finasteride — and still ended up bald after spending lakhs on a hair transplant.\n\nCONFUSION ABOUT GENETICS\n\nMy doctor said this condition usually comes from the mother’s side, but all my maternal uncles have excellent hair.\nSo why is this happening to me?\n\nMY QUESTIONS\n\nIf I did everything right — medication, consistency, doctor visits — why is the hair fall back again?\nIs there any real cure, or is everything just temporary?\nEverywhere on Reddit and online, people say minoxidil + finasteride stops hair loss.\nIt worked temporarily for me\nNow it’s happening again\nDo I really need to use these for my entire life just to keep my hair?\nI honestly don’t have the money for expensive lifelong treatments or transplants.\nTo be blunt, it feels like doctors just keep extending treatments and extracting money, without a permanent solution.\n\nCONCLUSION / WHAT I ACTUALLY WANT\n\nMy main goal is simple: I don’t want to go bald this early in life.\nI know people say “looks don’t matter” or “nobody cares,” but the truth is — it does affect social and professional life, especially at this age.\nI don’t care about impressing others.\nI just want to look good and feel confident.\n\nSo I’m asking honestly:\nIs there any realistic way to slow this down long-term?\nOr is early baldness inevitable no matter what I do?\nAny genuine experiences or advice would really help.",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I think if the whole head was the ‘wrong’ blonde id be happy, i honestly think im just dissapointed at how much natural hair is left.\n\ni showed these reference photos and the stylist was very confident we could accomplish them in one session, and seemed pleased with her results at the end.\n\nam i overreacting or should i go back to see if they can get me closer to the photos? or try to fix it myself at home? i feel really let down and confused, i don’t understand enough about this process to know what to think as of course i’m not a professional!",

      "content": "Hello! I am trying to add hyaluronic acid into my routine, but then realized I'm not sure if I even have the best product order to get optimized results. I've just tried HA and now I have questions...\n\nFirstly, my typical skincare routine consists of:\n\n1. Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner (using a cotton pad)\n2. NEOGEN Real Ferment Micro Essence\n3. Mary &amp; May Vegan Blackberry Complex Essence\n4. Pyunkang Yul Black Tea Time Reverse Eye Cream (PM)\n5. MIDHA Rice Cream (AM) or Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream (PM)\n6. Dr. G Green Mild Up Sunscreen (AM)\n\nI have sensitive, combo-leaning-dry skin. All of these products have worked well with my skin and have not caused me irritation. I've been looking to add more hydration and find new products to help get plump, glowy skin. I wanted to introduce hyaluronic acid (specifically Isntree Ultra Low Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum), and started using it between the PKY toner and Neogen by just patting it into my skin. Is this even the right place to use it? I also trialed a couple times adding a couple drops of The Ordinary Squalane Oil to my moisturizer at night, but I don't want to overwhelm my skin with changes so will probably hold off for a little.\n\nI've never used HA before, but lots of people said to start with this one as can be seen as gentler and a good starting product. I introduced the HA slowly by just using it at night for a few days before using in the morning as well. Things were fine, my skin was looking so refreshed and hydrated! Then yesterday before applying the Tatcha, my skin felt very irritated/started to sting and turn pink. I rinsed my face immediately and just used the MIDHA Rice Cream (no fragrance, so I figured gentler than the Tatcha?), but it feels a little sensitive still and I'm not sure how to remedy? I read that HA works best with a wet/damp base, do you think applying the PKY toner with a cotton pad is not hydrating enough to use the HA right after and that's whats causing the upset? Should I be using the HA at a different time or using different application techniques? I apply everything with my hands except the PKY currently. \n\n  \nTLDR;\n\nIs this the best order to use my products? Where to add in HA? What to do if recent irritation after using HA? (I'm assuming the irritation is coming from the HA as everything else has stayed consistent, but I'm not sure!) Please help, I'm just a girl looking for juicy, plumpy skin and now I'm just stressed lol :((\n\nThank you! Any and all suggestions appreciated :)",

I also think it’s low porosity?**\n\n\n\nRoutine:\n\nI wash my hair with head and shoulders and their conditioner because it doesn’t cause any breakouts and is good for my acne.\n\nI’ve been using the bowl method because that’s what seems to work best for me. I start by detangling my hair and using around 4 pumps of Xmondo wave tech cream (is that too much?) I dunk and squish 4 to 5 times. Then I glaze and scrunch what I feel like is a good amount of Aussie instant freeze gel in. I micro plop and glaze and scrunch Giovanni medium to firm hold styling foam as a mousse because that’s his want i have lol. Then I plop for 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nI hover diffuse my roots, and then pixie diffuse the rest\n\nHalfway through the diffusing process, it looks almost curly and great and then by the time it’s dry and I’m done it’s loose and not as tight and defined as I feel like it could be. I get absolutely zero gel cast, and it has little to no hold even though I feel like I’m using a lot of gel. From the research I’ve been doing I think my hair could be over moisturized. How can I fix this? So grateful for any help 💕",
