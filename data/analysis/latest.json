      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I always assumed that was just me. So my whole routine was basically me trying to fix the dryness I caused during step one(cleansing).\n\nThen a few weeks back, I had this mini identity crisis likee...... why does washing my face feel like a battle? Why do I moisturize like my life depends on it the second I step out of the bathroom?\n\nI still like a lil bit of foam, so I started hunting for something gentle but not boring. Ended up trying the biome gentle gel facewash because it talks about microbiome balance and has hyaluronic acid, ceramides, glycerin aka the trio that usually keeps my skin chill. \n\nGuysss the difference is like OMG.......\n\nno tightness, no wierd itchy mustache area, no redness clown nose momebt, no sprinting to my mositurizer like it's an emergency. \n\nHonestly feels like my skin has been beefing with me for years and I finally stopped giving it reasons. \n\nIf anyone else switched to a gentle cleanser and suddenly understood life, plssssss sharee it here guyssss.

It used to only be on my hairline, and now it’s on my forehead.\n\nI switched shampoos, and it helped for a while, but then the hairline acne came back after I washed it with shampoo that had sulfates and it just never went away.\n\nOver the past few months, I’ve developed forehead acne.\n\nI’ve tried Pan Oxyl creamy wash, dove beauty bar, Cerave, and several other washes and skincare routines. I even tried head and shoulders and ant fungal cream, in case it was fungal, but I think it may have made it worse.\n\nIt’s just really aggravating. I understand that it could just be normal teenage hormones, but if anyone has any advice on how to clear this acne, it would be very appreciated. Thank you! :)",

      "content": "Hello everyone, \nrecently the weather in Germany started to get a lot colder and I wanted to start a real skincare routine for the first time (I used CeraVe Foaming Cleanser, which always felt too stripping and CeraVe hydrating lotion before). I took a few days to research. I have generally dry skin that’s sensitive with an oily nose with pores on the larger side. In the end I decided on these products:\n\n- Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser\n- TirTir Milk Skin Toner light\n- Anua 7+ Rice Hydrating Barrier Repair Serum\n- CeraVe hydrating lotion, because I never had issues with it\n\nI introduced the new products in a span of 3 days (I know that’s fast but I was just so excited they arrived). In the beginning, I felt great and my skin looked glowy and felt good. Gradually, after 8 days I noticed a few small bumps on the side of my nose, in the height of the under eye area. They’re too small to be pimples and honestly, I’ve never had them before. Research suggested closed comedones (even though I thought I only bought non-comedogenic products) and I decided to stop using all new products except for the cetaphil cleanser because the product list seems so simple and I still wanted to cleanse my face. It’s 4 days later now and the bumps haven’t gone away and even seem to have become more. I’m a little panicked right now. Have any of you had similar experiences with these products before, and what did you do? Could it be the cleanser? Should I stop it right now or give it some more time? Or could this be the after-effects of the other new products? Some help would be greatly appreciated. I would be really sad to not use any of the new products now or to have to buy a lot more just to get rid of this effect.",

      "content": "The pictures were taken over these past 5years, I’ve always had about 3b hair, some patches of hair on my head are straight because of my mom’s genetics. On the second pic that was about a year after my first big chop (my hair was perfectly fine but my mom forced me💀), my hair was growing back soft and more ringlety-ish. Years later (after multiples choppings) I decided to just let it grow, i was seeing some curls in the front but most of it are just strong waves. I don’t really understand, I took care of my hair but the more and more kept falling out, yes i’ve been under a lot of stress idk if that has a part in it, I also smoke weed so that either. Fast-forward to now I just decided to start over and go baldita! Could I get any tips or answers on how i could get back my thicker curly-hair? Like what could I eat, supplements, derma-rolling? Anything would be helpful🫶🏽\n\nFor the routine that I used most of the times was\n\n1. Wash hair, rinse\n2. Condition, detangle, rinse\n3. Shea moisture leave in conditionner, rake through, scrunch\n4. Shes moisture curling cream, rake through, scrunch\n5. Scrunch with gel\n6. Scrunch with a towel, turn head upside down scrunch again\n7. Plop for 15-20mins\n8. Diffuse until damp\n9. Let the rest air dry\nFor my maintaining before i’d go to bed i’ll put it in a high loose bun and put on a bonnet and do it all over again in 3-5 days",
