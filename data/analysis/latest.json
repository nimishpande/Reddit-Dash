Sometimes I feel like all my features are “wrong”, including my curls. Why is everyone expected to look like Taylor Hill or Megan Fox? Why is their look considered “better”? On Reddit I was compared to them and rated a 6.5, and that I’m nowhere near a 10 like they are. I’ve been told in the past my rating would be higher if I had straight hair, too\n\nMy current routine: not your mother’s shampoo, conditioner, mousse. ",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I have wavy hair and I recently got it straightened four days ago. The first pic is how my hair looked after not washing it for 4 days. It looks so much more dry and straw like in comparison to the day I got my hair done at a salon (it was glossy and straight). By Day 2 and 3, my hair just started to progressively get dryer with a stringy straw-like texture. I decided to wash my hair today because I went to the gym and sweat quite a bit. \n\nMy hair never seems to get oily and I just have dry hair. \n\nAlso my hair easily gets so tangly and is filled with knots it feels like all the time. What should I do? I have no clue how to manage my hair.  Second pic is my hair after washing it. \n\nFor more background, I live in Florida. We have a relatively humid climate here. And I don’t know if we have hard water or not. \n\nMy normal hair routine is this:\nDay 1- wash day: clarifying shampoo, deep conditioner mask. I apply gel and mousse on my wet hair. Air dry or diffuse depending how I feel. \nDay 2-4: wash with just conditioner only on my roots.\nDay 5- wash day: shampoo with no sulfates or silicones, conditioner. Apply gel and mousse on wet hair. Air dry or diffuse depending how I feel.\nDay 6-7: nothing. Just leave my hair how it is. I don’t even wet it at all to style. ",

      "content": "For some backstory; I started my growth &amp; no dye or bleach journey about 2 years ago. As a teenager I did every color I could come up with and this did some real damage to my hair, then I decided it would be a good idea to go blonde(it was not). I was shoulder length platinum blonde for years continuously using bleach and toners, which further destroyed my hair because I didn't know how to take care of it properly. One day I went to bleach my own roots in a pinch and the overlap caused a lot of breakage, this is when I decided it was time to make a big change. I realized how brittle my hair was and it needed life! I gave my hair a rest for a few months and I was then color matched at a salon to my natural strawberry blonde color. This started my 2 year journey.\n\nSince then, I have been micro dusting the split and broken ends for a long time as well as many other things to keep it healthy. silk pillow cases, protective styles, satin bonnets, hair oiling, etc. but neglecting actual trims have been my downfall. I've grown attached to my hair so cutting this much was difficult for me to part with but I knew deep down it needed it. After a meltdown, I'm looking back at the pictures thinking maybe I needed to cut even more. Or am I torturing myself? Let me know if I'm being dramatic and it looks okay or do I really need to cut another inch or so off? I need HONEST opinions please, this is a weirdly touchy subject for me as I've grown attached to my hair but I'm asking for help! &lt;3 ",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\nThought I’d share my 4200-graft HT journey since this sub helped me so much when I was deciding what to do.\n\nI’d been thinning pretty fast in my late 20s. My hairline was almost gone and the mid-scalp wasn’t looking great either. After months of lurking here and stalking results, I ended up going with Dr. Heena Kudyar. A few people here had mentioned her, and I liked how natural her hairline designs looked.\n\n\nConsultation:\nSuper straightforward. She checked my donor, talked honestly about what could/couldn’t be fixed, and suggested around 4200 grafts to rebuild the hairline + add density through the front and mid-scalp. No pressure, no sales pitch.\n\n\nSurgery day:\nLong day but surprisingly chill. They drew the hairline (looked way better than anything I’d tried imagining myself), numbed me up, and the extraction/implantation was smooth. I was awake the whole time and the team kept checking if I was comfortable.\n\n\nRecovery:\nFirst two weeks were the usual paranoia: “Did I sleep wrong? Did I knock a graft out? Why do I look like I got head-butted by a goat?”\nBut everything healed normally.\nResults:\n\n\nMonths 3–4: sprouts\nMonths 5–6: big jump\nBy month 9, honestly… I couldn’t believe it.\n\nMy hairline looks natural, density is way better than I expected, and people who hadn’t seen me in a while literally thought I just “changed my hairstyle.”\nZero regrets.\n\nPosting because I know how scary it is to commit to 4k+ grafts. If you’re on the fence, I get it. Feel free to ask anything—happy to help someone the way this sub helped me.",

      "content": "hi everyone, like 2 months ago, i 19f got really really fucking sick and one of my symptoms was having really swollen eyes with (maybe tmi) discharge which really dried out my eyes especially since i didn’t have the energy to wash and moisturize my face regularly for a couple days. since then, my eyes has been on and off with the same exact dryness, mostly on. if the skin isn’t flaking, it’s tight, and if it is flaking, it stings and itches. any moisturizer makes it sting like crazy some of the time and since i do regular full faces of makeup, it makes my makeup look bad😭. i’ve always had sensitive and mostly dry skin, and have gotten dry patches under my eyes in the past but never to this extent. literally regardless of how much i moisturize or use eye cream with aloe or slug my eyes with vaseline nightly, they stay the same. i found that the one time they went back to normal for an extended amount of time was the week i came home from college and didn’t have my regular products and was also not washing my face as much (college student burnout lol). as soon as i got back to my regular routine, my eyes immediately went back to that dry state. does anyone know what’s going on and how to treat it? for my past dry patches, i was prescribed some ointment by my dermatologist but it’s been some years and my family’s current financial and insurance situation isn’t good so i can’t go to that derm. would appreciate any tips to help with this, thanks!! (3rd pic was when i was recovering from being sick with a little eye discharge)",

      "content": "Hello!\n\nSo a few months back my hair did a complete 180! I went from a very, very slight wave to tighter ones and even some ringlet formations. I’m pretty sure this was because I finally had a medical problem being addressed that was affecting my hair growth and overall health. But because of this, I’ve had to endure a steep learning curve on how to take care of my wavy/curly hair.\n\nIn the summer it wasn’t too bad — I live in Ireland, so the summer climate is kind of mild and didn’t affect my hair too much. But winter? Ugh, it’s so bad 😩 Yesterday, I spent ages styling my hair, but all the rain, humidity, and cold made it fall flat so quickly and left me with fuzzy frizz. I was so disappointed.\n\n**My routine yesterday:**\n\n* Shampoo: Ouai Detox &amp; Redken All Soft\n* Conditioner: Redken All Soft\n* Leave-in &amp; heat protectant: Redken 25-in-1 + heat protectant\n* Before diffusing: Keune Spring Loaded\n* When 60-70% dry: Umberto scrunching jelly\n* Method: S2C and rise it out completely\n* Sleeping: Pineapple hold\n\nI diffused with a claw clips yesterday near my roots and it actually worked pretty well, and my hair looked gorgeous once dry! I was really happy with it.\n\nI’m thinking maybe the products I’m using aren’t the best for this kind of weather, so if anyone has ideas, recommendations, or just general advice, I’d really appreciate it. I do live in Europe, so some products are harder to come by, convenience is a bonus.\n\n**About my hair:**\n\n* Low-medium density with medium-thick strands, so very heavy products weigh it down\n* Flat roots and curls start closer to eye level but those around my face which are layered start closer to the root.\n* Looking for some volume, but I don’t know where to start\n\nI see so many beautiful people on here with flawless curls, and I’m so envious!!\n\nAny tips, product recs, or advice would be amazing. Thank you in advance! 😊",

      "content": "I'm a guy with 3B-3C hair, and it coils a lot. My routine is I usually condition and shampoo (all sulfate-free) and detangle in the shower with a wide-tooth comb. I usually don't use gel or mousse because I don't like the texture; I prefer soft hair. Because my hair forms really big coils after a shower, about 6 to 8 large coils, it legitimately takes all the hair off the top of my head. So what I usually do is wait until it air-dries, then separate these big coils into smaller ones. The issue with this is: 1) separating the big curls takes forever, and 2) I can't separate them until they're dry, or else it creates these weird coils that I don't like. I want to know ways to find a less time-consuming way to do my hair and make it look as good, since the long wash days genuinely affect my productivity. Everything becomes a \"whether I should do this or that\" situation, but then I consider how frizzy my hair becomes, and I just get lazy. (it genuinely takes a few hours HOURS I DONT HAVE) (also pic is after separating i dont have any pics of before)",

I do live in south Florida so it is quite humid but I can't even go outside for 5 minutes without my hair being ruined.\n\nI included 3 photos one right my shower when I scrunch it. One after it is dry, then one after my walk.\n\nAs for my routine I use leave in conditioner (function of beauty purple bottle) then use a curl defining brush. I then use gel (not your mother's curl talk) and scrunch the remaining hair. Then finally plop it with a shirt for about 15-20 minutes and then let it dry naturally. But it makes me so upset when I spend time doing my hair then only 5 minutes outside has it completely undone. I'm not even sure I have wavy hair at this point lol\n\nAny products or methods that may be able to help?",

      "content": "Hey y’all! I’m pretty new to doing a full base routine (like 1–2 months in), and I’ve just recently realized… I actually have dry skin 🥲. I live in a super humid part of TX and am constantly running around campus, so I originally thought a matte setting spray would be perfect (ngl I chose it almost entirely bc I hate how sweaty my upper lip gets). But now my makeup is looking really cakey and almost powdery (not sure how to describe it, but it's like separating on my cheeks)\n\nFor context, my skin is: dry, sensitive, textured, acne scars, and lately some cystic acne on my chin. I’m a brown girlie so I have some hyperpigmentation too\n\n**Current Skincare Prep:**\n\n\\- TORRIDEN dive in serum\n\n\\- BRINGGREEN Cica Moisturizer\n\n\\- BoJ Aqua Fresh Sunscreen\n\n**Makeup Products Used:**\n\n\\- CONCEALER: \n\n* nars soft matte for acne &amp; radiant creamy for under-eyes \n* I also have the nyx bare with me but it feels rlly drying and separates so badly on my face T\\_T\n\n\\- SKIN TINT: alternating between the Armani &amp; NYX buttermelt glaze\n\n\\- BLUSH: house of hur dewy &amp; rare beauty cream blush\n\n\\- POWDER: I always set with the OneSize pink powder to prevent transfer\n\n\\- SETTING SPRAY: I only have the Milani Matte setting spray right now and I'm trying to finish it before committing to something new, but it just feels weird on the face and it makes me so dry.\n\n  \nI’d really appreciate any advice on makeup prep for dry skin and if you’re familiar with the products I’m using, I'd love any tips for making them work better (mostly bc IDK if the other products are what's causing the seperation)🙏 \n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY, I desperately need **hydrating/dewy setting spray recommendations** (drugstore + high-end). I don't really mind if the longetivity isn't that great, but I really want something to help melt everything together and stop the cakeyness. \n\nLiterally any help or advice at all is appreciated !!!\n\n",
