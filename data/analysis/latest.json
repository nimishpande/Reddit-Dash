      "content": "My 11 year old daughter and I have VERY different hair, I can’t seem to figure out the right hair routine for her and her ends up visibly greasy after one day. \n\nShe has VERY thick hair that is naturally wavy and tangles easily. She also has sensory problems and won’t let me blow her hair dry and getting a brush through her hair twice a day is about the max she’ll allow. Cutting her hair has caused panic attacks, so we’ve resigned to keeping it long for now. \n\nCurrently, she typically showers at night, and (by her request) she’s using Function of Beauty wavy hair shampoo and conditioner. We’ve tried others, but this one seems to be the best of the ones we’ve tried. She loves her waves. We’ve tried a few different products like curl cream and mouse but they make her hair greasier even faster. She sleeps with it wet. We’ve tried bonnets, they’re hit or miss. Often they fall off overnight. \n\nI know it’s not good to wash hair every day, and she’s not yet at the point of daily showers anyway, but it seems to need to be washed every day! \n\nI’ve tried dry shampoo (so many kinds) and she hates it and I don’t notice much of a difference. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? I just want her to feel confident and good about herself - and she’s okay for now, but I worry about the future and middle school is looming…\n\nThank you in advance! ",

Earlier in the week i got layers put back into my hair so my waves can ‘breathe’ and the hair stylist used this spray in my hair that she rubbed into her hands and scrunched my hair with before diffusing. After drying my waves had more definition than usual,  no cast and decent volume.\n\nThe spray has this tacky/sticky texture when she applied it to my damp hair which I’ve not come across before and I’m wondering what kind of product it was as it clearly gave hold and good definition. I think it had heat protectant in it too. Would anyone know what this is?\n\n  \nMy usual routine is the joico volumising shampoo and conditioner, Umberto gianni curl jelly shine, bed head smalltalk volumisier, lightly watered down eco gel and a heat protectant before diffusing.  (all styling product as applied sparingly by raking and I shape my waves with my fingers as I have the occasional ringlet) (I’m aware that I’m probably also weighing my hair down with most of these products but ill change to light weight ones after they run out!)\n\nthe photos are my my end of the day hair with the mystery product (ignore the fringe i was trying something new) vs my usual end of day hair ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

The replies to that post were very helpful and I wanted some help on choosing some alternate products or sticking to this routine.\n\n- Moisturizer: should I stick with the ponds or switch to minimalist b12 since I'm using niacinamide and need to protect my skin barrier?\n\n- Sunscreen: this is where I am facing the biggest confusion (so are others when I searched this sub lol), I initially decided to go with the regular minimalist spf 50 but then I found out it has retinol in it (seperate thread on that later, because that makes no sense) which is a big no no with the other actives I'm using so decided to switch to the light fluid one instead. I've also heard korean ones are good as well as reequil ultra dry matte but there's so many choices and not enough budget to go around so please help me choose one :\")\n\nI hope y'all can provide a overall verdict on my routine, I'm scared and excited to be starting this journey for the first time after decades of tanning and negligence of my skin \n\nSee you on the other side 🤎",

I'm getting back on track, my skin is very very dry and I do get a few pimples but no deep acne. Currently, I do spf in the morning and a full routine in the evening including exfoliating with AHA or BHA (not daily!!).\n\nI'd like to get into retinol as I hear over and over again that it prevents skin aging and I do get lines slowly now and didn't wear spf for YEARS. However, I can't figure out where to start, and I'm under the impression that I can neither use retinol together with AHA nor should I use either in the morning (?). But apart from retinol being The Best and also from it being difficult to start, I get so so many ads when trying to research and don't know where to actually start. \n\nCan you, knowledgeable redditor, please help me figure out the following questions? \n\nCan I use the The Ordinary products for that? They have retinol 0.2%/0.5%/1% in squalene, Granactive 2%/5% retinoid, and Retinal available.\n\nIf so, which one do I start with and how does one progress there/how strong do I need? \n\nAnd also, can I use my AHA/BHA in the morning or should it be the retinol in the morning if they don't work together? \n\nAny other advice for Dummies? \n\nI understand that's a lot, I'm just super overwhelmed with the information online 😅 any help is appreciated!",

It's going pretty well now and I think I have a routine down... or so I thought... \n\nI am trying to reduce my \"goo collection\" and dug out this gem (Citre shine making waves curl booster, see pic) from back in the day. I've sort of known for a while that these products were discontinued, but I had long moved on and so it didn't really bother me. But this week I decided to use this in my routine just so I could use it up and get it out of my closet and lo and behold I LOVE THE RESULTS!!! My curls are very tight on top/front compared to the bottom half of my head and the softness/loosness of this hold somehow makes everything look even and the finish feels sooo clean like i don't even feel like i have product in my hair except it looks great and not frizzy like it would if i really had no product in. \n\nNow I'm panicking because I stumbled upon a product that I actually love and it's been discontinued for over a decade. \n\nAdditional note: It is truly remarkable that the product has maintained it's original chemistry. Other ancient products I've tried to use up recently have come out of the tube completely separated or discolored and have clearly gone bad. But this citre shine product is preserved perfectly, as if I bought it yesterday. Their chemists deserve recognition for that time defying feat.",

      "title": "Can you help? Toddler wavy hair",
      "content": "My almost 4 year old daughter has very fine, wavy hair. Probably 2a/2b ish, if that matters. I have tried Facebook groups looking for help, but I get told it's not curly not wavy and not straight so I don't even know where to go at this point.\n\nI will include our routine but also key things that we have problems with. She had mixed threshold SPD. We are awaiting an ASD diagnosis. She likely has ADHD as well but that diagnosis will probably not happen until she's in kindergarten. Our biggest challenge is the sensory issues. She does not tolerate protective styling, especially at bed time. She will take ponytails and pigtails out during the day, even softer scrunchies, after a couple hours. She won't sleep on a pillow (so no pillowcase), she won't sleep on satin sheets. To braid her hair you would have to physically hold her down, which I won't do. She will \"let\" me brush her hair, but she screams and cries and pulls away the entire time, no matter how gentle I am or what steps I take.\n\nHer routine:\n\nWash/condition 1-2 x a week with eco chic kids.\nBrush hair while wet, usually while still in the tub, with a wet brush. Always starting from the bottom, always holding above the section or tangle I am working on so that it won't pull. I think she screams and cries sometimes more in anticipation of pain, or discomfort with the sensation, then because it hurts.\n\nWe just started putting a satin bonnet on her. She is excited about it. The problems we have are getting her hair into the bonnet, and keeping the bonnet on her head through the night. I have a child's size bonnet (she is a 98th percent head circumference so we have to go with one meant for 5+), it seems to fit well. The ties cross in the back and tie across the top of the forehead. We have tried putting it in a pineapple with a satin scrunchie, and then under the bonnet. But she will pull off the bonnet to take out the pineapple because she doesn't like the feeling. When we have managed to get her hair into the bonnet without the pineapple, eventually it falls off in the middle of the night. If I tie it tighter she doesn't like how that feels, and takes it off, or the tied portion slips up over the top of her head because of the tension.\n\nWhen she wakes up I use a continuous misting spray bottle that has mostly water and a small squirt of conditioner (I'm not positive which conditioner this one is, but I know it's just a regular conditioner). I get her hair very wet (wet enough that she complains that her hair/neck/shirt/whatever is wet). I brush it using a wet brush, often using it vertically, from the bottom up, holding above the section or tangle. Her hair is maybe to her shoulders when it's soaking wet and pulled straight. When it drives it comes to just below her chin/neck area. \n\nWe don't use any other product in her hair. No heat or styling implements like soft curlers or anything. Just what I have listed, my hands, the air, a wet brush, and her towel (we don't have any specific ones we use). Her hair is dry when we put it in the bonnet. As often as I can, or as often as she will tolerate, I will pull her hair back/up, because even in the car against the car seat it will become frizzy/start tangling. The pillowcase and sheat thing is out until/unless she can start tolerating that sensation, and I won't be able to put it in a braid unless she starts tolerating that. So I'm looking for shampoo, conditioner, or product recommendations (if that recommendation is no product, that's fine too). Types of brushes or combs. Techniques for brushing and combing. Types of hair bonnets or night scarves, ways to put it on and get it to stay on. If I am drying her hair correctly. \n\nAlso, she has had probably a dozen or more haircuts. We get it cut at the salon every 6-8 weeks, or sooner if we are noticing more issues. \n\nShe has a swirl pattern/hair whorl with no real natural part (although as her hair has gotten longer, it will now lay more evenly). \n\nWhen she was around a year or 18 months old, we had the stylist cut off an entire section of her hair. It was extremely frayed, frizzy, much coarser than the rest of her hair and nothing I was doing worked at the time. What grew back was much finer, but still frizzy and tangled prone with a wavy pattern.\n\nI know this is very long and points about her different sensory issues or needs may get lost in the shuffle. I'm just a mom who has 1b or 1c hair that still manages to get frizzy, who hated her hair growing up, who wants to take care of my daughter's hair as best I can, so that she feels proud and confident with it.\n\nEven if at the end of the day her waves are still baby curls after all the haircuts (and maybe they are, I'm no expert), it's the hair she has right now and I want to take care of it. \n\nETA: it is medium density (I think, I will have to double check, it could low density), fine, and the quiz says mixed porosity (it is past her shoulders and no heat, chemical or sun damage). I live in Ohio so currently it is dry out. The humidity in the summer definitely makes her waves/curls tighter and more defined.",

I don’t know why, but my skin reacted amazingly to it my active pimples completely cleared up within ~15 days, and no new breakouts came during that time. I wasn’t using any actives or serums alongside it.\nAfter coming back home and switching to my regular cleanser, my acne has started coming back 😞\nUnfortunately, the product doesn’t seem to be available anywhere in India.\nI’ve attached a photo / will attach ingredient details if needed.\nI’d really appreciate help finding it.\nOr recommendations for similar gentle, non-stripping cleansers that worked for acne-prone / sensitive skin\nThank you so much in advance 🤍\n",

For the messy looking style I literally just get my hair wet and go back and fourth with a towel. My frustration is with the combed style. I feel like my hair just does whatever the heck it wants. I really don't care for what my hair is doing in the first two pictures but I don't totally hate the third one. I just don't know how to make it stay throughout the day and consistently look like that. I'm really open on suggestions and I just want my hair to not look goofy. I'm pretty sure I have a somewhat sensitive scalp when it comes to product or I'm just doing something wrong. ",
