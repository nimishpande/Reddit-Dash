      "content": "Ms Chetali Chadha is back to her old tricks again\n\nRoasting products because they have fragrance in one reel and in a different reel, sneaking in a paid promotion for a product that has not just fragrance, but also color. \n\nYou may have all seen that series the influence with chetali . It has been running for two months now.\n\nI always had a feeling that Chetali was carefully and smartly, putting in her paid promotions inside the reels while making it seem like a genuine informed information and today I got the proof\n\nProof number one in one of her recent videos, she has spoken about the best moisturizer for oily skin, and the Foxtale suncreen has been shown as a clear winner, however, if you have been following her series, you will know that she is dead against fragrance, and any other additives Foxtale moisturizer has both. \n\nIn her latest reel for dry skin moisturizer, she has failed Himalaya and Nivea because they use a particular ingredient that has been banned in the European Union because they use fragrance, however logic did not matter in case of Foxtale. \n\nLastly, if you see her reels, clearly she has done paid promotion for requil, formula RX and Be body wise without making disclosures by just making a point that she is giving them a higher ranking\n\nIt is very easy to figure out which product has paid in which product has not paid. If you just go and put a timer on the reel and see how many seconds she dedicates talking about a product that is paid versus what is not paid.\n\n Incase you don’t have context she has done it before in 2024 and 2025 always roasting products that have fragrance and then promoting the L’Oreal glycolic serum which also has fragrance but at that time it did not seem to make a difference to her because she was paid for it. Her values keep changing based on who’s paying her and who is not.\n\nI cannot believe she has come down to this. I was really liking her content, and it was seeming genuine and educated but now knowing what I know, it is terrible it really breaks my heart. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi, I am a 16-year-old male, and I wanted to start a skincare routine. I haven’t used a lot of skincare products in my life other than some moisturizers and normal face washes. I have noticed that my skin has become a much darker shade than it used to be. I guess it’s because I don’t usually use sunscreen while going out, and since I play a lot of football in heat and sun as I am in Kuwait right now, it has made my skin look really dull and uneven. But my skin is really soft, and I only have 1 or 2 pimples, barely even at this age. I also did some research and found out that I have oily T-zone skin, as my skin gets a bit oily on my forehead and nose sometimes. So what I want to do is visibly reduce tan and brighten my skin tone. Here are some products I have and am planning to use. I know that most of these are unheard of and not the best ones; that’s why I am here for suggestions. I have also thought of trying some natural face masks. I mean, do they actually show results? I have seen many videos on them, but those don’t look believable.\n\n1. **Swiss image mattifying face wash**: Use this when i wake up\n2. **Swiss image absolute hydration day cream**: After using the facewash in the morning\n3. **Dremdoc sunscreen (spf 40)** : After using the day cream and before going outside\n4. **Ummachis Papaya &amp; Honey Herbal face wash (**[**Link - as this product is unheard ig**](https://www.ummachisnaturals.com/product/papaya-honey-herbal-face-wash/)**)** : I use this after comming from outside on the days i am gonna use Kojie san tan removal soap.\n5. **Himalaya tan removal facewash orange and honey**: I use this on the days i am not gonna use kojie san soap, as i dont want to use 2 tan removal products on one day, and i heard kojie san makes the skin highly sensitive.\n6. **Koji san tan removal soap**: I use this at night, with 2 days gap and use moisturizer after using it, i use creme 21 for now, since it is a really thick moisturizer and i guess it helps keep my skin moisturized after the kojie san, i hear kojie san makes the skin really dry.\n7. **Olay natural radiance night cream**: I use this before bed, i avoid using it on the day of useing kojie san.\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/need-help-starting-a-skin-care-routin-16-year-old-v0-8clyvmk576dg1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccb430000c466d2591ee7d60fd099603d100a8d5)\n\n[5](https://preview.redd.it/j34j5l2opihg1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89c2b7cdbd79b1c4bc4779dbe951671e323b9d06)\n\n[1](https://preview.redd.it/0i5xf1jopihg1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8333e1b59b6b4b90087d63a14f6381374089881)\n\n[2](https://preview.redd.it/esb34lsopihg1.png?width=225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f997be4eacdb266d4be3948490a8e79e11306b1e)\n\n[4](https://preview.redd.it/y50daq6ppihg1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff9e2e9fc303f50fa8132cd4f4b5beaad68d9b73)\n\n[7](https://preview.redd.it/y2x3r6jppihg1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3ad5723e9f2e1fd74d68e7ded2e994b4b2097a8)\n\n[6](https://preview.redd.it/ein2jkvppihg1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=068f184cf0f2f5660b0c0d4a551ca10dbc3a6e55)\n\n[3](https://preview.redd.it/79s8ep2qpihg1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac06d4d548e3bd6533cb15ee5061ab97023ce9e5)\n\n\\+ point, the reason I finally decided to start skincare is mainly because of the constant bullying I face from my classmates about my skin colour, and the way they use me for jokes, and then say it’s just a joke, but not knowing whether it hurt me or not. I’ve also had cases where my friends just randomly call me BLACK or N\\*\\*A when they see somehting the teacher teaches has anything about it, like once in physics class, the lesson was on Black body radiation and someone just called my name loud in the class while the teacher is there, and all of the students just laugh at me, but the teacher does nothing, even though I am not black. I thought I’ll start skincare now, because it’s winter and really cold out here, and there is less sunlight 😊",

In the last year vanicream keeps having quality issues and supply issues. Of course I’m open to other brands from around the world and USA but I figured I’d get the most new product suggestions (that I haven’t tried) hailing from Korea or Europe. I’m very interested in moisturizers and spf. If you have encountered SPF that is mostly or half titanium dioxide rather than all zinc that would be cool too (I know it’s very rare but my skin cannot handle zinc for now. Maybe a derm can help eventually but I’m not having much luck now, I think my barrier for some reason doesn’t like it since I guess allergies to zinc are extremely rare ). I tolerate the vanicream cleansing bar and vanicream moisturizing cream. Vanicream has simethicone in it and I seam to do fine but dimethicone in products and silicone heavy formulas seem to REALLY irritate me",

      "content": "hello! genuine question that’s been on my mind the last couple months: why don’t curly hair stylists offer just a basic trim service that doesn’t include a wash and style?\n\npersonally, I’m tired of paying $120+ for a haircut when all I need is a trim. I hate the wash because I don’t like other people detangling my hair. I recently had a bad experience where my longtime stylists of 8 years got impatient detangling and I was genuinely in so much pain and she pulled out a ton of my hair. And I don’t need the style because I hate these salon products anyway. They never leave my hair feeling right and I always need to restyle in a day or two. So what am I paying for??\n\nNow I would keep going to my stylist and just opt out of the wash and style and leave with the trim and eat the extra cost, but she just retired. And everyone in my area is charging $150-$250+ for a mandatory “new client education package” …… which I don’t need (I’ve been caring for my curly hair for 10+ years and I haven’t own routine)…. I need a TRIM.\n\nTLDR: Why do these stylists charge such a high entry fee into their services? And why can’t I just book a basic trim? Do I just know nothing about running a salon/being a hair stylist or are curly cuts really just a scam?",

Fix my curls cleansing shampoo\n2. Fix my curls Everyday Moisturizing shampoo\n3. Fix my curls Deep conditioner\n4. Curl up curl defining cream\n5. Curl up frizz control\n6. Fix my curls curl quenching flaxseed jelly\n\nMy routine is as follows:\n\nI wash my hair at least three days a week using both shampoos and using the deep conditioner. I apply the curl-defining cream and frizz control gel to soaking wet hair. I use my hand to apply it and use a regular comb to guide them, scrunch, and then let it air dry. Some days I use flaxseed jelly\n\nI tie a t-shirt over my hair while sleeping to protect my hair, and I don't follow a refresh routine.\n\nBut whenever I use these products, my curls never look natural or defined. Rather, my hair looks incredibly greasy, messy, and feels like it’s glued together in certain spots. It just ends up looking like a mess rather than the natural, feminine, defined curls I’m looking for.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Are there different products or accessories I should buy, like a specific comb or a bonnet? How do I actually get my curls to look defined and feminine?",
