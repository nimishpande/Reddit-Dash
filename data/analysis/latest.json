I've been using the cosrx snail mucin for quite some time, probably finished 4 or 5 bottles but honestly, I didn’t see much improvement. I just kept using it without any real reason.Recently, I read about using glycerin on the skin and decided to give it a try and my skin loved it!\n\nBought the atomiser from Blinkit and got glycerin and distilled water from a local pharmacy. Glycerin needs to be diluted, otherwise it can make your skin feel even drier. I diluted it in about 1:8 ratio (glycerin : distilled water)\n\nThe glycerin bottle cost me around 50, and the distilled water packets were rs.3 each. I spray it on my face when it’s slightly damp after cleansing, then follow up with a moisturizer. I’ve been loving it lately, it’s super hydrating and very budget friendly!",

I talked to my mom about them and she said that they could be tired lines and that they would go away. It would make sense as I’ve been working ) day weeks for the last two months. The thing is though it’s been a week and they haven’t gone away. \n\nI want to age with grace, but half of the reason I do skincare is want to postpone again for as long as I can lol.

      "content": "27F, \n\nWould love to hear some thoughts on what to add to my routine to combat oily skin. Some of my thoughts/context is included below. Been reading the wikis and looking at other posts from skincare addicts on here but have reached a point where I've got like 3-4 contending options but only want to start with adding in one step and need some direct opinions/suggestions. Appreciate any insight into products to add, or similar experiences anyone might like to share :) \n\n**Current Routine:**   \n**AM**: cetaphil gentle cleanser, cetaphil moisturizing lotion (i know i know so simple and could prob use a different moisturizer, but i'm scared to try another one bc i've used this one for so long and it's been so good to me.... but am open to recs here because i need help lol) \n\n**PM**: cetaphil gentle cleanser, adapalene/benzoyl peroxide prescription combo (0.1%/2.5%), wait for like 10-15min to let that baby soak in, then cetaphil moisturizing lotion again \n\nTrying to add just a 4th product to my routine for right now, then might build to a 5th after a couple weeks-a month. I've been thinking niacinamide might be the way to go, but wondering if there's something more reliable out there specifically geared towards controlling oil? Also been researching ceramides but know some formulas can be comedogenic and I have acne prone skin. Lots of research also points to using hyaluronic acid to combat potentially dry skin causing the oil, but worried it might exacerbate my issue instead of help it, OR it just wouldn't be enough for me right now to cause an impact without another product and I really just want to go one at a time to make sure I can keep my acne controlled. I was thinking the oil production could be coming from being on prescription adapalene benzoyl peroxide, so I tried to switch to A313 for something gentler to help reduce the oil production thinking that would help but it brought the acne back and had no effect on oil production, I switched back to the adap because I'd rather be oily than be pimply *and* oily. Could be the cetaphil lotion maybe, i know all good things must come to an end and it might be time for another one :(  Have heard good things on here about Vanicream, but dunno if it would help with reducing oil production. \n\nLast year I did a complete overhaul of my routine, went from like 7 products down to just my current 3 to fix a fungal acne situation I had going on at the time. The 3 step routine keeps my skin acne free so I've just kept up with it. I've always had combo-oily skin, but didn't really find my skins oily tendencies to be that annoying because I worked from home and hardly ever had to be on camera during meetings, didn't have to wear makeup more than like 2x/week for date night or whatever, and would just use blotting pads when I needed to control my overproduction of oil. BUT NOW, I am switching to an in-person role for work, AND i'm getting married next year (!!!) so my low-maintenance/i can live with it approach my oil reduction is not cutting it anymore. I feel like a grease ball all the time and every time I've tried to wear makeup recently I'm basically melting it off (even with primers, good skin prep, etc.) \n\nPls help a girl out :') ",

      "content": "For a little context, I had pin straight hair from out of the womb til around 30. For different occasions (prom, weddings, etc) professionnals tried to curl my hair to no avail. No matter the work, technique or product, 30 min later it was back to straight, not even a wave in sight. Then a few years ago my endo quickly got a whole lot worst and my hormones have been all over the place ever since. Which is what I suspect caused a change in my hair. \n\nI’ve seen then noticed loose waves forming when my hair is wet and even some random curls curls in the back of the my head. But I continued to treat them as fully straight and brushed when wet (and dry), mostly air dry and wore it in tight messy buns. My hair gets super frizzy and they never look good when not tied up. \n\nSo today I tried this routine (in order):\n\n- Washing the roots (Marc Anthony strictly curls shampoo)\n- Conditioning the ends (MA strictly curls conditionner)\n- Brushing (head down with curl defining brush)\n- Curl creme on dripping wet, scrunch (MA curl defining lotion)\n- Gel on dripping wet, scrunch (MA flex gel)\n- Scrunch some more with my hands\n\n\nAt this point they were very wavy / some curls\n\n- Plopping for about 20 min with a non textured microfiber towel\n\nAt this point they were looser waves with one side wavier than the other lol. (Photo 1)\n\n- Air dry\n- Scrunch to break cast\n\nOther photos. \n\nAnd now about 7h later they’re even looser. There’s still some wave pattern on the bottom but eh. \n\nErrors I might have made : \n\n- Too much cream\n- Not enough gel / Not well distributed\n- Touching my hair too soon because I had the impression it had fully dried but I don’t think it was\n\nHaving had straight hair all my life I kinda feel like an imposter that’s just trying to force it and feel like an idiot. So all this to say, is this normal day 1? Are these waves in need to be defined over time? Or am I just seeing things and my wavy wet hair means absolutely nothing? Thanks yall. &lt;3\n\n",
