      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi guys!! Posting here because I’m really at a loss for what’s going on with my hair lately. To start, I want to add context to the pictures I added. First picture was taken a few weeks ago, second picture back in August, and third picture 3 years ago today. \nI’ve noticed recently that the following things hace been changing with my hair: \n- the area of my hair that used to have the tightest curls, my crown and my bangs, are noticeably looser and don’t hold as long, if at all. I have to finger coil my crown area to get anything. \n- my wash-and-go’s, which used to last over a month if i allowed it, hardly last two weeks without needing to be refreshed. \n- more breakage when i detangle \n- i have to fight my hair to hold volume when before i used to have to fight my hair to NOT be huge. \n- the products i used to love and adore are mediocre now. \n\nI also want to include that I RARELY straighten my hair (last time was over a year ago), and usually use low heat to diffuse, so heat damage can’t be the issue. I dont do tight hairstyles, hardly do ponytails ever. I sleep on a satin pillowcase, the same kind I’ve been using for years (even when the 3 year old pic was taken). I’ve been on hormonal birth control for over two years (and have not noticed any real change in anything that hormones might affect. My skin is still the same as always, and my cycle has always been regular anyways). I don’t frequently cut my hair, I actually used to cut it more back when the 3 year old pic was taken, so I’m ruling out curl shock as a factor too. \nI wash my hair every 1-2 weeks usually with a cleansing conditioner. I shampoo only 1/2 times a month and use a clarifying shampoo shampoo for one of those days. I use hair masks frequently, either for protein or hydration, for maybe 20 minutes after I shampoo (maybe protein overload? Over hydration?). The only thing I can think of that is messing with my hair is the brand I use…Shea moisture. Mind you, I’ve been using this brand for 7 years and it worked super well even after the CEO and formula changes. But not now. \n\nMy routine has always remained the same: shampoo twice (if I do shampoo), detangle with conditioner using a tangle teezer, use a mask of some sort, wash out with ice cold water. Use a leave in conditioner and section my hair to get maximum definition. Diffuse or air dry after scrunchie with a microfiber towel. \n\nI guess I’m asking if you guys have had similar experience with this brand, and if it makes sense for me to point these changes to me using products that are actually hurting my hair rather than helping it. I would also appreciate if you guys can recommend black owned hair products/brands that I can look into as well. \nThank you for reading my novel!! I appreciate everyone who took the time to read :) \n",

Over the course of the past two years looking online about hair care and hair types I think I’m somewhere between a 2C and 3A. The reason I’m not sure is because my hair gets tangled and matted so often that I can barely see its natural shape outside of the breakage and frizz. \n\nMy hair routine is really basic as it stands:\n\n•In the shower I use an off brand oily scalp shampoo to clean up any buildup I have. Occasionally I’ll use Rizos Curls Apple Cider Vinegar Scalp Rinse if I want to go for a DEEP cleanse \n\n•After two washes, I go in with Pattern Medium and try to coat most of my hair. After the first rinse with Pattern, I go in a second time and brush my hair while it’s still wet. \n\n•I air dry my hair. Once it’s sufficiently dry I tie it in a pineapple bun and put on a silk bonnet before going to bed. \n\nI thought a bonnet would help with having so much “webbing” my hair does when it gets tangled, but it’s always so intense and I don’t know what additional steps I should be adding to my routine. I just feel like every wash day is a battle to make my hair cooperate and last. \n\nHoping to get any advice from the wonderful people of this subreddit!\n",

      "content": "I have been looking after my curls for over 5 years now and I had locked in my products and routine pretty well . My curls would be soft and with minimal frizz and most weeks they would hold for 5-7 days. I was having a bit of a poor week and (stupidly) decided to buy a [cheaper curl cream](https://www.chemistwarehouse.co.nz/buy/124611/tresemme-smooth-curls-cream-200ml). While I was using the cream itself my curls were as normal. It was when I changed back to my [normal curl cream ](https://www.mecca.com/en-nz/briogeo/curl-charisma-rice-amino-avocado-leavein-defining-cream-I-045581/?utm_content=performance-max&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22301333031&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAxJXJBhD_ARIsAH_JGjigjSSJfv3cLXl2PqYkFcpnFV64AXrF4oF03dEIKa98FY2WCM1ciG4aAgmhEALw_wcB)where things took a turn. My curls became flat, frizzy and only held for a day- I was devastated. I tried everything I could think of: I decreased moisture, increased moisture, used Olaplex bond repair treatment for a bit, tried a different gel ect. This all started in June and things have gotten a bit better but I'm still not close to my former glory. My hair just feels different, is still relatively frizzy and will only as 3-4 days. \n\nI use a moisturising shampoo and conditioner, a curl cream, mousse, gel and oil in my routine. I have never dyed my hair and do not use heat on it.\n\n  \nHas anyone experienced anything like this? I am open to any suggestions that might help get me back to where I was.\n\n",

Recent stress has adjusted my routine (forgetting, depression and not doing it, excessive tears and half butted routine ie just moisturizer or something like that) and caused a lot of texture and wrinkles it seems, my neck has also presented a few odd bumps that I definitely try to pop or scratch off and do not go away. My only consistent problem since I went through puberty is nose pore size, so this is all new to me. Can someone give me advice? \n\nMy face, neck, ears and décolleté are included on 1, 3, 5 and 6. my eyes only get caffeine, eye cream, meds and castor. \n\n1.

I tried to look through posts here but got kind of overwhelmed since I don’t even know the basics (aside from needing a diffuser). Some common brands I’ve seen are Dyson, Shark, Laifen, and Curlsmith. What are the differences between them? How are they not all doing the same thing? \n\nI would consider spending a bit more on something that works quickly, reduces frizz, defines curls, and does not cause damage. I have mostly 3b hair, pretty thick, no idea about porosity. My hair takes about 2-3 hours to fully dry and I’m getting sick of that lol. \n\nWhat’s best for beginners? Any old hair dryer + a good diffuser? A specific brand of both? And what’s a good heat protectant spray (and does that go on your hair after your regular styling products)? \n\nAnd any technique tips for the actual drying would be helpful too! \n\nThank you!! \n\nMy routine: I’m experimenting lol. Right now I’m using the Evolvh SmartCurl shampoo with Ouidad Anti Frizz conditioner and Ouidad Moisture Lock leave-in conditioner. For styling I use the Loma Curvy Creme and Loma Firm Hold gel. I also have some argan oil but idk how to use it. ",
