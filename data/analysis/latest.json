I use Aussie detangler and shampoo when needed but most showers I just only use conditioner. \n\nI usually let it air dry and will put in some Not Your Mother's Curl leave in conditioner on occasions. I have a wide tooth comb I use, and a regular comb I will use to fix my part in the middle. I also sleep with satin pillow cases and also use a bonnet if I don't feel like wetting my hair the next day. \n\nI really want to keep growing it out, although how long it's taking is a tad frustrating some times. But do you think I should try a new style? Or should I just invest in one of those bounce brushes or try finger coiling? Any feedback and thoughts are appreciated thanks!!",

First picture is in a dryer climate and last in a very humid climate. \n\nRoutine: I use cantu conditioner and leave in conditioner from kinky curly knot today on soaking wet hair + hair foam. I wash 2-3 times a week and I usually do no poo unless there’s a lot of build up. I also only aid dry. I sleep with my hair pineapple style but just normal pillow and don’t have a refresh routine since my hair takes too long to get wet. \n\nHope these pics aren’t too creepy btw but I’m a bit nervous about posting online. \n\nThank you so much everyone :))",

After rinsing with water, my skin will feel a little tight or dry, then either oily or feels gunky or dirty. Always reddish, but don't think I have rosacea. I feel like my moisture barrier is compromised but not sure. I also seem to get what I assume are keratin plugs, and I have mostly closed comedones.\n\n\n**Goals**: even/smooth texture, smaller pores.\n\n\n**Current routine**:\nPM:\n- The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Oil\n- Dermalogica Milkfoliant exfoliator (1-2x/week)\n- Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream\n- Vaseline (2-3 nights/week)\n\nI do like oil cleansers but I think I need an emulsifying one, didn't realize that this one wasn't and I don't wear makeup so don't double cleanse.\n\n\nI have tried so many different products, thousands of dollars worth, and I've never found a routine that feels effective. Most products sting my face or are super drying or feel like they didn't clean or moisturize my skin at all. The only thing my skin seems to like is Vaseline, but if I don't cleanse and apply it every night or every other night, my skin just feels weird and gunky? It's hard to describe, and I'm autistic so I don't know if what my skin feels like is how it's *supposed* to feel or not. \n\nI will try some things, and for a few weeks they feel great! But after a while the cleansers feel stripping, the moisturizers seem too thick or thin or just sit on top of my skin, and then I start breaking out.\n\nCerave, Cetaphil, and LRP all break me out. The Aveeno super sensitive line felt like it stopped working and broke me out, but was the best option for a while. Pretty much every sunscreen that I've tried has broken me out.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I (24F) live in Canada, attended a wedding last July and wore a sleeveless dress, and one my friends pointed it out. I have never noticed it my entire life and it was so embarrassing. I've done some reading on it and found out about KP. Before that, I just showered and used shower gel and used the Aveeno Daily moisturizing lotion after.\n\nImmediately switched my moisturizer to the Eucerin Complete Repair Plus Moisturizing Lotion, bought myself a shower glove and read about the First Aid beauty KP Bump Eraser Body Scrub one month later. I've been careful not to exfoliate too often with the glove and the scrub, say I use the glove today, then I'll use the scrub 3-4 days later, then another 3-4 days later the glove again, but always Eucerin moisturizer every day. I've been patient and told myself this will take time, but half a year later, i still haven't made any progress, and the bumps and redness are still there.\n\nI exercise, I think I eat pretty healthy and I shower twice a day. I always struggled with acne and am currently on birth control medication for hormonal acne which helps tremendously. Can someone point me in the right direction to make these go/less noticeable? Is it something with my routine? Products? Diet/lifestyle? I have another big wedding this summer and would really not want to have these showing 😭 I'm welcome to answering more questions if I didn't give enough details. Thank you!",

I’m starting to get really scared, I work in a warehouse doing manual labour so if sweat is the problem exacerbating the spots, I don’t know how to fix it and I’m on HRT and switched to injections recently and I haven’t got my levels sorted so I don’t know if its cause my testosterone is rising or something? Sorry I can’t take photos of myself for evidence cause I don’t like to look at my body, should I see a doctor? try ride it out longer? Use some sort of cream for it?

I think it's a pretty uncommon hair type for my ethnicity (white), I would say I'm a 3C and my hair almost never grows past my shoulder, and I've had it short or buzzed quite a few times in my life (I'm 28F).\nLately (2 years) my hair has been getting more and more damaged. \n\nI've been to different hair salons, they have cut my hair quite a bit three different times, but they're not solving the problem nor styling in a way that makes my hair look full. Even right out of the salon it looks dry and weird. I also went to an expensive bio hairdresser that uses natural treatments but it didn't help much. Now - especially the strands of my hair that are longer and sit on the top of my hair - look more like fried 2B curls, while I have some pretty and healthy looking shorter ones. From what I've seen the previous times I've cut my hair in the last 2 years, cutting a good chunk without going very short doesn't do much. \n\nThe reasons for the damage I can come up with are stress and living in a city with bad quality water from the shower. I've installed some shower filters about 4 months ago and thought there was some improvement, but right now I don't see any.\n\nI'm thinking about cutting it very short, but in my experience short curly hair can be quite difficult to deal with if I need to be out of the door quickly in the morning. With longer hair as I have now, I can put on a hair clip and look presentable, while with short hair it's more time consuming to style it and I honestly don't have the time/energy. I'm not sure about getting a buzz cut cause it doesn't feel like my style anymore, but that phase was truly effortless most of the time. \nI've been noticing this shift for the past 2 years, but lately watching older pictures of myself with a full head of healthy hair is too painful. \n\nMy routine:\n- wash every 4 to 7 days depending on different factors\n- omia aloe shampoo\n- omia almond conditioner \n- omia aloe hair mask \n\n when out of the shower, while still wet\n- redskin deep conditioner \n- aloe vera gel\n- heat protector (when I remember)\n\nThen I diffuse to dry \nI used to sleep with a satin bonnet years ago but didn't see much difference and stopped, I might need to upgrade to better quality, but I don't really think that's the main issue, as I've had longer healthy hair for years without a bonnet.\n\nAny advice is suuper appreciated!",
