BOJ Aqua Fresh Sunscreen:\n- Very moisturizing  \n- Blends like magic, no white cast  \n- Not as glowy as Japanese sunscreens, better aesthetic, not matte either  \n- I also started using the OG BOJ sunscreen and surprisingly that is thinner and lighter than this, but takes more time and effort to blend. And that isn't as moisturizing, and gets off easier.  \n- No breakouts  \n- No tanning  \n- Sticking with Skin Aqua, no repurchase  \n- **9/10**\n\n---\n\n###2. Round Lab Dokdo Toner:\n- Hydrating  \n- Very safe ingredients  \n- Nothing special  \n- Too basic for that price  \n- **6/10**\n\n---\n\n###3. Torriden Skin Booster:\n- Looks like a milky toner  \n- Very hydrating  \n- Not moisturizing  \n- **7/10**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream:\n- Best summer/AM moisturizer I've ever used  \n- Extremely hydrating, a bit moisturizing  \n- Gave me a glass-like glow once my texture was fixed  \n- A bit pricey or would've repurchased  \n- **9/10**\n\n---\n\n### 5. Formularx Barrier Relief Moisturizer:\n- Decent barrier care moisturizer  \n- Good hydration-to-moisture ratio  \n- The new Minimalist B12 pink one is better in terms of price and feel  \n- **7/10**\n\n---\n\n### 6. Goodal Hyaluron Soothing Ampoule:\n- Best calming, soothing ampoule I've used  \n- Better than Skin1004 Probio Cica ampoule  \n- Makes my skin supple, soft, and healthy  \n- Beautiful bottle  \n- Would repurchase if I keep getting it around 1k  \n- **9.5/10**\n\n---\n\n### 7. Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner: \n- I've heard it's extremely good for sensitive skin  \n- Since I do not have sensitive skin, it just felt like water to me  \n- **3/10**\n\n---\n\n### 8. Haru Haru Wonder Black Rice Toner:\n- Most hydrating toner I've ever used  \n- Too pricey tho  \n- **8/10**\n\n---\n\n### 9. Plum Rice Water and Niacinamide Toner:\n- Bang for bucks  \n- Doesn't cause any issues for my skin  \n- Softening and hydrating effect  \n- Will keep repurchasing  \n- **10/10**\n",

I’m in Australia so preferably products that are sold in Australia or products that I could easily ship here. I have a mixture of different types on waves throughout my hair, I also have straight hair on the underside which is very annoying. My hair was bleached for around 6 years, I think this is why I’m struggling with straight ends even on the wavy strands from damage. Sidebar: does anyone have any tips on how to remedy this or do I simply need to wait until the damaged hair grows out and chop it off? One side of my hair is significantly more wavy than the other, I presume this is also stress and damage from me sleeping on one side. Pics 1&amp;2 are the same day but shows the difference between both sides of my hair. I do try to wear a silk bonnet to bed but I find it uncomfortable and usually will take it off in my sleep.\n\nMy current routine is: I wash my hair 2-3 times per week.\n\n•\t⁠Shampoo and condition with redken extreme anti snap.\n•\t⁠Once a week I will use k18 bind repair treatment in place of conditioner.\n•\t⁠After my shower I use kerastase nutritive lotion Thermique sublimatrice heat protectant.\n•\t⁠Then I use Kristen ess leave in curl crème, I apply this in sections through my hair, then use a curl creating crush to brush it through and separate strands, then I scrunch my hair. I do this all round my hair.\n•\t⁠Then I use the not your mother curl talk sculpting gel and follow the same process as above.\n•\t⁠I then plop my hair using a microfiber towel to absorb excess moisture and product for 15 mins or so. Then I let it air dry.\n\nI really struggle with frizz, my hair is sometimes even frizzy while it’s wet, so I struggle to find a balance between the right amount of products and my hair either being crispy, or not-defined and frizzy. I’m not entirely sure I’m using the correct products for my hair type either. All hair care and styling recommendations and tips will be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",

      "content": "It’s been over a year now since my skin suddenly changed. A year and a few months ago, I started getting acne…small, closed comedones that slowly spread across my face. Back then, I had no idea what was causing it. I tried everything I could think of to fix it, but in the process, I damaged my skin even more.\n\nNow, over a year later, I’m dealing with new problems. My skin feels completely different from how it used to be. It used to be dry, but now it’s extremely oily. I don’t even understand why. There’s texture all over my face: tiny bumps that cover my forehead, temples, chin, jawline, and cheeks. The camera doesn’t even pick it up properly, but in real life, my skin is full of these little uneven spots.\n\nSometimes, those bumps get inflamed. They turn red and form crusts, just like in the picture. I still get closed comedones, and my skin often looks red and irritated. It gets red very easily, and it reacts to almost everything. My whole face feels rough and unbalanced.\n\nI’ve simplified my routine as much as possible a gentle cleanser in the morning, another cleanser in the evening, and a moisturizer. That’s it. But even with this minimal routine, my skin still won’t heal. I don’t know what it needs anymore.\n\nI’m mentally exhausted. I’ve been to multiple doctors (for my skin) and psychiatrists (for my mental health) because I can’t handle this constant struggle with my skin. It’s taken over my life. I barely leave my house, I don’t do the things I used to love, and I just feel stuck. Sad, defeated, and hopeless.\n\nAt this point, I want to ask for Accutane. I know it’s not an easy medication, but I’ve reached a point where I’m ready to try anything that might give me my confidence and peace back.\n\nI’m writing this with tears in my eyes because I don’t know what else to do. This is my cry for help. I just want to get rid of this acne and feel like myself again.",

Now my hair looks quite orange/coppery, and I honestly feel a bit like a clown 😅.\n\nMy natural roots are growing in (medium ash blonde/brown), and my hair feels a bit dry after the Efassor treatment. I’d like to fix the color tomorrow so I can look somewhat decent for work on Tuesday — but I don’t want to damage my hair further.\n\nHere’s what I currently have at home:\n\t•\tL’Oréal Majirel 8.13\n\t•\tL’Oréal Dia Light 9.13, 10.12, 6.28, and 6.3\n\nMy question is:\n👉 Which of these would be best to use to tone down the orange/red and make it look more natural or neutral?\n👉 Should I also color my roots now, or wait until my hair feels less dry?\n\nI was thinking about mixing Dia Light 9.13 + 10.12 to neutralize warmth, but I’m not sure if that’s strong enough or if I should go for something darker like 6.3 or 6.28 to even everything out. Or should I buy a box dye tomorrow? I live in Germany. End result should be a nice dark blonde or light brown. What looks best honestly.\n\nAny professional advice or personal experience would be really appreciated!\nThank you in advance ❤️\n",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
