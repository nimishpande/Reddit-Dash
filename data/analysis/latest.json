Thank you so much for that. \n\nBut I also appreciate all the feedback and took the advise of those who said I probably needed more product in my routine to help hydrate my hair. \n\nI took the time to section my hair and apply leave in and gel to each section. \n\nI used miss jessies curly pudding for my leave in  and not your mother’s curl talk flash gel. I then used my bounce curl to curl each section and finished by defusing my hair. \n\nI still see a bit of frizz at my root so I probably needed a bit more gel there. But over all I’m happy with how my hair turned out for last nights event. \n\nI will say my day two hair is still struggling a bit especially at the root but it was extra foggy this morning and wet so that probably did me in.

I had grown up always just brushing my hair out and then I learned how to use a flat iron and never looked back.. Until I started bleaching my hair. So I decided to put down the heat tools and learn how to do my natural hair.\nMy routine: \n1. I wash and condition with Redken Extreme Length (struggling to grow my hair because with it becoming healthier it also shrinks a lot) and usually do a hair mask every other washday. \n2. I use Sun Bum Leave in Conditioner, Sun Bum Curl Cream, Not Your Mother’s Gel, and a Bounce Curl Volume Brush. I also diffuse my hair upside down (I ❤️ volume) \n3. I scrunch and shake out my hair with Mielle Hair Oil\nI don’t do refreshes, I wash my hair around 2x a week, usually oil everyday, and I sleep in a silk bonnet. I also usually only wear my hair down to avoid breakage. Would love any hair growth tips!! \n",

      "content": "Early male, 20s. I have two toned lips but nothing really helped with that pigmentation, so I'm not gonna talk about it and I made peace with it. I'll review the spf and non-spf ones separately:\n\n#SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Chaptex spf 15 🟢\n\n- My derm prescribed me this when I had extremely dry and cracked lips (turned out to be cheilitis)\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, no fragrance, doesn't taste bitter, has humectant (D-Panthenol)\n\n- Has only spf 15. I see most people suggesting to use at least spf 30 or higher. I wish they made a spf 30 version\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##2. NMFe spf 40 🟢\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, has slight fragrance (I like it), has humectant (aloe vera extract)\n\n- It tastes bitter, that's the only complaint I have\n\n- Overall: 9.5/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##3. Sebamed spf 30 🔴\n\n- Has slight fragrance (didn't like it), very expensive, wasn't that moisturizing\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##4. Minimalist spf 30 (not in the picture) 🟢\n\n- Super cute packaging (but the lid broke after a few months 🥲), fragrance free, has humectant (Hyaluronic acid)\n\n- it's waxy, not quite easy to spread\n\n- Overall: 8.5/10. Will probably repurchase.\n\n___\n\n___\n\n#Non-SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Vaseline lip therapy Creme Brulee 🔴🟢\n\n- The caption under it says *for deliciously kissable lips* which hurts even more because it reminds me I have no-one to kiss 😭💀\n\n- It smells exactly like the Vaseline lip therapy cocoa butter one, it's very hard to differentiate the smell. Quite moisturizing, love the smell obv\n\n- Little heavy on the pocket (probably because it's imported?)\n\n- Overall: 8/10 (subtracted 1 for the caption). WNRP\n\n___\n\n##2. Vaseline skin protecting jelly (indian version) 🟢\n\n- Almost every Indian household has it lol. It's good, does its job\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##3. Vaseline BLUESEAL pure petroleum jelly (imported) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT! I wish they sold this here in India everywhere instead of the skin protecting jelly\n\n- I bought it from Amazon but I was skeptical initially because of the picture the seller put on Amazon lol.\n\n- It's AMAZING! Seals the moisture very well and I also use it for slugging in the night. It's smoother and more buttery compared to the Indian version we get\n\n- I don't use it on the lips alone, I'll be mentioning my current routine which is helped me the most at the end of the post\n\n- Overall: 11/10. WRP! HG\n\n___\n\n##4. Nipcare 🔴\n\n- Bought it at the expense of weird looks from the pharmacy guy (didn't know it is used by lactating mothers for sore nipples)\n\n- It smells really awful (Lanolin, can't complain), didn't really do much for my lips and it's also not easy to spread it\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##5. Laneige Lip sleeping mask (berry) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT 🐐 helped me so much with my dry lips. Not a big fan of that smell but it doesn't bother me. Leaves a white film on lips and I rub the entire thing off in the morning after waking up and there you go, plumpy soft lips!\n\n- It's probably a little overpriced but it lasts really long so can't complain ig\n\n- Overall: 10/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##6. LRP Cicaplast B5 baume 🔴\n\n- I didn't know you can also use it as a lip balm until I read some of the comments here but it didn't do anything for my lips and they felt even more dry in the morning \n\n- it's good as a barrier repair cream tho, helped me with redness and irritation near nose corners when I increased my tret frequency \n\n- Overall: 0/10 for lips, 8.5/10 for barrier repair\n\n___\n\n##7. Vaseline lip therapy tin (cocoa &amp; original) 🟢\n\n- It was a pain in the a*s to open the packaging but I bought the original one recently and it was super easy to open. Glad they changed its packaging (not sure about the cocoa one tho)\n\n- It's thick, does its job as an occlusive\n\n- Both of them are good. The cocoa one smells heavenly but I personally found the original one to be better.\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##8. Vaseline lip care total moisture (tube) (not in the picture) 🟢🔴\n\n- I love the smell, it's amazing! Very glossy finish and hydrates well. Affordable!\n\n- Hard to apply with that spherical base and I don't like touching it \n\n- Overall: 7/10. WRP\n___\n\n##9. Nova ayurvedic cream 🔴\n\n- My grandma suggested me this one. It's good with the hydration part but the fragrance is veryyy heavy and the lips kinda burn initially after application \n\n- Overall: 3/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##Current routine:\n\nAM: NMFe\n\nPM: Laneige lip sleeping mask + Vaseline BLUESEAL \n\nThis routine helped me so much with dry lips. But not applying lip balm for even 1 day makes my lips dry again. My derm suggested that I use lip balm at least thrice a day and asked me to reapply whenever they felt dry. \n\n___\n\n##HONORARY MENTION: Brillare natural coconut lip balm \n\nWHAT DO I EVEN SAY? Hate is a strong word and I hate this lip balm with a passion. The texture of it is ugly af, it literally sticks to my finger. It smells like shit. I have tried applying it only once and was weirded out with the texture but still wanted to try and apply. This idiot doesn't even spread, it's that thick and sticky. THE WORST LIP BALM I'VE EVER SEEN 🏆",

I don’t know if it’s the way i’m styling my wavy hair or if the haircut isn’t good for my hair type. I looove the wolf cut short layer look on longer hair, but when I pull my hair to the front, it looks so short in the back. I almost feel like too much of my underneath layer was cut… when i wear my hair to the front, the back looks like a bob or scraggly. Is it the way i’m styling it or was it not meant for my hair texture? \n\nTruthfully, my mom has pin straight hair so I never learned how to properly style or care for my hair. This is what it looks like fresh after a shower with curl cream (eva nyc), defining mousse (ouidad) and (an attempt at) diffusing. help :( ",

I don’t know what products actually matter for this style, and the only thing that’s easy for me to find are glitters, but they’re almost always too chunky. I’m specifically looking for that very fine, delicate shimmer, not big sparkles\n\nSo I wanted to ask:\n\nWhat kind of products are usually used for looks like this?\n\nIs it more about toppers, shimmery bases, pigments, or technique?\n\nAre there any key products to start with without buying a lot?\n\nAny advice, product recommendations, or even keywords to search would really help. Thank you ✨",

      "content": "Posting in this in case it helps someone else! I have fine curls that when I followed a routine and thought I did everything right most of the time they would not clump, come out stringy, and fall flat and limp and thin. I tried different products in different orders,  on different levels of wetness, etc, and eventually chalked it up to humidity and things out of my control. \n\nI was under the impression that since my curls were fine it was very important to get as much water out of my hair as possible (I almost never diffuse, and airdry instead) as to not weigh them down. After applying my product on wet hair I would use a cotton shirt and scrunch upwards and pulse as much water out as possible. Doing this also removed a lot of product and therefore reduced the hold, and my clumps would get ruined. \n\nAnyone else find this to be the case? What I’m doing now is applying my product to super wet hair out of the shower, use a cotton shirt to scrunch and pulse upwards the same but this time only doing a couple passes, before I would do it continuously until I got it as dry as possible. So my hair now air dries more damp and my routine seems to be working alot better! Not perfect but a good improvement!\n\nHair type: fine, oily\n\nEvery other day: double shampoo roots with garnier curl nourish, (will sub out for Nizoral or ouai detox shampoo as needed based on buildup, usually atleast 1x/week) \n\nAs needed (maybe 1x/month): exfoliate with ouai scalp scrub and scalp brush\n\nOn soaking wet hair in order: Not your mothers leave in spray curl talk conditioner, tresseme extra hold volumizing mousse, and curlsmith in shower style fixer gel\n\nApplication method: with head tilted, rake in and praying hands with tension to form clumps, then gently scrunch upwards only a couple times. Use cotton shirt to scrunch upwards again to absorb some water but not all, and air dry damp, in the morning I scrunched out the cast. I didn’t pineapple or anything over night (it always gave me mixed results)",

I notice if I cover my face while walking, those areas aren’t as red after, but it’s hard to have everything covered. Today was -12 celsius so it’s super cold but I had on a balaclava so most of the blotchy redness was just the apples of my cheeks where the fabric didn’t cover.\n\nI’m going to get something to wear with more coverage, but I can’t help to think that my skin barrier is just so damaged or something it can’t protect me from the cold/dry air.\n\nI use cetaphil cleanser with a silicone face scrubby, tatcha dewy skin moisturizer and alternate with the inky list ceramide lotion, Sephora brand caffein eye cream and the inky list vitamin c serum. I do shower and scrub my face (silicon scrubby thing) daily because I work out every day but idk if that matters.\n\nIs there anything I can add or replace my routine with to help?

I like the look of it blown out more than curly personally. I used to straighten it but now I don’t. I also used to do keratin treatments but I don’t now after researching how bad it is. My hair used to be huge and voluminous and amazing when it was curly and now it’s thin. My hair is so dry. I sometimes dye my hair dark brown. I cut it on my own because they only cut an inch which I’ve learned how to do on my own because I don’t want to pay $60 for a hair cut personally. It does grow a little bit it’s always damaged and very thin. I lose a little bit of hair whenever I shower. I used to take Nutrafol but it’s so expensive. \n\nIt feels like no matter what I do, it looks like I got electrocuted. I do a hair mask twice weekly, I wash my hair only once a week. I only blow dry my hair once a week, it’s the only thing I do to my hair. The second any humidity hits my hair, the bottom curls. It poofs up the second I go outside and I can’t be in the rain. \n\nI use heat protector, anti humidity spray, smoothing spray before blow drying.\n\nNexus epic shine anti humidity spray, xmondo forcefield heat spray, igk good behavior spirulina protein smoothing spray.\n\nAlso, my hair is thinning and I’m losing hair. What’s the best product that you’d recommend?",

      "title": "How to get the most out of a haircut? (and severe haircut anxiety)",
      "content": "I usually have bad experiences in my area with Great Clips so I've been going to a hair salon which charges around $80 before tip. I like it better but it also feels so expensive to get a 20-30 minute haircut for \\~$100. I also usually come out of a haircut absolutely hating my hair since the wash/blowout usually messes up my hair a lot (slide 2). I don't know a lot about social conventions or norms when it comes to this kind of thing, so a few questions:\n\n1. Is it normal to ask to skip a wash for a haircut? Is it easier to cut hair when it's wet? If so, is it normal to ask to skip shampoo? \n2. Is it normal to ask to skip the blowout? Almost every place I've gone to will blowout my hair after the cut and my hair doesn't respond well to that at all (second slide). It gets very straight and looks dry and damaged. The one time I asked to skip it I paid and walked out with wet hair and it felt a little silly walking out before getting to even see what it would look like dry, but also I would feel bad sitting in a chair taking up space waiting for my hair to dry. Maybe I should book longer appointments or at least be willing to sit there for the full amount of time they say the haircut lasts (for example, an hour)?\n3. Is it normal to ask to skip both of those things?\n4. Does anyone try to make use of any products they offer to you with the haircut, for example any sorts of hair serums/treatments, leave-ins, or anything too expensive to pay for yourself that might be included for free in the cut? One time I asked for some oil (since they gave me a blowout and it looked very dry) and I wasn't charged anything extra. Wondering if this is something I should make use of more often?\n5. Talking to your stylist while getting your hair cut? It seems like something so many people do but I don't really know how to do it. I feel very awkward sitting there and not talking or being on my phone or anything. It might be partly my anxiety but also partly that I keep switching stylists. What do you guys normally do? I also want to try to find someone who helps me feel enthusiastic about my hair. Growing up I was subconsciously modeled that I'm not allowed to take care of myself and that it is superficial so I still have a lot of guilt about paying money to look and feel better about myself. Because of this I imagine it would be nice to have a stylist who helps me be enthusiastic about the process even as much as I might feel that I shouldn't. Maybe that's asking for more than a stylist is being paid for. Any similar experiences?  \n6. I also feel like I could be getting more value out of my cut by talking to my stylist about what I want more. Usually whenever I book an appointment with a consultation I feel like we usually just talk for 1 or 2 minutes and then start, even though the consultations are described as 15 minute or so discussions about what I want from my cut. And whenever a stylist asks me if everything looks good, I usually just say yes because I'm anxious about being \"qualified\" to identify what I don't like about my hair or the cut and also anxious about showing that I care about my appearance. Any tips to make this easier? \n7. Should you pay this much just for a trim? My hair starts to split maybe 10-12 weeks after getting a cut so I try to get regular maintenance cuts all over (not just my bangs) around 8 weeks and latest 14 weeks, but this gets expensive and I feel weird paying $100 when the stylist isn't giving me a completely different style. Maybe I'm underestimating the skill it requires to leave a style as is and just shorten it all around. I haven't been able to find any salons in my area that charge less for a trim than for a full cut and style.\n8. Do ygs see any difference between the cuts (different prices)? The first slide was the $80 cut, the third and fourth slides were a $30 cut which I got around 10 weeks after the $80 cut.",

I read that the shampoo I’ve been using isn’t great for everyday washing (I work in a barn and my hair gets disgusting and stinks of horses if I don’t wash it everyday) due to excessive protein. I’m not sure how true it is, but I was hoping to get some advice on different types of shampoo &amp; conditioners that help with growing out my hair, breakage, and shedding. I don’t know what is and isn’t “safe” products, I’ve heard of products leaving harmful films on hair so I would like to steer clear of them. Any suggestions and recommendations would help :) Thank you!",
