I am allergic to a lot of shampoos and the like due to MCAS so finding things that don't make my entire head itch is hard, and I'm easily exhausted due to ME/CFS so I try to keep my routine simple.

      "content": "The short answer is: it doesn't exist. Mineral sunscreens use physical blockers like Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide that sit on top of your skin. Their job is to physically scatter and reflect harmful UV light away from you. Unfortunately, those same ingredients also reflect visible light, creating the white cast we all know. You can't have the UV protection from these minerals without the physical properties that cause the cast.\n\nSo, instead of searching for a unicorn, best bet is to look for sunscreens that are tinted, as the pigment neutralizes the white hue. Alternatively, look for formulas described as sheer or low-cast, which often use smaller mineral particles to drastically reduce how noticeable the cast is. Let's help each other out—what are your favorite low-cast or tinted mineral sunscreens?",

Both Photos are with wet hair. IMO, wet hair is when you really see how thin it's getting. \n\nInitially i was on Rogaine and off brand (Kirkland) for many years, noticed in my late 30s.  Finally got on Fin last year. I opted for topical due to fear of side effects. Topical has worked remarkably well for me and I've had 0 side effects. \n\nJust wanted to post to show the progress i've made in 12 months. First picture was at the begining of a shed. It did get a little worse than what's shown here however i only took pics on the 15th of the month and only after i saw the shed getting better. In hindsight i should have taken photos of the shed because it was very heartbreaking.  However, by Nov it was getting better. Taking photos every month really helped me keep the faith.   \n\nI've also noticed my hair is much more healthy looking. Prior to this it always seemed dried out, almost wiry and tired. Now it seems much healthier, almost bouncier... if that's a thing.  \n\nA lot of people have been blaming creatine for thinning and maybe that is the case for me as well. I've also been using Creatine for over 10+ years, just on gym days - 2-3 times a week. I'm still using it. So take that for what it's worth. \n\nGoodluck!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I had this style before and loved it, but this time something went wrong maybe a miscommunication and I ended up with a bowl-shaped bob instead. I hated it, but it was already too short to fix, so I decided to wait a bit for it to grow.\n\nAfter about 3 months, I went to another salon to even it out and shape it better, but somehow it looks even more awkward now. My hair is thin and straight, and I can’t really style it nothing holds, and I don’t use products or heat because it’s sensitive and prone to falling. I’ve been really unhappy with it for months.\n\nI just want to get it trimmed in a way that makes it easier to grow into a proper bob or at least something more wearable. What should I tell the hairdresser exactly? Or should I just wait it out and let it grow more before cutting again ? What would you recommend ? \n\nreference pictures: current situation and the hair once i had (so you can understand my texture and how it is naturally styled better)\n",

      "title": "Hair Transplant in Mumbai For Women?",
      "content": "Hello! Hope everyone’s doing swell. I am aware this might be the wrong forum, please do bear with me as I do not have enough karma to post this anywhere else.   \n\nTo get to the point, I’m travelling to Mumbai soon for hair transplant and need suggestions. I am so lost.   \n\nI’ve tried accepting my thinning hair and letting it be, but for the past 5 years, my hair part has been getting wider and wider until it’s the first thing people notice about me. I’m only in my mid-twenties. Putting what other people think aside, it’s heavily affecting my self-confidence as well. It is my humble **request to please not suggest I accept my condition** and let it be. Believe me, I’ve truly tried my best! 😂   \n\nA little background on my situation:   \n\nTo start with, I don’t have PCOS. I also have a very oily scalp, but frizzy and dry Type 2B hair. I had a consultation with a dermatologist last year (September 2024) and after seeing the overall thinning and a widening part, they told me it’s alopecia and prescribed me topical minoxidil. If you want to have a visual representation of the current state of my hair, it looks a lot like [this](https://i.redd.it/female-pattern-baldness-help-v0-l8wzw9mic5md1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b00366f0ced22047a73e98756ff2296f05e5c6d).   \n\nAnd so, I’ve tried topical Minoxidil for the past 2 years with little to no progress. I also opted for 2 sessions of PRP, but still nada (I took pictures weekly over the course of those 2 months to see if I was making any progress).   \n\nMy blood test as of 2 months ago included nutritional and metabolic panels (glucose, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, zinc, etc.), endocrinology (TSH, prolactin), kidney function profile, serum lipid profile, liver function profile, and HbA1C.   \n\nEver since I started living on my own in 2019, I’ve had low blood levels to the point where one doctor almost diagnosed me with thalassemia. My haemoglobin, HCT, MCV, and MCH always come out low. Whereas my TIBC and cholesterol levels are slightly high.   \n\nThese levels remained the same this time so doctor prescribed some ferrous fumarate and told me it’s nothing to worry about (regarding my health, not hair) and I should incorporate more greens in my diet. Also told me to take Vitamin D3 (5,000 IU) pills daily for only 3 months. That’s about it.   \n\nMy parents are in their 50s and have a good amount of hair on their heads, and my grandfathers from both sides had fantastic hair until their 70s. My grandmothers, however, also still have thicker hair than I do. So genetics might not play a role here.   \n\nI am also not stressed out. I’ve graduated, have a remote job with amazing coworkers, and live an overall chill life. There are no big decisions weighing on my mind and my mental state is A-OK.   \n\nLastly, I have been avoiding oral meds because I’m afraid they might undo my laser hair removal results. Hence why I’m thinking about a hair transplant now, though I’m still not 100% sure if that’s the right call.   \n\nCost is not a problem. Could you guys please recommend any legitimate and considerate doctors/clinics in Mumbai for a hair transplant procedure for females?   \n\nI would prefer it if it is a female doctor, but if you can’t think of any, please do feel free to suggest any doctor you could vouch for that have results to show for it.   \n\nI wouldn’t mind it if any women want to show me their own results and what worked for them by dropping me a DM.   \n\nIf you’ve reached this point, greatly appreciate you sparing your time reading this. Cheers!",

      "content": "Hi!!\n\nSo, I’ve been dealing with some breakouts for the past 6 months or so. I was taking Biacna Gel (Tretinoin) but it wasn’t controlling my skin well. My doctor then put me on TactuPump (Adapalene + Benzoyl Peroxide) - it was helping for a while, but I could still feel like my skin was prone to breaking out and just feeling dull/not at its best, even when moisturizing with the retinoids. \n\nMind you, I was never big into skincare - I had 0 routine and was hoping that the prescription would do all the heavy lifting. It’s actually while browsing this sub that I learned about the skin barrier and signs that it may be damaged (better late than never, right?)\n\nFor the past 2 weeks, I’ve ditched the prescription and adopted a routine:\n\nAM:\nBioderma Sensibio Gel cleanser\nLa Roche-Posay Mela B3 Face serum\nEither Cetaphil SPF 15 or Cerave SPF 30 moisturizer (depending on whether I’m going out or staying in, and I apply Cerave SPF 30 before going out if it’s a few hours later). \n\nPM:\nGarnier micellar rose water or Bioderma Sensibio if my skin feels icky\nOlay Complete 3 in 1 moisturizer (no SPF)\nLa Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 (only if my skin feels extra dry)\nAnd I’ve recently started slugging for the last 2 nights by applying a thin petroleum jelly layer to lock it all in. \n\nAt this point, I’m still dealing with some residual blemishes, but my active pimples have drastically decreased. I still have some closed comedones on my forehead that I’ll address, hopefully when I reintegrate my retinoid in a few weeks once my barrier is in shape. Either that or a good chemical exfoliant (or both?)\n\nThank you for all the insight and education, and I’m all ears if you have advices!",

But on Sunday evening, I tried to carefully put in Weightless Air Dry Cream and then Curl Retainer. I was really careful and do it in 4 sections. Then I used a spray heat protectant and difused.\n\nLooked good on Monday. Looked okay on Tuesday morning. By the afternoon it was over. I tried to \"refresh\" last night. I used mousse, but that didn't really do much to help. I had it up in a puff today (Wednesday).\n\nDid anyone have a lot of problems keeping curls, then discovered something that worked for them? I don't even need a week. If I could have made it so that I washed again on Thursday evening, I would have been happy! My goal is to wash and redo twice a week.\n\nair. Medium to fine. I don't know my porosity, but I assume it's normal. Color treated (cause I'm gray).\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\n\\------------\n\nRoutine -\n\nKind of a product junkie. Right now I switch off between Cecred Shampoo and Not Your Mother's (new version of Tahitian). Same for conditioner.\n\nUse weightless air dry cream from curlsmith and curl smith's curl retainer gel. Refreshed a bit Monday night with Curlsmith moisture memory or whatever it's called.\n\nI tried putting in a pattern mousse on Tuesday evening, but hair was still frizzy the next morning, so that was a waste of time. My hair doesn't really like Pattern, but I keep trying because I love the way the Palo Santo version smells.\n\nI've added my silly facebook pic because it was easy to access. This was first day hair with Rizos stronghold gel and mousse.\n\n[IMAGE. ](https://preview.redd.it/w7jo756c3cvf1.jpg?width=1254&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6c9607907cbae2548b8a3140f21eb923d65da84)",

I’ve gone to derm and was given tretinoin 0.05% and clindamycin, but I have been also gifted a couple products and bought some myself over the past few months (see picture). I’ve tried researching what to use and when but I’m lost, and I need your help.\n\nSo heres my question for you all: what should I be doing?\n\nI want a good routine for morning and night, and am willing to spend money to make my skin glow. Preferably I’d like to use what I have now and then swap it out for better stuff as I run out or rebuy what I have if it’s good.\n\nMy skin is fairly dry and irritated, and I do have acne. Given that, and based on the products I have:\n\n- what is a good morning/night routine using my current stuff\n- what should I toss because it’s either bad or not useful\n- what (if anything) should I buy to complete my routine\n\nThank you in advance! \n\n",

I will say I'm quite young (younger than 20, if that helps) and I don't intend to upgrade to a super elaborate skin care routine or start using retinol. I'm content with just a few steps, and so far my skin isn't too bad but I'm never without atleast one pimple (could be big or small). If anyone has any product recommendations, I ask they be affordable ($30 or less). My skin type is oily.\n\nTLDR; Can I use liquid exfoliant and a clay mask on the same day, and if so what order?

      "title": "[Acne] What helped me heal my hormonal mouth/chin acne",
      "content": "Unfortunately I do not have any before pictures (mostly due to me being too embarrassed to take pictures of my breakout at the time). I am 21F and have suffered from stubborn cystic acne around my mouth and chin areas for the longest time. I have been on Accutane twice and both times my acne always came back full force in these areas 7-10 months after finishing the medication. I had also been on tretinoin to no avail.\n\nRecently I did a bunch of research into ways people have healed their mouth/chin acne and tried out a bunch of stuff that people recommended and my acne is almost fully healed save for a few tiny invisible clogged pores here and there. But no cystic pimples! I have always been under the assumption that my acne is hormonal, but despite my derms recommendations I refused to go on birth control or spironolactone after all the horror stories I've heard from people who've tried those methods. I was also just sick of going on meds for my acne. I wanted to try and heal with diet and lifestyle changes.\n\nI started all of these methods at the same time so I couldn't tell you which one (or few) of these worked but I like to think they all contributed a little bit in their own ways. I am not a dermatologist or a doctor, I am just sharing what worked for me! Always listen to your derm before anybody else and don't try any new vitamins or healing methods without consulting your doctor first:\n\n**- SLS free toothpaste:** along with washing my face AFTER brushing my teeth, I heard SLS can be pretty nasty on the skin and switched to a toothpaste that is SLS free. Most Sensodyne toothpastes are SLS free but check the packaging first\n\n**- Spearmint tea:** I never got my hormones tested but the nature of my acne, plus other PCOS symptoms I have been experiencing, led me to believe my acne is hormonal, and spearmint tea is said to lower androgens so I started drinking 1-2 cups per day. I hate the taste so I usually take it iced with honey to make it more palatable. I recently ordered spearmint in capsule form to avoid having to drink it. PLEASE TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR FIRST before trying to change your hormones in any way or before starting any new vitamins!\n\n**- Cutting out dairy:** I found that my breakouts became more angry and cystic after consuming cows milk specifically. Not sure about cheese and yogurt, I just know that milk is a big trigger for my acne. Cutting out most dairy products and switching to non-dairy alternatives has calmed my skin\n\n**- Azelaic Acid:** I used the Anua Azelaic Acid for a while, however it didn't do anything for me and burnt my skin when I used it. I switched to Azclear and it's been serving me well so far. People complain that it piles, however I find if you only use a pea-sized amount for the whole face and wait 5-10 minutes between it and moisturiser it sits on the skin fine without piling. I've also heard good things about Finacea and Paula's Choice.\n\nAs I said, it might have only been one of these lifestyle changes that fixed my skin but I continue to do all of them regardless because my skin is finally getting back to where I want it to be. It took me about a week to start seeing results but this may vary for other people. What works for me may not work for other people so please keep that in mind if you decide to try any of these!",
