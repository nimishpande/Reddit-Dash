I have normal combination skin – as far as I can tell. I grew up in the desert and have some dark spots. I have red undertones. My current routine is as follows\n\nAM:  \nLa Roche Posay *Effaclar micropeeling cleanser*  \nSkinceuticals *CE Ferulic*  \nCerave *Intensive moisturising + hydro-urea*  \nLRP Anthelios\n\nPM:  \nLRP *Effaclar micropeeling cleanser*  \nLRP *Effaclar serum* (every other day)  \nCerave *Intensive moisturising + hydro-urea*\n\nIf I have an extra dry areas I'll apply Avène *Cicalfate+.* My main questions are:\n\nI just started using the Cerave as a face moisturiser because... I already owned it? Before I used the *Cicalfate+*but I think that clogged my pores. What moisturiser would you recommend for this routine/my skin? Happy with no frills – Kiehl's?\n\nHow can I manage redness? Azelaic acid? Where would I put this in my routine? Any recommendations on products?\n\nMy skin gets quote red when I apple LRP *Effaclar serum*. It is okay after 30 mins but should I drop it and go for a gentler BHA?\n\nThank you in advance and any other advice/input welcome!",

They're all sensitive, unscented types, so I don't understand why he says it burns. He only has that sensation on his forehead, eyebrows, hairline, and upper cheeks. (FYI: checked his skin and he's red all over those areas 😭). He obviously doesn't have barrier damage from overusing skincare, as this is the first and only thing he uses, he doesn't have any history of rosacea or eczema, its just like hes allergic to every moisturiser??? Not even cerave or decubal works, so im at a loss. He says it burns for like 30 minutes and then it goes away, but his skin is irritated as hell.\n\nHow do I help him without giving him facial burns? Ive had that happen to me twice, one was just bad for everyone (avoid cosmica), and the other was some la roche thing, but most moisturisers are fine on me, but he's seemingly allergic to everything.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

Double cleanse with Garnier Fructis Curls Method Curly Hair Shampoo\n3. Garnier Fructis Curls Method Hair Mask for Curly Hair\n4. Slightly dry my hair with a very soft cloth\n5. Apply Garnier Fructis Curls Method Hair Mask as a leave in conditioner and scrunch\n6. Apply the Garnier Fructis Curls Method Refreshing Curl Spray\n\nAfter that I just go to bed and when I wake up my hair is dry and nice. So my current routine seems to be working fine. However, I want my hair to have more volume. Hence, I am thinking of buying the Bounce Curl Volume EdgeLift brush. I am also not sure if buying a diffuser is a good idea. What other products should I add to my routine? Curl cream, gels, oils? \n\nI looked through lots of posts on this sub and watched a ton of tutorials on YT and I am kinda overwhelmed😅. So please give me some suggestions and recommendations that you think would fit my routine or improve it.\n\nThank you!!&lt;3",

I've looked at local stylists Instagram, gone and got haircuts, asked for recommendations from friends...still no luck. Finally, desperate I find a salon about 40 minutes away with great reviews and I love the vibe of the place. I get a haircut from a newish stylist. Its turns out ok. I'm used to not being 100% satisfied with cuts bc my hair is very fine and I like the girl so I rebook for a color. My color does not come out light enough but it still looks nice and I think over time the hairstylist will become more experienced and I will communicate more effectively in the future.\n\nAlmost a year later I come back to the same stylist and I tell her I want to go even lighter.  I want dramatic and I'm not worried about what my hair will look like when the color grows out.  Its my birthday and I'm starting a new job so nows a good time for change. My hair is now darker then when I went in. My hair lifts VERY easily. A level 7 is not hard to achieve with my hair. I've been platinum many times before. Maybe the undertone is throwing her off. Anyways, I'm going this afternoon to have her fix it. She offered bc she could tell I didn't like it. I'm not sure if we should try to fix it or if I should ask for a refund. With 20% tip it was a little over $300. ",

Now after reaching my twenties, I really wanted to get this done right. (Get pimples semi-easily, huge god damn pores). Saw a dermatologist a few weeks ago and after some chatting, left with retinol. I was told I need to pay attention to moisturizing and have been following all of their their advice thoroughly. Now after a few weeks of using it, I seem to be going through the \"purge\". I started to wonder if I could use anti-spot gel on the breakout spots, but dont know if it's ok to use while using retinol? The anti-spot gel I have is used for drying out the spots, but since retinol needs so much moisturizing, 1 am now afraid that the anti-spot gel will not be ok...Help!\n\nTLDR: Can I use anti-spot gel ((has alcohol, glycerin, polysorbate 20, propylene glycol, panthenol)) while using retinol? If not, any other way to fight breakouts while using retinol?",

I didn’t use any product when I used it yesterday, so I’d like some advice for what you guys use. My biggest problems are frizz and some sections of my hair don’t curl well (although I did notice a huge change in that with the Dyson, I went from 60% of my hair with good curls with a normal hair dryer and product, to 90% of my hair curled with the Dyson and no product along with a lot less frizz, but still a little).

      "title": "I am losing hope and starting to think this is a scam",
      "content": "I don’t really know what I’m looking for here. I just need to vent and put this out there because I’ve been carrying it for a long time.\n\nI started losing my hair in my early 20s. Even back then my scalp would get insanely itchy, to the point where I couldn’t sleep. In 2022 I finally started finasteride, hoping it would at least slow things down. I stayed on it for about a year and didn’t see any regrowth or noticeable stabilization.\n\nAfter that I added topical minoxidil. I keep my head shaved all the time, so I can’t really track shedding the way most people do. I’m not counting hairs in the sink. But when your head is shaved, you can clearly tell when you’re losing baseline, and that’s exactly what was happening.\n\nAfter about six or seven months on topical min, I stopped because it felt like I was only losing ground and hoping maybe it was just a shed that would recover. It never did.\n\nThat’s when I added dutasteride and oral minoxidil. I didn’t quit fin right away. For a few months I took both fin and dut, then switched to daily dut once I ran out of fin. That’s when things really started getting worse. People kept telling me it was just a shed, but shaved head or not, I knew I was losing ground.\n\nWhile on dut, I started getting this burning or itching sensation on my scalp. Some people call it DHT itch. What really messed with my head was how consistent it felt. The itch would start in areas that still had hair, and two or three weeks later that exact area would basically become where my hairline ended. That pattern repeated itself and didn’t feel random.\n\nI stayed on dut for about six months and then switched back to fin because it felt like dut was destroying whatever I had left. I’m still on fin and oral min now. The itch isn’t as intense as it was on dut, but it never fully went away. Whenever it comes back, it feels like a warning sign that I’m still losing hair.\n\nWhat really gets to me is that I’ve never recovered from any shed. Not once. Hair just fell out and never came back. I’ve had blood work done and everything came back normal.\n\nAt this point I honestly don’t know what to believe anymore. Sometimes it genuinely feels like this whole fin and min thing is just one long pipeline. You’re told to get on the meds early, then when things don’t work or stop working, you’re told to add more meds, increase doses, switch drugs, wait longer, trust the process. And when people finally lose hope, the next answer always seems to be a hair transplant, with the reminder that you’ll still need to stay on meds forever anyway.\n\nI’m not saying these drugs are a lie or that they don’t help anyone. Clearly they help a lot of people. But when you’re someone who keeps losing ground no matter what you do, it’s hard not to question the whole system and wonder if some of us are just stuck chasing something that was never going to work for us.\n\nI guess I just want to know if anyone else has felt this way or gone through something similar, especially people who never recovered from sheds or who had scalp burning or itching that seemed to line up with their hair loss.",

YTTP superfood air-whip cream\n5. YTTP youthscreen (religiously. like i literally keep one in my bathroom and one in my bag so i always have it on me. i don’t play about spf…)\n   1. i do also have ultraviolette's velvet skin/velvet screen/whatever-- whichever the recalled one was lol, but it's very heavy and greasy feeling on me and much prefer youthscreen\n   2. sometimes, i skip the air-whip cream completely and just have youthscreen function as a moisturizer since it makes me a little oily. i've yet to find an SPF that doesn't make me so oily so quick..\n\nPM:\n\n1. ma:nyo pure cleansing oil\n2. youth to the people superfood gel cleanser OR YTTP superfruit gentle exfol… cleanser\n3. dermalogica daily microfoliant (every few days, dependent on how my skin feels)\n4. thayers HA hydrating milky toner\n5.

I have a fringe, although it's not curled properly in the pic, and have had a recent trim so it goes just past my shoulder blades at the back.  As you can see from the second pic, my roots have grown in (I'm naturally a dark cool blonde!) I'm hesitant to put brown dye on my hair, because I know my roots would grow out lighter and look odd, but dark blonde dyes likely wouldn't cover the blue! I would also love to continue doing fun things with my hair, so really I'm just looking for any suggestions at this point! My hair hasn't seen any bleach for about 6 months, and the last blue refresh was probably just over a month ago. The blue is more faded towards the top, as I try to only shampoo my roots. The back gets a bit muddy with banding 🫣, as you can see in the third pic, so maybe a dark colour over the top would be a good idea? I can't afford to pay hundreds for a colour correction, but would wait until I can if people think it's the best option! As for colours, I would be happy with any...I naturally have a pink skin undertone and blue eyes for reference.",

      "title": "[Routine Help] Deep, painful pimples appearing after 4 months of a consistent routine — normal or a sign of overdoing it?",
      "content": "**Hi everyone!**\n\nI’ve noticed that after about **4 months of a consistent daily skincare routine**, I started getting **occasional deep, inflamed pimples**, and I’m trying to understand why this might be happening.\n\nI started skincare at the end of August. I built a basic routine myself after researching dermatologist recommendations. That’s how I ended up starting a **very simple CeraVe-based routine**. My main goal was **skin maintenance and “smart aging.”** (28 F)\n\nI built the routine slowly. During the **first month**, my routine looked like this:\n\n**AM:**  \n– CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  \n– CeraVe Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum  \n– CeraVe SPF 50 Facial Moisturizing Lotion\n\n**PM:**  \n– CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  \n– CeraVe Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum  \n– CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion\n\nMy skin really loved this routine. It cleared up, I got fewer breakouts, and my skin felt balanced.\n\nBecause of that, the next step was introducing exfoliation.  \nFrom the **second month**, I added **The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7%**, using it **once a week**. The results were even better: softer skin, fading marks, and a really smooth texture. The results were so noticeable that my husband also started skincare, and he had similarly positive results.\n\nIn **November**, we introduced **retinol** (CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum), **twice a week**, making sure that exfoliation and retinol were far apart from each other (for example:  \nTuesday night – exfoliation  \nThursday &amp; Saturday night – retinol).\n\nDuring the **first week of retinol**, we both experienced tiny, small, translucent bumps. They didn’t itch and couldn’t be popped. After researching, I found that this can happen at the beginning of retinol use. It went away quickly, and for a full month after that we only saw positive changes: more even skin tone and fewer “sharp” lines. I was watching closely for irritation, but everything looked calm and healthy. Because the breakouts appeared much later (after \\~6–8 weeks of retinol), I’m unsure whether this could still be considered purging, or if it’s more likely irritation or another trigger.\n\nThen, **around mid-December**, I noticed that out of nowhere I started getting **deep, under-the-skin pimples**. They were painful when pressed, but if I left them alone, they would calm down and disappear within **2–3 days**. Since then, I’ve had about **4–5 of these**. I managed to pop one of them, and **greenish-yellow pus** came out, which really surprised me — I’ve honestly never had this type of pimple before, not even as a teenager.\n\nThis is what confuses me: I’ve been following this routine consistently for **4 months**, without major changes. We **use separate towels for our faces** and change them roughly **every 2 days**. We use **about a pea-sized amount of everything**, we don’t over-apply, especially not retinol or exfoliants. There was one time when I overdid the glycolic acid and the tip of my nose started peeling slightly — that taught me very quickly that *less is often more*.  \n  \nHas anyone experienced something similar?  \nDo you think I might be doing something wrong — or is this kind of reaction actually normal?\n\nSince then, I haven’t had any new ones, and it almost feels like my skin has returned to its “well-behaved” state again. (lol — I even wondered if Christmas dehydration, irregular eating, or holiday habits could have played a role.)\n\n**Thanks so much in advance for any insight!**\n\n  \n**TL;DR:**  \n  \n**After \\~4 months of a consistent, gentle routine (CeraVe cleanser, HA serum AM/PM, moisturizer PM, SPF AM), weekly glycolic acid (7%), and retinol twice weekly, my skin improved a lot — until month 4, when I started getting occasional deep, painful, under-the-skin pimples that resolve in a few days if left alone. This didn’t happen earlier in the routine. Wondering if this is normal (delayed retinol purge? overhydration? random inflammation?) or if I’m unknowingly overdoing something despite being careful with amounts and frequency.**  \n\n\n[Photos for context only. Lighting and days are different. Overall my skin still looks healthy — my concern is the sudden appearance of deep, painful, under-the-skin pimples that come and go. The photo is meant as a kind of before–after comparison. The left photo was taken in August at the very beginning of my routine, and the right one was taken in December, about 3 months later. I’d also like to add that the August photo was taken in more natural light, while the December one has less natural light and more artificial lighting.](https://preview.redd.it/s1ify7vsiacg1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87ebc8037d57c529581d75b0fb188afa6fbdd19b)\n\n",
