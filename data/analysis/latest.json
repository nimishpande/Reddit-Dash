      "content": "Hey reddit! Looking for some advice on this crazy curl pattern change. Over the last two years, my curl pattern has gone from the beautiful texture you see on the first slide to the flat, sad pattern in the second, and I’m so lost trying to figure out why. I didn’t change my routine until after the change had occurred, stayed with the same amazing curly hair stylist for years, and didn’t change locations (i.e. water stayed the same). \n\nHere’s the routine I was using 2-3x per week:\n- Oribe hair alchemy shampoo (2 washes) + conditioner\n- Oribe leave-in conditioner\n- Oribe curl gloss\n- Oribe curl mousse\n- Scrunched dry with a microfiber towel, then diffused on low heat. Finished with kerastase oil and oribe anti-humidity spray. \n\nAfter I really started to get frustrated with the change, I tried:\n- Two different heat protectants for over a year, thinking maybe heat damage was the culprit\n- AG Care Renew Clarifying shampoo once per week, thinking buildup may be contributing\n- Innersense True Enlightenment scalp scrub once per month \nThese changes did not make a difference :(\n\nI have consistently used a silk pillowcase and silk bonnet to sleep, both before and after the change. \n\nI fear that, after doing some research, the culprit may be hormonal changes associated with a change in my birth control, or maybe this is just aging-associated change that I can’t control. But, before I jump to talking with my doctor about making major medical changes, does anyone have any other ideas I can try? \n\nTIA for your help and for reading, I miss my curls and really appreciate your help getting them back!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

Lately, my skin hasn’t been great, and it seems to come and go no matter what I do.\n\nA little about me: I’m 25, mostly vegan, and I drink around 3 liters of water per day. My diet is about 75% healthy, but I do still have processed sugar and fast food sometimes. I only wear makeup on the upper part of my face and try to leave my chin alone—though I struggle with skin picking, which doesn’t help.\n\nAbout a year ago, I went to a cosmetician who said my skin barrier was really damaged and needs to be rebuilt slowly. She recommended niacinamide and azelaic acid. I’ve been hesitant to use these because I read that it could be perioral dermatitis, and I haven’t seen a doctor yet because of anxiety and embarrassment.\n\nSince then, I’ve basically stopped using all products except for a low-percentage zinc cream (Balea). I’m wondering if there’s anything else I can do to help my skin heal, and I’d love any product recommendations that are available in Germany.\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice, routines, or personal experiences you could share—especially if you’ve dealt with sensitive, barrier-damaged skin or perioral dermatitis.\n",

To preface, I always had oily skin but I think I have dry skin now from all the products I've used. I had active acne for the longest time and it has finally gone away after I started using 0.025% tretinoin. I also use the Panoxyl Benzoyl Peroxide 10% soap along with a moisturiser and sunscreen when needed. I only recently found out that I have a weak barrier because my skin feels tight and dry after using the cleanser which I assumed was a good thing. Currently my focus is on fading away my PIH and also fixing my barrier. I have decided to use the Topicals Faded serum for the PIH but I'm lost on where to start to fix my barrier.\n\nMy questions are:\n1) Should I change my cleanser to something more gentle (maybe the 4% BP face wash)?\n\n2) Should I stop using the tretinoin since the packaging on the faded serum says \"not recommended to use along with actives\"?\n\n3)What type of products should I look for to fix my barrier? (Serums, toners etc)\n\nI am also planning to purchase the Anua Niacinamide 10% + TXA 4% Dark Spot Correcting Serum. Would this help with fixing my barrier as well? Please suggest a good routine. Any help is appreciated. Thank you :)",

      "content": "The first photo is my attempt at styling, which I disliked because it felt unnatural; I dislike the crunchiness and staleness. The second photo is brushed out and unstyled. The third photo is dried and unstyled, but not yet brushed.\n\nI (f24) have very curly hair. For the whole of my whole childhood, I assumed it was just frizzy and damaged. For the majority of my adult life, I've either straightened it or tied it back to ignore the frizz, but this coming year, I really want to embrace my curly hair.\n\nThe few times I have tried curly hair routines, I've struggled with the texture of mousse and gel on my hair, as I absolutely detest it! One of the main reasons I enjoyed straightening my hair was the soft feeling it gave my hair, so please keep this in mind when recommending products &lt;3\n\nI currently use Being Bye Bye Frizz Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner, as well as Herbal Essences Bio Renew Smoothening Leave-In Cream. For the in-between steps, I am absolutely clueless!\n\nI know you're not meant to dry brush, but does this mean I should wet my hair daily to be able to brush it and detangle it? Working in a bit of a labour-intensive job, my hair is going between tied up in a crappy bun and tied back at the base of my neck several times a day to keep it out of my face.\n\nAny tips and tricks would be appreciated, if products could be from Woolworths/Coles/other Australian stores that sell beauty/pharmacy products and not break the bank, that would be amazing as well.\n\nThank you all so much! Let me know if I need to clarify anything I've said.",

I've been experimenting more lately and realised that affordable, no-frills products sometimes do the job just fine. Just like, ive seen alot of people call Pond's super light gel a dupe for Neutrogena's Hydro Boost, and it honestly made me wonder how much do we have to spend for hydration. \n\nAt the same time, not everything marketed for dry skin helps long term. Some products feel nice for an hour and then the tightness comes right back. super annoying. \n\nSo can y'all recommend what works for your dry skin without it being crazy expensive? Creams, gels, barrier repair stuff im open to all atp. \n\nWould love to hear whats actually made a difference, especially from fellow dry skin folks.",

      "content": "Hi all, I’ve been dealing with acne for the past 3 years. It’s obviously a sinusoid - one time my skin gets so much better but then the bad days come. However, this year I made a promise to myself that I’ll finally heal my skin and be acne free.\n\nI’ve already been using adapelene for some time and recently switched to a different brand and see a huge improvement! I’m also using very gentle cleanser, moisturiser and spf (all from Dr Sam’s - the best thing I’ve ever put on my skin!. My diet is super clean, I drink bone broth (even though I’m vegetarian) and eat high protein &amp; fibre meals. I exercise and walk minimum 10k steps.\n\nI’d be interested to know your opinion about a vibration plate. It’s been trending recently and I was wondering whether it may indirectly support skin health through lymphatic drainage and blood circulation? 🤔 I’m also a very anxious person and I realise that my skin issues could also be related to stress. Could this help?\n\nIn addition, I’ve had a Dennis Gross LED mask for several years but tbh I haven’t seen that much of a difference. I want to switch to something better/stronger. I’m looking for a panel, rather than a mask. Do you have any recommendations, especially for acne skin?\n\nI also want to buy RingConn to track my sleep, steps and overall health. This is non-negotiable for me, but I’m also wondering whether I should get all 3 or just the ring + LED or vibration plate?\n\nAny advice welcome! Thanks so much!",

My curls are Fressingfield, undefined and look frankly sad. I even have like two patches of hair that just refuse to curl at all and stay frizzy. Maybe I'm using the wrong products or just don't understand my hair? Basically, my routine is that I shampoo twice with whatever is available, usually a olive oil shampoo then a 2 in 1 argan shampoo. Then I use coconut conditioner and detailed which takes a while. I have low porosity hair that just refuses to cooperate. Usually I use that green Aunt Jackie's leave in and brush it through my hair before adding Mark Antony curl cream and using a define brush, sectioning my hair into top and bottom before defining. I also do my bangs and define them while they are over my face. I then use Aunt Jackie's mousse and air dry after scrunching with satin fabric. My hair always turns out stiff, even when I flip it upside down it kinda just flops sorta sadly. It has limited volume near the top and I have to redo it everyday despite wearing a bonnet to bed. Please help out! Also, bonus question, do you guys have any curly hairstyles that obscure your forehead a bit? That's how I like to wear my hair. Thanks!",

Right now I’m using product la that are way too heavy for my hair: I have quite fine 2b/2c hair (&amp; high porosity) and I was thinking about purchasing shampoo and conditioner from the brand Milk Shake. Has anyone with my hair type experience with this brand? It’s important to me that the products are lightweight and at the same time moisturizing. Here are some more facts about my hair:\n\nit gets greasy fast on the roots/ sides of my head.\n\nDry from the middle to the ends and very frizzy all over.\n\nhigh porosity\n\nI wash it every other day/ every two days\n\nmy current routine is( please don’t judge, I know it’s bad hahaha): dry brushing my hair before showering, then washing with q+a curl shampoo (British brand), then conditioning with the q+a curl conditioner (both contain heavy coconut and Shea butter ingredients). I dry my hair in a normal towel and then I style it upside down and scrunch it with my hands with the cantu leave- in conditioner, the Yari Curl activator and the Yari curl maker gel. I blow dry my hair with a diffuser. I do have a bonnet but I often forget to put it in at night. I do not have a refresh routine. I’m open to any haircare recommendations! \n\nps. I just ordered a bunch of lightweight styling products and I’m going to do my routine very different now (brushing in the shower with leave-in detangler etc).\n\n* thank you so much in advance!",

Because of that, I stop using it. After 2–3 weeks, once my skin calms down, I try it again… and the same thing happens.\n\nThese aren’t small bumps. They’re big, painful pimples that take weeks to go away.\n\nI initially thought this might be purging, maybe because of azelaic acid or some other active in it, but I’m confused now because:\n\n\t•\tI’m not using it regularly (only once, then I stop)\n\n\t•\tIt’s been 3 months and the reaction is the same every time\n\n\t•\tThe pimples stop when I don’t use it\n\nMy routine is very simple:\n\n\t•\tChemist at Play face wash\n\n\t•\tSometimes Garnier Neem Face Wash (this actually helps reduce my pimples)\n\n\t•\tIn winter, I occasionally use Nivea cream (the white one) and that does NOT break me out\n\n\t•\tNo other actives, no serums, nothing else new\n\nSo this Foxtail moisturizer is literally the only different factor that causes these breakouts.\n\nAbout my skin:\n\n\t•\tI’m 25\n\n\t•\tOily skin in summers\n\n\t•\tNormal to dry in winters\n\n\t•\tI don’t use moisturizer daily — only when my skin feels dry\n\n\t•\tHonestly, when I just stick to face wash, my skin seems fine, like it has enough oil on its own\n\nMy questions:\n\n\t•\tIs this actually purging, or is my skin just reacting badly to this product?\n\n\t•\tIf I start using it regularly, will my skin “get used to it” and stop breaking out?\n\n\t•\tOr should I just stop using it completely?\n\nBecause right now, this is not fun anymore and the pimples are painful 😭\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone who’s experienced something similar.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

One month? Two months? 6 months older than the expiration date on the package?\n\nI have on occasion bought too many of something and simply didn't get to all of them in time.\n\nFor example, a pristine box of Neutrogena Hydroboost gel I had bought in 2021 and simply didn't see in the bottom of my sink - unopened.\n\nPartially my problem is because the unused product is similar to other regular products that I use daily and really like. I end up ignoring others, which doesn't give me the chance to use them before they expire.",
