I always had some redness and skin texture, but as long as I didn’t have an active breakout I was happy with my skin. I posted on here that I had a very slightly red patch on my cheek that someone mentioned looked just like a dry patch, and someone else gave me great advice on looking into barrier repair and papular rosacea. I a currently on the waitlist for a dermatologist, but while I wait I just need some advice on how I can treat my skin, as it looks like the products I bought to fix this are seeming to cause more sensitivity. \n\nCurrently my routine is as follows:\n\nAM:\n\n\\- Rinse my face with lukewarm-cool water\n\n\\- Purito Wonder Relief Centella Cream Unscented\n\n\\- Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum (This stings when I put it on, but I’m using it up until I figure out what my next sunscreen should be. Ideal would be niacinamide free and mineral based.)\n\nPM:\n\n\\- Garnier Micellar water pink cap (with clean microfibre face cloth, maybe I should switch to cotton pads?)\n\n\\- Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser\n\n\\- I shave my face every 2nd day with Nivea Men Sensitive Skin Shave Gel\n\n\\- Purito Wonder Relief Centella Cream Unscented\n\nI was using the Purito Centella Serum Unscented for a few weeks with this routine but believe it or not it made my skin look worse. I have Zeroid soothing cream in the mail to swap out with the Purito moisturizer, as I read that it is a very simple barrier supporting cream that is a lot of peoples HG. I am also looking for any suggestions on a sunscreen replacement option, right now I’m considering BePlain Sunnuse Mineral Sunscreen as I heard it was a lot of other people’s holy grails. But I haven’t ordered it yet.\n\nIf anyone has any advice for how to deal with this while I wait to see a derm, or what could be causing it/making it worse, any and all input is greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!!!",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening?

On the other nights (and in the morning), I use azelaic acid 15% daily.\n\nI’m thinking of using Sebamed Clear Face Care Gel as my moisturizer, but I’m not sure if it’s suitable to use along with adapalene. Has anyone used this combination? Did it cause any irritation, breakouts, or dryness?\n\nMy concern is mainly whether it’s hydrating enough while using actives like adapalene and azelaic acid.\n\nWould really appreciate your experiences and suggestions. Thank you!",

Though I would still prefer to use it, I needed confirmation if I should still use it or recommend me some moisturizers idk since I would like to keep my skincare routine as minimal as possible, that blue tin being a really fitting and versatile moisturizer for me ",

      "title": "Minimalist Skincare, when do you actually see results?",
      "content": "Hi, 26F here. I have hormonal acne due to pcos, Hirsutism and as a result I always have folliculitis and clogged pores on my face. My cheeks are always red and my skin is always inflamed, PIH, PIE, skin texture. Cystic acne occasionally but mostly there's pus filled whiteheads and pustules always. \n\nI used to use MamaEarth products and they worked for me before, but then I read so many bad things about it, so I stopped using them. And then Minimalist was all over the internet. So I've been using Minimalist products for quite sometime now, maybe 3 years. But I have yet to see results. Then for the past few months I stopped using everything and focused only on CTM routine. I felt my skin could finally breath without the daily hectic skincare routine. \n \nI finally decided that I will stop giving in to the trends and products hyped and suggested by influencers and reviews by random strangers online and consult a dermatologist and focus more on internal healing, lifestyle changes and diet to be specific. But I gave in again because they were offering a free tote bag (I also have the glass bottle and for some reason I really like the idea of collecting merch hehe) and ended up buying stuff again.\n\nWhile scrolling saw that the Oil-free fluid light sunscreen which I was eyeing for a long time because no sunscreen suits me out of all that I tried, was available as freebie. Got this one as a freebie before and I liked it. It was free on Minimalist products along with the tote bag. So I ended up buying all these just to get the free sunscreen because I know it's stupid but I didn't want to spend 500 on a sunscreen again because I end up not using the ones that don't suit me.\n\nAnyways all of my serums were empty and so decided to buy everything one last time. Salicylic acid serum, 5% niacinamide serum, Vitamin C serum, Vitamin b5 Moisturizer - these are the stuff that I bought. I'm also using Tranexamic Acid for my PIH and PIE, and the Vitamin B12 Moisturizer occasionally.\n\nShould I have hope for these to work while I'm finally starting to improve my lifestyle and focusing on internal healing? I used to have a very sedentary and unhealthy lifestyle. So maybe that's why these didn't work before. \n\nTL;DR: Do Minimalist products actually work? Should I continue using them topically while working on my lifestyle to see changes? Have these products worked on someone with hormonal issues like pcos? \n\nAlso is that freebie actually 50ml. You can see in the picture, though it is not bright, the sunscreen is only half of the tube. Is that how it is normally or do they give products like these for free because they're free anyway and we're not paying for it? ",
