      "content": "I don't even want to post a before because I'm so embarrassed by how bad my hair looked in comparison so often so I'm not going to!\n\nI started going grey at 17, I dyed my black hair ONCE out of curiosity and from then on out, pretty much always had it colored, natural and unicorn colors over the years. I also straightened it because 20+ years ago, product for curly hair was awful and flatirons were the only styling tool!! I also want to mention I was treated rather cruelly for my hair, even being called ethnic slurs and having it pulled by strangers, and when I was young, I didn't know how to handle that other than to assimilate.\n\nAt the end of 2023, I just changed my mind. I washed my hair and brushed it and I didn't straighten it. It looked like wet straw from a process not meant for curly hair (hairstylists will do anything for a buck and that's a big part of why I had shit hair for 2 decades), I was sick of hiding my true self, and I just wanted to love my hair for the first time in my life. \n\nIt took until September 2024 for my roots to be long enough to do the big chop. I cried, a lot. A lot of pain fell away with that hair but more came with it. First, the girl I went to did a terrible job, she just hacked the damaged parts out, didn't give me an actual cut, and didn't know how to style it, but it was gone and that's what I wanted. Second, I had to confront my face, which was hard. I felt naked walking around with short hair, I felt ridiculous that I didn't really know how to style it. Third, I felt kind of ashamed I had taken so long to do it.\n\nEventually, I found out a hairdresser friend of mine is a curly hair wizard and she's been doing my hair ever since my second haircut since the chop! She's such an artist, I love going to see her and get my hair perfected. I love how I look. I get so much attention I never got before, which is actually kinda weird but exciting! I feel beautiful and unique and how having good hair makes you feel!! ",

      "title": "Low-key a lip balm addict lol. Reviewing all the lip balms I've tried until now",
      "content": "Early male, 20s. I have two toned lips but nothing really helped with that pigmentation, so I'm not gonna talk about it and I made peace with it. I'll review the spf and non-spf ones separately:\n\n#SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Chaptex spf 15 🟢\n\n- My derm prescribed me this when I had extremely dry and cracked lips (turned out to be cheilitis)\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, no fragrance, doesn't taste bitter, has humectant (D-Panthenol)\n\n- Has only spf 15. I see most people suggesting to use at least spf 30 or higher. I wish they made a spf 30 version\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##2. NMFe spf 40 🟢\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, has slight fragrance (I like it), has humectant (aloe vera extract)\n\n- It tastes bitter, that's the only complaint I have\n\n- Overall: 9.5/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##3. Sebamed spf 30 🔴\n\n- Has slight fragrance (didn't like it), very expensive, wasn't that moisturizing\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##4. Minimalist spf 30 (not in the picture) 🟢\n\n- Super cute packaging (but the lid broke after a few months 🥲), fragrance free, has humectant (Hyaluronic acid)\n\n- it's waxy, not quite easy to spread\n\n- Overall: 8.5/10. Will probably repurchase.\n\n___\n\n___\n\n#Non-SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Vaseline lip therapy Creme Brulee 🔴🟢\n\n- The caption under it says *for deliciously kissable lips* which hurts even more because it reminds me I have no-one to kiss 😭💀\n\n- It smells exactly like the Vaseline lip therapy cocoa butter one, it's very hard to differentiate the smell. Quite moisturizing, love the smell obv\n\n- Little heavy on the pocket (probably because it's imported?)\n\n- Overall: 8/10 (subtracted 1 for the caption). WNRP\n\n___\n\n##2. Vaseline skin protecting jelly (indian version) 🟢\n\n- Almost every Indian household has it lol. It's good, does its job\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##3. Vaseline BLUESEAL pure petroleum jelly (imported) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT! I wish they sold this here in India everywhere instead of the skin protecting jelly\n\n- I bought it from Amazon but I was skeptical initially because of the picture the seller put on Amazon lol.\n\n- It's AMAZING! Seals the moisture very well and I also use it for slugging in the night. It's smoother and more buttery compared to the Indian version we get\n\n- I don't use it on the lips alone, I'll be mentioning my current routine which is helped me the most at the end of the post\n\n- Overall: 11/10. WRP! HG\n\n___\n\n##4. Nipcare 🔴\n\n- Bought it at the expense of weird looks from the pharmacy guy (didn't know it is used by lactating mothers for sore nipples)\n\n- It smells really awful (Lanolin, can't complain), didn't really do much for my lips and it's also not easy to spread it\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##5. Laneige Lip sleeping mask (berry) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT 🐐 helped me so much with my dry lips. Not a big fan of that smell but it doesn't bother me. Leaves a white film on lips and I rub the entire thing off in the morning after waking up and there you go, plumpy soft lips!\n\n- It's probably a little overpriced but it lasts really long so can't complain ig\n\n- Overall: 10/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##6. LRP Cicaplast B5 baume 🔴\n\n- I didn't know you can also use it as a lip balm until I read some of the comments here but it didn't do anything for my lips and they felt even more dry in the morning \n\n- it's good as a barrier repair cream tho, helped me with redness and irritation near nose corners when I increased my tret frequency \n\n- Overall: 0/10 for lips, 8.5/10 for barrier repair\n\n___\n\n##7. Vaseline lip therapy tin (cocoa &amp; original) 🟢\n\n- It was a pain in the a*s to open the packaging but I bought the original one recently and it was super easy to open. Glad they changed its packaging (not sure about the cocoa one tho)\n\n- It's thick, does its job as an occlusive\n\n- Both of them are good. The cocoa one smells heavenly but I personally found the original one to be better.\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##8. Vaseline lip care total moisture (tube) (not in the picture) 🟢🔴\n\n- I love the smell, it's amazing! Very glossy finish and hydrates well. Affordable!\n\n- Hard to apply with that spherical base and I don't like touching it \n\n- Overall: 7/10. WRP\n___\n\n##9. Nova ayurvedic cream 🔴\n\n- My grandma suggested me this one. It's good with the hydration part but the fragrance is veryyy heavy and the lips kinda burn initially after application \n\n- Overall: 3/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##Current routine:\n\nAM: NMFe\n\nPM: Laneige lip sleeping mask + Vaseline BLUESEAL \n\nThis routine helped me so much with dry lips. But not applying lip balm for even 1 day makes my lips dry again. My derm suggested that I use lip balm at least thrice a day and asked me to reapply whenever they felt dry. \n\n___\n\n##HONORARY MENTION: Brillare natural coconut lip balm \n\nWHAT DO I EVEN SAY? Hate is a strong word and I hate this lip balm with a passion. The texture of it is ugly af, it literally sticks to my finger. It smells like shit. I have tried applying it only once and was weirded out with the texture but still wanted to try and apply. This idiot doesn't even spread, it's that thick and sticky. THE WORST LIP BALM I'VE EVER SEEN 🏆",

      "content": "Hi all, I am a 19 year old college student who recently began a combination of the typical doses of oral minoxidil and finasteride.\n\nTo those wondering, I did initially experience adverse side effects, like decreased libido and ED (at 19, crazy right), but they have since gotten much better 😉\n\nMy medication trajectory played out just as you might’ve imagined; I began and experienced an insane shedding. Now, keep in mind that I decided to take action against hair loss early; I probably could have gone another year without even noticing I was balding. However, I decided to be proactive. So I ended up losing a ton of volume in my hair, which stopped after about two months of constant shedding.\n\nSince the shedding stage stopped, I noticed small, ever darkening baby hairs growing at my hairline—I had hope. I felt that I was taking control of something that many cannot. However, I got ahead of myself.\n\nMonths have gone by, and I have noticed a gradual thinning of hair all over the top of my head. This has made it so that my once thick and luscious hair is now the consistency of thin strands of spaghetti. On top of this, it appears that my hairline is continuing to recede. The only affected (noticeable) parts during my initial shedding stage and overall alopecia before beginning the medication cycle was at my temples, or the corners of my hairline. I have since noticed that the mid section of my hairline is gradually going backwards. While there are many nearly invisible baby hairs growing here, I am very discouraged at the moment. The hair regrowth i experienced at my temples is also receding—but not as you might think. Somehow, the initial hair that has already began regrowth remains, but the hair behind it is receding?? I don’t get it. You can see it in the series of photos I’ve attached.\n\nToday marks month 5 of treatment, on the dot. I don’t know how to explain what’s happening because it’s truly been a rollercoaster. I don’t know if this is expected or if the treatment is even working at all. Did I experience a temporary positive from the minoxidil? Is the finasteride not slowing recession at all? I would love some sort of explanation or comparison if anyone here has any words to offer from their own experience or an actual scientific explanation.\n\nIf anyone can offer any words or advice or simply an explanation, that would be much appreciated. I truly thought this was going well and that starting so early would be a plus, but it doesn’t feel like it.\n\nThank you. If you have questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.\n\n5 MONTHS IN 🫡",

The other day I went to a dermatologist and he was pretty rude and prescribed me doxyderma ( some pills for my skin ). Does anyone maybe used them already and can share their experience and would you suggest me to take them or stay on tretinoin longer. I’m really frustrated because nothing seems to help. \n\nMy current routine is the sunscreen very day in the morning and in the evening I cleanse my skin and switch between tretinoin and just moisterizrr every day. I also use moisterizer like 10 min after applying tretinoin.\n\nDown below are some pictures of my skin before and after using tretinoin for 3 months. I also changed my cleanser and moisterizer. Also added pictures of my old and new routine \n\nAppreciate your help a lot.\n",

For context I ‘have/had’ fine shoulder length hair with a few top layers and a blunt cut finish.\n\nI went for a freshen of foils (not bleach) and a cut n blow dry. She thought more layers at the bottom sections of my hair would eliminate it kinking up at the ends as it touched my shoulders.\n\nAs she was blow drying it I was close to tears as I could see how much she’d actually cut off. Obviously the way hairdressers finish our hair is always going to make it look much better than we can do at home.\n\nI was going to a party last night and washed it for the first time since the cut. I dried it and curled it. Because there are so many layers and it’s not blunt anymore I looked like I’d aged about 20 years so I washed it again and dried it straight and cried and cried because I couldn’t do anything with it. The sides are different lengths, it all sticks out even more than it did before, because of the amount of layers. It’s going to take many months if not a year to grown this cut out to get back where I was.\n\nMy question is; do I call the salon and let them know I’m not happy with the cut? Do I even go back there again? What would you do or has this happened to you. I feel like my hair is ruined as it looks really messy. I’m considering getting a hairpiece to give me back some volume but never had to use one so know nothing about them. I’m gutted and being Christmas very soon too, makes it a difficult time to be going out a lot when you feel like I do now. Help! ☹️",

It’s obvious I have frizz even tho my hair is healthy and I treat it gently.\n\nMy post wash routine has always been like (moisturising banana food cream by garnier&gt;&gt;bond strengh serum with heat protection by dove&gt;&gt; parachute oil to seal in) and then I blow dry my hair on the lowest heat because I think it produces less frizz compared letting it air dry. Obviously I also use a good hair mask in the shower that helps me untangle my hair (dove bond strength hair mask)\n\nHowever, lately I’ve been seeing a lot of people talking about mousses/holding gels and searched about them and they might help out with my frizz (I also suspect my frizz is just curls/waves that are undefined)\n\nBut I have no idea whether to choose a mousse or a holding gel or both, nor I have an idea how to inquire it into my already existing routine (and if i should change anything in my routine when I use them)\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",
