      "content": "My routine used to be washing my hair 2x a week with Shea Moisture  Curl and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner, lightly wringing out the water with a microfiber towel until its damp but not dripping, applying Not Your Mother's Curl Talk gel and scrunching before letting it air dry and breaking the hard cast the gel dried into. \n\nThis would get me a mix of ringlets and looser curls, hair kind of going whatever direction it wanted at the shorter parts, and the curls would survive up to 3 days with the gel, sleeping on silk pillowcases. \n\nI liked most of my routine and how it held up between washes, if not how greasy it would look sometimes, and the fact that I know my curls have been tighter in the past, but when I last ran out of my Shampoo and Conditioner, the store was out of stock. I asked an employee with visibly well maintained coily/thick hair for advice and she said Shea Moisture was way too heavy for me with my fine hair - that it contained glycerin and was too heavy for her hair type, so it was definitely the wrong choice for me. She recommended Nexxus Pure and Clean shampoo and conditioner and I'm trying it out now with nothing else changed in my routine, but my curls fall out of their curl pattern within the day. I spend the days between wash days with hair that looks like someone with wavy hair tried to straighten it.\n\nSo clearly this current shampoo and conditioner is not for me, but was she right that the other was too heavy for me and was weighing down my curls?\n\nWhat kind of products and routines do you use for your fine curly hair, and how long do your curls last?",

It's not that I particularly mind that it's different, it's just idk how to properly take care of them in the same way. It doesn't look good at all and idk what to do. I just started my curly journey a couple months ago. I had finally went to a curly salon and she gave a lot of great tips, but when it came to my roots she told me to do the same thing to them as the rest of my hair, but clearly it isn't working out. I've tried using a bounce curl brush, denman brush, and now I finger coil, but still no luck. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I thank you all in advance!\n\n✨️\n\nRoutine:\n•Wash my hair twice a week\n•Wash only top of my hair with Herbal Essence sulfate-free shampoo, condition only bottom of my hair with Herbal Essence sulfate-free conditioner\n•Use Ouidad Coil Infusion Deep Conditioner on whole head once a week\n•Clarify whole head with Olaplex Clarifying Shampoo once a month\n•Put Rizo's Curl Cream on soaking wet hair (whole head including roots)\n•Put Ouidad Advanced Climate Control gel on wet hair (whole head including roots)\n•Finger coil whole head, using fingertips to pull at roots to make them not so kinky (which isn't working)\n•Add a small amount of Kenra No.9 hairspray\n•Diffuse with Babyliss dryer\n•Use small amount of Kenra Luxe Shine Oil to break cast\n•Sleep in silk bonnet and silk pillowcases",

I do get Ouidad curly cuts - last one done on 9/27. \n\nAs far as shampoo/cond I used to use Kevin Murphy Hydrating &amp; then switched to Davines Love curl, which worked for awhile &amp; then started to make my hair feel like straw. At the time I paired it with Davines Curl Building serum, but didn’t think it was creating nice curls. \n\nSwitched to Ouidad Curl Quencher sham/cond when I got my first curly cut, and paired that with the Ouidad Whipped Curls, but felt like that combo was too much moisture &amp; was weighing down my hair. \n\nA few weeks ago I purchased some Curlsmith Full Body Weightless sham + Milk Cond and then tried various combinations of the Hydro-style flex jelly, Weightless air dry cream, and Vital Curl, none of which seemed to do much for me. I get much better definition from the whipped curls than the vital curl gel. In fact, by day 2 on Vital Curl, my hair was totally listless and lost curl. \n\nToday’s routine:\n1. Washed &amp; conditioned with the CS Full Body\n2. Whipped curls (I literally used like a teaspoon or so &amp; mixed in some Vital Curl gel\n3. Combed thru w wide tooth comb (only to disperse product)\n 4. Sprayed some extra water and then plopped as usual with a microfiber cloth. But \n\nAnd my hair just looks greasy &amp; lifeless. \n\nI am at a loss. What is wrong with my hair and what should I change? I believe it’s low porosity (I tend to dryness, but get weighed down easily) but too much protein or something? I don’t know. My curls used to look so much better, but maybe this is just my hair on menopause + a year on GLP-1. \n\nFirst pic is this past July 20, the last 3 are today. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!! ",

I’ve been struggling with this dry, flaky patch on my cheek(photo 1) for months, and even after trying dermatologist-recommended products, it hasn’t gone away completely.\n\nIt feels like no matter what I use — my skin either becomes too dry and tight, or it breaks out with closed comedones and small white bumps. I have been using the Minimalist:5% Aquaporin Booster Face Wash With Hyaluronic Acid and  Dot &amp; Key: Ceramides &amp; Hyaluronic Barrier Repair Moisturizer and aloe vera gel. \n\nCould anyone please suggest:\n•A hydrating serum that won’t clog pores\n•A gentle toner that helps with dryness but doesn’t irritate\n•Even a different moisturizer that’s safe for dry, acne-prone skin (non-comedogenic, soothing)\n\nAny specific product recommendations ( affordable ) would be really helpful.\n\nThank you so much in advance.",

Recently it has gotten even thinner and I am noticing a lot more breakage, split ends, and frizziness. I do not use any heat on my hair nor do I dye it. I get my hair trimmed once every 3-4 months. I most recently got my hair cut 1 month ago and my hair felt like straw at the time because of how damaged it was. It felt a bit healthier after I got it cut, but the split ends, thinness, and dryness/frizziness quickly returned. I feel like I can’t even wear my hair down anymore because it frizzes out so much, and I am unable to define my curls.\n\nI added a picture before my most recent hair cut that shows how thin and damaged the ends of my hair were. One month later it is starting to look like that again :(\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to rescue my hair?? Thank you!",

I'm in my early 30s and have noticed more fine lines recently, especially on my forehead. \n\nI know you must wear sunscreen when using retinol and protect yourself well from the sun. My job is outdoors for about 6 months and I sweat a lot while working outside. I always put sunscreen on at the beginning of the day (and always wear a hat, long sleeves, and pants), but usually can't re-apply sunscreen throughout the day due to how sweaty I get. \n\nSo I am wondering if it would be worth using retinol 6 months on (when my job is indoors and I can reliably wear sunscreen all the time) and 6 months off (when my job is outdoors)? Or would the 6 months off of retinol reverse all the benefits/progress? \n\n\nThanks! ",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
