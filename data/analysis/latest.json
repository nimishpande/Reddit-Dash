      "content": "I'm till kind of in shock, so bear with me. I'm in my early 30s and I literally just found out a little over a month ago that I have curly hair.\nFor context: I've been blow-drying my hair straight twice a day (morning and night) since before junior high. Just brushing it straight down when wet and blow-drying it flat. I rarely flat ironed, but the constant blow-drying was doing the job of keeping my hair straight. I genuinely had NO idea I had any curl pattern.\n\nThe Discovery:\nAbout 5 weeks ago, I decided to do a \"curl test\" just out of curiosity after a conversation with friends, and waves started forming. I was honestly confused. Fast forward to now and I'm apparently 2C/3A? Wild.\n\nMy Current Routine:\n\nBriogeo Curl Charisma shampoo\nDivaCurl conditioner\nBriogeo Don't Despair Repair protein treatment (1x/week in place of conditioner)\nPattern styling cream (quarter size at night, dime size for morning refresh)\nCurlsmith heat protectant when diffusing\nI only brush right before the shower with a mixed bristle brush (per my stylist's recommendation)\nFinger detangle in the shower\nT-shirt/microfiber towel to scrunch out water (no rubbing)\nPrayer hands + finger waving + scrunching with product\nDiffuse upside down: medium heat/low speed, then switch to low heat/low speed when nearly dry\nSleep in silk bonnet on silk pillowcase\nMorning refresh: spritz with water until dampish, small amount of Pattern cream, scrunch\n\nI shampoo and condition every other night, but I get my hair wet every night to refresh.\n\nThe Journey So Far:\nWeek 1-2: Barely any curl definition, looked stringy and weird wet, questioning if this was real\nWeek 3: Had a full crisis. Almost gave up and went back to straight hair. The greasiness, the unevenness, the awkward in-between phase - I was DONE.\nWeek 4: Got my first curly cut from my stylist (who was SO excited). She gave me layers and removed weight without touching my length. Game changer.\nWeek 5 (now): The photos you're seeing are from morning refreshes, not even full wash days. I'm honestly still processing that this is my hair.\nThings I've Learned:\n\nThe \"healing timeline\" people talk about is REAL. My existing heat-damaged hair has legitimately improved in curl definition over these 5 weeks.\nYour hair can look completely different in just a month\nWeek 3 almost broke me, but I'm so glad I pushed through\nThe underlayers of my hair are curlier than the top layers (which apparently means the top was getting more heat damage and needs more time to recover)\nFinding a stylist who understands curly hair is everything\n\nThe first photo is my hair when I still wore it straight (many months ago). The e next pic is early curl from week 1. The oast photos are from the last couple days - just morning refreshes, not full wash days.\nMy family thinks I'm crazy and wants me to go back to straight hair, but my girlfriend and all my curly-haired friends have been incredibly supportive. My stylist literally went buck wild when I walked in with curls for the first time (never told her ahead of time).\nIf you're in week 2 or 3 and thinking about quitting - PLEASE don't. I almost did. And now look.\nHappy to answer any questions!",

SO stoked.\n\nRoutine this time: \n\n1. Wash Ouidad Anti-frizz shampo quick to get most of my products out, then InnerSense scalp detox, BounceCurl gentle clarifying shampoo (been a bit and Ouidad shampoo usually does a good job with getting rid of build-up).\n2. InnerSense Conditioner (although NYM conditioner worked and felt quite similar in post about my recent hotel water fiasco) - detangle brush, then while still in shower: \n3. Rake in: dollop of AG Beach Bomb Cream\n4. Rake in:  *NEW* dollop Briogeo Curl Charisma cream\n5. Rake in: *NEW* dollop Briogeo Curl Charisma gel - detangle brush to distribute everything evenly throughout hair, then scrunch every direction raking hair off scalp, rewettingas needed to get clumps to reform &amp; wet-plop in shower cap - finish shower. Then out of shower, the following...\n6. BounceCurl EdgeLift brush - section top &amp; crown, and leave sides &amp; back dangling and do those first\n7. *NEW* NotYourMother's Beach Babe foam, glaze and scrunch, concentrated on roots area, but also lengths each section \n8. Biosilk Rock Hard gelee, emulsify in wet hands and glaze on quarter-size dollop per section, then scrunch until hands feel \"clean\" of product. I put a little emulsified NYM Flash Freeze gel (5) just on the ends that tend to straighten.\n9. Microplop, enough to dry fairly fast\n10. Diffuse cupping just the ends, just a little to set cast on the ends but not put weird bends, just until cast starts to harden.\n11. Hover diffuse - to 100% dry\n[Ali Noskowiak diffuse routine. ](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cz347PyO6LC/?igsh=MWoweWVuZWw1b2NoYw==) To speed up drying after cast is well set, I use the cone on my roots, upside-down, holding casts with my arm to keep them from blowing around until scalp fully dry, then continue to cup and/or hover till fully dry.\n12. 3 drops Righteous Roots hair oil warmed in palms, gather hair on top of head and gently squeeze to ends. Fluff roots. Scrunch any cast around face by smoothing lengths roots to ends with tips of my fingers carefully. \n\nBedtime: Use coily tie to put my hair at my forehead and silk bonnet to sleep. Just water with a couple pumps (to a full bottle of water) of Ouidad Curl Shaper Memory Maker Revitalizing Milk to refresh this morning. ",

I dont really like my hair to be crunchy so I wouldn't be okay with a heavy hairspray, maybe a light one but im not sure.

My hair knots very easily at the ends, i always do better with short hair. I wash nearly every day and have always had my hair get oily FAST even without activity. \n\nThis is my hair freshly washed but no product. When I blow dry, i blow dry, take a break to brush, blow dry, take break to brush, and so on. I have a hard time doing them at the same time lol. Last time my hair was cut it was layered. \n\nI cannot easily hold styles. Texturizing sprays and mousse do nothing. Teasing my hair never worked, and blowdrying with round brush doesnt do anything different.\n\nI have always hated my hair and been so frustrated styles dont work. I just want to do what is best for my hair so trying to figure out which type it is. TIA!!",

So far I don’t see much visible regrowth yet. I have a receding hairline and thinning crown. I’m planning to add minoxidil and a derma stamp, but I’m confused about the routine. I start work at 8 AM and I’m worried about applying minoxidil in the morning because I don’t want my hair to look greasy at the office. I usually go to the gym in the evening and reach home around 9–9:30 PM. I was thinking of applying minoxidil around 9:30 or 10 PM and then washing my hair at 6 AM before work. Is leaving it on overnight for about 8 hours enough for proper absorption? Also, how should I schedule derma stamping along with minoxidil? Any advice from people with a similar routine would really help.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",
