My skin normally heals really slowly, and I’m in the medium-tan range.\n\nSo far I noticed my breakouts calm down faster and less lingering redness/dark marks. PIH fades a bit quicker than usual, and my skin is weirdly less inflamed before my period (which never happens for me). It’s not doing something for now for clogged pores, but the healing-time change showed up after just a few sessions, kind of like the “retinoid but gentler” vibe, though obviously totally different mechanisms.",

Cleared acne and got glow on skin but skin got dried out. \nRealised that I most likely damaged my skin barrier. What I initially thought was acne, I kept treating aggressively with actives, instead of stepping back. Big mistake.\n\nCurrently, I’ve switched to a simpler routine, but I’m still confused about what to add vs what to remove to actually heal my skin.\n\n✅️ My current products :\n\n1. Face wash :  Salicylic acid facewash (only when acne feels active)\n                           Simple facewash (when skin feels dry/dehydrated)\n2. Toner: TonyMoly Ceramide Toner\n3. Moisturizer: Excela\n4. Sunscreen: Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen\n5. Serum: Alpha Arbutin – Beauty of Joseon\n6. Serum: Niacinamide – The Derma Co\n7. Tretinoin\n8.

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I was convinced I would have to cut my hair down to a bob or shorter. \n\nHowever, luckily I didn’t have to. Thanks to you angels! Your advice on how to comb my hair and multiple product suggestions saved my hair. The many comments saying it was going to take awhile to undo the mess stood true but it helped. Before I posted I felt hopeless because I had already put in a day of slowly combing and working through the knot. I did not understand how long, it would actually take. Everyone who advised me to be patience with the process, THANK YOU! \n\nHowever, the experience did not come without a cost. I had to cut/trim 4-5 inches of length from my hair and lost a TON of original volume I had prior to this disaster. But, I am so grateful with the outcome I did receive, and have learned my lesson. I will never go to bed without wrapping my hair again and no matter how busy I am I will find the time to detangle my hair weekly. I vow to never let something like this happen again. \n\nHere is a picture when my hair freshly detangled. It was a mess no product in it. I will be taking these next months to focus on regrowth to bring it back to how I like it but I am so so so grateful for the hair I still have left on my head!\n\nThank you so much for your advice again. This community is amazing!!!\n\nMy Detangling Routine:\n\nI detangled my hair dry misting with water and warm coconut oil. When I got it wet in the shower it seemed to get worse.\n\nI enlisted the help of my boyfriend to help. We got comfortable on the couch and watched movies while he slowly picked away at with. Starting and mainly using a fine tooth thin comb but also a wide tooth comb to loosen things up when needed.\n\nWe used almost an entire bottle of native conditioner (it’s just what we had on hand).\n\nAlso used coconut oil in a spray bottle which I would warm up by setting in hot water for a bit. Also used Cowboy Magic Horse Detangler &amp; Shine. And also used water in a spray bottle just to dampen hair slightly before adding product. We didn’t really depend on wetting the hair to detangle.\n\nThe process so super slow and also painful! My scalp was red afterwards even though he was very gentle. I took Tylenol throughout the process and it definitely helped but the pain was still  present. Make sure to take lots of breaks throughout the process!",

      "content": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI’m pretty new to skincare and the first product I used was the effaclar line from La Roche Posay and the trinamexic acid from Naturium. Now, I don’t have the driest skin and some areas like my forehead and cheeks don’t get too dry so I assumed I had combination skin. Anyway, I used this line for a little over a month and I was seeing some improvements in my skin complexion and it was smoother and I got less acne (though I don’t get much to begin with).\n\nThen I got the glycolic acid from the Ordinary because I wanted to shave and I’ve heard good things about it as an exfoliating toner. I got the big bottle, for a about a week or two I wasn’t paid on time and I ran out of the toner the time before I got paid and went to go get my normal skin care I used the glycolic acid as a substitute (I normally put my toner with my hands). So when I got everything I needed plus buying the glycolic acid again, I started using them both at the same time, which in hindsight was not the best idea and after searching I found out it was pretty harsh and is not meant to be a daily things (in addition to that, I was using cotton balls to put it on) and as I did that I noticed slight burning so I stopped.\n\nNow I just use the effaclar line and I use my hands to put the toner on (it doesn’t burn when I do this) but when I put my moisturiser on it has that same sensation and I don’t know what it might be. Did I mess up too badly? Do I need to switch products? If I do does anyone have any recommendations for more hydrating products which is safe for sensitive skin? I would really appreciate some advice!",

My hair is somewhat fine in texture but also thick, lot of products just sit on top of hair and don’t absorb, when I try to do in depth curly routines the curls always fall out after a few hours. I got to the point of putting my hair on a ponytail and adding water and leave in conditioner and scrunching it while it was in the ponytail because it would leave my curls defined but I recently cut my hair because it was damaged and now I can’t do that. I’m okay with some frizz but ig seems like it’s always such a weird mix of defined and frizz and I don’t know what to do. My current routine is shampoo and condition 1-2 times a week with aussie miracle moist shampoo, not your mothers daily nutrition conditioner, herbal essence repairing leave in conditioner and I’ve been testing not your mothers curl cream and mousse but they both seem to weigh down my hair. I switched to cheap and simple products a while ago after getting tired of spending so much money on products for them not to work. Any advice is appreciated.",

My routine used to be acne based, mandelic serum in am, benzoyl peroxide pm. Skin looked great. Until it didn't. \n\nFirst.. I overdid sulfur spot treatment when I got a pimple on the side of my lip. It dried out, flaked, and wouldnt heal. Also when the weather went incredibly dry. Flakes spread around the side of my mouth and simply would not go away. \n\nOcclusives made it worse, no moisturizer seemed to help. First derm gave me betamethasone and clotrimazole. It seemed to solve the issue, and then my skin rebounded. Clotrimazole alone didn't do much of anything.\n\nBefore I realized my spot treatment caused this, I also had used it on a pimple on my chin, and forehead last fall. I stopped all actives.\n\nAt that point I had 3 red flaky spots that didn't hurt but won't heal. The one on my forehead grew into a red inflamed circle shape. Worried it was fungal, i tried nizoral. Had a reaction that caused 4 new splotchy red itchy stinging spots on my forehead.\n\nDermatologist #2 gives me desonide, zoryve and fluconazole, shames the first derm for what she prescribed. Zoryve made the Flakes on my chin dry out and sting.. didn't continue. I used desonide on my forehead for 5 days. 2 days later, horrible itching in the same spots. Google claims the inflammation just wasnt gone. Try desonide again for 7 days. 2 days after, horrible itching back.\n\nSide of my lip has healed 4 times or so and recurred. Inner lip corner dries out, corner cracks, then flakes move to my skin but redness and inflammation is gone. Desonide heals, then it happens again weeks later.\n\nSides of my eyes are red and flaking from my skin being destroyed and not able to heal too.\n\nOther things I have tried but not consistently because I'm so overwhelmed and conflicted with what is actually going on: cicaplast gel, azelaic acid (calm Flakes/inflammation), squalane, hypochlorous acid, SOS barrier recovery cream, pretty much the whole face reality line, zinc oxide, siv.\n\nAll of this and I still feel like my biggest mistake is not using more moisture in our dry michigan weather yet everything I'm reading tells me my face won't tolerate anything right now.\n\nHas anyone gone through this and made it out with success? I'm so desperate at this point and have gotten so much conflicting information from derms and estheticians... ",

I feel like I haven't been able to grow my hair past my shoulders for about 10 years. I currently have a lot of breakage at the back of my head and my hair gets super knotty and frizzy. I have included a pic of me younger as like goal hair and then a pic of my hair now.\n\nMy current routine is as follows. I use the loreal everpure sulfate free clarifying shampoo once a week. If I am just trying to wash out gel, I will use the amika the kure strength repair shampoo. I dont wash with shampoo more that 3 times a week. I follow that with loreal elive dream lengths curl conditioner. For hold when pulling my hair up or when wearing it down, I use the wet line extreme extra hold styling gel. I know it needs help and products are not high quality. \n\nI’m prepared for trial and error, just looking for some help on where to start\n\nThank you for any help :)",
