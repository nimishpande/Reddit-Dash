      "content": "Why is my hair straight at the roots and ends? Why is it only curly in the middle?\n\nFull disclosure, I used ChatGPT to blur the background and remove the local logo from my shirt.\n\nMy hair has gotten curlier as I’ve gotten older.  I noticed recently that the ends of my hair are not so curly or wavy. The roots of my hair have always been straighter as shown in the photo. Why is only the middle section curly??\n\nMy normal routine: I wash and condition my hair every other day usually. I rotate products. Today I used Elvive Dream Lengths Split End Sealing shampoo and conditioner. Other days I use OGX tea tree clarifying shampoo and conditioner. I also have a bottle of Mane ‘n Tail Herbal Gro shampoo that I randomly use sometimes. \n\nToday I washed and conditioned my hair this morning with the Elvive Dream Lengths, combed it, and let it air dry. This is my normal routine. I’ve been trying to grow my hair out to a longer length. I haven’t had a haircut in 6 months. \n\nSometimes, I scrunch my Prose curl cream in my hair or put OGX coconut milk hair oil on the ends.\n\nSometimes, about once a week, I blow dry my hair with my Shark blow dryer and use the round brush attachment to straighten it. I recently got the Tymo Curlpro Plus curling tool that I’ve used a few times. Other than those tools, I let my hair be. I’ve never colored my hair.\n\nWhy are the ends not curly?? Is it time for a chop?",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

My hair keeps falling flat and I’m not sure if it’s from my hair’s weight or my products.\n\nMy current styling routine is the Camille rose guava slip leave-in and Umberto Giannini curl whip. I don’t use gel because it weighs down my hair. I’m thinking of changing my products up to the innersense leave in and a different mousse (unsure what one yet). I also brush style the top of my head with the bounce curl volume brush. In the shower I use Rizos curls clarifying shampoo, and I rotate between rizos curls biotin shampoo &amp; conditioner and Camille rose guava slip shampoo &amp; conditioner. I use Curlsmith bond curl rehab salve every 3-4 wash days.\n\nBut i really want volume and I always see people saying layers will give more volume. I’m not that happy with my hair shape anyway so I’m thinking of changing it up. Any ideas/recommendations for haircuts to get or advice would be helpful!",

When I was younger I have used to shower with hot water, but for the past few years I've used cool to Luke warm. I know there's no real solution in solving split ends besides trimming regularly, but what else can I realistically do in trying to fix my split ends that are reaching my roots? \n\nMy aunt jokingly said to just shave it all off but since its reached the root that doesn't seem feasible? I'm trying to fix my hair but it does seem like once you get it there's no turning back... my sister also told me to just leave it and im trying to but when I see or feel a split end that crazy my head spirals...\n\nSeeking for advice or what everyone else does in treating their split ends.

We‘re trying to fix it, but it’s not going well and it’s absolutely miserable to deal with. On really bad days, nothing helps, but I noticed on days when it’s not as bad, my husband’s Head &amp; Shoulders 2-in-1 and Old Spice body wash mask the water smell enough to be almost tolerable. My Garnier shampoo &amp; conditioner + Bath &amp; Body Works body wash doesn't smell strong enough to cover it, and I’m tired of smelling like Old Spice. What women’s bath &amp; body products (ideally available at Walmart/Target) have a VERY STRONG scent?\n\nedit: I’m looking specifically for things that smell very strong while they’re actively in use, since it’s the experience of showering itself that is so gag-inducing. Things that remain strong on my skin for a long period is super helpful, but that isn’t what’s critical.\n\n  \nedit 2: Also open to indie or less-mainstream brands, as I don’t like having to rely on the big box stores, but unfortunately I’m currently in a very rural area where the big box stores are what’s vaguely accessible (still 40+ minute drive one way). I’m looking for an immediate replacement for my current products, but I’d be able to wait for a shipment for something else once I have a stop-gap in place. ",

      "content": "I have pretty curly hair, 3A, always have. Recently I’ve noticed my hair goes almost completely flat once I wake up in the morning, with the exception of some curls at the ends doing a singular curly cue. My hair routine has been the same for about a year straight, unchanging, same exact products. I use about a penny size of conditioner, Shea Moisture coconut and hibiscus curl &amp; shine conditioner w/ silk protein and neem oil. I also use a pretty good holding gel that used to make my hair hold these beautiful, hella strong curls, but now all it does is hold my hair until I go to sleep and wake up to see it flat again. The gel is Herbal Essence curl scrunching gel sculptant lvl 3/strong, which I’ve been using for maybe 3 years now switching between that and my Aveda nutri-plenish curl gelée nutrient-powered hydration shine &amp; definition. Sometimes I’ll do 75% Herbal Essence and 25% Aveda, is it bad to mix two different ones? I also don’t sleep on a satin/silk pillowcase because the new one I got a few years ago has cooling properties, and also don’t use a bonnet. I get out of the shower, run my fingers through my hair to separate coils, scrunch it while looking down, and put about a quarter size of the herbal essence in my palms and scrunch a little more. Then I proceed to blowdry it because for some reason now, if I don’t blow dry then it almost won’t hold a curl ever anymore. I’ve been blow drying for two years now, always on cold setting, low and slow. First pic is me when I’m done styling, and second is the morning after. I’ve never once even died it or even put spray color in it, it’s EXTREMELY healthy and pure. The first pic isn’t even as curly as my hair can get, that’s just the curliest I’ve gotten it to get recently. The second pic is the day after I’ve showered",

Then after that, I put each section in Velcro rollers, sprayed a little, and let it sit for about 2 hours. I took them out, and it's a mess. I'm afraid if I brush it, it will all come out and go flat. I'm not sure what exactly to do. In the videos, they take the rollers out and it's just effortlessly done and gorgeous without looking like they even had to brush it. I was going for the 80s brook sheilds volume look. Looks effortlessly done, but obviously nice, any tips? Am I going wrong somewhere? Would appreciate any tips! ",
