      "content": "Today I saw this Montreal salon charging 45 dollars for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù hair cuts and 85 dollars for curly hair cuts and I‚Äôm outraged! I know people might think it‚Äôs fair because it takes ‚Äúextra knowledge‚Äù but here‚Äôs my thing: we naturally grow curly hair out of our heads. 60% of the world‚Äôs population does. It makes absolutely no sense to center hair care only around straight hair as the norm, with curly hair as the exception. Beauty schools should mandatorily teach their students how to style curly hair, and to not do so is discrimination. Plus, styling curly hair is not even hard!! It doesn‚Äôt take MORE knowledge, it only takes a DIFFERENT set of knowledge than straight hair. I would go as far as to call it racist, given that most people with curly hair are people of color (even though I am not). It‚Äôs not our fault our hair grows like this and we should not be made to pay more because of it. Shame on any salon that practices this. \n\n(Since I have to include my hair routine: I wash with Lola‚Äôs shampoo and conditioner, and style with Arvensis defining cream and salon line‚Äôs gel)",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe‚Ñ¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",
