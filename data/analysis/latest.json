      "content": "Hello, I’ve decided to be a bit vulnerable here. But I thought it would be a good idea to post it anyway, because I want to provide hope for others struggling, either with alopecia or with their curly hair. \n\nIn 2021, I first discovered the alopecia. It started out as a tiny spot, which quickly grew to a large one over time. It got so bad, I was finding hair constantly throughout my home. I finally shaved it off in summer of 2021. In spring of 2022, I started prioritizing my own health, started working out, lost some weight and started taking multivitamins. I didn’t expect it, but my hair, it started growing back! So I let it do its thing. But my previously wavy hair started growing back super curly!\n\nIt was definitely an experience. As it grew back, I ditched my previous habits of heat treating and bleaching, and focused solely on health. No heat treatment, no color of any kind. \n\nNow, my hair is much longer, healthy, and much curlier. It definitely gets less curly the longer it grows, but that is a trade off I’m willing to take. \n\nI still struggle some days, but for the most part I’m very happy with how my hair looks and feels. My curl routine is as follows:\n\nClarify 1-2 times per month with v05 clarifying shampoo. Regular washes 3 times per week with all about curls low lather shampoo, and all about curls conditioner. \n\nI use all about curls gel on the lower half of my hair only, and all about curls mouse through out my whole head. I do this because the mouse is lighter than the gel and I’ve found it doesn’t weigh the roots down nearly as much. \n\nI sleep in a silk hair bonnet to minimize split ends. I’m going to continue growing it out, I think my goal is to eventually have it reach my elbows!\n\nFor anyone struggling with their routine or alopecia, give it time! There’s always hope ❤️",

Rake shea moisture curl smoothie through hair, then use bowl method. Scrunch out as much water as i can with my hands, then scrunch out excess water with towel, scrunch in xtreme pro expert and diffuse upside down, scrunch out crunch with &amp;honey melty repair oil. I do the whole routine once a week.\n\nOn non wash days i use mousse and heat protectant, then diffuse and scrunch with oil.

I'm working on stopping!\n​Tretinoin Use: I use 0.05% Tretinoin as part of my routine.\n​Need for Toner: I absolutely need a toner to feel \"right\" before applying moisturizer. I can't stand the feeling of moisturizer going directly onto my cleansed skin.\n​Current Toner: I'm using the Simple Soothing Facial Toner right now.\n\n\nTL;DR: Combination skin on 0.05% Tretinoin. Oily T-zone/open pores, plus dry, flaky nose tip and chin due to Tret. Need a budget toner to help with oiliness/pores and hydrate the dry spots, while being safe with Tretinoin.",

Over the last year I let my roots grow out and decided to get my hair coloured to get a more natural look as I'm tired of re-doing the roots. The hairdresser I went to suggested to blend the roots and lengths of my hair with a sort of like highlights (she used another word but I forgot now). Anyway, here is a before and after of my hair:\n\n[before](https://preview.redd.it/lg2lre2gu80g1.png?width=442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56ce5a60ea3b1a3b6f0a5c080f43d4cd213e9bc1)\n\n[after](https://preview.redd.it/2glu3zwht80g1.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7e012a6b49a082fc53a258dae5bd5fb2c18d005)\n\nI have quite thin but long hair and wash it about once or twice a week. The ends are quite dry and had several split ends, eeek! I think I have combinational skin and my roots get oily after 2-3 days (not sure if this is normal or too quick).\n\nThe hairdresser suggested the FarmaVita Amethyste Color Mask and looking into the Lidl dupes of Olaplex as they're supposedly quite good. The question is, I know bleached hair is very porous so what products should I use to help avoid or stall the colour from fading? As well as help with the dry ends. I live in Europe so please keep that in mind when suggesting things.",

I have Seb derm on my scalp, it’s not an issue on my face but figured I’d mention it\n\nCurrently I am using:\n\nAM\n- cerave foaming cleanser\n- Vitamin C serum (would love brand recs for when this bottle runs out!)\n- cerave SPF\n\nPM\n\n- cerave foaming cleanser\n- Cerave retinol resurfacing serum (I’m on month 2 of using this, I use it every other night, is that okay? Do I need to use it more? And is this brand okay?)\n- cerave PM moisturizer\n\nMy questions:\n\n• I am told i need to exfoliate. I also have a milia on my cheek I’d like help with LOL, I have the ordinary glycolic acid - would that be good to use? And would once per week (on a night I’m not using retinol) be okay? Do I need more frequent use?\n•\t⁠I really liked using snail mucin toner (the brand I had was farmstay)- it just felt so good, if I wanted to add that toner back into my routine, where/when/how often should I use it?\n•\t⁠I also do red light therapy 5-6 nights per week (omnilux mens) - i quite like using the device. Should I be using anything else? Gua sha? Face roller?\n\nI like having a relatively simple routine but am just hoping for some critiques/ suggestions and answers to the above! Also no idea if I’m using these products in the right order or if I’m supposed to wait before applying moisturizer or add it to wet skin etc LOL- thank you so much for your help!",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

I started in 2023 with a simple 2% salicylic acid cleanser from minimalist for my mild acne, then after a few months I started using 10% niacinamide serum. The cleanser caused mild purging but it works wonders for my acne. I have been using the cleanser once in the morning and once at night and serum only at night time. Recently started using moisturizer too for night time skincare. I have been wanting to add glycolic acid toner to my skincare and was looking for suggestions like-\n\n1. How do I introduce it in my skincare routine ?\n2. How often should I apply it ?\n3. How do I apply it ?\n4. When to stop ?\n\nI havent bought it yet and want to know everything before I regret purchasing it...",

I was wondering if there were any eyelash growth serum that could actually work well. I know that the serums with prostaglandin work best but they also cause irritation in the eyes and a “sunken look” i really don’t want that since i already have really prominent dark circles. I’ve heard serums with peptides might help? But I’m not sure which ones are actually effective. I’d love any recommendations, my main goal is to lengthen my eyelashes, make them look fuller and denser without any serious side effects.  ",

The minoxidil is its own pill. The Dutasteride is generic adovart. It’s a yellow gel cap with liquid on the inside.\n\nIs this different Dutasteride type of pill good or bad compared to the powder?
