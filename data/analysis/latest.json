      "content": "\n\n\nHey everyone,\n\nAfter reading so many transformation stories here, I finally gathered the confidence to share my own. It’s been a full 12 months since my journey began, and honestly, choosing to go ahead with a hair transplant has been one of the best decisions of my life.\n\nI’m a 41-year-old doctor, but for years I looked much older than my actual age. I had a very large forehead, strong frontalis muscle activity, and a badly receding hairline. It affected me more than I’d like to admit. I avoided mirrors, disliked being photographed, and slowly my confidence started fading. I run a small hospital, so looking constantly tired or stressed didn’t help either.\n\nThe Surgery &amp; Choosing the Right Doctor\nI had been thinking about a hair transplant for a long time, but time was always an issue. Traveling to another city felt exhausting, and I was very clear about one thing—I didn’t want a “hair mill” setup where technicians do everything. I wanted a qualified doctor who personally performs the procedure.\n\nThrough one of my colleagues, I came across a doctor in Patna, and from the very first consultation, I felt comfortable. What impressed me most was that he didn’t just talk about the number of grafts—he talked about aesthetics. He carefully studied my face, age, muscle movement, and skin laxity, and explained why my case needed a customized approach.\n\nFirst Sitting &amp; Setbacks\nMy first surgery involved 3,500 grafts. Unfortunately, soon after the procedure, I went through a very stressful personal phase. Because of that, I couldn’t follow the post-op routine properly—diet, supplements, and overall care were not ideal for almost six months. Naturally, this affected the results.\n\nBy the 8th month, the outcome was decent, but deep down I felt something was still missing.\n\nSecond Sitting – A Grateful Moment\nWhen I discussed this with my doctor, he was incredibly understanding. He agreed to a second sitting for refinement—free of charge, except for a minimal OT cost. I wanted a slightly lower hairline and better density, and around 1,800 additional grafts were added to enhance the hairline peak and blend everything naturally. I’m genuinely grateful for his honesty and support.\n\nHairline Design – The Game Changer\nThis is what truly changed everything.\n\nInstead of giving me a straight, artificial-looking hairline, he designed a:\n\nTriangular, age-appropriate hairline\n\nOne that perfectly matches my face shape and muscle movement\n\nNot too low, not too youthful—just natural and balanced\n\nThe Real Journey (No Sugarcoating)\nMonths 1–3: Shedding, anxiety, stress, and poor aftercare\n\nMonths 4–6: Early signs of growth\n\nMonth 7: Good density, but I wanted a lower hairline\n\nMonth 8: Second surgery for refinement (1,800 grafts)\n\nMonth 12: Major transformation\n\nSome areas are still improving, and since it’s only 4 months after the second sitting, I feel I might gain another 20–30% density.\n\nHow I Feel Today\nFor the first time in years, I don’t look constantly stressed or older than my age. I finally see a version of myself that feels right. The confidence this has given me—both personally and professionally—is something I can’t put a price on.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nA hair transplant isn’t just about getting hair back—it’s about getting your confidence back.\n\nIf you’re thinking about it:\n\nChoose a doctor who designs, not just implants\n\nBe patient—it’s a long journey\n\nTrust the process\n\nI’m finally at a place where I truly like how I look, and that feeling is priceless.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or share pictures if anyone wants",

      "title": "[Misc] Effects of retinol on facial hair growth - advice needed",
      "content": "Heya, I’m a trans woman and around early November, I started using retinol (The Ordinary 0.5% retinol in squalane) to help with anti-aging and combat some other skin concerns (discolouration, texture etc). My skin has actually had no negative reaction at all, which is why I’ve decided to increase the frequency.\n\nIn late October, I did two sessions of laser hair removal (can’t do it for long stretches because it’s very expensive for me atm) at a new place, which actually gave me better results than the place I went to before, and after just two sessions, I thought I could now transition (heh) to shaving every three days instead of every other day. I get bad irritation on my neck from shaving, so that would’ve been great. However, since increasing the frequency of retinol in the past two weeks, I’ve noticed an increase of beard growth to the point where it’s actually more visible halfway through day 2 than it has been for the past two years. The only change I’ve made is increase the retinol frequency, so I’m pretty sure that’s the only thing it could be.\n\nI’ve looked online as well and it seems like there is something to it, with some cis women reporting similar things (mildly increased hair growth and even some darkening of that hair).Tretinoin seems to promote hair growth in androgenic alopecia in humans, and there seems to be some evidence in mice that it increases hair growth (I know, mouse evidence doesn’t necessarily apply to humans but still, it’s a hint). Given that retinoids increase cell proliferation, all of that makes sense.\n\nNow, my actual question is: Does anyone have any advice on how to combat this? I can’t afford regular laser appointments and unfortunately, the skin concerns I’m trying to combat with the retinol are present in the areas where there is facial hair growth, so it feels like a catch 22. Increasing the amount of times I shave would be possible but would also cause much more irritation around the neck. Thinking about reducing the frequency of retinol again because the increased hair growth makes me quite dysphoric and makes it more difficult to get gendered consistently by strangers.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

My mom took away the 15 tabs that I had of isotretinoin and told me i don't need them anymore so i should stop as she says my skin has improved now. I believe i should atleast complete those 15 tablets and then visit the new dermat later whenever possible as I've exams coming up in a while. Should I convince my mom to give me those?

I’m overall just trying to get rid of my dry scalp while using products that do justice to my curls. I was using Cantu curl cream and mousse for about 5-6 months, then stopped because I thought it was starting to strip my scalp. Since then I tried Miss Jesse’s Multi-Cultural curl cream, which didn’t work AT ALL. I normally use a t-shirt to let my hair dry and then let it air dry.\n\nI’ve been trying to search for a good leave-in conditioner for about a week or now because I wanna start using products in my hair again, but I don’t want to dry my hair, at the same time I want to make my hair more curly. I would try Shea-Moisture, but their Manuka Honey Shampoo and Conditioner dried out my hair, so I’m weary of trying their leave-in. I’m just confused on where to start or what brands to get. ANY help or advice is helpful!",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

The ends are all orange now, they're not totally fried, but they don't look as healthy as the rest of my hair. I don't have many split ends because I take very good care of my hair now. I've been slowly cutting my hair, but i can't cut it too short it looks too awkward.\n\nI'm looking for a mid term solution. I don't wanna cut it short and get extensions, they thin out my hair. I don't wanna do a big chop, it would destroy my confidence. I don't wanna dye my hair fully. The only solution l've found would be to dye or apply a gloss on the ends only. My hair atm only looks good in low lighting because you can’t see the orange 🤣🥲. \n\nMy current hair routine: \n- wash + deep condition weekly\n- I mostly style using the pink skala, my hair loves that stuff. (Suggestions for healthier products with similar consistency would be appreciated) \n- I do diffuse my hair with heat but only sometimes \n- I sleep with a satin bonnet \n- I never ever wear my hair up anymore to avoid breakage (and it worked 😍) \n",

I tended to use curly marketed products already because other products made my hair puff out or feel greasy. When it’s wet, it arranges itself like pictures I’ve seen of 2c— small bundles that sometimes twist around themselves and sometimes form short S shapes- but usually it air dries looser and with straight portions especially towards the top of my head. \n\n But taking care of that was hard enough without trying to figure out a routine to encourage curls 😂 I got a shoulder length haircut a few months back and my hairdresser commented that my hair texture had definitely changed and had started curling a bit as he cut it. TBH didn’t think much of it until it got chilly in my house and I decided to break out a diffusing attachment my sister got me. \n\nPretty much all the layers below my eyes started forming larger C shapes at the ends as opposed to the long S I usually get. I thought it was cute and thought I’d try changing my routine a little to try and get more definition to the wave I already have and maybe encourage it to curl more if it would like to 😊 \n\nI like the shampoo/conditioner and infusium I currently have— so I’d be aiming for Technique and leave in conditioner/gel(?) recommendations! \n\nAttached pictures are from right after I used a diffuser on my hair :)\n\n\\-Soapbox argan oil shampoo and conditioner (wash roots with shampoo, condition through full length of hair and rinse after 5 minutes)\n\n\\-squish out some water, then spray until wet with Infusium23\n\n\\-sit there toweled up until it’s less drippy, then apply Anika Supernova Moisture and Shine Cream (usually I use the Aussie curl cream)\n\n\\-diffuse hair, plopping 1/6 of my hair right on that diffusing head of a hair dryer\n\nNowadays I sleep with a poly satin pillowcase, loose or in braids depending on my mood :)",

Shampoo twice (Head &amp; Shoulders, then Ors creamy Aloe Shampoo), then conditioner (currently I use SheaMoisture curl conditioner and Aussie deep conditioner in rotation). \n\n2. I apply curl cream (SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie) into really wet hair, think seaweed hair. I brush it through completely. Then I apply Herbal Essences Volumizing Mousse and brush it through completely. It is my favorite hold product.\n\n3. I brush style it in sections and carefully scrunch afterwards.\n\n4. Sometimes I apply a gel cast after brush styling, but this time I didn't do it. If I do, I would mix Aussie Instant Freeze Gel with water in my hands and carefully apply it all over my hair.\n\n5. Diffuse carefully. First 10 mins hover diffusing upside down, then a mix of pixie diffusing and cup diffusing until dry.\n\n6. When my hair is 100% dry, I rub hair oil (Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine) in between my hands and gently scrunch my hair and shake out my roots.\n\nIn order to keep my hair looking like that pretty much throughout the week, I use a silk pillowcase and just carefully flip my hair over from underneath when sleeping. When taking a shower, I put my hair in a ponytail, fix it with a clip and then use a shower cap.",

I apologize if this isn't the right subreddit but I thought it would be helpful since I know curly, thick hair can be hard to manage.\n\nShe has beautiful, long, red hair. It is very thick and curly. Like Merida from the movie Brave. I do not remember off the top of my head what shampoo she uses (I know I should). She uses a lot of oils on her hair and I know she talks a lot about how important it is to moisturize. That is as far as I know for her routine.\n\nDoes anyone with similar hair have any good hair diffuser that I could get her for Christmas? Preferably found on Amazon. I'm willing to spend good money on this for her so I just really care about the quality. After searching on Amazon, I saw that some of them did not get hot enough (she complains about this with her current hair dryer), and some other ones got too hot to the point where it burns hair and melts.\n\nI don't know much about haircare, especially with her hair because she is really careful with what she uses. Would anyone have any recommendations or advice for me? I would greatly appreciate it",

Right now it’s just all one length. my routine is wash and condition with Marc Anthony products, mouse, gel then scrunch and plop, diffuse to dry. \nI’m really unfamiliar with hair styles that can give me more shape and ease of styling.

I let things go on until maybe march 2025, but some time in this period i hear some words of wisdom, \"when it is time to get on the finasteride, do so quickly.\"  (So says a family member who has multiple balding colleagues in a STEM work environment)\n\nPic 3\n\nNot exactly the fairest comparison from a length or hygiene perspective, but this is a freshly shampooed shot from today 12.13 and I am maybe halfway into my first 2 boxes of proscar which I dose at 1/5 every day that I remember, cut down using an electrical wire cutter.  I am 33 now, and my dad was norwood 3 or worse at this age.\n\nI am optimistic because I hear that crown follicles like my back strip of thinning are very sensitive to DHT and therefore ripe for regrowth in a finasteride-enhanced environment.  On the topic of sides, I feel strong physically, especially at 33, and libido has taken a 10% hit, but well, plenty of it where that came from so meh.

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
