      "content": "Hey reddit! Looking for some advice on this crazy curl pattern change. Over the last two years, my curl pattern has gone from the beautiful texture you see on the first slide to the flat, sad pattern in the second, and I’m so lost trying to figure out why. I didn’t change my routine until after the change had occurred, stayed with the same amazing curly hair stylist for years, and didn’t change locations (i.e. water stayed the same). \n\nHere’s the routine I was using 2-3x per week:\n- Oribe hair alchemy shampoo (2 washes) + conditioner\n- Oribe leave-in conditioner\n- Oribe curl gloss\n- Oribe curl mousse\n- Scrunched dry with a microfiber towel, then diffused on low heat. Finished with kerastase oil and oribe anti-humidity spray. \n\nAfter I really started to get frustrated with the change, I tried:\n- Two different heat protectants for over a year, thinking maybe heat damage was the culprit\n- AG Care Renew Clarifying shampoo once per week, thinking buildup may be contributing\n- Innersense True Enlightenment scalp scrub once per month \nThese changes did not make a difference :(\n\nI have consistently used a silk pillowcase and silk bonnet to sleep, both before and after the change. \n\nI fear that, after doing some research, the culprit may be hormonal changes associated with a change in my birth control, or maybe this is just aging-associated change that I can’t control. But, before I jump to talking with my doctor about making major medical changes, does anyone have any other ideas I can try? \n\nTIA for your help and for reading, I miss my curls and really appreciate your help getting them back!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "The first picture is from 2023, the second and third are from a week ago.\n\nFrom ~2022–2024 my skin was at its best. During that time I did very little skincare: mostly rinsed with water, occasionally used Vanicream cleanser, and rarely used moisturizer. My skin was calm, pretty even-toned, and acne was minimal (except some acne marks). Then in the summer of 2024 I started getting acne again, this was right before a vacation so I decided (impulsive decision from watching a youtube video) to buy and use adapalene and benzoyl peroxide without any buildup and start using it almost daily. As you can imagine this triggered a very bad breakout and made my skin barrier very damaged. After the breakout I stopped using any skincare for whatever reason for a good few months. Forward to 2025 I started using tretinoin (my skin barrier still wasnt fully repaired) but my skin couldn't handle this even with slow buildup and enough hydration/moisture, I saw no improvement and my skin kept staying red, irritated and the texture was bad.\nBecause of this my skin gradually became more reactive. Now even lukewarm water or gentle cleansing can cause dryness and stinging, especially after showers.\n\nCurrent symptoms I have are:\nTightness after washing or water exposure\nStinging when applying even gentle products\nDiffuse redness on cheeks and around nose\nMild inflammatory acne (not cystic)\nSlight “orange peel” texture consistent with dehydration\nSkin feels fragile/reactive rather than oily-comedogenic\n\nThis is my current routine I have been using for 2 weeks, I have found some posts on reddit that said if you have oily dehydrated skin you should use a hydrator and moisturizer + gentle cleanser for your skin so this is what I'm using right now:\nCleanser Round lab dokbo 1025 cleanser only in the evenings\nMost mornings: lukewarm water\nHydration / Moisturizers:\niUNIK Beta-Glucan Serum (daily, AM &amp; PM)\nPurito Oat-In Gel Cream (main moisturizer, AM &amp; PM)\nAvène Cicalfate+ (2–3× per week or as needed, targeted to irritated areas)\n\nWhat I’m NOT using right now:\nNo exfoliants (AHA/BHA/PHA)\nNo retinoids\nNo actives\nNo scrubs or masks\n\n\nSo my question is,\nDoes this sound like barrier damage from overdoing skincare?\nIs continuing a very minimal, gentle routine the right approach to calm sensitivity and eventually return to a low-maintenance routine like what worked for me before?\nAny feedback or suggestions (especially cleanser frequency or whether to temporarily stop cleansing entirely) would be appreciated.\nAlso, any products you recommend and should I add or remove anything?",

      "content": "Hi i hardly post on reddit but i desperately need to find a way to deal with the closed comedones I have on my cheeks and other areas. Ive had them since I was 11/12, and im 23F this year(2026). I live in a tropical area but with clean water and have done most things to ensure I dont have them anymore. Theyre mostly not whiteheads nor blackheads. But theyre very numerous clogged pores whereby if I squeeze them, lots of gunk comes out almost in a spiral BUT theyre not pimples unless I squeeze them out wrong and they get inflammed. The issue is that there r so many that I cant squeeze all of them, and some are on parts of my cheeks that I cant see or squeeze without either scarring myself or causing it to become a pimple. Im on differin gel, and that has purged and helped my skin a bit, but i still have a lot of these closed comedones and Im not sure what I can do about them. Im hoping for advice on what products to use etc. Ive gone for facials before where theyve removed the gunk once a month, but i cant afford $700 facials every 3 months. Currently I have a cleanser, salicylic acid toner pads from cosrx, SkinLab serum, and moisturiser. I won’t be continuing the serum soon because it’s not affordable for me. But I really want to get rid of these bumps. It really really bothers me every day.\n\nTLDR: numerous closed comedones/clogged pores. I dont know how to get rid of them and I need suggestions or help. Ive used differin but it only helps to a certain extent. ",

Lately, my skin hasn’t been great, and it seems to come and go no matter what I do.\n\nA little about me: I’m 25, mostly vegan, and I drink around 3 liters of water per day. My diet is about 75% healthy, but I do still have processed sugar and fast food sometimes. I only wear makeup on the upper part of my face and try to leave my chin alone—though I struggle with skin picking, which doesn’t help.\n\nAbout a year ago, I went to a cosmetician who said my skin barrier was really damaged and needs to be rebuilt slowly. She recommended niacinamide and azelaic acid. I’ve been hesitant to use these because I read that it could be perioral dermatitis, and I haven’t seen a doctor yet because of anxiety and embarrassment.\n\nSince then, I’ve basically stopped using all products except for a low-percentage zinc cream (Balea). I’m wondering if there’s anything else I can do to help my skin heal, and I’d love any product recommendations that are available in Germany.\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice, routines, or personal experiences you could share—especially if you’ve dealt with sensitive, barrier-damaged skin or perioral dermatitis.\n",

The third photo is dried and unstyled, but not yet brushed.\n\nI (f24) have very curly hair. For the whole of my whole childhood, I assumed it was just frizzy and damaged. For the majority of my adult life, I've either straightened it or tied it back to ignore the frizz, but this coming year, I really want to embrace my curly hair.\n\nThe few times I have tried curly hair routines, I've struggled with the texture of mousse and gel on my hair, as I absolutely detest it! One of the main reasons I enjoyed straightening my hair was the soft feeling it gave my hair, so please keep this in mind when recommending products &lt;3\n\nI currently use Being Bye Bye Frizz Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner, as well as Herbal Essences Bio Renew Smoothening Leave-In Cream. For the in-between steps, I am absolutely clueless!\n\nI know you're not meant to dry brush, but does this mean I should wet my hair daily to be able to brush it and detangle it? Working in a bit of a labour-intensive job, my hair is going between tied up in a crappy bun and tied back at the base of my neck several times a day to keep it out of my face.\n\nAny tips and tricks would be appreciated, if products could be from Woolworths/Coles/other Australian stores that sell beauty/pharmacy products and not break the bank, that would be amazing as well.\n\nThank you all so much!

I've been experimenting more lately and realised that affordable, no-frills products sometimes do the job just fine. Just like, ive seen alot of people call Pond's super light gel a dupe for Neutrogena's Hydro Boost, and it honestly made me wonder how much do we have to spend for hydration. \n\nAt the same time, not everything marketed for dry skin helps long term. Some products feel nice for an hour and then the tightness comes right back. super annoying. \n\nSo can y'all recommend what works for your dry skin without it being crazy expensive? Creams, gels, barrier repair stuff im open to all atp. \n\nWould love to hear whats actually made a difference, especially from fellow dry skin folks.",

My skin is very dry around the nose and a little bit oily elsewhere(not much though). I currently swap between panoxyl cleanser and this foaming cleanser(like flip flopping each night) but I always apply toner and then my moisturizer. I also wear sunscreen each day and make sure to wash my hands when applying all my skincare. I typically do this routine at night then apply the sunscreen in the morning but sometimes I am lazy and do it in the morning. I also do wear makeup sometimes so that may contribute. Also have been suffering from chest acne :( and thought that panoxyl would help but so far it hasn’t done anything. Here are some photos for reference.",

I have only been using a gentle cleanser and moisturizer for two months now. My derm had initially diagnosed me with cystic acne and Rosacea. I had first been prescribed in March 2025 clind+benzoyl peroxide cream for a couple pimples around my face, but the bp burned my skin. Then many months later, I had tried ivermectin, which made my skin a lot worse after 8 weeks. I stopped and started the gentle routine, but it just kept getting worse. \n\nMy derm says it could also be hormonal. I also suspect I have perioral dermatitis, but the sheer amount of deep cystic pimples I have gotten in the past month is insane. I also have many CC's, and these white heads that are very liquidy, but sometimes pop on their own, and are also very deep. I'm starting topical clindamyacin in two days, hopefully that will help.\n\nI'm at a loss. I'm petrified Accutane won't work and that the redness and PIE won't go away. I feel so awful and don't know what to do anymore. I already cannot use so many products due to the rosacea, and avoid anything that isn't fungal acne safe. My skin seems oily but dehydrated. Is there a way to come back from this? Damaged barrier? \n\n",

Because of that, I stop using it. After 2–3 weeks, once my skin calms down, I try it again… and the same thing happens.\n\nThese aren’t small bumps. They’re big, painful pimples that take weeks to go away.\n\nI initially thought this might be purging, maybe because of azelaic acid or some other active in it, but I’m confused now because:\n\n\t•\tI’m not using it regularly (only once, then I stop)\n\n\t•\tIt’s been 3 months and the reaction is the same every time\n\n\t•\tThe pimples stop when I don’t use it\n\nMy routine is very simple:\n\n\t•\tChemist at Play face wash\n\n\t•\tSometimes Garnier Neem Face Wash (this actually helps reduce my pimples)\n\n\t•\tIn winter, I occasionally use Nivea cream (the white one) and that does NOT break me out\n\n\t•\tNo other actives, no serums, nothing else new\n\nSo this Foxtail moisturizer is literally the only different factor that causes these breakouts.\n\nAbout my skin:\n\n\t•\tI’m 25\n\n\t•\tOily skin in summers\n\n\t•\tNormal to dry in winters\n\n\t•\tI don’t use moisturizer daily — only when my skin feels dry\n\n\t•\tHonestly, when I just stick to face wash, my skin seems fine, like it has enough oil on its own\n\nMy questions:\n\n\t•\tIs this actually purging, or is my skin just reacting badly to this product?\n\n\t•\tIf I start using it regularly, will my skin “get used to it” and stop breaking out?\n\n\t•\tOr should I just stop using it completely?\n\nBecause right now, this is not fun anymore and the pimples are painful 😭\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone who’s experienced something similar.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

My curls are Fressingfield, undefined and look frankly sad. I even have like two patches of hair that just refuse to curl at all and stay frizzy. Maybe I'm using the wrong products or just don't understand my hair? Basically, my routine is that I shampoo twice with whatever is available, usually a olive oil shampoo then a 2 in 1 argan shampoo. Then I use coconut conditioner and detailed which takes a while. I have low porosity hair that just refuses to cooperate. Usually I use that green Aunt Jackie's leave in and brush it through my hair before adding Mark Antony curl cream and using a define brush, sectioning my hair into top and bottom before defining. I also do my bangs and define them while they are over my face. I then use Aunt Jackie's mousse and air dry after scrunching with satin fabric. My hair always turns out stiff, even when I flip it upside down it kinda just flops sorta sadly. It has limited volume near the top and I have to redo it everyday despite wearing a bonnet to bed. Please help out! Also, bonus question, do you guys have any curly hairstyles that obscure your forehead a bit? That's how I like to wear my hair. Thanks!",
