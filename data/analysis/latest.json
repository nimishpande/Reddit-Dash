Afterward (yes, I know 😅) I watched a Mel tutorial and ended up doing pretty much exactly what she did.\n\nRoutine: I washed my hair three days ago with Elvive dream length shampoo and conditioner, used taft heat protection, scrunched in moroccanoil mousse and taft gel, then diffused. Today I refreshed by wetting my hair and using heat protection, mousse and gel and diffusing. I sleep with a bonnet at night but I also ordered a silk scarf because I’m really not pleased with the bonnet head I have to deal with in the morning ",

      "title": "Updated curly hair routine, in the hopes it will help someone! Can be found under the photo",
      "content": "Hello hello! If you're here then I'm assuming you've come to look for my hair routine and what I do to get results like these, and you've come to the right place!! It's taken me over a year to figure out how to look after my hair because I'm the only one in my family with curly hair, but thanks to my lovely friends and tiktok of course, I've been able to get better at doing it! I've got a long way to go to find what works for me but here is my latest curl routine.\n\n1. I start by wetting my hair in the shower. Then I detangle. I only ever do it when it's wet and as soon as I'm able to run a brush through my hair without it catching, that's when I know I'm good! \n\n2. I then double shampoo, the first time being to get rid of any gunk or whatever on my hair, the second time to actually clean my hair properly. The first time, I use head and shoulders because that's what my dad buys and it cleans my scalp nicely, and the second time, I go in with a hydrating shampoo. Currently I'm using the one by Phyto. \n\n3. I go in with some Sukin Hydrating Conditioner.Thiw is an Australian brand so you may not have it where you are, but I find this works for me really well. If not though any old hydrating conditioner will do. \n\n4. Depending on how dry my hair feels, I sometimes go in with a bit of a hair mask by Tsubaki. I'm not really sure which one or where to get that because it was a random one my mum didn't want and have me but as with all my other products and things I use, any old hair mask will do! \n\n5. Sometimes I like to use a Denman brush to brush style in the shower. I do this and then make sure I don't disturb the curl clumps before I get out of the shower. Recently though I've taken to using a dupe of the Bounce curl brush that I found at City Beach for $10. If you decide to use that, it can be done in or out the shower, but if out the shower, it should be done after resetting and applying leave in and curl cream. \n\n6. After getting out of the shower, I use a bit of Garnier Aloe Vera leave in conditioner. I don't like to use too much because I don't like when my hair feels product heavy but feel free to experiment with how much you need! \n\n7. Then, curl cream. I like the one by Hask. I only ever use the teeniest tiniest amount to again prevent my hair being product heavy, we're talking a literal smudge for each section of hair. I don't always section but if I do, then it's into top and bottom and left and right. if not though I just use a slightly bigger smudge of curl cream and add it into my hair \n\n8. I plop my hair in a t shirt until it's 50% dry. I don't own a diffuser and don't intend to get one because I don't like the idea of heat damage, but I do fine without one anyway! Plopping helps my hair hold its shape a bit before I add gel to set it \n\n9. After plopping, I go in with gel. I use a decent amount on each side because of course I've taken my hair out of its sections and it's just left and right, and I'd describe it as how much you'd put if the gel were moisturiser for your face if that makes sense? And I never rake it through. I use praying hands and then scrunch my hair to really get it in there. Lately I've been using the one by Umberto Giannini but I also love the one by Cake! It smells absolutely delicious \n\n10. I leave my hair to air dry and then I'm done! I try to avoid touching it as much as possible. Then once it's dry I scrunch out the gel cast with my hands and separate any huge curl clumps. And that's all! I typically wash my hair every four days because I can't stand leaving it any longer but it lasts me well provided I take the time to do a good job\n\nI hope this helps someone here!! Any questions feel free to ask me!! ",

      "content": "Hi everybody,\n\n\n\nI don't know if I'm in the appropriate sub. I tried to find info about this topic but I found very old posts, so I though I could ask it again.\n\n\n\nAs the title says, I'm 27F from Spain and I'm starting to notice my elevens getting worse as time goes by. Right now they're not very visible because I've applied moisturizer, but when my skin is drier or when I use my forehead muscles (so most of the time), they become more visible. It's like my skin is not flexible at all.\n\n\n\nTbh, I feel like I use those eyebrow muscles unconsciously. I wish I could avoid this. I'm not really troubled or stressed, but I tend to do it when I concentrate on a task (which, to be fair, I think is most of the time lol).\n\n\n\nI wanted to ask you for advice. What has helped you personally to reduce your elevens? **Not just skincare**: did you find a way to stop frowning unconsciously? do you eat some vitamins/food that helps you with that? Btw, I would like to avoid botox / invasive procedures as much as possible, as I'm not an expert in that and I would be scared of the consequences (tbh, I don't really like the results in most cases, but this may be due to prejudices...).\n\n\n\nThis is my current skincare routine FYI. Very minimalist in order to be constant.\n\n**\\[Morning\\]**\n\n* No cleanser lately as my skin feels dry. Also because of the cold temperatures lmao.\n* **Super C Serum** Niche Beauty Lab.\n* (When I don't use Vitamin C serum, I use **Niacinamide Glow Cream** by Niche Beauty Lab.)\n* **Moisturizer** SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella.\n* **Sunscreen** SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella. I work from home, so I only use it when I go out.\n\n**\\[Night\\]**\n\n* **Cleanser** Effaclar La Roche-Posay. I'm thinking it may be to strong for my skin, as my skin feels dry after using it.\n* **Clinical Vitamin A** Niche Beauty Lab. This has 0,3% Retinol and 0,1% Retinal, apparently.\n\n  \nThanks to all in advance!!!",

Cleansing: Previously Based Bodyworks shampoo and Bouclème Hydrating Shampoo/Conditioner (full scalp/length application).\n\n2.  Other products: Bouclème styling gel/cream (applied to soaking wet hair via praying hands + \n\nscrunch).\n\n3.  Drying: Air-dried only (no diffusing/heat).\n\n4.  Other notes: Trying a modified Curly Girl approach but struggling with oiliness, buildup, and curl consistency. No consistent bonnet/silk pillowcase use.\n\nHas anyone found evidence-based or well-tolerated natural-ish products/routines for curly hair that provide good moisture without heaviness, maintain strong curl pattern, minimize buildup, and have neutral/mild scents? Please share what worked for you (products, brands, application tips). Thank you!",

      "title": "[DIY] I Fell Down the Fermented Rice Water Rabbit Hole (And Now I'm Questioning Everything)",
      "content": "So three weeks ago, I stumbled across this post from a woman who swore by fermented rice water for shrinking her pores. Like, genuinely swore by it. The kind of enthusiasm that makes you stop scrolling and actually pay attention. I'm 23, male, and I've been dealing with visible pores and some lingering hyperpigmentation from a previous breakout, so I figured why not? What's the worst that could happen? That question is now keeping me up at night.\n\nI did what any rational person would do: I went full research mode. A couple hours of reading about how rice water fermentation has been used for centuries across Asia, how the process supposedly increases bioavailability of beneficial compounds, how it's been a beauty staple passed down through generations. The science seemed sound enough. The anecdotal evidence was overwhelming. I was sold.\n\nHere's the thing though. I study biotechnology, so I know enough to be paranoid about contamination. I wasn't about to follow some recipe blindly and end up culturing something nasty on my face. So I developed what I'd call an obsessively sterile protocol.\n\nMy process goes like this: one cup of rice, one cup of water. First rinse gets discarded to remove any surface impurities. Second wash is where the magic happens. I rub and massage the rice between my hands for a good while, really working it to release as much as possible. Hands freshly disinfected with alcohol, nails trimmed short. The rice water sits with the grains for about an hour to extract the good stuff, then I transfer only the liquid to a glass bowl and let it ferment in a dark spot at stable room temperature for exactly 24 hours. After that, it goes into a spray bottle that's been thoroughly cleaned with soap and disinfected with 70% alcohol. Then straight to the fridge.\n\nEvery utensil gets the same treatment. Soap first, then 70% alcohol spray, let it evaporate completely. I'm trying to minimize external contamination while letting the rice's native microorganisms do their thing. The whole batch gets used within a week, then I start fresh. New batch, newly sanitized bottle, the whole routine. I read that making it with genuine koji spores can extend shelf life to two weeks, but I don't have access to those, so I play it safe.\n\nCost wise? It's almost laughable how cheap this is. In Mexico, 250 grams of rice runs me maybe 30 to 40 cents USD. The value proposition is honestly insane.\n\nNow here's where it gets interesting. For two weeks, this stuff has been really good for my skin. My pores look noticeably smaller. My skin feels calmer, especially helpful since I use tretinoin. That stubborn hyperpigmentation seems to be fading. The smell after 24 hours of fermentation is distinctive but not at all unpleasant. If it ever smelled bad, I'd toss it immediately, but that's never happened.\n\nSo naturally, feeling good about my discovery, I decided to dig deeper into Reddit to see what others were experiencing. And that's when I found the other side of the story. People breaking out. Posts about fungal acne. Warnings about contamination. Someone who fermented theirs for a full week and said it smelled like actual shit (which, yeah, that tracks). The contrast is stark. On one hand, centuries of traditional use and my own positive experience. On the other, people claiming it wrecked their skin.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what's different. The woman in the original post ferments hers for a week and doesn't mind the strong smell. I stop at 24 hours specifically to avoid that. She doesn't refrigerate. I do. Maybe that's the difference? Maybe the fermentation sweet spot is narrower than people think? Or maybe some skin types just don't play well with this, regardless of how it's prepared?\n\nI want to believe the sterile technique matters. That my biotech background is actually helping me do this safely. But I also know that even with perfect aseptic practices, fermentation is inherently unpredictable when you're working with wild cultures. Every batch could be slightly different. Every person's skin microbiome is different.\n\nSo here I am, genuinely conflicted. Part of me wants to keep going, the other part thinks maybe I should quit. What do you all think? Should I keep riding this wave or jump ship before something goes wrong? Has anyone else had success with shorter fermentation times? Or am I just playing Russian roulette with my face and getting lucky?\n\nI'd genuinely love to hear from people who've tried this, whether it worked or bombed. Because right now I'm stuck between traditional wisdom and modern horror stories, and I honestly don't know which side to trust.",

I wash my hair every 2-3 days because it gets really greasy. My hair looks terrible if I blow dry it and I need to straighten it. But it also looks terrible if I just let it air dry\n\nMy current routine is this: \n\nI use regular shampoo, purple shampoo and then I use k18 (have been using it for 5 washes already) after the 4 minutes I use a hair mask and then I wash everything off. \n\nI let my hair air dry and when I’m in a hurry I just air dry it on the cool setting (sometimes warm, but I don’t use hot) \n\nI use my straightener on one of the lowest settings and also apply heat protectant. After that I apply oil mainly on my ends.\n\nI also sleep with a satin bonnet on\n\nI’ve seen improvements but I want make it look better.\n\nFirst picture it’s after I’ve straightened it but I went outside at night and I guess the air humidity (idk) messed it up because it didn’t look like that at first. \n\nSecond picture is how it looks when I leave it to air dry.\n\nAny suggestions on products I should use?
