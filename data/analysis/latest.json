I found this routine on tiktok, usually they don't go well but this one made me feel so great about my hair. I did use a hair mask on this specific day, it was Camille Rose cocoa and mango butter mask.\n\nI then sectioned my hair into 3 sections, went through the first section with a small amount of curl cream, then with the bounce Curl brush, I applied mousse after and then gel (still in that first section) after I did that , I proceeded to dry that section.\n\nAfter the first section I rinsed and repeated the above for the next section, and then once again repeated for the last top section. I found it cut down on drying time because the sections were smaller. Maybe each section took no more than 5 minutes to dry. Also easier on the neck and able to achieve volume easier. It sounds like a lot but I promise it was easier than plopping you head over for an eternity.\n\nThis will be my permanent routine as long as it continues to do me right. I am pretty excited. \n\nI wash my hair twice a week only. Rest of the time I just let her do her thing. If it looks too bad then I will put her up, but I find",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

(correct me if i’m wrong)\n* hormonal acne? (pretty confident about this, correct me here too)\n* pore clogging/black heads on nose\n* spot cystic acne\nthe cystic pimples aren’t constant but mostly appear on my forehead, chin, and sometimes cheeks when they do occur. some are painful and skin colored, some are painful and beating red, both rarely ever being able to pop\n\nand i will say though, i never break out this bad on a regular. my period is supposed to start anytime now, but i guess it’s good to ask  now so that you can see its “full potential.” i feel i break out the most around ovulation and my period, so a good amount of the months time. every month is a new month, so where and what the breakouts will be are a mystery. my cheeks rarely ever break out, my T-zone is what gets everything the most\n\nmy current routine (once a day, at night):\n* vani cream facial cleanser\n* vani cream daily facial moisturizer\n\ni’ve heard the moisturizer actually contains pore clogging ingredients, and i believe the cleanser may be too gentle for me. the moisturizer can also burn on open, scarring pimples for me too. i started using jojoba oil as an oil cleaner a few days ago since i heard it can work as that, and i already had it on hand, but can stop if it’s not actually helpful. i’ve never used an oil cleanser before, but heard it’s good for closed comedones and future pore clogging\n\nwhat tiktok/chatGPT suggests:\n* differin adapalene gel 0.1% acne treatment for my hormonal pimple/cystic acne spotting\n* cerave acne control face cleanser with 2% salicylic acid\n* cerave PM lotion\nall 3 products were said to be acne safe and would help with all my skin needs\n\nclearly, i’m wanting advice from real people that can actually see my skin and go from there. the products i currently use, and what was recommended are all included with my skin’s photos below. let me know your thoughts, and ask questions if needed! thank you all",

      "content": "Hey all, \n\nSearched around this subreddit and online and couldn't find any good examples of this happening with oral minoxidil, but has anybody else gotten facial Pili Multigemini (compound hair growth) from oral minoxidil? I have relatively thick facial hair, and started oral minoxidil roughly a year ago at 2.5mg, once a day.  I haven't noticed these elsewhere on my body, just on my face. \n\n\n\nI used to get these compound hairs once every couple of months, but now I've been finding them after shaving 1-3x per week. They almost always end up becoming ingrown hairs/turning into zits if I don't pluck them, and I've been shaving with a Norelco OneBlade which generally doesn't leave any ingrown hairs/irritate my skin at all. I wash my face with a silicone scrubber in the shower (helps exfoliation), apply moisturizer 1x per day. At night I wash my face and apply 0.5% tretinoin cream 2-3x weekly. I've had this skincare routine for years, so nothing's really changed on that front. \n\n\n\nThese aren't particularly bad or anything, but I'm wondering if anybody has any advice on how to deal with them, or if they've also experienced dealing with these. Overall oral minox has been pretty good for me, I tried finasteride a few years ago, had some bad side effects, but aside from extra body hair/ear hair and these, no negative side effects on minoxidil. \n\n\n\n(Photo taken from elsewhere on Reddit, I never seem to remember to take a photo of these whenever I pull them).

      "content": "This is a cautionary tale.\n\n  \nI have skin of steel. I never react to anything, ever. Salicylic acid, physical exfoliants, vitamin C, retinoids, going straight to bed with seven layers of sunscreen and bug spray on my face because I'm too lazy to wash my face: nothing.\n\n  \nRegular routine: salicylic cleanser rubbed into face with a washcloth followed with face lotion with added SPF in the morning. Salicylic cleanser alternating with vitamin c exfoliant followed by a hydrating gel in the evening, except one night a week where I do salicylic cleanser followed by retinol cream and hydrating gel.\n\n  \nI recently decided to simplify my routine and swap the salicylic and vitamin c cleansers with a single, all purpose gentle cleanser. I've also been trying to save money and wanted a product that I could pick up any any old drugstore so I wouldn't have to deal with shipping or stock-outs with buying specialty products online. Did some googling, found a gentle cleanser within the brand I've been using with reviews talking about how gentle it is and how it's perfect for people with sensitive skin and did I mention it is really gentle?\n\n  \nEnter Niacinamide.\n\n  \nAccording to Google and Tik Tok and seemingly every beauty article under the sun, this spiteful little devil of an ingredient is anti-inflammatory, strengthens your skin barrier, improves your skin's appearance, and all the while it is super gentle and perfect for people who have sensitive skin or skin conditions. I do not have sensitive skin, I have never spot tested new products, and I definitely wasn't going to do so for a product that was marketed for sensitive skin. That would be silly.\n\n  \nI used the new cleanser four times. First skin was itchy, then itchier, then hot, then feeling and looking like an angry sunburn by the fourth time. Did a quick comparison of the ingredients with every other product I've ever used in my life (many) and lo and behold this is the first time niacinamide has ever touched my face. An itchy arm after a belated spot test confirmed my suspicions. It's been five days, my face is still painfully burnt and in a cruel twist is now reacting to everything, including plain water.\n\n  \nCurrent routine: morning and night, splash cool water on face, slather on the Vaseline until I shine like a diamond and feel like a greased pig, wallow in self-pity.\n\n  \nMoral of the story: ALWAYS SPOT TEST NEW PRODUCTS, no matter how impervious your skin might appear to be. And listen to your skin when it's telling you it's upset.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I am determined not to cut it, and I’ve successfully reduced it in size a small bit over the course of about 2 weeks with an hour of brushing at night, but I think we might have reached the end of what’s possible. It’s now rock solid, and I mean like rock solid. We can’t even penetrate it with water after soaking it in the tub our shower. It remains dry because it’s that dense. My husband says just cut it, but I am holding out hope.\n\nHas anyone ever been able to get out a rock hard mat before? I’ve gotten out smaller ones, like the size and thickness of a penny before, so in theory, this should also be able to come out eventually, but lord it seems so daunting. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nWe have tried:\n\nBaby oil  \nDetangler  \n3 different conditioners  \nHair honey  \n4 different brushes including a boar bristle  \nA hair pick  \nA literal fork \n\nAm I out of luck, should I just cut it? I feel like we have tried EVERYTHING. When it gets wet, it has a lot of movement, but it also locks and gets even harder. Any help is very, very appreciated! ❤️",

For context, I've been buying from Myntra for many years and even part of their Insiders program.\n\n  \nMy pre-paid order from Myntra was supposed to be delivered 2 weeks ago. They initially sent me a wrong product. To my surprise, their app had no option to return it so I had to fight with the customer executive to raise an exchange request (which is already hard to reach because of their dumb chatbot).\n\n\n\nThey sent me the same wrong product again a week later. Now they're saying the product doesn't have a return policy so they can't process any refund, nor are they responding to any requests for a return.\n\n  \nI ultimately had no choice but to complaint to Consumer Helpline but the Myntra team immediately lied there as well and closed the ticket saying they already did the exchange. What's the point of an exchange if you're just going to send something useless again?\n\n  \nI understand this could be a scam from the seller itself that keeps sending users the wrong product but I'm extremely disappointed at how Myntra chooses to handle such requests and further refuse to refund any money or take back the wrong product I haven't even opened.\n\n  \nPlease be cautious when spending big amounts on Myntra. I'm glad it was approx Rs. 500 order I can forget as a reminder to never use Myntra again but if it was a big amount I'd have been mentally exhausted with how useless their customer support is.",

      "content": "Ok guys, just shoot me straight. I'm 4.5 months into treatment and just trying to get an objective progress check. Pic 1 is mid July, pic 2 is this morning. I'm almost 51, started thinning slowly when I was about 23. Back in mid July I started on LockLab 5mg min, 1.1mg fin and 1mg biotin. That was about 4.5 months ago. Also using Nioxin shampoo (ketoconazole 1%), and 2 months ago started on weekly microneedling (0.75mm) with topical NANoxidil 5% (daily)​. Also using copper peptides daily.\n\nI told myself I would give it a full year (thats still the plan) and if I didnt see meaningful progress by then, I'd throw in the towel. So I'm just looking for honest feedback at the 4.5 month mark. Both pictures taken at same time of day from the same place and as close to same camera angle and lighting I could get. I'm a realist and not expecting massive results or any miracles, especially at this point. It SEEMS like I'm making SOME progress, but not sure if my eyes and mind are just playing tricks on me? Thanks for the input.",
