Recently switched to L’Oréal Ever Pure bond repair shampoo and conditioner. \n\n2. For styling I spray Aussie leave in conditioner then using detangling brush, next spray Not Your Mother’s- All eyes on me hair perfector and brush through. Next apply Kaleidoscope curl cream sorta using like praying hands to apply. Lastly use the bounce curl define brush and spray with Not Your Mother’s spray gel. (Used to use Miss Jessie’s gel and various ones through the years.) \n\n3. I just style and let it air dry because I’m usually rushing out the door.\n\n4. When I sleep I’m sure my hair goes through it so the next day for a refresh I just apply water and go. \n\nHowever in that first pic I did twist once and clip my hair up to try to keep the waves from yesterday and not have it fall near straight. It seemed to help. \n\nThe next few pics are to share what it looked like last night then 3 and 4 are initial bleach and dye. Last is from 2024, (didn’t take pics much last year), been on and off bleaching and coloring my bangs mostly. Those are my natural waves or sorta curls after years trying to figure out how to even do my hair. \n\nNow it feels like I’m starting over with repairing and minimizing breakage.\n\nIf you happen to have advice I’ll take it or different products to use. I think I may be using too many products after wash but not sure.\n\nThank you! ",

      "content": "Hi all! Just posting a victory really. Yes I still bleach and dye my hair. As much as I love my curls, I love changing colours more. I’ve learnt how to do this without (completely) ruining my hair and I’m proud of myself for it. \n\nWhile my routine works, I would love some advice as I do wash my hair 3-4x a week, and I’d like to cut back on my wash days. I just feel my hair gets too greasy if I don’t. \n\nI usually wash twice a week with a clarifying shampoo, then a colour and/or curl protect shampoo. Any other wash day I just use my curl protect shampoo. Sometimes that’s Aussie, sometimes it’s the Loreal Elvive “Extraordinary oil”. The latter smells amazing!\n\nAfter washing these out, I use L’Oréal Elvive dream lengths or the extraordinary oil conditioner, sometimes I use both. I’ve never had my hair feel so nourished apart from this shampoo! I might also use a Garnier Hair Food mask if I’m gonna be in the shower for a long time. The cocoa butter “curl-restoring” is my fave.\n\nTo dry, I leave my hair soaking wet, section so that there’s a triangle at the front, and clip that up. I use one of those pronged curl brushes to brush through Umberto Giannini’s curl activating mousse, then massage that in, then use a tshirt to scrunch my hair. Once I’m happy with how my hair looks scrunched, I use Umberto Giannini’s Curl Jelly/scrunching jelly (pretty sure it’s the same thing as the normal one but I use the vanilla gelato scented one), then I diffuse my hair on high until bone dry. \n\nRepeat with the triangle section of the bangs.\n\nIf I want to save my curls for the next day, I sleep with my hair casted. I use Aussie’s “Work that Curl Oil” to break my cast. \n\nIt’s taken forever to find a method that works for my waves that I’m happy with! I’m still learning too, eg like cutting down my wash days, how to protect my wavy hair while sleeping (pineapple method is NOT working), and how to keep my curls fresh the next day. After I break my curl cast and sleep sometimes they lose 50% of their volume so I’m still learning how to fix that. However, I’m happy with my progress! ",

The underside has loose ringlet like curls the top is wavy and frizzy. I have very fine, thin hair. \n\nI have no idea how to care for it and everything I've tried has made it appear stringy and oily. (Photos 1-4) \n\nCurrently i brush my hair before showering, then I use  loreal elvive hyaluron + pure oily roots and scalp purifying shampoo and rehydrating conditioner. I then add a pump of Pantene miracle rescue bond building serum on each side. Then a little of sukin natural balance leave in conditioner (each side I spray once or twice in palms) scrunched in. Then I diffuse/air dry.  \n\nThe photos are my results. My roots are clearly clean and not oily but I feel like my hair looks wet and stringy.  If I finger brush it after (photos 5 &amp;6) it looses all definition and becomes straight in parts curly in others etc and still feels stringy. \n\nIs this just how it will always look? Is my current routine too heavy? Any advice is appreciated. ",

I’m fearing it’s my beloved La Roche moisturizer with 30 spf. I don’t know what else to do. Am I still purging? Is something in my routine creating more comedones? Should I quit differin? I’ll put my very simple routine below.   \n\nAM  \n\n\\- Cleanse with CeraVe hydrating cleanser  \n\n\\- The ordinary azelaic acid (recent addition, like two uses)   - Vanicream daily moisturizer (on my eyes because they’re sensitive)  \n\n\\- La Roche moisturizer w 30 spf   \n\nPM   \n\n\\- Remove makeup on eyes with ponds, avoiding chin  \n\n\\- Micellar water for the rest of the face   \n\n\\- Cleanse with CeraVe gentle foaming   \n\nSandwich method for differin  \n\n\\- Cetaphil deep hydration moisturizer   \n\n\\- Differin (haven’t worked up to every night yet.

      "content": "We all know that hair loss leads to psychological and emotional distress. I've experienced it myself; started at 18 years old, and now I'm in my early 20s with a solid norwood 2-3. I've tried countless drugs to address the DHT angle (topical fin, dut, kx826/pyri, fluridil, RU), yet I've experienced either dry eyes or chest pains. I'm not giving up with the topical fin, still experimenting with lower doses.\n\nBut that's not the point of this post. The point is that you **shouldn't** let balding ruin or lower your quality of life. Be as optimistic as you could be. I do this by coping through several strategies.\n\n\\#1: Self improvement. I know you guys of tired of hearing the usual advice of get muscular or dress better, but I want to be the best version of myself I can be, so when a decent treatment comes out, getting my hair back will be the last piece of the puzzle, so to speak. \n\n\\#2: Make yourself busy. We are all at different stages of life, whether it be high school, college, or employment. When you're outside of school or work, indulge in your hobbies, spend quality time with your friends and/or your significant other. \n\n\\#3: Potential treatments coming soon. I know it's a common trope that the cure is always 5 years away, or that baldness has been cured in mice a million times. But we have Veradermics' VDPHL01, an extended release minoxidil; Cosmo pharmaceutical's Clascoterone, a topical androgen receptor inhibitor (potential alternative to 5-ARI's for those who can't tolerate them); and last but not least, PP405, with a novel mechanism of action. None of these are guaranteed to get FDA approval, but this is the most exciting time for AGA patients since the release of propecia 20 years ago.\n\n",

      "title": "[Routine Help] Winlevi + Adapalene or go slow?",
      "content": "Hoping for some neutral, sanity-checking advice as I (33f) prepare to start the next phase of my skincare recovery journey.\n\nTLDR: My skin is a mess and after finally seeing a dermatologist, I’m questioning whether I should listen to her advice and use winlevi or just start with the adapalene 0.1 + benzoyl peroxide and go from there.\n\nHISTORY: \nLike many other posters, I had beautiful, nearly flawless skin that I took for granted all through my 20s. I have combination skin, with dryer, somewhat KP prone cheeks (which match the rest of my body). No history of oily skin elsewhere or body acne. I historically never had breakouts on my cheeks, only in the t-zone areas, and breakouts were predominately clusters of easy to extract blackheads or the occasional angry red pimple that would eventually come to a head and heal itself as long as I didn’t pick at it. Every few months I’d find a 1-2 flesh colored bumps on my cheeks or chin that would easily extract with a hard keratin plug or soft cheesy keratin coming out with light pressure after a shower or rinse off mask. I did find that my skin was sensitive and needed the right products – no generic body lotions or hotel lotions or even cerave for me, because I would break out, but as long as I had the right kind of cleanser that cleaned deeply without stripping, a good basic moisturizer (Sephora brand used to make some that worked well but they’ve been discontinued) and a gentle exfoliating toner (Ren Ready Steady Glow was HG, also now discontinued), my skin was great. \n\nI semi-regularly slept in my makeup (yuck), did not use SPF, and experimented with all kinds of products from Sephora, just using my own intuition, and my skin was very resilient.\n\nAround two years ago my skin started to deteriorate likely due to insufficient nutrition and stress, and about one year ago I had my mirena IUD replaced, and shortly after all hell broke loose and I have been experiencing persistent pustular and comedonal acne all over my face ever since.\n\nI’ve spent the last year scraping this sub and every other source of information and trying so many product combinations, supplements, plus lengthy barrier repair phases, but I am trapped in a perpetual cycle of dehydration, over-exfoliation, and congestion/oil over-production.\n\nTHE CYCLE: \n\nSTEP 1: Dryness\n\nI go easy on the hydrating products and get my skin to kind of dry out, the acne will subside and start healing. But, my skin isn’t exactly happy and healthy and it’s clear that it needs more moisture to continue healing and not get flaky and papery.\n\nSTEP 2: Congestion\n\nI’ve tried what feels like every moisturizer under the sun, serums, essences etc. from the ordinary to drugstore to SkinCeuticals to SK-II. While there are some that seem to do a better job than others, as soon as I start actually letting my skin settle into hydration or complete an eight week barrier repair with super gentle products, my skin is *nasty*. So congested, angry sebaceous filaments and keratin plugs everywhere, visibly oily, giant pores, and those once-occasional cheesy bumps on my cheeks are all over, all the time. \n\nSTEP 3: EXFOLIATION &amp; SENSITIVITY\n\nAfter noticing that nothing seemed to move the needle between steps, one and two, I accepted that exfoliation wasn’t optional for me. I’ve used the Cetaphil gentle scrub with some success, pixi glow tonic (which I accept is not a ‘good’ product, but settled on it as a less offensive, gentler AHA toner then most I had tried), panoxyl 2% salicylic acid, and very occasional use of the dennis gross alpha beta pads. I do not exfoliate daily, and mix in only one exfoliating step every few days. \n\nI have experimented with many different exfoliating routines and products and have found that this one works the ‘best’, but every few weeks inevitably still end up with sensitivity, perioral dermatitis around the nostrils and smile lines, and rebound acne from stressing out my barrier.\n\nTHE QUESTION\n\nI finally saw a dermatologist this week and she did did take a reasonably thorough history, but she seemed to generalize everything on my face as “acne” and \n“irritation” and didn’t seem troubled by the perioral dermatitis even when I drew her attention to it. Obviously, I’m not a doctor, so maybe I’m wrong, but that felt off to me. She said she felt confident that hormone imbalance was likely the culprit preventing my skin from finding equilibrium again after all of the stress and nutrition issues wrecked my barrier. \n\nShe prescribed me a combo gel of Adapalene 0.1% + benzoyl peroxide to use at night, and Winlevi cream to use morning and night. I was instructed to use gentle cleansers and otherwise stop everything else.\n\nShe had offered spironolactone, but I’m reluctant to take it because I’m on other medications, and similarly, I stopped taking birth control pills as a teenager because they made me feel ill.\n\nI just put Winlevi into Google to try to figure out how much it was going to cost, and was bombarded with lackluster and negative reviews about how it ruined peoples skin. The derm did not mention any of this to me, she only said that it was potentially less effective than oral medications, but it seems crazy to me that she wouldn’t mention that it could potentially make my skin way worse and also has a number of side effects.\n\nSo my question to you all is- what would you do if you were me?\n\nMy gut is telling me that I shouldn’t start both of these prescriptions at the same time, and if I haven’t had angry cystic acne up to this point, that it’s an unwise gamble to start winlevi after one quick consultation with a new doctor and zero testing of any other medical-grade treatments. Am I being foolish to second-guess her? She was highly rated and had good bedside manner, but I don’t know if I can handle the mental health aspect of developing even worse acne right now. \n\nAny other routine help, advice, support, wisdom etc welcome.",

My current bottle is Aussie Miracle Curls. \n\nWhen I get out of the shower, I just flip my head and run my fingers through it, scrunch a bit, and let it dry. I don't use brushes (it just doesn't need them), blow dryers, or any leave in products. I used to henna my hair, but it's been natural for 5+ years now, so probably mostly virgin hair. It does grow very slow, though.\n\nI have a silk pillow case, but don't do anything special at night. I don't really style it, either. Sometimes I mist it with my plant sprayer (just water) to reactivate the curls, but that's about it. \n\nMy hair is ultra, ultra fine and gets weighed down very easily.

I’m 19 now and it seems to get curlier ? \n\nI have serious problems with frizz and it’s very hard for my hair to retain moisture. It soaks up leave in conditioners like no one’s business. That being said, my curls only last one or MAX two days before bending out of shape and my hair looking absolutely wild. \n\nMy hair is EXTREMELY thick but the strands are very fine. My current routine (if you can call it that) is:\n\n1. Detox shampoo 2-3 times a week \n\n2. Cer-100 mask 1x a week (hair has improved with this)\n\n3. Whatever conditioner I can find in my house (moms or brothers, or deep conditioning mask 2-3x a week after shampooing. \n\nCurl products:\n\n1. Leave in Pacifica beach waves cream or Not Your Mothers curl cream \n\n2. Not your mother’s mousse OR Marc Anthony curl defining cream (though it’s sort of like a gel) \n\nI do not use heat on my hair as I am trying to grow it out and diffusing has never really worked for me, so I tend to dry it in a microfiber wrap or with a tshirt if I don’t have my wrap with me. \n\nMy curl pattern is also irregular, some parts are ringlets and some are waves. This is my SOS! \n\nI’m a college student and would really appreciate recommendations for everything (shampoo, conditioner, etc) and preferably cleaner ingredients! \n\nThank you so much and I am grateful for any advice!!

After the styling it’s all fine, but once I touch them my hair becomes all frizzy.\n\nLike, I’ve recently seen a video of a guy who passes his hand in his hair and they go back to how they were. If I try to do that my curls will just fall apart. (I don’t know if it makes sense, English isn’t my first language).\n\nI’m a boy and I have short hair.\n\nRoutine:\n\nshampoo (Garnier), conditioner (Garnier) while under the shower, then when I get out of the shower I get my shirt and hoodie on without drying my hair, then I use a defining cream, after that I put on a defining mousse.\n\nI then use a hairdryer at minimum to dry them and they’ll become “crunchy”: they’ll look wet and it almost looks like I have put on gel (they will be almost hard to touch). After that I let them dry at air for some time (usually 20 ish minutes because that’s the time I need to get to work, if I’m preparing to hang out I’ll wash my hair in advance and let them dry at air even for an hour or two), and after they have dried I do the scrunch.\n\nI don’t have any pictures of my curls right now, I will take one tomorrow in the morning before going to work (if I don’t forget). I will add the only one I have where you can see something so you can get an idea of my hair. (EDIT: it’s in the comment as I forgot to attach it when I published the post)\n\nAlso, if it can be useful I’ll also take a picture of the product I use. (The one I use aren’t the best, but it’s what I can currently afford.)\n\nWhat can I do to prevent my hair getting frizzy so easily?",
