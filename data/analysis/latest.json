      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

But now i’m running into the issue that since my hair is much more fine (fine as in strand size) and straight on the underneath section, it keeps getting tangled and matted when i sleep with a bonnet or any other way, or also just by going through my day normally. It used to do this when I was young and i forgot until now (maybe why I had it cut shorter in the first place lol). Does anyone have any advice? I’m not sure if there’s anything I can do tbh. I never really get any knots anywhere else in my hair only this section. \nMy routine is AG ultra moist conditioner &amp; shampoo, AG fast food leave in conditioner, and auntie jackie’s curl boss coconut curling gelée (highly recommend this one).

      "content": "Not here to sell anything, and I’m not speaking for every provider or clinic. This is just what I’ve consistently seen move the needle for people’s skin over years of working in medical aesthetics and consulting with regulated health-care teams.\n\nSkincare can feel overwhelming, but the ingredients that work long-term are surprisingly consistent. Here’s what actually delivers noticeable improvement when used correctly and consistently! \n\n  \n**For pigmentation and stubborn** discolouration\n\nHydroquinone (at least 2%)  \nStill one of the strongest short-term options for targeted pigment concerns. Usually used in cycles because it’s potent.\n\nNiacinamide (Vitamin B3)  \nGood for general discoloration, redness, and supporting the barrier.\n\nAzelaic Acid  \nGentle, versatile, and effective for pigmentation, redness, and texture issues.\n\nTranexamic Acid  \nOften helps with melasma-type uneven tone and overall brightening over time.\n\n**For anti-aging and long-term skin quality**\n\nRetinol or Tretinoin  \nStill the most reliable ingredient for improving texture, fine lines, and overall skin quality.\n\nVitamin C + E + Peptides  \nA brightening, antioxidant-rich combination that helps support healthier-looking skin.\n\nPeptides  \nUseful for strengthening the skin and improving resilience when used consistently.\n\nSunscreen  \nThe ingredient that protects all of the above from going to waste.\n\n**For hydration and barrier repair**\n\nHyaluronic Acid  \nBest used on damp skin and sealed with a moisturizer to prevent moisture loss.\n\nCeramides  \nEssential for repairing and reinforcing the skin barrier.\n\nUrea (low percentage)  \nHelps with smoothness, hydration, and softening rough patches.\n\nCicaplast Baume B5  \nConsistently helpful for calming irritation, supporting barrier repair, and restoring comfort when the skin is stressed or over-exfoliated.\n\n**For acne-prone or congested skin**\n\nSalicylic Acid (BHA)  \nKeeps pores clear and helps reduce inflammation.\n\nBenzoyl Peroxide  \nStill one of the most effective tools for managing acne-causing bacteria.\n\nAdapalene  \nA beginner-friendly retinoid that supports both acne control and long-term skin refinement.\n\n**General principles that make the biggest difference**\n\n\\- Consistency is more important than product count (can take sometimes months to see real permanent change, give a product at least a month of consistent use before deciding if it helps you or not) \n\n\\- Barrier health should always come first\n\n\\- Introduce new products slowly\n\n\\- Use one strong active at a time\n\n\\- Water intake and a balanced diet genuinely impact skin behaviour\n\n\\- Sunscreen determines how well all other products work",

      "content": "Hoping for some advice here from people who are having the same issue. My front and sides are decently curly but my back is only wavy in comparison. Of course, this gets elevated by sleeping on it and so on.\n\nI'll do my usual routine, as stated below, and diffuse with Dyson, then scrunch curls when fully dry. Sometimes I use one drop of hair oil for this step, sometimes not, just whatever I feel like doing that day.\n\nI've tried stronger hold gels to no effect, did finger curling, tried upside down styling exclusively, I even used the Bounce Curl Brush. I have rather fine hair and this thing makes my hair so incredibly shiny and frizz free but sadly sucks out all the measly volume there is. The best way to handle the back of my head for now is to style regularly and then diffuse upside down but this often leaves me with a lot of mess (as well as some stronger curled waves). Problem is, to get rid of this mess, meaning some unwanted parting, I use my flat iron to even things out. Most of the time this means killing some of the pretty curly waves. Even finger combing before diffusing to get some order into my hair does not help anything.\n\nNicer waves/curls + messy back of my head or pretty loose and shiny waves. It feels like I can't get one or the other. My sides are nice and bouncy and hold up so nicely even with me only using mousse. A curly cut is already off the table since I'm worried this will make me look like a spaghetti monster.\n\nCurrent routine (just 1 of each):    \n1. Pantene Volume &amp; Body OR Ouai Detox OR Wella Nutri Curls shampoo     \n2. L'Oreal Glycolic Gloss Conditioner OR L'Oreal Bond Repair Conditioner    \n3. Every 4th wash K18 mask    \n4. Pantene Miracle Rescue Leave-In OR Pureology Color Fanatic Spray    \n5. Pantene Perfect Waves Mousse (applied with prayer hands and scrunched)",

      "content": "Hi, I’m struggling with extremely oily skin – to the point where I can literally see tiny droplets of oil forming on my nose. I’m starting to think it might be because my moisturiser isn’t hydrating enough (I’m using the Purito Oat-In Calming Gel).\n\nI’ve been reading through the forum and saw a lot of people saying that layering toners and essences can help with hydration and possibly control oil production. One product that kept coming up was the Isntree Green Tea Fresh Toner, which sounds great for sebum control and is something I’d really like to try. But I also read that it can be a bit dehydrating, which worries me because I’m currently using acids like lactic acid and I’m planning to introduce salicylic acid in the future – so hydration feels pretty important right now.\n\nMy question is: would it be possible to use the Green Tea Fresh Toner *together* with a more hydrating essence to balance things out? If so, what kind of hydrating essence would you recommend pairing it with? And if that’s not a good idea, what would you suggest I do instead for oily but dehydrated skin?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice! 🙏\n\n  \nCurrent Routine \n\nAm \n\nNuetrogena Hydro boost Cleanser \n\nSkin1004 Centella Ampoule \n\nPurito Oat In Calming Gel\n\nCosrx Ultra-Light Invisible Sunscreen \n\n  \nPm\n\nNuetrogena Hydro boost Cleanser \n\nTO Lactic Acid 5% ( Only on Sunday, Tuesday and Friday nights )\n\nPurito Oat In Calming Gel",

I've only been using the terbinafine for 3 days and I've seen a great improvement. I want to start using retinal and I was hoping for some advice. I might not start it yet and try to get the fungal acne more stable first but I'm just thinking ahead.\n\n  \nI wasn't sure where in my routine to put the retinal. I planned to not use it on the days I use ketoconazole or salicylic acid face wash to not overload my skin I wasn't sure whether to put it on before or after the terbinafine and barrier serum. I've seen some people recommend putting the retinal on after the barrier serum but I apply my terbinafine before my barrier serum. Will that be too many layers for the retinal to have a good effect?\n\n  \nThanks in advance :)",

This was not entirely my decision, but it is an obvious problem...)\n\nThe results are much better than what I was doing a few months before I started, but they are still poor;  \n\\- The biggest issue is that my curls have hardly any definition to speak of.  \n\\- My hair is rather limp.  \n\\- I find I get more frizz than is normal.\n\nI am asking for advice on what products I ought to use instead, and also on how I should use them. Keep in mind that where I live has a lack of quality hairdressers and beauty-stores, and so I find it hard to find quality products and advice.

I’m amazed at how my hair has reacted to just a little TLC. ❤️ However…\n\nAs per the title: I have no idea what is causing my curls to come out so stringy when I style them. \n\nPicture one is before I style my hair in the morning (just taken out of Medusa clips) and picture two is after I style them. \n\nEven on wash days, when my hair is clean and not weighed down by anything, my curls turn out like this. \n\nRoutine:\nIn shower \n* Shampoo with NYM bond building shampoo and rinse out (before this photo my hair was particularly dirty so I shampooed twice, but normally just once)\n* Condition with NYM Curl Talk 3-in-1 conditioner/leave-in/co-wash, leave in for 1-2 minutes, then rinse out\n* Turn water off, squeeze out extra moisture with hands, apply NYM Curl Talk 3-in-1 conditioner/leave-in/co-wash (around 2 pumps) as leave-in via praying hands/glaze, then scrunch \n* For this picture, I forgot to apply gel until about halfway through plopping, but usually I apply Aussie Instant Freeze gel via glaze/praying hands and then scrunch.\n* Plop for about 20min-1hour\n* Diffuse on low-slow until 80-90% dry: hover and then pixie, just pixie, or just hover, depending on how much time I have. I haven’t noticed much of a difference.\n* SOTC once hair is completely dry\n    * Overnight: Medusa clip and satin pillowcase\n    * If it’s a night shower: leave hair in cast and gently Medusa clip\n",
