Recently switched to L’Oréal Ever Pure bond repair shampoo and conditioner. \n\n2. For styling I spray Aussie leave in conditioner then using detangling brush, next spray Not Your Mother’s- All eyes on me hair perfector and brush through. Next apply Kaleidoscope curl cream sorta using like praying hands to apply. Lastly use the bounce curl define brush and spray with Not Your Mother’s spray gel. (Used to use Miss Jessie’s gel and various ones through the years.) \n\n3. I just style and let it air dry because I’m usually rushing out the door.\n\n4. When I sleep I’m sure my hair goes through it so the next day for a refresh I just apply water and go. \n\nHowever in that first pic I did twist once and clip my hair up to try to keep the waves from yesterday and not have it fall near straight. It seemed to help. \n\nThe next few pics are to share what it looked like last night then 3 and 4 are initial bleach and dye. Last is from 2024, (didn’t take pics much last year), been on and off bleaching and coloring my bangs mostly. Those are my natural waves or sorta curls after years trying to figure out how to even do my hair. \n\nNow it feels like I’m starting over with repairing and minimizing breakage.\n\nIf you happen to have advice I’ll take it or different products to use. I think I may be using too many products after wash but not sure.\n\nThank you! ",

      "content": "Hi! \n\nFirst time poster here, apologies if I format wrong. \n\nI recently moved to a new country that is very humid, and went from having slightly wavy hair to a mix of curly to wavy hair. The underside has loose ringlet like curls the top is wavy and frizzy. I have very fine, thin hair. \n\nI have no idea how to care for it and everything I've tried has made it appear stringy and oily. (Photos 1-4) \n\nCurrently i brush my hair before showering, then I use  loreal elvive hyaluron + pure oily roots and scalp purifying shampoo and rehydrating conditioner. I then add a pump of Pantene miracle rescue bond building serum on each side. Then a little of sukin natural balance leave in conditioner (each side I spray once or twice in palms) scrunched in. Then I diffuse/air dry.  \n\nThe photos are my results. My roots are clearly clean and not oily but I feel like my hair looks wet and stringy.  If I finger brush it after (photos 5 &amp;6) it looses all definition and becomes straight in parts curly in others etc and still feels stringy. \n\nIs this just how it will always look? Is my current routine too heavy? Any advice is appreciated. ",

      "content": "Hi all! Just posting a victory really. Yes I still bleach and dye my hair. As much as I love my curls, I love changing colours more. I’ve learnt how to do this without (completely) ruining my hair and I’m proud of myself for it. \n\nWhile my routine works, I would love some advice as I do wash my hair 3-4x a week, and I’d like to cut back on my wash days. I just feel my hair gets too greasy if I don’t. \n\nI usually wash twice a week with a clarifying shampoo, then a colour and/or curl protect shampoo. Any other wash day I just use my curl protect shampoo. Sometimes that’s Aussie, sometimes it’s the Loreal Elvive “Extraordinary oil”. The latter smells amazing!\n\nAfter washing these out, I use L’Oréal Elvive dream lengths or the extraordinary oil conditioner, sometimes I use both. I’ve never had my hair feel so nourished apart from this shampoo! I might also use a Garnier Hair Food mask if I’m gonna be in the shower for a long time. The cocoa butter “curl-restoring” is my fave.\n\nTo dry, I leave my hair soaking wet, section so that there’s a triangle at the front, and clip that up. I use one of those pronged curl brushes to brush through Umberto Giannini’s curl activating mousse, then massage that in, then use a tshirt to scrunch my hair. Once I’m happy with how my hair looks scrunched, I use Umberto Giannini’s Curl Jelly/scrunching jelly (pretty sure it’s the same thing as the normal one but I use the vanilla gelato scented one), then I diffuse my hair on high until bone dry. \n\nRepeat with the triangle section of the bangs.\n\nIf I want to save my curls for the next day, I sleep with my hair casted. I use Aussie’s “Work that Curl Oil” to break my cast. \n\nIt’s taken forever to find a method that works for my waves that I’m happy with! I’m still learning too, eg like cutting down my wash days, how to protect my wavy hair while sleeping (pineapple method is NOT working), and how to keep my curls fresh the next day. After I break my curl cast and sleep sometimes they lose 50% of their volume so I’m still learning how to fix that. However, I’m happy with my progress! ",

Washing with even just water makes my face extremely tight now\n\nI’ve stripped back my routine as below - \n\nAM:\n\nRinse with room temp/lukewarm water\n\nApply Skinfix moisturizer\n\nPM:\n\nCleanse with LRP hydrating cleanser\n\nApply Skinfix moisturizer\n\nI stopped shaving with my razor and switched to an electric as well to prevent any exfoliating of my skin.\n\nWhile this seems to be better my skin is still tight and I feel like I could be doing more to help speed the process. I know it takes time but what else would be recommend to help me heal my barrier quicker? Toner? Serum? I have to be careful as to not use products that are too occlusive as it causes me to breakout from the ungodly amount of oil I am producing through the day/while sleeping.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated",

I don’t need super heavy repair — I mostly want to keep my skin regularly moisturized so it stays comfortable and calm.\nIdeally, I’d love something that is vegan and cruelty-free, but that’s not a strict requirement if the product is really good.\n\nMy biggest issue: I absolutely hate the feeling of lotion sitting on my skin. I’m looking for something that absorbs very fast, is not greasy at all, and leaves no residue — basically that “is it even there?” feeling (if that’s even possible 😅).\nIf you have any recommendations for lightweight, fast-absorbing body lotions, I’d really appreciate it.

Whatever conditioner I can find in my house (moms or brothers, or deep conditioning mask 2-3x a week after shampooing. \n\nCurl products:\n\n1.

Not your mother’s mousse OR Marc Anthony curl defining cream (though it’s sort of like a gel) \n\nI do not use heat on my hair as I am trying to grow it out and diffusing has never really worked for me, so I tend to dry it in a microfiber wrap or with a tshirt if I don’t have my wrap with me. \n\nMy curl pattern is also irregular, some parts are ringlets and some are waves.

      "content": "Hi there, as the title says I have a “problem” with my curls. After the styling it’s all fine, but once I touch them my hair becomes all frizzy.\n\nLike, I’ve recently seen a video of a guy who passes his hand in his hair and they go back to how they were. If I try to do that my curls will just fall apart. (I don’t know if it makes sense, English isn’t my first language).\n\nI’m a boy and I have short hair.\n\nRoutine:\n\nshampoo (Garnier), conditioner (Garnier) while under the shower, then when I get out of the shower I get my shirt and hoodie on without drying my hair, then I use a defining cream, after that I put on a defining mousse.\n\nI then use a hairdryer at minimum to dry them and they’ll become “crunchy”: they’ll look wet and it almost looks like I have put on gel (they will be almost hard to touch). After that I let them dry at air for some time (usually 20 ish minutes because that’s the time I need to get to work, if I’m preparing to hang out I’ll wash my hair in advance and let them dry at air even for an hour or two), and after they have dried I do the scrunch.\n\nI don’t have any pictures of my curls right now, I will take one tomorrow in the morning before going to work (if I don’t forget). I will add the only one I have where you can see something so you can get an idea of my hair. (EDIT: it’s in the comment as I forgot to attach it when I published the post)\n\nAlso, if it can be useful I’ll also take a picture of the product I use. (The one I use aren’t the best, but it’s what I can currently afford.)\n\nWhat can I do to prevent my hair getting frizzy so easily?",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nThe last year and a half  or so I was able to stabilize my hair loss pretty decently. I’m currently doing oral finasteride six times a week, dutasteride once a week. Topical minoxidil 8% twice a day. In April 2025 I did a stem cell + PRP procedure which in my opinion was very potent but I just don’t know what’s going on right now. The stem cell treatment actually pretty much completely halted any hair loss and helped grow a bunch of hair about six months after the treatment. Now we are in February 2026, and the hair loss just started ramping up suddenly. My baseline was probably about five or absolute max 10 hairs falling out per day. Over the last week I’ve noticed probably about 20 or 30 hairs falling out a day. Yesterday and today was really nasty in particular, I probably lost about 50 to 60 hairs today and probably about the same yesterday. I’m noticing a mix of thick terminal hairs as well as some thinner and finer hairs that are falling out - i’m not seeing a majority of them being one type of hair. ChatGPT seems to think that this is indicative of a shedding cycle and that a good amount of it will likely come back. Can anyone share their opinions or past experiences to know what I may be dealing with? Thank you in advance",

      "content": "This was technically my 3rd treatment for burst vessel removal in my face. 1st worked well (purpura/bruise) but it left behind lily white circles from the laser pulses. 2nd was meant to do entire face to blend but they screwed up and used way way too light of a setting. 3rd round is what you see here with the last photo being immediately after. \n\n8 Weeks later and the redness is gone, but there are some track marks in the skin texture in this one area. You can see slight depressions/ripples where the overlapping pulse lines were. \n\nIt's getting better and AI (sorry I can't find any resources online about this specifically and need to talk it out) says the collagen synthesis process (pit filling) can take 3-6 months. \n\nRight now I'm just using The Ordinary Multi-Peptide HA serum and LRP Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer. Then I just restarted my 2.5% Tret without any issue which I think should help?\n\nHas anyone else had this issue of track marks? I have the urge to do something proactive like massaging it, or anything to expedite. \n\nIt looks fine (basically undetectable) when my skin is calm but after working out and under bad lighting at the gym the track marks are very evident still.

I'd prefer she use it every night as Olay recommends but that's too much for her)\n\n\n\nWhen showering and not just cleaning with a wash cloth (about once a week):\n\n\\- cleanse face with Some Bi Mi AHA-BHA-PHA 30 Days Miracle Acne Clear Body Cleanser \n(I read that it has basically the same ingredient list as the facial cleanser and that it's just cheaper)\n\n\\- out of the shower spray damp face with BIOHEAL BOH - Panthecell Repair Cica Cream Mist\n(this is a spray on hydrating cream which is easier for her)\n\n\\- apply sunscreen Beauty of joseon Relief Sun Rice + Probiotics SPF50+ PA++++\n\n\n\ndo you think these products will be able to keep her face healthy while slowly resurfacing the milia that bother her? I know this is a long post so thanks so much for reading and any input is appreciated!!",

I would say my hair is thin overall, meaning I don’t have a lot of it. Routine: This is my hair air dried after ouai clarifying shampoo (first time trying), Pantene conditioner, not your mothers curl talk cream, and garnier fructis hair oil+Indian olive oil for the ends. I haven’t been scrunching my curls all the way to the roots (only scrunching a bit at the ends) to attempt more gentle waves rather than springy tighter curls. Not sure the exact curl pattern I have but it definitely gets a bit curlier than this. I’ve been using a satin bonnet every night to sleep. Ive never dyed my hair and got a trim 7 weeks ago, and haven’t spotted any split ends. Any help is super appreciated!",

Right now, a Korean brand called\"I am shampoo\" 😅\n\n I've tried a bunch of conditiners recently. I have a low budget. My current bottle is Aussie Miracle Curls. \n\nWhen I get out of the shower, I just flip my head and run my fingers through it, scrunch a bit, and let it dry. I don't use brushes (it just doesn't need them), blow dryers, or any leave in products. I used to henna my hair, but it's been natural for 5+ years now, so probably mostly virgin hair. It does grow very slow, though.\n\nI have a silk pillow case, but don't do anything special at night. I don't really style it, either. Sometimes I mist it with my plant sprayer (just water) to reactivate the curls, but that's about it. \n\nMy hair is ultra, ultra fine and gets weighed down very easily. The problem I've been having is if I use clarifying shampoo, it gets frizzy and tends to lose the curl, but is nice and fluffy. If I use more moisturizing products, it gets weighed down and greasy within 24 hours. I can't seem to find a happy middle ground that keeps both the moisture and volume. ",

I only recently stopped straightening and started styling it wavy/curly (only been in the game for a week and I’ve never tried styling wavy hair before).\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n• Shampoo &amp; conditioner (both curl crush, hairlust)\n\n• Leave-in conditioner (curl crush, hairlust)\n\n• Mousse (curl crush, hairlust)\n\n• Gel (curl crush, hairlust)\n\n• Scrunch on soaking wet hair\n\n• Diffuse for a bit, then air-dry\n\nI REALLY try not to touch it after I’ve scrunched but DAMN I find it hard!!!!)\n\nI don’t brush it once it’s dry. \n\nWhat I’m struggling with:\n\n• Inconsistent wave pattern\n\n• Waves falling flat in the lengths\n\n• Not sure if I’m using too much or too little product\n\n• Unsure of my hair type (thinking somewhere around 2A–2B, but not confident)\n\nMy goal:\n\nDefined, soft waves with less frizz and better hold — without weighing my hair down.\n\nAny tips for beginners, routine tweaks, or insight into what my hair might need would be greatly appreciated. And also - do you believe I will get more defined waves in time? \n\nThanks in advance 🤍",

I’m hoping to incorporate something into my routine to help with these breakouts but I’m not quite sure what would work best.\n\n**My current routine is as follows:**\n\n**AM**\n\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n2. Naturie Skin Conditioner\n3. CeraVe Vitamin C Serum\n4. Ulta Chill Out Under Eye Balm\n5. La Roche-Posay Triple Repair Moisturizer mixed with Hero Green Correcting Cream (OG formula)\n6. Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n1. DHC Cleansing Oil\n2. Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n3.

      "content": "So this might sound weird but hear me out. After years of dealing with hormonal acne and trying literally every product under the sun, I finally figured out what was actually keeping me stuck and its not what I thought.\n\nI was so focused on treating my skin that I completely ignored what was happening in my mind. And turns out that matters just as much, maybe even more.\n\nHeres what I learned. When you have hormonal acne that keeps coming back no matter what you do, your nervous system never relaxes. Youre always waiting for the next flare up. You check your face first thing in the morning, one new pimple tanks your whole day, and youre constantly in this state of stress. That stress messes with your hormones even more, which causes more breakouts, which causes more stress. Its a feedback loop and topical treatments alone cant break it.\n\nI was doing everything right on paper. Good routine, tried retinol, azelaic acid, niacinamide, salicylic acid, even spironolactone. Some things worked temporarily but the acne always came back. So I kept adding more products, more actives, being more strict with myself. But that constant fixing was actually keeping my skin barrier compromised and my stress levels high.\n\nWhat actually started helping was treating my mind first. I know that sounds like BS wellness stuff but I'm serious. I had to calm down my nervous system before my skin could actually heal. Stop panicking over every bump, stop constantly switching products, stop being so rigid with everything. Give my body permission to fluctuate without treating it like a failure.\n\nIve read DOZENS of articles (on Reddit, Quora, Official Websites, Medium, the whole nine yards!) none of which talk about the importance of relaxing yourself before rushing to medicines. But what I finally understood is that hormonal acne creates this cycle between stress, hormones, and inflammation. Stress increases hormonal imbalance, hormonal shifts trigger breakouts, breakouts increase stress, round and round it goes (I'm gasping for air after writing this, good God!). And because this cycle is internal, topical treatments alone rarely solve it long term. They might reduce symptoms temporarily but they dont address the deeper pattern. What most of us actually want isnt perfect skin, we want relief. We want to wake up without immediately checking our face, we want predictable skin that doesnt hijack our plans or tank our mood, we want to stop obsessing over every ingredient and every habit. I tried to sum things up, but this [article ](https://medium.com/@MayaBright/why-hormonal-acne-feels-like-a-never-ending-cycle-even-when-you-do-everything-right-346cf3dde626)explained it way better than I can.\n\nIm not saying my skins perfect now but Im also not obsessing over it the way I was. And weirdly that shift in how I relate to my skin has done more than any product ever did.\n\nAnyone else had this experience? Like realizing the mental part was holding you back more than the actual skincare?",

But I've stopped doing competitions, and my hair gets really fluffy anytime i try and brush it and ringlets form easily (although a bit messy). I was a very curly haired baby and it runs in my family as well! I tried a 'curly hair routine'  which was :\n\n1. Wet brushed hair + Scrunch\n2. Use heat protectant (got2b guardian angel) + Scrunch\n3. Hair serum / Frizz Ease (John Frieda) + scrunch\n4. Leave in hair mask (Garnier Hair Food, Banana + Shea) + Scrunch\n5. And then I did attempt to blow dry but have lost my diffuser..\n\nAnd now it currently looks like this. Can anyone help me find out what's happening?? \n\n",
