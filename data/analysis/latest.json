      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

There has been a lot of progress because at 18-20 my face was full of acne. My mother straight up took me to do a laser treatment from a cosmetologist without consulting a dermat when I was 18 which obviously reversed.\nThen I went to a top dermat at 22 in mumbai who helped me with medicines and chemical peels which solved a good chunk of my problem. I moved away to a different country and  my acne was back. I have since moved back to India and was diagnosed with PCOS and my acne is well gone and stable with the medications given by my gynac. I can finally touch my face and even discovered I have a dimple.\n\nNow I am looking to solve this acne scaring problem. Makeup does not help because it accentuates the pores. Anyone have any tips or knows affordable dermats in mumbai who can help me get my skin close to regular females my age? I sadly can no longer afford my original luxury dermat 🥲  and I feel super embarrased traveling in Mumbai with this issue. ",

      "content": "I’m 25 and I used to have extremely oily, acne prone skin. I was also starting to get hormonal acne because of my gut issues. I used every viral skincare product and my face only became worse. I first went to the doctor for my gut issues, I still have them but it’s better now. I then went to the dermatologist and got pharmacy skincare and was prescribed isotretinoin(please don’t take it without doctor’s advice) for a month, along with Moisturex Hydra. Was also given a face wash, but didn’t like it much. \n\nBut, one product I can recommend is the Moisturex Hydra face moisturiser. It’s the best for oily skin. I have used everything in the market, and everything sucks. This one doesn’t feel heavy at all. My skin is far less oily now, and feels and looks hydrated. So if you’re an oily skin person and are looking for a good budget friendly moisturiser, go for Moisturex Hydra. It’s available in pharmacies and on Amazon also. And my skin cleared! This is after 6 months of using this moisturiser. \n\nAlso attached my updated skincare routine. FYI I only use the AHA BHA PHA peel once in a week at night. Please use it after a patch test. And the Asaya serum at night. It has helped lighten my dark spots after 3 months of usage. You can use the toner spray both morning and night. Dot and key sunscreen is good. But if you use anything else, that is fine too. And simple is the only face wash that has worked for me. Literally so good. \n\nThis is just my personal experience, please don’t be mad if some of these don’t work for you. Use whatever suits your skin. Thanks!",

      "content": "\nI’ve been trying to get my routine under control, and I’d love recommendations from anyone who has similar skin to mine. My skin is acne-prone, dry, and sensitive, and I’m on tretinoin 0.1 percent gel every 2–3 nights. I also deal with hyperpigmentation that darkens quickly and I’m extremely prone to closed comedones, especially from anything that leans heavy or creamy.\n\nHere’s what I’m using right now:\n\nMorning:\n• Cleanser: SkinCeuticals Simply Clean Gel or a basic Cetaphil cleanser\n• If my skin doesn’t feel dirty, I use a Cetaphil wipe instead of washing\n• SkinBetter Alto Advanced Defense Serum (about 4x a week)\n• Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer\n• Sunscreen: Supergoop Mineral Sheer Screen or SkinCeuticals mineral sunscreen\n\nNight:\n• Makeup removal: Cetaphil wipe, sometimes with micellar water added\n• Cleanser: SkinCeuticals Simply Clean Gel or PanOxyl 2 percent salicylic acid wash\n• Thin layer of clindamycin phosphate lotion on some nights\n• Moisturizer: mostly Biossance Gel, but occasionally SkinFix Triple Lipid Cream (which I’m pretty sure is breaking me out)\n• Tretinoin 0.1 percent gel every 2–3 nights\n\nA few other things that might be relevant:\n• I work out regularly and wash my face afterwards\n• I got a VI Peel a few months ago but didn’t see any lasting improvement\n• Heavy creams with fatty alcohols or occlusive ingredients tend to clog me almost immediately\n• Gel moisturizers are the safest for me, but I’m trying to find something that can still get me through winter without triggering breakouts\n\nI’ve added photos of my skin so you can get a better idea of the texture, bumps, and hyperpigmentation I’m dealing with.\n\nWhat I’m hoping to get advice on - \n• Winter moisturizers that won’t clog an acne-prone, sensitive, tretinoin-using face\n• Gel or gel-cream formulas that add moisture without causing closed comedones\n• Any treatment suggestions for acne + hyperpigmentation that won’t overwhelm my skin or conflict with tret\n• And if anything in my current routine looks like it might be contributing to irritation or clogging, I’d like to hear that too\n\nI’m really trying to get my skin to a calmer, more consistent place, so any recommendations are appreciated.",

Both are AWESOME for body but not for face, they made me look dull and dark. But if you have very dry skin condition? The white tub will work for you\n\n3) Bioderma atoderm - very moisturizing and a bit sticky, great for body but again it gave me pimples on face. So I used it for my body \n\n4) Cetaphil - Have used this before nivea for few months, very moisturizing but made me look dull and greasy \n\n5) Venusia max - I have used both max and the simpler version of this moisturizer, It's amazingg! Non comedogenic, no fragrance and gives a matte finish!!!! But I may not order it again bcz I'm not a fan of matte finish, I like those slightly dewy finish kinds hehee \n\n6) Emolene - nice but will give you acne, so use on body\n\n7) Re'queel Ceramide moisturizer - Just ordered it 3 days ago, I like it, even the fragrance is very good but moisturizers shouldn't have strong fragrances right?? So idk if I'll get this again or not, let's see\n\nLastly I want to try my hands on Cerave😂 I'm wishing to have one holy grail Moisturizer, That I will carry to my grave!\nIt should be simple and good, and yes like drugstore products &amp; I'm not a fan of products with too much social media hype like dot &amp; key etc\n\nThanks for listening!

I heard a lot of good reviews about these brands for my skin type, and am now using products from them that haven't triggered my skin (but I know all products are different). I want to incorporate a more soothing toner that's gentle enough for everyday use, and I hear milky toners are good for hydration. I like that the Naturium toner has some azelaic acid because I was planning to incorporate azelaic acid into my routine anyways-so I think this could be a decent product to introduce it to my sensitive skin. However it is described on the website as a gentle \"exfoliant\" which confuses me? I don't want to over exfoliate my skin I want to hydrate it. This is what is making me consider Versed because their toner seems to emphasize hydration more. \nLet me know what you guys think, any help or advice is appreciated :)\n\n",

      "content": "My routine: \n\nWhen I shower I wet my hair with warm-ish water, use shampoo, rinse with warm-ish water, then add conditioner, and I use a wide toothed comb to remove any tangles, then I rinse with cold water. \n\nWhen I get out of the shower, I squeeze out as much water as I can, and dry with a towel (I know, I should use a cotton tshirt or something, but when I did, it didn’t really help), then I brush it with a detangling brush, and add leave-in conditioner. I use a smoothing brush and put it in a low pony, as that is honestly the only hairstyle I can stand (I can’t stand my hair touching the sides of my neck).\n\nThe problem:\n\nAfter maybe 6 hours or less, my hair frizzes up on the sides (the top too, but mostly the sides) and comes out of the ponytail. Using gel extends this time, but not by very much. It really bothers me because a) it looks silly, and b) I can’t stand the feeling of little frizzy hairs touching my ears. \n\nMy current solution is to spray my hair with water mixed with the leave in conditioner, and rebrush it with the smoothing brush, but this only lasts for like 2 hours. I could add gel, but if I did that every 2 hours my hair would get so gunky. I’m just so tired of having to refresh my hair every couple hours, and it’s eating up a lot of conditioner. \n\nThanks for any suggestions! (I also don’t have a lot of money which I why I use shampoo and conditioner from the dollar store…)",

I do not have a night time routine.\n\nMy skin is generally dry in the mornings however it tends to get oily throughout the day, I think this is due to working 9 hours in an office.\n\nI do not have acne or any problems with my skin, maybe apart from the oily skin throughout the skin which can be somewhat irritating. I also have puffy, eyes and lines under my eyes in the mornings (could a caffeine solution help here)\n\nWith all of this in mind what should I aim for as I am unsure. So far I have gathered the following to begin doing:\n\nMorning:\n- CeraVe Cleanser as I enjoy and benefit from it\n- Caffeine Eye Cream\n- Vanicream Moisturising Cream\n\n\nNighttime:\n- Same routine as morning but with Retinol added in\n\nI had looked into Suncream however I live in Ireland and at the moment I wake up in the dark and head home in the dark too. I have also looked into a Serum/Toner however I do not see much benefit to these unless someone can convince me. I am also looking into maybe adding in an Eye Cream\n\nWhat am I missing that should be added to my routine? ",
