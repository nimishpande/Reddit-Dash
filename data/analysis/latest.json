I'm so so happy and in love with my hair right now 🥹 I had the \"I had pin straight hair my entire life so I thought my hair was just frizzy straight\" experience. After discovering it was wavy, trying to figure out what the hell to do with it has been a big struggle. I cut off most of my bleach damaged ends a couple weeks ago which I think also helped a ton. My hair has never looked this nice. It feels so amazing to not hate and be frustrated with it for once.\n \nMy routine:\n1. Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Defining Shampoo and Conditioner — shampoo twice, apply conditioner and brush through with a curl defining brush (the one w/ the slots on the sides), leave in for ~5 minutes while I do the rest of my shower stuff and space out lol. Rinse by scrunching with water.\n2. Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner — Apply on sopping wet hair w/ praying hands, brush through, *don't scrunch*.\n3. Not Your Mother's Activating Curl Talk Mousse — Apply (lots) using prayer hands, brush through, scrunch, then microplop until hair is no longer sopping.\n4. Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Sculpting Gel — Lightly glaze over hair upside down, then each side. Microplop until hair is damp.\n5. Hover diffuse (warm air, low speed) upside down, then start pixie diffusing. Flip to the side, pixie diffuse, then other side. Rightside up, pixie diffuse with cold air.

      "content": "This might be a stupid post to make but I don’t know who else to ask. Whenever I go to the hairdresser I ask for rounded layers and lots of them. Recently I went to get a proper curly cut (only person in town who does it) after searching once again. I cannot for the life of me see layers except at the very bottom. My mom keeps telling me I need to get more layers than what I have right now. It’s just not round in the back the way I wanted it. On YouTube there’s a woman (Marina Ann - two of her videos showing what I mean: https://youtube.com/shorts/irIaGDE11MU?si=YV3Jr3KhkTdLAjx0\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/2fafQ4UEKlA?si=Gs_Tr6Cq0tXpPfXM) cutting her own hair with lots of layers and I always show her video and tons of pictures at every hair appointment but it just never translates. \n\nCan anyone help me out if these are lots of decent layers? The hairdresser took off so much of my hair last time and I feel like she gave me a cut she gives everyone else. I asked for curtain bangs and had to cut those myself afterwards essentially because she didn’t cut them short enough like the old picture of my curtain bangs I once had which I showed to her. From some angles the bottom looks a bit sparse. I was thinking I might just try and cut it myself next time considering that these cuts are expensive. I’m just a bit wary since I tried a Wayne Tuggle haircut on my own and the bottom was super uneven. First few pictures attached show my hair after the cut once I’ve been styling it myself and the last couple (where it’s more defined) show right at my hair appointment. \n\nRoutine (new one - I’m still figuring out how to use all of these but my hair does look better):\n\nShampoo: innersense pure radiance or clarity hairbath\nConditioner: innersense color radiance conditioner\nStylers: innersense quiet calm curl control, innersense I create volume and I create hold, sometimes I create finish as well. \n\nThese are all very concentrated so I only need to use a tiny amount. I usually just rake the products through with tons of water and then scrunch a bit and get the excess water out with a towel. I switch between air drying and diffusing. Now that it’s cold, I diffuse (definitely not as neat or methodically as others though). \n\nI’d really appreciate someone’s thoughts! \n\n",

Things that have worked for me: cosrx snail mucin, innisfree sunscreen, purito green tea sunscreen (RIP), belif moisture bomb, alastin, keihls overnight purple serum, Sunday Riley good genes and the blue overnight one. Things that haven’t worked for me: la roche posay, dr jart ceramidin, anything cerave or neutrogena. I would love any advice, thank you so much!!",

I didn’t have all of the time in the world to develop a perfect routine so I went to Chat GPT and had it create a routine for ‘glass skin’ based on pictures of my skin using only Korean products as that’s what I’ve historically had the best success with. \n\nThese before and after shots are only 2 weeks apart! \n\nI’m not an expert on the subject but right now I’m fixing my skin barrier and strengthening it before adding any actives. \n\nFor background, I have rosacea and very fair, very sensitive, combination skin. This has been the only routine that has ever worked THIS well for me! \n\nAM:\n1. Lukewarm water\n2. I’m From Rice Toner\n3. BOJ calming serum (green tea + panthenol) \n4. Isntree aqua gel moisturizer \n5. Isntree watery sun gel \n\nPM:\n1. Manyo oil cleanser\n2. BOJ green plum cleanser \n3. I’m From Rice Toner\n4. BOJ calming serum \n5. Cosrx snail mucin \n\nStarting today it has recommended I switch from I’m from rice toner to Anua 77 heartleaf toner + add in Illiyoon ceramide cream on top of the cosrx snail mucin as the ‘sealing layer’ of my nightly routine. \n\nIf anyone has gotten this far, thank you and I’d love to hear your experience on which toner you prefer between I’m From vs Anua \n\nStill a long way to go until glass skin but really happy with the results so far! \n",

Sarat Anandh, MD (DVL) — a Board-Certified Dermatologist and Double Gold Medalist 🏅🏅.\n\nMy heart truly pains to see so many people struggling with acne — often misled, mistreated, or losing confidence over something that’s completely treatable. That’s why I wanted to host this AMA — to give you honest, science-based answers and help you understand what really works.\n\nBefore founding my own clinic, I served as the Youngest Regional Medical Director for a leading national skin-clinic chain, where I designed Pan-India protocols for Laser Hair Reduction (LHR) and trained doctors across centers.\n\nOver the years, I’ve presented and published multiple research papers internationally — Acne management and Acne-scar treatment protocols as well. I’ve also conducted fellowships and workshops, teaching about lasers and energy-based devices.\n\nCurrently, I practice at The Derm Edit Clinic (Chennai) — a science-driven boutique equipped with Fotona SP Dynamis NX Line, Fotona StarWalker MaQX, HydraFacial MD, GFC, Exosome therapies and many more.\n\nFocus of this AMA\n\nDermatology is a vast field, so to keep this focused and useful, today’s AMA will be only about Acne &amp; Acne Scars — causes, treatments, lasers, peels, oral medications, and everything in between.\n\nTo make the discussion efficient:\n\nI’ll be answering the Top 20 upvoted questions in detail.\n\nAMA will stay open for 48 hours.\n\n*Will not be giving medical consultation/product recommendations*",

She bathes more than that but just gets her hair wet, so we apply leave in conditioner after. We never brush her hair dry. In the mornings I use water and a little leave in conditioner to style her hair. She usually requests some sort of braid to keep it out of her face. If she wears in down like in the last picture I add a small amount of curl cream. First two pictures show her hair after she’s woken up without styling it. \n\nI’m worried there is product build up and that her hair is just in general too dry. It now feels straw like when I wash it. Is this normal? \n\nI’m thinking I need to use a clarifying shampoo but don’t want to make the dryness worse. \n\nAny recommendations for a clarifying shampoo, how often to use it, and what moisturizing products to use between washes? Bonus if it’s low on fragrance. I don’t love the smell of most strong fragrances. \n\nShould I be getting her a silk pillow case or having her sleep with her hair a certain way? \n\nWe love her curls and want to start from a young age teaching her the proper maintenance. I research online but get overwhelmed with all the different possibilities and would love some guidance on simple routines that have worked for others. ",

      "content": "Around two months ago I decide to add a very gentle foam cleanser to my routine in addition to the usual micellar water that I have always used. My skin is sensitive, but the cleanser didn’t feel ripping and my skin felt very clean initially. But then suddenly I noticed that my fine lines in my forehead became way more visible than before. I freaked out because I’m only 26 and I asked for help in this community because I felt like my routine only got better so I didn’t understand why my skin started looking worse. Thanks to all the lovely people here I stopped double cleansing and switched back to micellar water only. Now a bit over two weeks later my skin started looking so much healthier again. I’m not at all saying no one should double cleanse just that you should listen to your skin and don’t always follow whatever is trending on social media at the moment! These pictures are two weeks apart and I know I’m probably a lot more critical about the difference than others but just wanted to say thank you people for your great advice ✨",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
