      "content": "curly hair has been a special interest of mine since I discovered mine in may this year. a friend of mine has gorgeous, waist length, curly hair and after begging for months he finally let me me style it! he never used anything to it other than shampoo &amp; conditioner and oil (loreal) in the ends to comb it and air dry. also, I never ever did someone elses hair before. I don’t even remember purposely touching hair other than mine lol \n\nhis hair seems to be the complete opposite of my hair. he has low porosity hair that tangles like crazy. I read about tangly hair but omg I repeatedly combed it for what felt like hours. in the next second it looks like a family of meerkats live in there. he also has a lot of breakage from brushing it too harsh.\n\nI essentially used my styling products but to wash and condition we used his stuff.\n\nroutine: head&amp;shoulders shampoo and conditioner, bali curls moisture mask in between, balea curling creme, bali curls volume foam, taft 14 gel, microplop with tshirt, diffuse on high heat low fan and vice versa and then scrunch out the crumch with balea plex care oil\n\nside note: some comments on my last post said they would like their hair washed by me and coincidentally this happend lol ",

He actually rates it pretty highly which is pretty rare. He talks about it at 5:35 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgUFHMH99UY).\n\nstudy : [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7373546/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7373546/)\n\nTried to research about it a year ago but apparently it was only sold in South Korea until recently I searched for it on google and they have an international launch from some [Australian website](https://ceraderma.com.au/product/easy-hairfull/) . They also have free international shipping which is nice.\n\nThought it would be interesting for this sub as it is considerably cheaper than other models like irestore/theradome but actually has good clinical efficacy backing from reputable journals unlike the other two. Although its still $679 with discount though which is still pretty expensive. ",

The next morning is when i start my routine, and i wet it like crazy and then section off the crown of my head. Then i work in 4in sections on either side of my ear (leaving a section in the back to avoid a part) and run the cream through my hair with fingers followed by the tangle tweezer detangling brush(9 bucks at target). I get the gel and run my hands flat along the sections (normally 3 per section of hair). Then i use the deranged brush to brush style the sections. When i finish the back doing the same method, i part 5 horizontal sections in the crown of my head and do the same thing. I like a side part so after i've styled my curls i work a side part. Then i go over with mousse with flat hands and scrunch. I get a cotton t shirt and scrunch the water out and then i blow dry my hair. I ride a bike to work and now work at an office job. When i ride my bike i claw clip my hair and wear a bandana to protect it from the wind and my hair lasts 5 days, albeit very frizzy on the last day. When i worked retail my hair only lasted a day lol.\n\nANYWAYS LOL \n\nthe first picture was a week ago and the second was two years ago. i'm so proud of myself. I was never taught how to style my hair as a kid and only learned when i moved out over the last few years. I was dying my hair very heavily at one point, split dye black and pink, until i realized how damaged my hair was; it could barely form a curl. I had finger curled my hair on the second picture but it looked so mangly but i was so proud in the moment. So i went all black but then the black faded on the side that was formerly pink, leaving that super light brown you see there. The light brown is only on the old pink side, so half of my head! The other half is the normal dark brown. But once i stopped dying my hair it became so healthy. I am a little overdue for a trim (i trim my own hair) but otherwise i think im doing great!!",

My father has always had a thick head of hair (so did I). Unfortunately though it seems I took after my maternal grandfather, who experienced severe hair loss in his 30's and 40's. (I share my hairline with him)\n\nThe trick is in catching it early. I noticed my hairline receding up on my temples, and severe thinning on the front. I legitimately tried but couldn't grow it back to full thickness. It was the weirdest thing. \n\nI also had hair loss up on my crown area, but not full balding. \n\nI began finastride in Fall of 2023. It completely stopped all hair loss for me, but I didn't see any significant regrowth. I also experimented a bit with minoxidil but I wasn't consistent with the application of it. I also have cats, and it's toxic to them so I stopped out of fear of them getting contaminated with it. \n\nI stopped finastride a few months back and began dutasteride and oral minoxidil. I've been seeing slight increase in thickness, and my hairline is still holding (I'm now 32). I've been able to hold on with maybe some very slight regrowth in thickness thanks to the treatment. \n\nNot sure where I would be on the Norwood scale currently. \n\nI'm hoping if I keep treatment up I can prevent any future hair loss from this point. I just know when I started, within a few months hair loss halted. \n\nIt just barely reversed, but at least it held. \n\nI think the key is in starting early, right when you start noticing it. I'm hoping for some future gains with my current treatment in the next year but I'd imagine I would be way worse off right now if I didn't begin treatment years back. \n\n*I also apply rosemary oil regularly at night time 3-5x a week.

      "content": "Hello! I just recently decided to try out curly look (instead of straightening). I went to curly hair hairdresser, who basically gave me a short course on how to handle curly hair. I haven't tried styling my hair myself and decided to try DIY flaxseed gel as a leave in product, because most bought ones have some kind of strong smell.\n\nHairdresser actually used mousse in my hair and said it is probably better than gel, because my hair is very fine. She also said I don't need deep moisturizing.\n\nSo, because I'm doing this for the first time, I'm a bit lost on how much I should use the flaxseed gel? I did observe the hairdresser, when she applied the mousse, but like she said, you don't really get that much product in your hair, because mousse has a lot of volume. So I'm unsure about the amount of gel that's needed. My hair is medium length (almost bra strap length when straight) and not very thick)\n\nHere's how I made the flaxseed gel: I just made a small portion, 1 cup or water and 2 tbl spoons of flaxseeds. Boiled for 12minutes, until it became a thick gel. Strained, cooled and  stored in fridge during the night.\n\nI'll try to style it as I was advised, so the routine will be: wash, use conditioner (neither is made for curly hair), rinse. Then \"comb\" through my hair with fingers (I don't have the curly hair brush yet) and put in the gel, scrunch it, then scrunch few times with the towel and I was told I can also leave the hair in towel for a while. And then I will just let it dry (won't use hair dryer).\n\nBut my main question is, how much gel should I use? Tablespoon, a few?\n\nThanks in advance for suggestions, it's a totally new topic for me!",

I’ve started on a 20mg dose for the first month, then went on 40mg for the second and now the third and the dermatologist is possibly thinking of increasing my dosage to 60mg (close to my body weight) for the next month.\n\nEven tho my acne/ folliculitis isn’t severe, it’s the fact the it occurs in everywhere from my face, shoulders, back, thighs and butt. One of my biggest insecurities is the scarring and the PIH that it leaves behind. Before starting accutane, I did try spot treating with hydroquinone 2% and 4% but that didn’t do much.\n\nHonestly I’m feeling really helpless and for this month, I started breaking out and if anything the PIH looks worse on the new breakouts and idk what I can do about it because I got told to not use actives. I did use a few over the counter products like a Kojic acid bar soap for showers, 10% glycolic acid body lotion and 10% azelaic acid on new spots.\n\nAny advice/ feedback will be very appreciated :/",

      "content": "I have 2b wavy hair and my hair is thin but i have a lot of it which seems to predispose it to being knotty therefore I ALWAYS use plenty of conditioner (if I don’t I literally can’t get a brush through it) and often use a detangling spray and a tangle teezer brush which usually means I can brush it without too much difficulty. I often let my hair air dry so rarely use heat. I get it cut and coloured every 8 weeks.\n\nHowever I am getting awful knots on top of my head in particular that are really difficult and horrible to brush out. I even tried brushing my hair with the conditioner in whilst showering yesterday and it was STILL knotty!\n\nI don’t understand as my hair seems to look in good condition apart from a bit of frizz which is normal for me. \n\nIt’s making me want to avoid having showers as a result, please help!
