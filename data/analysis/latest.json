Yeah so Tretinoin really does work if used according to your skins needs. (If you want to ask about peeling, then yes it peeled for first one year and now also it peels but significantly low peeling, and strangely the peeling kinda reduced when I jumped from 0.05% to 0.1%, so yeah it might take different durations for your skin to adapt to the peeling). If you have acne like me just know that tret can fix this, you just gotta trust the process.",

      "content": "My mustache is dark, and I've been getting thicker, more prominent hairs above my lip. I usually wax every couple of weeks, but it's painful. Also, it looks weird in the sun; all the hair above my lip will be completely gone, but I'll still have baby hairs all over my face.\n\nI've heard of dermaplaning, and while I know hair *allegedly* doesn't grow back thicker/darker from shaving, I have to disagree. I started shaving my happy trail area when I was a teenager because I thought you could see it. A couple of weeks of shaving, and then suddenly the hair was super dark and obviously thicker in the exact area that I shaved. My hair is naturally ash blonde, you can't really see my body hair like that so it was noticeable. \n\nThe same exact thing happened with my legs and my upper lip. I used not to shave the upper half of my legs because, again, ash blonde hair, I truly didn't need to. Well, in my early 20s, I started shaving the upper half, and then again, a couple of weeks later, the hairs started growing in much thicker and darker. I know that shaving doesn't create new follicles and that it can't change the pigmentation. I just genuinely don't understand how my hair *definitely* grows back thicker and darker. I swear I'm not crazy lol \n\n  \nAnyways, all of that to say that I know shaving apparently doesn't do what I've described and/or experienced. I have been told, despite my experience, that I'm wrong. So, will dermaplaning help my facial hair? Or will I truly fuck myself over, and I'll grow darker, thicker hair all over my face?\n\nI've also heard that there are more benefits to dermaplaning. Smoother skin, improved skincare absorption, exfoliation, it can help reduce the look of fine lines, etc. Is this actually true? \n\nCan someone who experiences hair growth like I do weigh in here?",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

      "content": "Hi all! The title is my current prescription - got it this morning from a dermatologist. This was my first time seeing this dermatologist or any dermat, and the process actually felt pretty rushed and I didnt have time to explain my concerns/reservations.\n\nI am a bit scared ab using either of these topical creams, partly because I wasnt struggling with acne up until 2.5 weeks before. I would get the occasional fungal acne that I use head and shoulders for and it worked. \n\nA little bit about me: I remember getting some acne when I was about 16 but idk what I did to clear it up. At this point I had started using some kind of milk soap that was drying but afair effective. Then when I was about 19 I used vitamin E on my face once and it broke me out. This prompted me to look into acne clearing \"natural\" products and I landed on this charcoal soap, that helped me quite a bit at the time. Even since then I have used that soap every day. When I was about 22, I started working out and drinking milk. This caused breakouts. But it healed by itself. I was probably still using the soap. In the recent years, I would get small acne only on my forehead and cleared up with head and shoulders.\n\nRecently, I started working out again. This time also taking whey. I started seeing small acne on my forehead and jaw, and thought it was fungal. So I applied head and shoulders and it worked for a bit until it stopped, mostly for the jaw. Now I have active breakouts on my jaw. \n\nWith this, I went to the dermatologist. My current routine invovles just the charcoal soap and BOJ sunscreen in the morning. The dermat didnt really ask for my routine, like I said. I am writing it here in case it matters. Anywho, so he has prescribed me the topical creams I wrote in the title of my post. Both every day. \n\nWhat do you all think? I understand that the dermat knows best, but i didn't get enough time with him. So I am looking for additional advice before I dive into the world of Tret! \n\nMy skin is p dry but im not sure if my barrier is compromised?\n\nCurrent pictures of my acne are attached for your reference! I turned 26 a month or so ago, if that also helps.",

      "content": "I am curious about how much we spend annually on upkeep and maintenance. I am older now, and I used to do the regular stuff (mani/pedi, tanning, highlights, etc), and I was curious about the costs nowadays.\n\n I am talking to the ladies who get routine (bi-weekly/monthly) cuts, color/highlights, mani/pedi, tanning (self-tanning included), lashes, extensions, facials/peels/microneedling, and waxing. I even budgeted in things like monthly massage, shopping (clothing, makeup, serums, hair products, styling tools), dental whitening, and gym memberships, as I consider those beauty, as well. The whole shebang! The only thing I am excluding is plastic surgery, but feel free to include it if you'd like!  \n\n\nI am blown away by the number I came up with, and I am wondering what is considered \"normal\" nowadays.\n\nLastly, I've noticed an online trend of women asking men to pay for these services. Not sure how true this is (as I said, I am older), but curious if there is any truth to this, and what they pay for, if you have someone else pay for these services. \n\nPlease: No hate in the comments. Everyone's budget and what they find important is different. Only love, please!\n\nIf this gets some traction, I will share my breakdown and the approximate cost I came up with in the comments later.",

I checked multiple online sources like curlscan, curlbot and AI and got mixed answers. Does anyone have the same hair concerns and knows if this acts as protein or not since it’s not hydrolyzed?  \n\nThe product I’m thinking to get is ecoslay Rice pudding conditioner for reference. \n\nI appreciate any recommendations 🙏",
