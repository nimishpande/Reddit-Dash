My curls feel way less frizzy in the morning now.\n\nPicture was taken 2 days after washing.\n\n**The Routine:**\n\n* **Wash:** Co-wash with **Hask Detangling Curl Care Conditioner**. I spend a good couple of minutes massaging the scalp to make sure it’s clean, then rinse.\n* Apply **Cantu Curl Cream** to soaking wet hair and scrunch them\n* **L**et it air dry\n* Once it’s completely bone-dry, I Scrunch Out The Crunch to get rid of the cast and make it soft.\n\nThanks to everyone in this community for the tips and the motivation to embrace the curls! I know it's a pretty basic routine and theres definitely space to improve but it works for me.",

Years of constant sun exposure without a lick of sunscreen has turned my visible skin (face/arms) a deep, dark black. The contrast is crazy because my inner body is still naturally white. It’s a \"perma-tan\" that’s been baked in for ten years.\nI’m also dealing with oily skin and deep acne scars. To be honest, I’m way too introverted and under-confident to go see a dermatologist in person right now. I want to try and fix this myself at home first while I start my New Year's resolution of getting physically active.\nMy Planned \"Starter Pack\":\n * Glycolic Acid\n * Vitamin C Serum\n * Kojic Acid\n * Sunscreen &amp; Moisturizer\nCan you guys help a brown brother out with some guidance?\n * The Routine: How do I actually use these? I’m clueless about what goes first and what shouldn't be mixed.\n * The \"Decade\" Factor: Since this is 10+ years of neglect, how long should I realistically wait to see my natural skin tone start to peek through?\n * The Scars: Will these products help with deep scarring, or am I wasting my time without professional help?\n * The \"Gym\" Factor: Since I'm starting to work out, when should I do this routine? Before or after the gym?\nI’m tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. Any advice or encouragement would mean the world. Thanks, guys.",

When I curl it with a wand or iron, I clip them in the curl position and leave that in for 30+ mins and then hair spray and then I brush them out and they fall straighter and frizzier then anything omg.\n4. I have tried overnight curls and brush out and they come out STRAIGHT AND FRIZZY.\n5. My hair is SUPER tangly at all times. Like genuinely I could brush it and then wait 10 seconds and brush it again and I will get tension. I have tried a few detanglers, I use Olaplex, etc.\n\nBasically, my hair looks minimally voluminous but overall not glossy at all (even when I add Kerastase night serum, or leave in conditioner, or oil!) and super frizzy and weird poofy straight.

      "content": " Help a brown brother out: Yo everyone, I’m making this post because 2026 is the year I finally stop hiding and get my life together.\nI’ve spent more than a decade being completely negligent with my skin. Years of constant sun exposure without a lick of sunscreen has turned my visible skin (face/arms) a deep, dark black. The contrast is crazy because my inner body is still naturally white/fair. It’s a \"perma-tan\" that’s been baked in for ten years.\nI’m also dealing with oily skin and deep acne scars. To be honest, I’m way too introverted and under-confident to go see a dermatologist in person right now. I want to try and fix this myself at home first while I start my New Year's resolution of getting physically active.\nMy Planned \"Starter Pack\":\n * Glycolic Acid\n * Vitamin C Serum\n * Kojic Acid\n * Sunscreen &amp; Moisturizer\nCan you guys help a brown brother out with some guidance?\n * The Routine: How do I actually use these? I’m clueless about what goes first and what shouldn't be mixed.\n * The \"Decade\" Factor: Since this is 10+ years of neglect, how long should I realistically wait to see my natural skin tone start to peek through?\n * The Scars: Will these products help with deep scarring, or am I wasting my time without professional help?\n * The \"Gym\" Factor: Since I'm starting to work out, when should I do this routine? Before or after the gym?\nI’m tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. Any advice or encouragement would mean the world. Thanks, guys.",

I was introduced to these creams recently when my mom showed me her La Roch Posay 2 x barrier repair cream and she and a dermatologist introduced this as a moisturizer. I tried it because my barrier is compromised a little from....going to the sun without sunscreen and using too much serum on my face than the amount asked twice a day....and washing my face with hot water. I tried it and I felt no real deep moisture, in fact it just seemed to be sitting on top of my skin but only on the top layer, inside I still felt dry. So I added more...bad idea La Roch Posay is very thick and rich that it broke me out. So I wanted to try maybe the Korean skincare angle and look for a face moisturizer there. I was recommended another barrier repair cream. I tried it yesterday and sure enough the same thing happened. Well no actually this one just disappeared. My skin still feels like it needs a little more moisture under it and it did nothing for my under eyes. In the end so far it seems that any moisturizer advertised as barrier repair is a below average moisturizer that is only there to repair a damaged barrier but not actually moisturize much of anything. Am I wrong? Maybe I'm using it wrong. Is it like a treatment that you have to wait a month for results? Maybe you use it on damp skin, not dry? How do these work? ",

      "content": "Can anyone share their experience with DPN removal and aftercare? I’m on Day 6 after getting them cauterized and the healing process seems slow and I wonder if I’m doing something wrong with the aftercare.\n\nI only had a few removed to test out the process, but they were larger and raised and maybe that’s the issue? For aftercare, my derm recommended gentle cleanser twice per day and to moisturize with vaseline until the scabs fall off, only switching over to sunscreen once the skin is healed. After the appointment, the areas started to darken later that day which I expected but they haven't formed a hard scab yet and it's been almost a week. Each dpn lesion has been swollen and a bit red. No sign of anything drying out due to the vaseline. I’m only using a thin layer, but wonder if I should switch back to using my normal gel moisturizer which is lighter (Vanicream daily moisturizer).\n\nNot sure whether it’s better to keep the area very moisturized with an occlusive like vaseline vs let it to dry out a bit so that full scabbing can start. If anyone has any advice or experiences, would really appreciate it. Thanks!",

I feel like the reason why is my routine, which goes like this: As I Am rosemary shampoo, and run it through my hair loosely and scrub scalp, As I am rosemary conditioner, and loosely let it through my hair, and then wash through and air dry, and i think this loose washing is leading to the mildew, but if i rake my hands through my hair, it makes my hair frizzy and pulls apart the curls. Does anyone know what I’m doing wrong or if my hair is healthy/how i can treat it better? Thank you so much.\n\nSorry for crap picture quality, I used what I have\n\n(Slide 3 is how it looks when fully clarified)",

So far I’ve been told to keep everything totally dry, switch to beeswax lip balm, eat more vitamin C, and switch toothpaste brands. I’ve tried using diaper rash cream (which is my usual go-to for things like pimples) but it doesn’t help much. Does anyone have any experience or product recommendations? I live in a cold and humid country. Thank you so much 💙",

I've been using Aveda Invati that I purchased on sale, and while it's clearly high quality, it's also incredibly expensive...especially now that it's no longer on sale. That being the case, I'm looking for another natural shampoo and conditioner that work well for people with thinning hair. I will add the disclaimer that I'm well aware no shampoo or conditioner actually treat hair loss. That's not what I'm asking here. I just need a good natural (i.e., no SLS, etc.) shampoo and conditioner that aren't egregiously expensive but that are specifically formulated for thinning hair. If they add noticeable volume and fullness that's great, but most important are the ingredients and overall quality. I realize every scalp is different so opinions are subjective, but it would be great to have some recommendations. Yes, I have looked through the wiki and tried to do other research in this sub. There are just so many products out there, new ones come out all the time and old favorites are sadly prone to formula changes, so any recommendations to help narrow the field would be much appreciated!",
