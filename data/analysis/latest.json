      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

No burn, no tingle.\n\nI thought the formulas had gone weak, so I tested both with pH strips.\nThe glycolic toner still shows pH ~3.5–4, and the peel gives that classic low-pH orange/red edge that strong acids normally show.\n\nSo the formulas are absolutely fine.\n\nThat’s when the concept of barrier adaptation made total sense.\n\nHere’s what actually happens:\n\nYour barrier gets stronger with consistent use. Early stinging is normal, but long-term users often stop feeling it.\n\nIf your routine already includes other actives (like lactic acid, vitamin C, glycolic masks), you’re already exfoliating → less reaction.\n\nMore hydration = less sting. Moisturizers, snail mucin, hyaluronic sunscreen all buffer acids naturally.\n\nHealthy skin doesn’t scream. Once your barrier is stable and non-irritated, acids feel mild regardless of pH.\n\nStinging is not a measurement of effectiveness. pH + concentration determine performance, not sensation.\n\nTL;DR:\nIf your acids stop stinging, it usually means your skin has adapted — not that the products lost strength.",

Do I use it after EVERY single shower? Even if that's twice a day?\n\n2. Do I moisturise EVERYTHING such as bum cheeks, boobs, arms, legs, shoulders, back(???), tummy, hips etc? Or do I only moisturise dry areas such as arms, legs, knees? \n\n3. Do I need to be completely dry after the shower and before putting on the lotion or shall I leave some moisture on my skin?\n\n4. How long should a regular tub last me? I feel that even with half assed lotioning I'm going through a tub too fast. Am I putting too much lotion?\n\nThanks everyone 🙏 ",

Easy to blend. Might pill if you layer too many products or use a thick/matte moisturizer underneath it. I skip moisturizer when I use it.\n\nWhite Cast : Low to None\n\nFragrance : None\n\nBest Suited for : All skin types except for oily. I have combination acne-prone skin and it did not break me out.\n\nSweat proof : No (Check out the unwind version)\n\nEye sensitivity : No stinging\n\nPrice : 599 but you can get it under 300 for 50 grams\n\nProtection : 7/10, gives decent protection. Better than a lot of gimmicky sunscreens, but there are better ones out there. \n\nReapplication : Easy to re-apply but definitely feels heavy.\n\nMy experience: \n\nI mainly use it for indoors for two reasons :\n\n1. It works like moisturiser + sunscreen in one. I skip moisturizer as it is quite moisturising.\n\n2. Two fingers’ worth feels heavy on me, and makes me sweat and makes my face look a little dull. So for indoors I apply less amount and it works fine.\n\n\nBeen using it for about a year now. Earlier this was the only sunscreen I used, but I did notice slight tanning with outdoor sun exposure (even with 2 fingers worth). My only real issue is that it feels more like a moisturizer with an SPF, which works on most days but once you get tanned it’s hard to reverse, especially with the UV index in summers. For indoor, it does the job.\n\nVerdict : Would repurchase for indoor use only.",

      "content": "I would say I’m a mix of 2C-3A as I do have coils but some of my hair is waves(?) maybe due to damage, I have a lot of volume and a thick head of hair. I have a bob shaped layering on the top then a long bottom almost like a jellyfish, I’ve tried to get it thinned out but it grows back 10x thicker.\n\nMy dad is half black/mixed so I think that’s where I get my hair texture from, it’s more loose then his but his was a tighter 3A/B.\n\nThe second photo is my best example of how thick and big it is, a lot of these are cropped because of my face but it doesn’t even cover how big my hair is irl. It’s also just after I washed it and dried without products or brushing so it looks very  thick and dense, ( basically knotted/tangled ).\n\nI use curl smith mostly and cantu for my shower products. I’ve heard pattern and bounce curl are good but I’m unsure whether to purchase.\n\nI have box dyed my hair and bleached it around 3-2 times. I like my volume but I wish my hair was slightly more defined as the week goes on my hair gets more and more wavy or just puffy. The front stays intact but the back looks a mess 😭,\n\nIt’s extremely dense as well and barely absorbs water unless it get sprayed down completely, it soaks up any liquid completely if that helps with defining qualities of my hair. I don’t wash my hair often. Usually over a week I wait as I can get away with just spraying some curl refresher on it ( 7-8 days is how long I wait in between washes)\n\nI use a bonnet to sleep in and just shove my hair in and refresh it with water mixed with leave in curl cream. \n\nAny help or tips would be greatly appreciated, I really want my hair to be more defined but still voluminous. As I want my curls to show off more rather than my big frizzy poof. Thank u &lt;3\n\nRoutine- \n1. Curl smith shampoo and loose cantu curl cream \n2. Drugstore curl mousse i scrunch in after half air drying\n3. Diffuse \n4. sleep in bonnet ",
