      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi everyone, posting here hopefully to hear if someone had a similar experience or for advice. \n\nI’ve been growing my hair for a year… and was feeling good about it.. but then I went for a cut requesting only a small amount (1/4 inch) be taken off only the top layer and I completely froze. The stylist was moving/talking very quickly and used a razor on my hair to “debulk (my hair is not thick)…. I’ve had bad hair cut experiences in the past and I was traumatized and frozen… I couldn’t speak up to ask her to stop. She wound up taking off so much hair. I knew I didn’t want to use a razor on my hair but I was frozen.\n\nMy hair is 2b/2c and 3a in some places. It is feels very frizzy, coarse, and thin from the razor now. The internal layering has left shorter pieces all over the place and my hair doesn’t clump like it used to. It falls almost entirely straight in places now. \n\nI have to finger coil it over my entire head for it to even look kind of ok. I use Innersense shampoo and conditioner, Innersense Sweet Spirit leave in conditioner at ends and mid lengths and K18 mask every other week (routine). Air dry only, diffuser makes it fall straight (styling). Protein makes it fall flat so the coarseness is the only thing contributing to volume. The look of it isn’t bothering me as much as the feeling of it (though still don’t like the look at all). It feels so coarse and rough that I am very uncomfortable. She said she wasn’t going to take any significant length off the top layers but they ended up almost 3-4 inches shorter in some places. I’m still trying to grow it long so I don’t know what to do in the interim about the change in texture and thinness. \n\nIf anyone has advice on steps to take while growing it out, I’d love to hear. If this has happened to someone else, I wonder how long it took to grow out? I am wanting to grow it out so that it is very low maintenance. I used to be able to just comb it and walk out the door. Now it takes hours to do anything with it.\n\nPictures are: \n\n1. Current after 3 months growth (after finger coiling, trying really hard to style)\n2. Post haircut \n3. Pre haircut ",

My eyelids look dry and scaly with eyeshadow.\n\n\nColor correction is a temporary solution, but I want a more long lasting solution.

Tret advice… (UK)\n\nI’ve been using their subscription service for almost 2 years and have worked up to 0.01 tretinoin probably mixed in with azelaic acid and a bunch of other filler stuff… I landed up with excess product and took a very small break after developing perioral dermatitis after a 38c blistering heat visit to Berlin. I spoke to them about this and after it settled down they were happy with me to continue to prescription.\n\nRecently, I went to login to my account to see when my next delivery date was and I had to do the full consultation (like you do when you firestorm join) and they said they couldn’t give my prescription anymore; no reason, zilch. I’ve tried getting some info out of them but they are non-responsive.\n\nI can’t just stop 0.01 tret suddenly!? Using it has meant for the first time in my life I’ve not had cystic acne since I was 12 (I’m 45!). \n\nTo be honest, I’m completely terrified as to what’s going to happen to my skin. \n\nI’ve had a light research into products from India but I’d appreciate any guidance. \n\nI’m also interested in Tazorac cream and if my skin tolerates tret with no issues, is this something I could try? Is azeliac acid something I could combine it with?\n\nMy skincare routine is flawless (I have OCD so the thought of not incorporating the tret in there is giving me genuine anxiety). I use Curel products (double cleanse/ essence, moisturiser/ ceramide spray/ SPF 50 for day).\n\nNot asking for medical diagnosis, just looking for people with similar experiences or routine suggestions. Will speak to GP\n\nHelp a stressed gal out! Thank you 🙌🏻\n\n",

While I've gotten better at it, I'm still not getting the definition that I want, and I'm still getting some frizz. I can't seem to get bantu knots tied. I tried doing finger coils but it took forever and seemed to pull my hair more straight. I also can't seem to keep the stray curls up (no volume) so it's constantly getting behind my glasses and in my eyes. I guess I'm a 3A with some tighter curls and some waviwr strands. But I'm not really certain. Any advice is welcome. \n\nMy routine:\n- sleep in a silk night cap\n- wash and condition with Pantene Bouncles\n- shake out the water and pat dry with a microfiber  towel\n- detangle with fingers and add Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Leave in Conditioner\n- scrunch and spritz with OGX nourishing + coconut oil\n- air dry\n\nI've tried using a diffuser but it seems to lead to more frizz than air drying. I've also tried various curl defining creams including Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Cream and OUAI Curl Creme. But the weight of the creams seems to pull my curls down into something more wavy. Gel and mousse seem to leave too much crunch and pull the hair down like defining cream.",

      "content": "My mom (64f) and I went Black Friday shopping and she was targeting by a guy at a kiosk selling skincare. The brand was called Cb Gardn. As I was taking bags to the car he got her in the store. It was called “Beelive” in Niles, Ohio. I get there and they talk her into this free 10 minute facial. She tried to tell them no.. she didn’t want her makeup removed. Guy said he’d just do her neck. I told her I’d run over to American Eagle and she can meet me there. I finished my shopping in AE and went back to this store. It had been about 40 minutes by this time. She had this slop on her face and this guy was instructing her on how to use this red light thing to help reduce puffiness under the eyes and fill in deeper lines and wrinkles.\n\nMy mom is normally really good at saying no, but these guys were so aggressive and she’s been so self conscious of her aging face lately. She was 100% targeted.\n\nSide note: something weird about this store… it was called “Beelive” and there was all this product and literature about honey but they weren’t pushing anything with honey.\n\nAfter selling her on the entire eye system for over $400, they started working her for the face system. He tries to tell her it’s worth over $11k bc of the red light devices. When she says she can’t afford that he miraculously can drop the price to $5k. My spidey senses were tingling. When she said she couldn’t do $5k at once he agrees to a payment plan, but if she changed her mind she could bring it back within 5 days. She sets up an affirm plan on her debit card. This proves to be a good thing.\n\nWe get home and it’s instant buyers remorse. I email. I text. Mom calls. Finally connect. He says sure go ahead, bring it back. I get to the mall, which is a solid 35-40 mins from my house, and he proceeds to tell me there’s no returns because it’s a medical device and points to this notice on the back of the check out counter that says “no returns”. It definitely wasn’t there 5 days prior. Everything was still in shrink wrap. I knew my mom would be pissed. He tried to convince me that my dad needed to go with my mom to get this included facial so he could convince him it was a good investment for my mom. Eye freaking roll.\n\nMy mom calls the guy the next day and she’s popping off on him. When he doesn’t relent, she hangs up on him. She texted him the following day and his response was “who’s this?” She gets off the phone and looks at me and says “I’ll call the bank and report fraud on my card. That’ll cancel the payment plan.” Unfortunately they already took a payment even though he said it’d be 30 days.\n\nI think we’re going to go to mall management and let them know these guys are scamming people, but I’d like more to go on than our experience. Has anyone out there experienced something like this? Has anyone out there dealt with this company? Is there anyone else I can report these guys to so they can be held accountable for this unscrupulous business practice? I feel so dumb.",

I’ve come a lot way (tried every skincare routine, medication, diet, lifestyle changes), but have been left with scarring, pigmentation and clogged pores/ closed comedones (?) that I have been able to get rid of.  I’m really glad I don’t have many active breakouts anymore, but when I do they scar badly and stay red for weeks. \n\nWhat should I be doing? Are in office treatments necessary (laser/microneedling) to help? \n\nCurrent routine below as of the last ~6 weeks. I stopped using any actives bc my skin was always oily and getting so many small bumps and did a lot of research in these threads (tysm) to find the best products.

      "content": "Tried 5 different products and **still no glow**? Still breaking out even after \"**doing everything right**\"? Most people think the problem is the product....\n\nBut, often, the real issue is: you're using *products* meant for the ***wrong skin type***.\n\nSound familiar? Let's fix that today, safely &amp; scientifically.\n\n**1. The #1 Pillar of safe skincare: know your real skin type**  \nYour skin decides almost everything:\n\n* Which moisturisr nourishes you (or clogs you)\n* Which actives you can tolerate (or burn you)\n* Which ingredient will help or hurt\n* Why certain products break you out instantly\n* Accept or reject gel texture or creamy products in Indian weather\n\n**Memory bank:** **W**rong type + **W**rong product = **W**asted ₹^(+no result)\n\n**2. Understand the 3 pillars of your skin: A framework**\n\n* Skin type: Your baseline = oily, dry, sensitive, resistant\n* Skin condition:  Your temporary state = dehydrated, inflamed, flaky\n* Skin concern: Issues needing focus = acne-prone, redness, lifestyle issues that would need a safe &amp; fast path forward by medical professional, not social media guesswork.\n\n**Memory bank:** Type = **Baseline** **|** Condition = **State** **|** Concern = **Focus**\n\n**3. The science-based way to find your real skin type**\n\nI use the Baumann Skin Typing System, created by Dr. Leslie Baumann, MD, FAAD is a Board-Certified Dermatologist, educator, researcher and NYT bestselling author. She created a validated framework with 16 distinct precise skin types.\n\nDr. Baumann kindly gave permission for me to reference her patented system for this community. It is one of the most structured, dermatologist developed &amp; referenced framework to understand your skin type. In my opinion it's one of the best starting map.\n\nDr. Baumann, from India, **Dhanyawaad**.\n\n**Step 1: Safe, simple plan to find your real skin type**\n\n* Search SkinTypeSolutions Quiz; take the quiz\n* It will show a recommended routine, just learn from the structure\n* **Share** your skin type below &amp; comment if it actually feels accurate\n* Repeat the quiz at the start of each season\n* Your skin's behaviour in Chennai humidity is not the same in Delhi winters\n* When you know your skin type, you'll be empowered to see through the *marketing hype*\n\n**Step 2: Observe your skin like a scientist, it talks to you daily**  \nIndia's climate changes fast, your skin gives clues faster:\n\n* Oil patterns: Where do you get shine? When?\n* Sensitivity: What stings, burns or flakes?\n* Hydration: Skin feels tight, flaky or rough after washing?\n* Weather reaction: Humid monsoon, dry winter, excess pollution or UV\n\n**Memory bank:** **W**atch your skin, **I**nterpret signals, **N**avigate products  = **WIN** at Skincare.\n\n**Takeaway:** Products aren't magical, don't put them on a pedestal. They only work **if they match your skin's baseline (type)**. Once you get that right, everything else in skincare falls into place. You will start to focus on the mechanism of your skin rather than the ***popularity of a product***.\n\nA heartfelt thank you ❤️ to all who shared their skin type on my prelude post \"***Share your skin type. Let's see what this community looks like!***\" your responses helped shape this instalment.\n\nSo, next time when someone on Reddit asks you your skin type, you'll know exactly how to reply back.\n\nMe? I'm a **DRPW**  \n*Dry, Resistant, Pigmented, Wrinkle-prone with no condition or concern* \\- any recs? 😉\n\nBon SkinVoyage!\n\n**Missed previous knowledge, FOMO?**  \n**Search** this community for *Healthy Skin 101*:  \n*Which SPF fact surprised you the most in your skincare journey?*  \n*SPF &amp; PA explained? A simple guide for beginners.*\n\n**Coming soon:** The most important part of skincare you've never been taught. **Stay tuned.**",

I was on Accutane at a younger age, but not for long enough and going back on it is an absolute last resort for personal reasons. \n\nFor awhile now, I just haven't touched my skin. No cleanser, no moisturizer, rarely any makeup and micellar water to take it off when I do wear it. Yet, I still have acne in the form of small white heads and a lot of redness, dryness, dullness and overall unhappy skin. I'm mostly looking for a moisturizer I can tolerate before I branch out into cleaners. \n\nI've discovered that I react poorly to hyaluronic acid, squalane, niacinamide, salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide. It sucks. Everything I've tried recently (which is really just vanicream and cera ve, only moisturizers) has broken me out and given me angry, stubborn pimples. I'm too scared to branch out and try other things because I'm tired of the acne and I'm at my wits end, and I'm nervous about seeing a dermatologist who may just suggest products I know won't work. Is there absolutely anything anyone can think of that may help me out?",
