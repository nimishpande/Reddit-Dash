I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "late 20s skincare routine advice\n\nI just turned 28 at the beginning of January and I fear my skin is really starting to show it. \n\nI grew up with pretty acne prone skin but have gotten it under control over the past few years. During covid I struggled badly with deep painful cystic acne on my cheeks from wearing a mask, so I’m always afraid of that coming back. I’m proud of my skins clarity and overall evenness, but there’s a few things I’m struggling with.\n\nI’ve reacted terribly to retinol in the past, like wrecked my skin for multiple years and left me with months of scarring, so I’m a bit scared to try it again, but I’m ready to try something new. My routine is pretty simple and basic.\n\nI’d say my biggest concerns are:\n\n\\\\- fine lines on my forehead (I believe these are expression lines but I’ve been told by a facialist she thinks these are dehydration lines?)\n\n\\\\- fine lines near my eyes\n\n\\\\- larger visible pores and texture on my forehead, cheeks, and nose\n\n\\\\- dark under eyes and puffiness in the morning\n\nThis is my current routine:\n\nAM: \n\nRinse face with cold water\n\nMad hippie vitamin c serum\n\nFarmacy honey milk hydrating essence \n\nAveeno calm &amp; restore redness relief moisturizing cream\n\nPM:\n\nWash face with Farmacy whipped greens\n\nFarmacy honey milk hydrating essence\n\nAveeno calm &amp; restore redness relief moisturizing cream\n\nCerave healing ointment under eyes &amp; on forehead\n\nFrownies patches 2-3x a week (don’t use ointment when I use frownies!)\n\nThings I’ve considered/have been recommended:\n\nRed light\n\nAzelaic acid\n\nUnder eye creams\n\nRetinol\n\nBotox? \n\nBut I don’t want to try too much and overwhelm my skin!

With the routine I have now, the roots end up looking really piece-y and stick up at odd angles, which makes me feel like my hair looks messy and greasy. Back when I was not doing a wavy routine, the hair came out of my scalp at lower angles, and it didn’t look sectiony or piecey at the roots. \n\nAny advice on how to remedy this? \n\nCurrent routine:\n- herbal essences volumizing shampoo (roots) and conditioner (mids and ends) in the shows, detangle with brush/comb as I rinse out the conditioner\n- section wet hair, rake through kinky curly curling custard, and style with curl defining brush (I’ve had similar results with multiple sectioning techniques. 1 is sectioning hair into front/middle/back and styling upside down. 2 is sectioning hair into top/left side/right side and styling right side up; with the top section I brush the hair upwards and let the clumps fall down towards the back of my head. Both create similar issues with the piecey and weird-angled roots)\n- apply aussie curl like mousse with praying hands and scrunch with cotton tshirt\n- diffuse leaning forward and tilting to the side; hover diffuse roots until sorta dry and then diffuse the rest of the hair until cast has formed and hair is sorta dry\n- let air dry the rest of the way and then SOTC ",

      "content": "I'm 34 years old and have had oily skin all my life, and I still deal with acne (so freaking annoying). I live in Texas with a very dry climate and I work in an office with dry air. I have invested in a humidifier though and it does help.\n\nMy skin is very prone to dehydration and now that I'm in the aging phase of life, I'm looking to make sure I'm properly taking care of my skin.\n\nEverywhere I go, people on Reddit, YouTube, etc. are always recommending to fix dehydrated skin with skincare ingredients like ceramides, fatty acids, cholesterol, and oil content. The biggest recommended products being Illiyoon (their cream mostly) and the skin 1004 pro bio cica ampoule and the ample n ceramide ampoule.\n\nHere's the issue, all of those products caused me to break out.\n\nThe Illiyoon cream has canola oil in the ingredients list which is a trigger, the skin 1004 has niacinamide and so does the ample n. My skin HATES niacinamide.\n\nThere was a point I got so desperate, I went to my local store and got the Cerave in the tub. Worst mistake ever because not only was that heavy on my skin, but it made my skin texture worse (and caused breakouts, go figure).\n\n**My biggest concern:** I have a decent skincare routine, but there's no ceramide or lipids in my routine so I'm worried my skin might be lacking some barrier repair.\n\n**So my main question is:** have any of you successfully repaired your skin barrier without ceramides, fatty acids, or lipids? And if so, how long did it take?\n\nFor reference on what I use, here is my current skincare routine:\n\nAM:\n\n* Wash face with only water\n* Wipe face gently with naturie hatomugi on a toner pad\n* Apply RL dokdo toner with hands\n* Skin 1004 poremizing ampoule\n* Aloe gel\n* Angel aqua moisture cream\n* SPF\n\nPM:\n\n* Double cleanse with cleansing oil and BOJ green plum cleanser\n* Apply aloe gel in a thick layer on skin after shower to help retain moisture\n* (Dry my hair, do body care, etc.)\n* Wash excess aloe off and then mist face with thermal spring water\n* Apply RL dokdo toner with hands\n* Purito deep sea water serum\n* Skin 1004 poremizing ampoule\n* Aloe gel\n* Angel aqua moisture cream (but in a thicker layer than I would in the morning)\n\n**Other skincare that I don't do daily;** on the weekends I'll apply a sheet mask for extra hydration and what I typically do is the \"wet dressing\" method. I do my skincare routine like normal in the evening but I apply the aloe in a THICK layer and then place the sheet mask on top. This prevents the hydration from escaping and then I top it off with the angel aqua cream.",

I had a hunch when I tried a specific conditioner for curly hair years ago (pic1) but ive been dye-ing my hair for 7-8 yrs and just straightening any wavy strands. My friend encouraged me to use shea moisture enhancing curl cream with water in a spray bottle, after seeing my hair wave/curl up when wet, to see if it does something but I dont think it worked? It made my hair wavy ish (pic 2 - wet hair) but it was stringy and pattern is all over the place when its dried after plopping + diffusing (pics 3-8). What am I doing wrong/not doing for my type of hair? Or am I just delulu &amp; forcing my hair to be something it isnt?\n\n Everyone I know has 3c-4c hair, I dont have anyone who has the same hair type as me so im not sure how to “fix” my curl pattern or even curl train(?) my hair. Some recommendations on a proper routine/product would be appreciated!!\n\nCurrent routine (as of last week):\n\n\\- l’oreal paris everpure moisturizer color safe shampoo\n\n\\- tre semme paris color safe conditioner\n\n\\- shea moisture curl enhancing cream (diluted)\n\n\\- WOW xtra large volumizer mousse",

I just feel like its so stringy on the ends (especially when its curly) but I don't want to straighten it either. \n\nThis is my hair after routine washing with Loreal shampoo/conditioner, then using Kitsch Air dry cream and letting it air dry. My hair is ALWAYS dry and I can't seem to EVER get rid of the frizz. I've tried so many products and nothing seems to help. I compared my hair to a picture of it from last year and just can't stop wanting to get it cut short for how thin it looks now.\n\nAny tips or similar stories?",

Looking for advice from anyone who’s dealt with this.\n\nHeyyy since the start of December I’ve noticed my hair getting greasy a lot faster than usual. I used to be able to go a minimum of 3–4 days without it looking even a bit greasy, but now I can barely make it to the next day without looking like I’ve dunked my head in a bucket of oil.\n\nI’ve also lost a LOT of volume and my hair has become pin-straight?! I’ve always had “frizzy” hair that I used to hate, but now I’m crying for the volume I used to have…\n\nI stopped using conditioner and hair masks a month ago and have been using the most basic shampoo, thinking the conditioner and all the hair care I put on my hair before/after showering were the problem, but nothing has changed. My hair keeps getting greasy after a day and it’s driving me crazy.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? If so, what helped you manage it? I’d really appreciate any tips or advice.",
