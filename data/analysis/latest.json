      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have not really posted here before, but about 1,5 years ago I read on here that spearmint could work for hormonal acne. I was suffering from pretty bad post pill acne so I wanted to get rid of it! I ordered some spearmint capsules. I took one a day.\n\nLong story short. My skin improved. But unknowingly, i began to feel worse and worse. Shortly after starting I wrote in my diary that I felt \"kinda flat like being on the pill again\". Which at the time I did not connect to the mint.\n\nOver the last year I developed hormonal issues like heavy periods, painful periods, spotting, low libido, crying spells, insomnia, brain fog and just an overal awfull luteal phase (pmdd symptoms).\n\nWhen looking for solutions online, I FINALLY read somwhere (I think on this subreddit!) that my estrogen dominance issues could have been caused by the spearmint! I quit immediately and felt sooo bad for putting my body through this.\n\nSo now I've quit 1,5 months ago, and my skin is as perfect as it will ever be. There is some more facial and body hair (same as when I quit the oral birth control pill). The spotting is gone.\n\nBut I still dont feel like myself again. My libido has not yet recovered and my mood is also wacky.\n\nSo why this post? For two reasons\n\n1. to warn future users about the possible side effects and to support people who are looking for their symptoms online and haven't found the connection yet\n2. to connect with people who experienced the same, because i feel really alone in this.\n\nWho else experienced this, and how long did it take you to feel better?\n\nThanks so much in advance for any replies",

      "content": "Hello skincare addicts, sharing my journey with skin, expectations, and a bit of self-realization.\nI’m 38M. For most of my life, skincare simply wasn’t something I thought about. No proper routine, no sunscreen, and very little attention to skin health overall.\nMy work later required long hours outdoors, often sunrise to night, several days a week, for a few years. Constant sun exposure, dust, and heat gradually took a toll on my skin and hair. At the time, I didn’t really notice because it was just part of the job.\nIn 2022, a small incident made me pause and look at myself more closely. I happened to really observe my skin in the mirror for the first time in years and realized how much sun damage, tanning, and uneven pigmentation had built up over time. That was the moment I started thinking seriously about skincare.\nAround 2024, I began following skincare discussions on Reddit and social media. Seeing people’s progress motivated me to improve my own skin.\nBut enthusiasm quickly turned into overdoing things.\nI started buying almost every product people recommended, serums, creams, actives without fully understanding what suited my skin. I ended up with more products than I could realistically finish, and mixing things randomly actually irritated my skin instead of helping.\nI did consult a dermatologist and was given a basic routine, but I kept getting distracted by new recommendations instead of sticking to consistency.\nRecently, after learning more about skincare fundamentals and setting realistic expectations,\nI accepted a few important things:\nSkincare takes time and consistency matters more than product quantity.\nYears of sun exposure won’t reverse quickly.\nGenetics determine baseline skin tone, chasing fairness isn’t realistic.\nHealthy, comfortable skin should be the goal, not lighter skin.\nThat realization simplified things for me mentally.\nNow I follow a minimal routine: cleansing, moisturizing, sunscreen, and patience. No product hoarding, no rushing, just steady care. Honestly, this approach feels much better both physically and mentally.\nStill learning and open to advice, I’d genuinely appreciate constructive feedback or shared experiences.\n\nAlso, these are the products I currently have not including the ones already in use or the ones I’ve finished.\n\nTL;DR\nIgnored skincare for years → sun damage → product overload → irritated skin → reality check. Now keeping it simple and focusing on healthy skin, not fairness.",

Normally I don’t mind frizz at all and think it adds character, but it’s been excessive, so I’ve been finger coiling more and it definitely helps tame everything better.\n\nOverall, this routine has made a noticeable difference in how my curls look and feel, especially with volume and frizz control.

My hair is puffy, curly, and a bit coarse. If someone could help, I would be eternally grateful. I don't want to chop it off lol, but I have never had someone to help or guide. If you can let me know and I'll send the picture of my hair. I'll post one here, but everyday it changes it's attitude. But always naturally parts in a way that covers my face almost completely.\n\nMy current routine is every 2-3 days using head and shoulders shampoo, tressemme strength conditioner. Sometimes I will add Coconut oil, but I always use Cantu curling cream and the leave in conditioner.\n\nI just let my hair air dry after squeezing out the excess water and towel drying. As far as night protection, I just use silk pillow covers, because no matter what I do my hair always wants to knot.",

Their hair grows. It’s called science. You didn’t invent evolution.\n\nLet’s talk about your lack of common sense - you aren’t even a brand that specializes in children. What was the reason you used an infant in an advertisement, in order to have parents feel that their child is growing at an unacceptable rate?\n\nThis isn’t marketing, it’s desperation and to do so using an innocent infant.\n\nShould you, instead of using infants to gain emotional sympathy, focus your time on developing a solid product for adults? You already have a damaged reputation.\n\nSome brands really will stoop to any level to sell.",

      "content": "Hi, I need advice and help!\n\nI've been struggling with acne for a few looong months now (I've never had acne like this before) and I can't help myself anymore...\n\nIt started with slightly red pimples appearing on my face - that's when I went to a beautician for the first time with the idea of ​​recommending cosmetics - she recommended a set from skin1004, so I bought it with the idea that it would help me, but the opposite was true and these cosmetics completely ruined my skin barrier...\n\nlater I took matters into my own hands, started researching and so I bought LRP - effaclar, later toleriane (which I've been using so far, but it doesn't seem to be doing me that well, I don't know...)\n\nand then baume b5 (it helped me with inflamed areas, repaired my barrier, but at the same time it clogged my pores, so comedones formed).\n\nI also tried cosmetics from Avené (it was horrible), then Purito cream (also completely wrong...)\n\nMy acne, inflammation and comedones were getting worse. At that moment I found the LRP Baume b5 (which I mentioned before) and after this time (closed comedones) I made an appointment with a qualified cosmetologist for an examination. The cosmetics she recommended were great at first, but after a month the barrier repair cream started to close my comedones (again😔) and every time I put on the cream (a pea-sized amount) I felt like I had a thick mask on my face.\n\nand now? my face is still back at the beginning of this whole journey - closed comedones, red spots and acne... I don't know what to do next and what's wrong.\n\nIn the last days, I do research and lot of people (influencers) recommend - neutrogena hydro boost water gel - This is such a terrible cream - it made me even worse than before...\n\nI hope I have described my situation at least a little bit clearly… 🥹\n\nI am already desperate that everything that seemed good will soon do the complete opposite… everything what is ,,non-comedogenic” is for me like hell…\n\nthe only thing I noticed is that in the past I used more natural brands (and they don't hurt me at all - they suited me) although when a pimple appeared - they didn't do anything to it, but they didn't hurt either…\n\nwhat brand of cosmetics would you recommend? I have oily, but now also dry skin in some places, sensitive…\n\nwhen I was looking at the brands, I really liked medik8 cosmetics, do you have any experience with it?? It seemed it can be better than LRP\n\nThank you to everyone who read this far! I appreciate every single comment!🌸✨",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

They also told me the root couldnt go as dark as I wanted it to because they bleached it, although ive never had that problem before. The inspo pic is number 5. They told me is was very doable, but then when it didnt turn out like that they were like oh its because we've gone from blue to red. I asked repeatedly beforehand if they cant do that let's do a dark red to neutralise and we can do the fashion colours another time and they assured me it was doable. Also the condition is awful.

After the second or first day of washing, it usually straightens out.     \n\nMy current routine; \n\n\\- wash twice with Kiehls amino schampoo.  \n\n\\- conditioner from same line     \n\n\\- once a week; amika the kure bond hair mask      \n\n\\- brush only when sopping wet straight out the shower     \n\n\\- spray with amika hydro leave in treatment.    \n\n\\- let air dry     \n\nWhat do you guys think? Is there a way to get the wavy patterns in my whole hair? It’s so thick so I feel like it’s weighing itself down at the top. The cut I had now thinned the hair out to about 50% to make it more manageable. Let me know your thoughts! ",

I have done so much to it in my 20s and 30s but what seems to be consistent is that I always end up cutting it once it’s past shoulder length because it starts looking dead. \n\nI would love some advice on a routine for length retention and if anyone has gotten their curls back to a length like in my photo? A big part of the problem is I get impatient and blow dry my hair because I’m having a bad curl day. I have a bob right now and sometimes struggle to like how my hair looks curly because every day is a different result. I want to stop with heat altogether and give it a real chance but need some advice that’s worked for others to make sure I’m maintaining hair health while getting my long curls back. \n\nThanks in advance ❤️",
