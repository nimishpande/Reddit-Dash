      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "\\*not pictures of MY cracked heels, TOOK IT FROM GOOGLE for yall's reference\\*\n\nhiii Redditors!\n\nim living in Hong Kong thus unfortunately not all products are neither easily available nor accessible but as I was researching, thankfully Eucerin is available here and im considering on buying their Eucerin roughness relief cream (which supposedly has 10% of urea in it).\n\nso here are some of my confusion:\n\n5-10% is good for hydration &amp; mositurization\n\n20% and higher is good for exfoliation (doubt #1: so is the eucerin roughness relief cream going to help with exfoliation of my heel to help heal the cuts)\n\ndoubt #2: on eucerin web, it says it contains AHA so sun sensitivity, im so confused cuz I have eczema-tic skin (thankfully this is under control) thus lets say as I have never in my 23 years of life so far even worn sunscreen on my leg as I hate the feeling of anything there except for normal moisturizer (I use the cerave one!), thus if I apply the eucerin cream at night and in the morning when I step out, would I get a sunburn or the sun would definitely trigger any sensitivity or since I will just be applying it on the heels, that shouldn't be an issue?\n\nand doubt #3: how should I make a decision on what percentage of urea to use as a daily moisturizer to treat my cracked heels?\n\nthis is the routine so far from all the reddit research and google searches, I have come down to (Feel free to share urs / any suggestions on the below routine, thankk uu!):\n\n\\-&gt; Wash your feet with pumice stone / foot file / glass foot buffer (help me out here one dermatologist said not to use pumice stone: what are your guys thought YES OR NO?).\n\n\\-&gt; Simply apply the thickest moisturizer you can find, a drugstore brand will do: (urea moisturizer)\n\n\\-&gt; Follow up with a thin layer of petroleum jelly: (cerave healing ointment / vaseline)\n\n\\-&gt; Saran Wrap &amp; Wear 100% thick cotton socks for overnight healing.\n\njust gotta narrow the urea product down and feet care routine would be good to go!!",

I don’t have active acne, but my skin definitely doesn’t look healthy and I want to give as much detail as possible about my face.\n\n* Noticeable redness around my cheeks and a few small marks that look like healed pimples.\n* Old acne scars  some small pits or uneven spots on both cheeks.\n* Overall uneven tone and skin texture, and visible pores, especially around the cheek and nose area.\n* A few brownish dark spots or slight discolorations from old breakouts.\n\nI’m not sure what kind of skincare routine. I currently don’t have any, so I’m open to starting from scratch. I’d say my skin is not very sensitive, but I’m not sure how strong it is either. I think I have an oily center face (nose, chin and inner cheeks) while the outer face is kind of dry (sides of cheeks and neck).\n\nI did a bit of basic research and made the list below, but as I said I don’t know much and I’m open to all suggestions. I would really appreciate specific product recommendations since I’m not familiar with the market.\n\nWhen Wake Up:\n\n* Cleanser\n* Niacinamide Serum or Hyaluronic Acid ?\n* Moisturiser\n* Sunscreen \n\nBefore Bed:\n\n* Cleanser\n* Azelaic Acid or BHA or Retinoid-based stuff ?\n\nAbout tret/retinoid products: I did basic research and found it might be better to start with non-prescription options first so I don’t harm my skin. I’m thinking of trying Avène Cleanance Comedomed Peeling Intensiv Anti-Pickel Akutpflege.\n\nI live in Germany and I can buy via online. Also I’m open to prescription medication, but I don’t want professional dermatologist procedures like laser treatments or needles. What would you recommend to me?\n\nThanks a lot in advance for your help!",

The ordinary has 23%off currently and I'm wondering if I should switch.\n\nI didn't get results with a lot of products from Typology as well.\n\nI'm not 100% sure what my skin needs but I know it is often deshydrated and I think I see my pores too.\n\nSo far I mostly use a cream for my under eyes bags/circles, a hydrating serum, something for when I get a pimple and something to made the scar go away but it's not really working.\n\nAnyway, what brands would you recommend in Europe ?

      "content": "Hi everyone, I'm 27, male. I don’t have active acne, but my skin definitely doesn’t look healthy and I want to give as much detail as possible about my face.\n\n* Noticeable redness around my cheeks and a few small marks that look like healed pimples.\n* Old acne scars  some small pits or uneven spots on both cheeks.\n* Overall uneven tone and skin texture, and visible pores, especially around the cheek and nose area.\n* A few brownish dark spots or slight discolorations from old breakouts.\n\nI’m not sure what kind of skincare routine. I currently don’t have any, so I’m open to starting from scratch. I’d say my skin is not very sensitive, but I’m not sure how strong it is either. I think I have an oily center face (nose, chin and inner cheeks) while the outer face is kind of dry (sides of cheeks and neck).\n\nI did a bit of basic research and made the list below, but as I said I don’t know much and I’m open to all suggestions. I would really appreciate specific product recommendations since I’m not familiar with the market.\n\nWhen Wake Up:\n\n* Cleanser\n* Niacinamide Serum or Hyaluronic Acid ?\n* Moisturiser\n* Sunscreen\n\nBefore Bed:\n\n* Cleanser\n* Azelaic Acid or BHA or Retinoid-based stuff ?\n\nAbout tret/retinoid products: I did basic research and found it might be better to start with non-prescription options first so I don’t harm my skin. I’m thinking of trying Avène Cleanance Comedomed Peeling Intensiv Anti-Pickel Akutpflege.\n\nI live in Germany and I can buy via online. Also I’m open to prescription medication, but I don’t want professional dermatologist procedures like laser treatments or needles. What would you recommend to me?\n\nThanks a lot in advance for your help!",

I would love some advice on how to make it more consistently lean into the more wrapped/defined curls.\n\nI believe I have medium porosity hair, as water does bead up some when first getting it wet. Takes a good couple minutes to get it fully soaked. Here are the products / routine I am using currently.\n\nI am washing my hair every 3-4 days depending on what’s going on/ how it’s looking.\n\nStep 1- Get in the shower, soak my hair and use a light detangling spray. Currently using the Marc Anthony Grow Long spray. Brush out my hair completely with a denman type wet brush.\n\nStep 2- Shampoo and condition hair. I was using the Kristin Ess curly S &amp; C, but recently just switched to Rizos Curl Biotin S&amp;C\n\nStep 3- Still in the shower, apply Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Cury Envy Cream. Brush through my hair, and then while under the water scrunch my hair with a bit more cream in my hands.\n\nStep 4- Get out of the shower, get dressed, and scrunch some of the excess water out of my hair with a micro fiber towel.\n\nStep 5- Prayer hands apply Cantù Wave Whip Curling Mousse. Scrunch in if needed but usually try to avoid that.\n\nI do not do any diffusing / drying of my hair, which I know I’ll get some flack about. But I’m a working mom of 2 and never have the time to do it given how thick my hair is.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions on what I could do differently without adding a ton of extra time to my routine that would be amazing. Open to product recommendations or answering questions to help determine what I should do.",

They used k18 in the salon and I absolutely loved the result in terms of colour and condition. \n\nI continued to use K18 as frequently as recommended on the bottle since (every 4 or so washes) and also used Philip Kingsley elasticiser extreme at around the same frequency. \n\nBy June/July I was noticing it was becoming dry and extremely frizzy/reacting to humidity over the summer. It seems to only be getting worse despite being bleached many months ago now and the weather is no longer hot. Here are all the kinds of things I’ve tried so far:\n\n- added in moisture treatments such as Aussie 3 minute miracle moisturiser, amika the cure and Davines nou nou masks in the last couple of months to try to balance against the protein treatments like K18 that I’m still using once every 4-6 weeks or so\n- Have used a chelating treatment (Malibu hard water) and got a shower filter as I live in a hard water area\n- Taking iron supplements as my levels are relatively low (including ferritin) \n- Am avoiding having it coloured for as long as possible (though I do wonder if a toner could help as the colour feels so flat and dull)\n- Using medium heat settings with heat protection at all times \n\nIs there anything else I can be doing aside from protein + moisture? From reading I’m wondering if hydrolyzed protein needs to be added in, from what I understand this is more smoothing than bonding from within which could help? ",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I recently had my graduation, and since it was a special day, I decided to get my makeup done professionally… and honestly, it was awful. My brows were super square, the base didn’t look good, and I was already running late, so I just had to go as I was. The photos were such a disappointment, and instead of feeling confident, I felt uncomfortable the whole time.\n\nBecause of that experience, I’ve decided I want to learn to do my own makeup. I’ve always wanted to, but I never really learned. In my whole life, I’ve worn makeup maybe 5 times: 4 were done by my sister (she’s no longer with us, so it hurts that I never got to learn from her), and the 1 time I paid for it… which was this time, and it went terribly.\n\nI’m a very simple/natural person. I just want to learn how to enhance myself a little for special occasions—natural skin, decent brows, soft makeup, nothing heavy.\n\nSo I wanted to ask:\n\nWhere should a complete beginner start?\n\nWhat are the basic products I should buy?\n\nAny simple beginner-friendly techniques for natural makeup?\n\nDo you recommend any channels, tutorials, or creators for soft/natural looks?\n\nAnything you wish you had known when you first started?\n\n\nThank you so much for any advice. ❤️",
