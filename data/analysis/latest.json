      "content": "Since this is my first post here (longtime lurker, first time caller) I made an effort to write a \"comprehensive guide\" as recommended in the wiki. I'm in my 40s with fine lines and loss of elasticity, and looking for something to solve for that. Lately I've been seeing some talk about PDRN (polydeoxyribonucleotide, aka salmon DNA) in skincare, especially from Korean clinic-inspired brands..\n\nI did a lot of digging. Like...a loooot. Lol. Now that I've emerged from my rabbithole, I thought I'd share what I found and see if anyone else is using it, so we can compare notes.\n\nI managed to find a couple of studies: A 2016 double-blind study in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery found PDRN significantly improved wound healing and collagen density compared to placebo. Another one (2019, Clinical and Experimental Dermatology) found topical PDRN helped repair UV-induced DNA damage and increased hydration and elasticity. There's also a 2022 study in Molecules that found PDRN + vitamin C + niacinamide combos seem to help with elasticity, pigmentation, and oxidative stress, especially after UV damage.\n\nPDRN = Polydeoxyribonucleotide, a DNA fragment extracted from salmon sperm (yes, really) that's used in medical treatments for skin regeneration and wound healing. It's been used in Korea for years in dermatology clinics as an injectable \"skin booster,\" especially for aging or post-procedure skin.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of Korean brands trying to bring this clinic grade tech into serums and creams for home use. So instead of just peptides and retinol, you're getting these regenerative DNA fragments (from salmon sperm! lol) meant to help the skin heal and renew itself at a cellular level.\n\nThis sounds great. Salmon is so good for you, so why wouldn't salmon sperm also be? haha. That said, I'm still skeptical because I keep seeing people questioning how much of that regeneration is real outside of injections? If anyone is using it already do you feel like it's helped?",

In the shower when I start scrunching it looks quite nice but after the drying process (and especially the next day it looks terrible!) \n\nI usually start with brushing my hair before washing it. First I use shampoo I use the nutritive shampoo, hair mask and conditioner. I will detangle my hair while in the shower with the conditioner in. Then I will wash it out and start scrunching all the water out. After that I will use some hair gel (it’s a strong paste from a local hair dresser that I delude with some water to create a more creamy texture) and scrunch it into my hair after that I will use a towel and scrunch to get the excess water off. Then I try and diffuse my hair which is still a bit of process. After that I plop it into a t shirt and wait till the last bits dry and it sets and that’s how I end up here. Am i using the wrong products or should I use a different method? I saw some people use a comb and twirl the hair around that, is that more suited for curlier than wavy hair or the other way around? \nAnyways I’m super thankful for any suggestions or tips on how to deal with this mess.

      "content": "I started having small bumps and acne, so I went to my trusted facial salon. A day after my facial, I used 10% Benzac (benzoyl peroxide), thinking it would be more effective since I had just finished a 5% tube. But instead of improving, my skin got worse, more redness, bumps, and irritation appeared, especially on my forehead and cheeks. I stopped using Benzac and went back to my usual Clinda skincare routine from my facial salon. My skin slightly improved and felt smoother in some parts, but I still kept getting new pimples, especially around my cheeks and ears, which stayed red and bumpy.\n\nBecause of how bad my skin got, my confidence really dropped. I always wore heavy makeup and lots of concealer before going to school just to cover my acne, afraid people would focus on my face. I tried watching tons of skincare videos and even considered consulting Dr. Mike D on TikTok, but his treatments were expensive and involved isotretinoin, which needed monthly labs and extra costs. Thankfully, I finally installed Reddit and started reading real testimonies and tips from people with the same struggle. I also learned how to spot legit dermatologists accredited by the Philippine Dermatological Society (PDS), which helped me a lot.\n\nThrough Reddit, I found a highly recommended dermatologist, Dra. Sarah Bayot on the NowServing app. I had my first consultation around May 15 and a few follow-ups afterward. After following all her prescriptions and skincare advice, my skin finally cleared up! I still get an occasional pimple, but they heal fast with the ointment she prescribed.\n\nNow, my skin is clear and healthy. There are still faint red marks, but they’re barely noticeable anymore.\n\nPhotos are in chronological order.",

I don’t get a lot of pimples but I mostly get cysts/nodules that are very deep and take a long time to go away. In this picture, I only have 2 active pimples and all the other marks you see are completely flat and soft. I’m trying to repair my skin barrier right now so I’m only using a matte moisturising cream along with aloe vera gel, and also the Laroche possay Effeclar green cleanser. My skin feels much smoother and healthier now but still super red.\n\nI’ve tried Benzoyl Peroxide (honestly I think my skin is this red because I was overusing BP), tretinoin, azelaic acid, you name it.\n\nAlso i’d like to mention that I can’t take accutane as i’m a pilot, and there are certain restrictions regarding my medical that I don’t really want to mess with for accutane.\n\nIs there anyone that can give some advice how to combat this persistent redness that never goes away?",

The price jump feels surprisingly small — usually 100g packs cost almost double or at least 1.8x, right?\n\nSo I’m wondering:\n\nIs this a typo or intentional?\n\nHas anyone bought both sizes — are they actually the same product and formula?\n\nDo they maybe use different packaging or batch formulas for the larger one?\n\n\nAlso, if you’ve tried both Barrier Relief and Barrier Plus, how do they compare in texture and finish? (I have combo-sensitive skin leaning oily, if that helps.)\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

Over the past year, I’ve tried to stay consistent — using various skincare products I found after a lot of research on Instagram and other online sources. I’ve even used a few medicated products that were commonly recommended for pigmentation.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing has really worked for me. My skin still looks dull, uneven, and patchy. Every aesthetician I’ve consulted says it’s mainly sun damage, and that I might need to go for something like a Cosmelan peel or a professional treatment. But honestly, those are way beyond my budget right now.\n\nIt’s quite discouraging because I used to have clear, healthy-looking skin, and now it just feels like I’ve lost that glow. I’m looking for affordable and effective treatment options, or even simple product routines that might help improve my skin tone and texture gradually.\n\nIf anyone here has gone through something similar — sun damage, pigmentation, or post-inflammatory marks — and found something that actually worked (especially in the Indian climate), I’d really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThank you so much in advance 🙏",

It’s been around 2 years now and I still keep getting new pimples — mostly on my forehead and cheeks. I don’t even eat much oily or junk food, I drink enough water, and I’ve been sleeping early too.\n\nI started skincare around 6 months ago — using gentle products like salicylic acid, niacinamide, moisturizer, and sunscreen — but honestly, I don’t see much improvement. Sometimes my acne gets worse, and sometimes it calms down for a few days but then comes back again.\n\nThe worst part is that I feel really alone in this. Everyone in my class has clear skin and I’m the only one struggling with so many marks and acne. It really affects my confidence, and I don’t even know what’s causing it anymore.\n\nI’m not using any harsh product right now, just taking a break to let my skin breathe.\nBut still, new pimples appear out of nowhere.\n\nHas anyone gone through this kind of long-term acne even with a clean routine and diet? What did you do that actually worked?",

An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
