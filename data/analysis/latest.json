Additionally there were 3 PRP sessions: October 3 , November 14 and December 19\n\nIt’s been just over 4 months total and about 6 weeks since PRP #3. I’m so pleasantly surprised !

      "content": "Man, I’m telling you just buy these from [Costco.com](http://Costco.com) (as a nonmember) or buy legit ones. I can’t believe somebody would make a fake of a $15 package. It’s ridiculous. I’m so pissed I’m seven months into pouring a mystery fluid on my scalp. And it’s strange because I initially had a shedding without really changing my oral medication.\n\n\\*edit\\* the bleach test apparently isn’t consistent because some people will just dilute the formula so that it will pass. As well as they put that other ingredient in instead of minoxidil. Wow. so much effort to counterfeit $2 bottles. \n\nSo I’ve noticed lately that my hair stopped improving after I got the initial shed. I just opened up my new package from the same seller and it’s the same outdated packaging. The outside is I believe the new packaging, but the bundles are the old packaging that Kirkland doesn’t use as of over a year ago in discontinued all sale of.\n\nFirst, the lid wouldn’t screw on and I’m like what what’s going on OK this is super fishy like Kirkland doesn’t know how to make a bottle that can screw on? When you look at the text on the bottles it’s very different. The colorations are different hues by a small percentage like the yellow text has like a haze around it and a dark quality color on one and the other one it’s like Jimmy counterfeit printed it off their computer printer.\n\nThe bottles are also different sizes. One has two threads and the other has three threads, which is why they won’t screw together. The new bottles are also different size.\n\nFinally, we have the bleach test absolutely nothing it just made it clearer  EBAY purchased with lots of positive reviews. You have to remember that people don’t know anything and they will leave positive reviews, especially in the hair medication world without even confirming if it works or not. Like you know on Amazon, for example where they say, I haven’t even used it yet or it’s been a week, but it’s great and they leave five star reviews. Or like dating apps for example how they don’t work at all but for some reason, people pay for them and leave overwhelmingly positive reviews for something that doesn’t work for what it was made for. Lol. Reviews aren’t the end all.\n\nSee pics included.",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I’ve had acne for a long time and I’ve been on multiple prescriptions — in the past, l ymecycline + Epiduo cleared my skin insanely fast (like within a couple of weeks), but eventually it stopped working and things slowly got worse again. Right now I’m back on l ymecycline and I’ve been prescribed a tretinoin 0.025% combo cream (used nightly, pea-sized), but my main issue at this point isn’t even active spots — my skin is mostly flat, but covered in red and dark marks that look inflamed, get worse after cleansing, heat, or being in warm rooms, and make my face look constantly angry and shiny. I’ve been told this might be PIE (post-inflammatory erythema) rather than normal acne, which would explain why exfoliants don’t seem to help. I cleanse daily (gentle cleanser on face, 10% benzoyl peroxide wash on my back/chest in the morning which actually seems to calm redness there), use SPF and sometimes BB cream, but I’m stuck in this loop where my skin feels sticky, reactive, and worse after washing. I keep feeling like my routine “isn’t strong enough,” so I’ve been tempted to add things like glycolic acid, but I’m worried about making inflammation worse, especially while on tret. My back and chest seem more straightforward and tolerate BP well, but my face just won’t calm down, and the marks aren’t fading. NHS derm wait is 8–10 months, which I honestly can’t deal with mentally, so I’m also considering private options like IPL or vascular laser (VBeam/PDL) for redness. At this point I don’t care about discomfort — I just want something that actually works. Based on all this, what would you do differently: add/remove actives, change timing, stop exfoliating completely, push for laser, or consider something like isotretinoin again? I’m looking for realistic but effective next steps, especially from anyone who’s dealt with PIE or stubborn post-acne redness that just wouldn’t go away.",

      "content": "I have 2B curls/waves, very tangle-prone, thin strand, easily weighted down, hair that’s mainly so easily getting knotted to the point where I’ve had to cut off knots on occasion in the past. I wash my hair daily or every other day with shampoo/conditioner. I try to detangle as gently as possible w/ conditioner, starting at the ends, in the shower. But once it’s detangled, it’s smooth for a bit &amp; then re-tangles SO quickly 😭 lol it’s like my hair sticks to itself almost - besides braiding it, silk pillowcase &amp; leave in conditioners, any advice on how to detangle without damaging &amp; keep it tangle free more often? It’s mainly tangle free only briefly in the shower/when braided.\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. I use Trader Joe’s tea tree tingle shampoo (&amp; I’ve tried shea moisture retention shampoo) and sometimes Aussie girl apricot conditioner other times the Trader Joe’s tea tree conditioner \n\n2. I don’t use gel nor mousse usually but I’ve tried the doux mousse which is really nice but does make my hair appear thinner/less voluminous.\n\n3. I let my hair air dry\n\n4. I do use satin pillow case when possible.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nthin, 2B wavy hair that tangles so easily and re-tangles quickly after detangling. I wash every day/two, and detangle gently with conditioner, but it only stays smooth/knot-free briefly. Looking for ways to prevent tangles &amp; detangle w/o damage beyond braids/silk pillowcases/leave-ins.\n\nAlso open to styling techniques too (worth noting my hair gets weighed down easily, but also won’t detangle w/o some slip)!\n\nThank you!!",

I sleep with a satin bonnet on a satin pillowcase but still have crazy tangles the next morning when I wash it. I have tried to pineapple the hair but haven't noticed any differences. Should I put something in my hair the night before to make it more slippery so that it doesn't get tangled? I am looking for a fairly cheap product or maybe even a light oil that won't make it greasy. My fear is that I am loosing more hair than I need to.\n\nMy routine is this:\n\nI wash my hair almost every day (I know it's sounds crazy). It's truly the only way to manage it and make it look good. It is impossible to keep it looking good overnight. I am not looking for any advice on how often to wash it. My hair is not super dry so I am not concerned that the washing is causing negative effects. I sometimes use shampoo but also sometimes do a co-wash only. I use a brand called J and L Naturals for their shampoo bars and use Shea Moisture Hair Masque for the conditioner. I brush through my hair after the conditioner has been sitting for a few minutes. I wash it all out. I use Prose curl cream for styling. I scrunch it with a microfiber towel and let it air dry. I don't have a diffuser/ hair dryer as I try to avoid heat products, but am willing to purchase one if that will help with volume and frizziness. ",

Since I found out the og Aveda be curly was discontinued, I’ve replaced that step in my routine with the new advanced version (dark green bottle). It sorta works but my hair gets stringy and the curls fall after only like a day, overall I think it’s weighing my hair down a lot. the texture is more creamy and opaque than the og. It does work really well for frizz though. Some other ones I’ve tried are the pattern beauty palo santo one, but that made my hair frizzy, and the not your mother’s curl talk was too heavy. I’ve tried just using less of it, but it’s still not the same.\n\nMy routine is:\n\n1. Whatever random drugstore shampoo I have on hand\n\n2. Random conditioner (unless I’m using k18 that day, then use clarifying shampoo and skip conditioner)\n\nand then on soaking wet hair out of the shower:\n\n3. leave in conditioner only sometimes if my hair feels extra dry or damaged (Davines oi or k18)\n\n4. Aveda be curly cream (light green bottle, this is the discontinued one)\n\n5. Davines curl building serum (or sometimes the not your mother’s mousse, but that weighs my hair down a lot depending on the weather, and makes it look kinda greasy. I can’t use any heavier gels or anything because they make my hair stringy)\n\n6. Scrunch out excess product/water with a T-shirt and then diffuse until almost completely dry.\n\ni dont do a refresh because I’m too lazy, and it always ends up frizzy unless i do the whole thing",

I feel like my hair has too much hold, to the point where if I pinch a curl at its root and point it out to the side, it don’t droop down from gravity it just holds its shape. It seems to get more stiff the longer it is dry. Because of this, I want to grow out my hair but I can’t because it ends up looking really chunky/boxy (like in the 3rd image, which isn’t even that bad but I don’t have photos of it longer on my new phone). This leads into the next question. \n\n3. What haircuts would suit me? I like the length of the 1st/3rd image maybe a bit longer and I might want to try a softer/more androgynous style\n\n4. I currently go to a salon that doesn’t know a ton about curly hair, but I don’t live close to any that do. Would I see significant improvement from finding a more curly hair focused stylist? \n\nThanks :p",
