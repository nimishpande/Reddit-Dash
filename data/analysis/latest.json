      "title": "112 lbs weight loss in 1 year. Here's what worked for me and what didnt.",
      "content": "I feel like most people just tell me to eat less when it comes to losing weight. I literally hated it. So here is what I actually did to lose 112 lbs.\n\n1. Don’t overload yourself with fiber or foods your body just can’t break down. I learned this the hard way. I basically lived on the toilet for a while. BTW not fun. Tons of diets will preach “eat endless lettuce” “snack on peas all day” or “go nuts with corn.” If you do that, your digestive system is going to go into literal overdrive. Sure, the average person carries around 3 to 8 pounds of uhhh waste and yes bathroom reading time is productive, but you’ve got a life outside that porcelain throne.\n2. Lettuce? Honestly, it’s the biggest scam in the veggie world. If you want greens, eat the ones that do something for you like spinach for iron, kale and bok choy for all that nutrient goodness, collards and Swiss chard for all the minerals your body actually needs. Lettuce is basically crunchy water with a side of fiber. Throw some Swiss chard on your sandwich. Stir-fry some bok choy.\n3. This one I don’t hear alot of.. Log your weight with progress pictures everyday. Like I would look back from previous months and when I would see “12 lbs lost this month” I would be so fired up to keep on going. Holding yourself accountable is so important guys trust me I quit like 10 times before I actually did it. The app I personally used for this or I think the only one you can do this on is called “Jurney” on the app store not sure if its that popular but I saw it on a tiktok.\n4. Drink… but don’t DRINK you feel me? A glass of something after a long day can help you relax, and that’s genuinely good for your health. Some alcohol even has small benefits (I am not a doctor btw) antioxidants in wine, vodka killing germs, bourbon helping a cold. And alcohol loosens you up physically, which might be why your grandma who drank like a pirate made it to 97. But once you go past “a little” you’re suddenly chugging calories and your self-control goes flying out the window. My always drunk professor once said, “For every drink you think you drank, there were three you didn’t think you drank… and that’s why you can’t remember what you drank.” Honestly, she mayyyybe was right.\n5. Smoking wrecks your cardio and so does dirty air. I don’t smoke, but I dropped about 40 pounds after moving away from a smoker and into a place where the air didn’t feel like soup. I started doing my cardio at the gym instead of outside because, shocker, it's easier to exercise when you can breathe.\n6. As for sports, here’s the deal: swimming an hour burns roughly 400 calories, and running for an hour burns about 300. But grinding out laps or running in a circle for 60 straight minutes? Pure torture. Some people live for running good for them. I’m not one of those people. But can I run during a two-hour soccer game? Yep. Can I do a hundred accidental squats during volleyball? Definitely. Can I work my triceps rowing across a lake while pretending I’m in a nature documentary? Absolutely. It’s exercise without the suffering.\n7. Start now. Stop waiting for the “perfect moment.” Want to go to the beach? Go. Want to wear a crop top? Wear it. I used to think everyone would stare, whisper, and judge the whole nightmare scenario. That’s how high school was for me. And yeah, when I started wearing bikinis as an adult, a few kids still made comments. But way more people either said something nice or didn’t care at all. Turns out, I was just another human being, not a billboard begging for insults.\n8. Here’s another thing: most green foods have almost no calories. The exception? Avocados. Those things are tiny calorie bombs coated in fat and somehow manage to taste like enchanted ogre mucus unless they’re in guac. Meanwhile, mint chocolate chip ice cream also green absolutely has zero calories. Don’t argue with me it’s literally science I made up.\n9. Stop putting your life on hold. Don’t wait to “get skinny” before getting a haircut or buying clothes you love. Stop delaying being happy.\n10. Lastly, sleep is sacred. So if anyone finds you napping in the grass after stretching at the park, just tell them you’re prioritizing recovery. And accept their coffee money with gratitude.\n\nI hope this helps!",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I was very impressed with the improvements people were posting here, so finally got the courage to ask.  \nI have used Nincamide serum once before in past for some time based on a friend's advice but that didn't worked out much.  \n Can you please recommend me something that I can use to improve my skin.

I was excited to start taking care of my hair, but I’ve had the hardest time managing it. I have a horrible problem with frizz and I’m truly at a loss on how to handle it. I feel like I’ve tried everything and I have a million bajillion product attempts, but nothing has given me any sort of progress. I’ve followed hair routines that are similar to my hair type and porosity type, I’ve bought Camille Rose shampoo and conditioner that are supposed to mend frizz, I tried Not Your Mothers Sculpting gel and after that didn’t work I tried the same brands Flash Freeze gel. I’ve also tried using Not Your Mothers mousse- that didn’t work so I tried Doux’s mousse, but I still had frizz. I have tried SO. MANY. CURL. CREAMS. I’ve tried Rizo’s, Not Your Mothers, LUS, everything I could find; the only one that showed clear signs of decreased frizz was Rizo’s, but there’s still frizz galore. I’ve even been spending a good 3 hours after wash and routine day diffusing my hair with cold air. I’m not sure if it’s the way I’m applying products or the order I rake them in?\n\nMy routine right now consists of:\n\nSoaking wet hair washed by Camille Rose shampoo and conditioner, then I section and spray Not Your Mothers leave conditioner. I then rake in Rizo’s curl defining cream followed by Doux’s texture foam enhancer. After that I take a styling brush and brush out each section. Finally, I use Not Your Mothers flash freeze gel and I scrunch each section and then I diffuse on the coldest setting and allow a gel cast to form. (I’m not sure if this helps, but I have a medium hair strand, it’s not super think, but a strand is noticeable between my fingers and is far from thin.)\n\nAfter the routine, sometimes my curls with separate from each other and I’ll have really small strings of curls that look super weird. The shape and frizz-less curls will usually last the day, but once I’m home from school, my hair is ridiculously frizzy and it won’t last make it another day. I am truly at a loss and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Any advice is super welcomed. I’ve never dyed my hair or had any treatments done, my hair is completely virgin- not sure if that information makes a difference.\n\nI never realized how difficult curly hair can be.",

I recently learned that silk-lined beanies exist, and I’m wondering if they actually help with curls or if they’re just another trend. Anyone with 2c–3c hair tried them and noticed a difference? Do they reduce frizz and keep definition better than regular hats? I’d really like to hear real experiences before buying one. For routine context, I use Treecell Moisture Rich shampoo and conditioner, Cantu Curl Activator and Eco Style Olive Gel, and I diffuse my hair on low to medium heat. I sleep on a satin pillowcase.",

I’m doing the sandwich method and using it only 2–3 nights a week.\n\nHere’s the weird part:\nMy right side is healing beautifully\nBut my left cheek suddenly got 2–3 new inflamed bumps\n\nIs this normal??

At first I was traveling abroad and I thought the change of water and dryness was a contributor but now back at home I flare up almost everyone other day. For reference here’s a list of products I use: CeraVe foaming facial cleanser Paula’s choice 2% BHA Exfoliate (started using in last 6 months) It cosmetics gel cream La Roche-posta ciciplast B5 (recently started using after moisturizer to help with issues) And very very rarely adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel (.1%/ 2.5%) but I have routinely been using for over a year but cut it out of my routine over a month ago to reduce irritation\n\nAny advice welcome",
