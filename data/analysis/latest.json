      "content": "Thanks to this post https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/b8jtf7/black_orchid_large_hair_diffuser_hack_when_it/\n\nI don’t think the OP posts anymore but thank you nonetheless! It was so annoying having to put the diffuser back on every couple of mins. I didn’t have any elastics big enough so I tried using a shoelace and it worked perfectly. This solution allows me to use the hairdryer without the diffuser too. \n\nI thought about using a rubber band or tape to give the inner rings more grip but I wasn’t sure how they would hold up against the heat in the barrel. \n\nI have 2B-2C hair. My current routine: \n\n• Wash with Tresemme Clean &amp; Natural shampoo every other day\n• Condition with Herbal Essences Hello Hydration and clip my hair while I do my other washing, and shaving, if needed. Comb out knots when I’m ready to rinse\n• Apply LUS All-in-One Styler, about 2-3 pumps, followed by a tennis ball sized thing of Herbal Essences Body Envy mousse, all while standing right side up. I don’t style upside down much anymore \n• Diffuse for about 10 mins and air dry for 45-60 mins\n• Scrunch out the crunch \n",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I've been recommended wide-tooth combs a lot, but I can't even pass fingers through my hair. It gets tangled and matted so fast! \n\nMy living conditions are also far from ideal. I work in wildland fire in the summer, and chainsaw work in the winter. So I wear hardhats all the time, in very hot and very cold conditions, I always end up with twigs and branches struck through my hair, which end up damaging my hair when I try to pull it out. \n\nI also live in a dry cabin with a woodstove, so its very dry inside in the winter, and I don't have a regular access to a shower. (I setup a camping shower in the greenhouse this summer and it's been awesome, but it's now winter and I'm not showering outside at -30 😅)\n\nSo far, my routine has been to shampoo, condition and use a detangle brush every time I shower, then air dry. It varies from everyday up to a week between a proper overhead shower. I'm not brand-loyal when it comes to toiletries, but I try to avoid the cheaper brands.\n\nI always wear hats, but I'm hoping for a way to get better coils/waves instead of a giant poof in the back of my head.

Now I’m choosing between:\n\nCeraVe Moisturizing Cream (Made in India) – great reputation, ceramides/HA, but unsure about the India-made formula.\n\nBioderma Atoderm Crème Ultra (Made in France) – cheaper, lighter than the Baume.\n\nSince Baume was too occlusive, I’m leaning toward Crème Ultra.

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Family may have some products. \n- almost entirely out of my bb cream I use for everything. I thought it was full when I packed it!!\n\nAny rapid advice appreciated!!!",

(Plus I know DE is generally overpriced.) He also burns really, really easily so I worry a lot about his lack of sunscreen.\n\nI’d ideally like to find him an actual facial moisturizer for nighttime, a daytime sunscreen, and a hand cream - that sink in quickly and feel like…well, as close to feeling like nothing that’s possible while still getting the job done. Any lip balms would also be welcome (a bonus though bc he’s more willing to try new lip balms) - he used to love a Kiehls one in a blue tube that was discontinued, it felt super light on the lips.\n\nI’d be grateful for any recommendations!

I showed the hair dresser my inspo pics and specificslly said \"I'm just afraid of it turning out blonde, I don't want that\" and clarified that I don't want highlights, I want toning, dimension and something subtle. I asked for something similar years ago and the hairdresser then understood the assignment but this was a different gal (same salon though).\nAfter the foils came out the hairdresser said it looks really good so I was excited. She started cutting it though and what she was cutting was blonde. So I told her that it was lighter than I expected like it was blonde, and then another hairdresser came over and looked at the pics and agreed it was lighter than the pics. So they mixed up some stuff to tone it down. It's now a day later and I've seen it in multiple different lights and I just feel like it's much lighter than what I asked for and I don't like it.\n\nAm I over reacting? Is it actually close enough to the pics and it's just the change that's getting me and it looks good? Or is it actually not close to the pictures and not good? I wanted something that looked natural and sun kissed but this very much to me looks like streaks that are growing out. They already tried to fix it so I don't know if I even can go back and ask for help or if I should go to a different salon or just change it myself.\n\nI appreciate your input. ",

Please help me diagnose what I need for a better style. My hair goals are to look less messy (maybe that means more consistent pattern?), reduce frizz, maintain only washing 2x a week.\n\nCurrent routine:\n- using kitch rice water protein solid shampoo bar. Shampoo scalp, rinse with cooler water.\n- using kitch rice water protein solid conditioner bar. Condition from ears to ends and let it sit on hair for 5/10 minutes while I do everything-shower things.\n(Both of these are bars because they travel well/ have low weight but open to other products if needed)\n- comb hair with conditioner in to detangle, rinse with cold water.\n- squeeze out 50% of water in the shower (don’t scrunch)\n- out of shower, section hair in top and bottom + use prayer hands to apply TreLuxe ReFlex. Scrunch in.\n- use teeshirt to remove excess water \n- scrunch in TreLuxe Hi!Definition gel\n- plop hair in teeshirt wrap on top of head for ~10 minutes \n- diffuse to 70%-80% dry\n\nI sleep with hair pineapples and in a silk scarf. I Wash at night so don’t scrunch out - there is no crunch by morning. \n\nHair:\n- bleach highlights done 3/4 times a year\n- I straighten my hair exclusively for 10+ years.\n- Have been wearing exclusively wavy/ curly for 9 months.\n- I wash 2x a week. \n- shower is hard water\n\nLiving in a humid, hot environment with sporadic rain. If anyone has product recs I can get in Thailand, even better but welcome things I can ship to someone in the US to bring.\n\nPhotos are from same wash day \n\n",

I also have slightly wavy hair. How do I style my bangs in a way that instead of parting so strictly down the middle, they kind of spread evenly along my forehead? I have never really gotten into the whole styling thing because I usually dont have time for it but I am kind of tired of my bangs not looking the way I want them to when they looked nice right out the hairsalon.",

I put a little NYM Flash Freeze gel (5) just on then ends that tend to straighten.\n10. Microplop depending on porosity, enough to dry fairly fast (YouTube) \n11. Diffuse cupping just the ends, just a little to set cast on the ends but not put weird bends. \n12. Hover diffuse - set cast to 70% dry\n[Ali Noskowiak diffuse routine ](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cz347PyO6LC/?igsh=MWoweWVuZWw1b2NoYw==)\n13. To speed up drying after cast is well set, use cone on roots, upside-down, holding casts with arm to keep from blowing around until fully dry.\n14. 3 drops Righteous Roots hair oil warmed in palms, gather hair on top of head and gently squeeze to ends. Fluff roots. Scrunch any cast around face by smoothing lengths roots to ends with \"triangle fingers\".\n15.
