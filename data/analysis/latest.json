      "content": "After years of bleach and extensions I finally went back to my natural hair color and length. I’m really happy with the decision but I feel like the damage left behind is bigger than I expected.  \n  \nMy hair is naturally thin and low porosity. I’ve cut off my split ends and my hair feels a bit healthier but it’s still nowhere near the thickness or density I had before all the bleaching. It grows, just very slowly and the ends still feel fragile.  \n  \nI’ve been reading a lot about minoxidil and batana oil but I’m confused, is it better to use minoxidil topically on the scalp or take it as a pill? I see mixed opinions everywhere and I don’t want to make things worse long term. Same with batana oil some people swear by it and others say it’s just heavy oil that makes hair look thicker but doesn’t actually help growth.  \n  \nAnother thing I struggle with is knowing if anything I try is actually working, hair grows so slowly that it’s hard to tell if a product is helping or if time is doing the work. Are there specific brands or products you’ve genuinely seen results with especially for thin or low porosity hair?  \n  \nI’m not expecting overnight results I just want my hair to feel stronger and fuller again like it used to before the bleach. Would love to hear what actually worked for you and what ended up being a waste of time.",

Looking for a moisturiser to use here, please suggest the best one.\n\nResults-\n\nCleanser: i’ve been using for about 6-7 months now and i dont know if it works but i have noticed that oil production has reduced in my T-zone. It has never broken my skin out or anything harsh like that so I’ll probably repurchase it and continue using it.\n\nSunscreen: Been using this since the start of summer this year so around March, and I quite like it. Again I honestly don’t know if it’s doing anything because I have fair skin with redness on my cheeks 😭. But I haven’t tanned so i guess it’s working? It’s light-weight, blends into my skin quick, no white-cast, and the texture is thin, not thick at all, hasn’t caused any breakouts so I have recently repurchased it and will continue using it.\n\nToner: Just bought it a week ago, no clue if it’s working or not, hasn’t caused a breakout, let’s see if it reduces pores as it claims. Will update in the comments if I notice improvements.\n\nSerum: Definitely noticed a difference from the first week itself, I used 5% for like 6 months and it hardly did anything so I started using 10%, I can see the redness reducing and other people have noticed it too so i’ll keep using this one.\n\nTLDR: Sharing my review of these 4 products &amp; Requesting y’all to drop some advice/comments about my routine, what other serums I can try to reduce redness and acne scars, and please suggest a good moisturiser for my skin type.",

I’m trying to find the right products (&amp; routine) for me without trying a bunch because I just can’t afford it. Trial and error is totally part of the deal , but I’d love to get recommendations and avoid at least some heartache and unnecessary expense!\n\nPics for reference:\n\n1 - 4 are decent hair days \n\n5 &amp; 6 are styles but not good hair days\n\n7 is day 3 or 4 after brushing it before showering \n\nMe:\n\n\\- nonbinary, they/them pronouns (not a woman/girl/etc).\n\n\\- disabled and chronically ill with a weak neck, so I can’t tilt my head back to diffuse, do everything upside down, or do my whole routine standing\n\n\\- newly curly; my hair became wavy/curly a little less than 2 years ago\n\nMy hair:\n\n\\- Mid-back length \n\n\\- 2b/3b (I think)\n\n\\- medium/high porosity\n\n\\- medium/fine and medium density\n\n\\- smooth hair besides damage, very little coarseness/strand texture/hold\n\n\\- mixed healthiness and textures due to hormonal shifts; split ends and in need of a trim\n\nEnvironment:\n\n\\- I live in a high desert environment but use humidifiers inside and WFH, so low/medium (30% - 50%) humidity most of the time and then very low (like 15%) when I’m out. \n\n\\- very hard water (\\~120)\n\nCurrent products:\n\n\\- NYM Tahitian gardenia &amp; mango butter shampoo &amp; conditioner\n\n\\- NYM curl talk leave-in conditioner\n\n\\- NYM curl talk styling products that I use in different combos (obviously not all together), including flash freeze, hold, and spray gels, cream, mouses, and foam\n\n\\- NYM beach babe salt spray\n\nRoutine (\\~2x/week):\n\n\\- dry brush before showering\n\n\\- lightly scrub scalp &amp; then brush through shampoo\n\n\\- rinse\n\n\\- deep scrub scalp with shampoo\n\n\\- rinse\n\n\\- condition midlengths to ends thoroughly, brushing through; let sit while I shower the rest of me (\\~5 mins)\n\n\\- rinse\n\n\\- add leave-in while still soaking wet, brushing through &amp; scrunching\n\n\\- add styling products while still pretty wet, brush through, style, and scrunch lots; add water as necessary\n\n\\- air dry (sometimes I diffuse)\n\nI often try to refresh on day two to no avail and end up in braids.\n\nI use silk pillowcases but can never get a bonnet to stay on. \n\nWhat I’ve noticed:\n\n\\- creams seem too heavy\n\n\\- the flash freeze gel and mousse are sticky and hard for me to manage; the gel is okay when I get it into soaking hair but the mousse always seems heavy\n\n\\- the foam honestly works best, but I tend to use it on day 2 or as a touch up and I don’t like how it makes my hair feel\n\n\\- nothing ever holds all day\n\n\\- hover diffusing seems to do nothing other than speed up drying, but the finished look is the same \n\n\\- diffusing adds volume but messes up my curl pattern\n\n\\- roots are always flat\n\n\\- my hair is dry and frizzy by end of day and oily at the roots on day three\n\nI’ve tried a couple shea moisture products, all too heavy. \n\nPlease help!! And please be kind. ",

They haven't really developed into whiteheads or blackheads but just kind of sit under the skin? I haven't switched up my routine at all. I noticed it did start to worsen around my cycle but this is still fairly new. Last pic of my right side for comparison.\n\nI have a hydrafacial booked im 2 days hoping it would help but now I'm not so sure. I do sleep on my left side mostly (but haven't this problem before)\n\nAs for my products I think I keep it pretty basic:\nAM:\n- Bondi Sands Fresh'n up gel cleanser\n- Neutrogena Hydro Boost Face, SPF50\n\nPM:\n- Skinceuticals Overnight Renew Gycolic acid 10% (twice a week)\n- Revitalift Filler + Hyaluronic acid night.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on what it may be if it is acne or something else? Even suggestions on a routine to help would be much appreciated!",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
