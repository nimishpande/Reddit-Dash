      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe‚Ñ¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Shampoo every other week with Briogeo Clarifying Rice shampoo ($13 on sale at TJ Maxx). Rotate between Not your mother‚Äôs curly shampoo/ Ouidad humidity shampoo when not clarifying. (I shampoo approximately every 5 days or so). \n**Today I brushed shampoo through hair with 4 row denman, separating bottom half from crown. \n\n2. Condition with Aussie curl quench (head upside down and finger combing before a light rinse) \n\n3. Thick layer of Cant√π leave in (squish with couple handfuls of water to clump curls) \n\n4.  Two gentle scrunches with cotton t shirt, before a generous dollop of tresemme curly mousse applied with prayer hands \n\n5. Pink Eco Brand gel (about a shot glass full) squished throughout \n\n6.

      "content": "\nI went to my dermatologist because of patches of redness/bumps on my face. He mentioned Rosacea and Dermatitis and prescribed Tacrolimus 0.1% and ketoconazole 2% which helped over the course of a month. I went back for my follow up and he prescribed clindamycin pledgets, pimecrolimus, and methyl prednisolone. Over the course a month my face seemed to fluctuate but ended up much worse. The redness returned slowly and the red bumps spread. He took a culture and gave me doxycycline and murpirocin 2%. Four days later, after the culture result indicated that I had a staph infection, he put me on bactrim (smz-tmp) and told me to continue with the murpirocin and stop the doxycycline. I just got prescribed accutane after my most recent follow up and was told to stop bactrim and murpirocin.\nHonestly everything seems to be moving rather quickly right now. Acutane seems a bit alarming because of the possible side effects.\n\nFor the photos I included. 1a-c show the current state of my skin. So they‚Äôre photos after the bactrim,doxycycline,etc\nPhotos 2a-c show the state of my skin before the doxycycline,bactrim and murpirocin but after everything else.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what Is currently wrong. I don‚Äôt know what caused it. I‚Äôm unsure about acutane. It‚Äôs definitely difficult dealing with this.\nIf anyone can offer any advice or suggestions as to what‚Äôs wrong, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it.",

I do have allergies, but I keep them well managed with a strict (and I mean strict) routine, and even when I feel much better overall, my under-eyes still look the same every day - no fluctuation. I don‚Äôt have good days they‚Äôre all just bad. I‚Äôve seen two dermatologists who both said it looks like fat pads and recommended seeing an oculoplastic surgeon though they suggested against surgery solely because of age. Which kinda leaves me with nothing if I‚Äôm just going to get turned away. I also got a blood panel to rule out health issues.\nFor the obvious questions: yes, I sleep well/upright, don‚Äôt drink alcohol, and don‚Äôt eat a high-sodium diet. I already have a strict low inflammatory diet for gut reasons. I‚Äôm trying to be smart since I‚Äôm young, but I also can‚Äôt keep living looking tired and twice my age.

It‚Äôs not a permanent fix though and I‚Äôm due to see a new derm in the next month.\n\nIf anyone has similar issues or skin conditions that look like mine, would recommend getting either (or both) protopic and/or sulfur face washes/masks. The itching and irritation is basically non-existent anymore, thankfully. ",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n¬†\n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n¬†\n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n¬†\n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n¬†\n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n¬†\n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you‚Äôve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you¬†\n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "title": "Creatine is the opposite of minoxidil !",
      "content": "The main pathway hypothesized for minoxidil's hair growth is through the modulation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K-ATP channel). This channel is governed by the ATP/ADP ratio, meaning when ATP is low the K-ATP channel gets open. This channel is interesting, since the medications which open this channel are shown to cause hypertrichosis (Minoxidil, Pinacidil, Diazoxide,...). The reason for this hair growth is unknown but based on pp405 mechanisim of action, we can 'guess' minoxidil (minoxidil sulfate) is inducing a low ATP state by opening this channel which might shifts the mitochondrial metabolism and result into hair growth. \n\nThere is an important mechanism for recycling ATP called creatine kinase/creatine phosphate system. This system turns the ADP into ATP via the help of Phosphocreatine. Basically it rapidly regenerates¬†adenosine triphosphate¬†(ATP) from¬†adenosine diphosphate¬†(ADP) to provide energy for cellular processes like muscle contraction during short bursts of high-intensity activity.¬†This process allows for immediate energy use without needing oxygen.\n\nNow this is where Creatine Monohydrate gets involved since it is the direct precursor and a source, for the Phosphocreatine. This is what essentially creatine supplementation does, recycles ATP. The study I found directly mentions this: \"Opener-induced channel activation was also inhibited by the creatine kinase/creatine phosphate system that removes ADP from the channel complex\". Basically the creatine system prevented the K ATP channel to get open by medications like minoxidil. (Check out Figure 5 E of the study)\n\nSource:\n\"ATPase activity of the sulfonylurea receptor: a catalytic function for the KATP channel complex\"\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11023978/\n\nPersonal conclusion:\nThis is clear evidence that supplementation of exogenous creatine, favours the potassium ATP channel to get closed, minoxidil sulfate and the Pinacidil bind to the same unit of the channel. Not only creatine can decrease the minoxidil's hair growth action via opening K ATP channel, it has the potential to close the channel even further and inflict hair loss on predisposed individuals, validating the numerous anecdotal reports of us who get hair loss with creatine. \n\nDon't believe the recent study, done on a group of hypogonadal men which were excluded to not have AGA, even for a moment. Short study time and questionable blood work is the least weakness of this study. Funded by a supplement company, in a country which is racing towards the trashiest place in the world, even is at war with the US right now, so you expect me to believe an US based company fetched Iran the creatine with their only kind-hearted intentions to see if we go bald or not??? Funniest joke I heard this year. \n\nCreatine awsome for the gains, bad for the hair loss",

My old skincare wasn‚Äôt hurting but it wasn‚Äôt particularly helping my hormonal breakouts. I tried Evatasha because it‚Äôs got clean ingredients. About two months after using it daily, I started getting awful breakouts that weren‚Äôt getting better or worse at different parts of my cycle- they were just continuously getting worse. I kept using it for about 4-6 weeks, thinking the worse acne was because I was getting off a low-dose progesterone (it very well could have contributed). \nI kept getting cystic acne, lots of whiteheads and occasional blackheads, only on my cheeks and chin- none on my forehead or nose. I stopped the oil cleansing and oil moisturizing (I was using their Oily and Acne Starter Kit as they suggest), and my acne wasn‚Äôt exactly getting better because I had no clue how to get it to go away.\nI got a professional facial from an esthetician who specializes in acne and that helped kickstart the healing. It‚Äôs been a month since then and I started using the SkinOwl charcoal bar once a day, SkinOwl brand Pomegranate Enzyme Cleanse cleanser once a day (if I use the charcoal bar in the AM, I will use the foaming cleanser at night and vice versa), and I used the CeraVe Mattifying Oil Moisturizer only on the affected areas (which helped dry out the immense number of spots). I will still use it on the big cystic spots before my nightly cleanse and moisturizer. I realized my skin needed more moisture than the CeraVe could do. I started using Paula‚Äôs Choice Hydrating Treatment Mask as a moisturizer after washing and that‚Äôs been AMAZING! I haven‚Äôt used it as a mask, just as a moisturizer after I wash my face once in the morning and once in the evening. \nI have used the Origins brand Drink Up Intensive mask once so far (it‚Äôs suggested to use twice a week), and I liked it.\nI also use a clean washcloth after each wash of my face. \n\nI hope this helps someone who is experiencing AWFUL acne due to skincare and/or post progesterone use‚Ä¶ ",
