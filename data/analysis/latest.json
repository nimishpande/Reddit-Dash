      "content": "Hey reddit! Looking for some advice on this crazy curl pattern change. Over the last two years, my curl pattern has gone from the beautiful texture you see on the first slide to the flat, sad pattern in the second, and I’m so lost trying to figure out why. I didn’t change my routine until after the change had occurred, stayed with the same amazing curly hair stylist for years, and didn’t change locations (i.e. water stayed the same). \n\nHere’s the routine I was using 2-3x per week:\n- Oribe hair alchemy shampoo (2 washes) + conditioner\n- Oribe leave-in conditioner\n- Oribe curl gloss\n- Oribe curl mousse\n- Scrunched dry with a microfiber towel, then diffused on low heat. Finished with kerastase oil and oribe anti-humidity spray. \n\nAfter I really started to get frustrated with the change, I tried:\n- Two different heat protectants for over a year, thinking maybe heat damage was the culprit\n- AG Care Renew Clarifying shampoo once per week, thinking buildup may be contributing\n- Innersense True Enlightenment scalp scrub once per month \nThese changes did not make a difference :(\n\nI have consistently used a silk pillowcase and silk bonnet to sleep, both before and after the change. \n\nI fear that, after doing some research, the culprit may be hormonal changes associated with a change in my birth control, or maybe this is just aging-associated change that I can’t control. But, before I jump to talking with my doctor about making major medical changes, does anyone have any other ideas I can try? \n\nTIA for your help and for reading, I miss my curls and really appreciate your help getting them back!!",

However, this year I made a promise to myself that I’ll finally heal my skin and be acne free.\n\nI’ve already been using adapelene for some time and recently switched to a different brand and see a huge improvement! I’m also using very gentle cleanser, moisturiser and spf (all from Dr Sam’s - the best thing I’ve ever put on my skin!. My diet is super clean, I drink bone broth (even though I’m vegetarian) and eat high protein &amp; fibre meals. I exercise and walk minimum 10k steps.\n\nI’d be interested to know your opinion about a vibration plate. It’s been trending recently and I was wondering whether it may indirectly support skin health through lymphatic drainage and blood circulation? 🤔 I’m also a very anxious person and I realise that my skin issues could also be related to stress. Could this help?\n\nIn addition, I’ve had a Dennis Gross LED mask for several years but tbh I haven’t seen that much of a difference. I want to switch to something better/stronger. I’m looking for a panel, rather than a mask. Do you have any recommendations, especially for acne skin?\n\nI also want to buy RingConn to track my sleep, steps and overall health.

I put on my bonnet while a tad bit damp. \n\nI tend to struggle with frizziness. Especially in the back of my hair. More in a specific spot it’s frizzy and doesn’t like to curl up like the rest.

They’re big, painful pimples that take weeks to go away.\n\nI initially thought this might be purging, maybe because of azelaic acid or some other active in it, but I’m confused now because:\n\n\t•\tI’m not using it regularly (only once, then I stop)\n\n\t•\tIt’s been 3 months and the reaction is the same every time\n\n\t•\tThe pimples stop when I don’t use it\n\nMy routine is very simple:\n\n\t•\tChemist at Play face wash\n\n\t•\tSometimes Garnier Neem Face Wash (this actually helps reduce my pimples)\n\n\t•\tIn winter, I occasionally use Nivea cream (the white one) and that does NOT break me out\n\n\t•\tNo other actives, no serums, nothing else new\n\nSo this Foxtail moisturizer is literally the only different factor that causes these breakouts.\n\nAbout my skin:\n\n\t•\tI’m 25\n\n\t•\tOily skin in summers\n\n\t•\tNormal to dry in winters\n\n\t•\tI don’t use moisturizer daily — only when my skin feels dry\n\n\t•\tHonestly, when I just stick to face wash, my skin seems fine, like it has enough oil on its own\n\nMy questions:\n\n\t•\tIs this actually purging, or is my skin just reacting badly to this product?\n\n\t•\tIf I start using it regularly, will my skin “get used to it” and stop breaking out?\n\n\t•\tOr should I just stop using it completely?\n\nBecause right now, this is not fun anymore and the pimples are painful 😭\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone who’s experienced something similar.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

Just makes the cynical me wonder whether topical fin is a marketing ploy.\n\nAnd why would we need 2-3 mg of fin on our heads to exert a localised effect?",

However, it gets to be extremely out of control at times, to where I have to soak it to get rid of some of the random, isolated curls that stick up. At that point, it does give more “order” to my hair, but at the expense of the “fluffy” look.\n\nThe pics shown have been taken on different days throughout the last week to show how much my hair’s appearance can vary. Lately I’ve been washing it 3 times a week because I want to prevent it from being over-dry, but I do like how it looks immediately after being washed better.\n\nOut of the pics, I like pics 8 and 9 best. Any advice on how I can get my hair to *always* look like that, or any suggestions on a different hairstyle is welcomed. Let me know what you think.\n",

Should I slowly introduce the 10% niacinamide again, or switch to a lower concentration?

My current routine includes the OGX Coconut Curls Shampoo and Conditioner. I run the John Frieda Dream Curls Hair Gel through my hair after this then use a diffuser to dry upside down. \n\nSometimes to style I use the Schwarzkopf Curl Flex Crème (especially during mornings to refresh and fix my bangs!) When my hair was longer a bonnet really helped but with shorter hair it didn’t really work so I use a silk pillowcase with a bandana on top with bangs out. I wash my hair every 2-3 days.\n",

However, I got a terrible rash on my forehead a few years ago that ruined everything! \n\nA dermatologist had prescribed me a rash cream that fixed it but it left me with a permanent oily forehead. I’ve left it for years thinking it would naturally go away but it’s messed with my bangs too since my forehead is SO oily that even touching my bangs or moving them would immediately cause them to become oily as well. It also has caused some tiny bumps on my head too!\n\nI’ve researched it and as a broke BROKE broke college student who can barely afford anything, I’m assuming I need toner and some exfoliation product (I’m so sorry I’m a newbie to skincare)?? \n\nI have a 5 in 1 facial serum from Self Care Canada and I’m planning to buy a St Ives Apricot Scrub (a cheap exfoliant for oily skin apparently) and a green Nivea Purifying Toner for Combination &amp; Oily Skin. \n\nAm I making the right choice? I’ve looked for the cheapest products, I know St Ives ISNT really good from what I hear and the ingredients don’t look too good but I need a solution that works until I can afford a better skincare routine. I just need something that’ll help my forehead and as long as these products do the job, it’s fine! \n\nAlso!! What order do I do this stuff in? I know I have to cleanse first, then I put on the scrub?? Then I cleanse again? Which I should do once a week apparently? Then I dry my face and apply toner and then I apply a serum? Is this right? \n\nI’m so thankful for any help and advice I can get, thank you all in advance! ",

With it now being January and my hair not having reverted, I figured I was stuck. I used to hair straighter/maybe a bit wavy hair, amd no one else living in my family had this hair(My maternal aunt did, but she passed as a teenager, unfortunately, long before I was born) and no one knows how to care for it. I am doing my best after neglecting my new curls.\n\nI have not acquired a 'Routine' yet, as I have not proper done research and have not done been very responsible. I know I have damaged by hair. I use a regular hair brush, but my mom suggested using a wide comb(she is slowly doing research with me) so I will be picking one up. My hair is also very, very thick; very long. My hair also likes to frizz. It also does not like to sit in generic hair ties very well. It was always a nightmare, now it's worse.\n\n I do not have a refresh routine, I air dry my hair, I do not style with any products, and I do not \"protect my hair while I sleep\". I also do not dye, bleach, straighten or curl my hair. I do not part my hair. These are all things I really have to do some research into and care for. It's all very... overwhelming, almost.\n\nI use OGX for Shampoo and I alternate between Bond Repair Repair &amp; Protect, and their Clarifying Strength+ Refresh and Clarify; I am a woman, and I have cycle, during that cycle I use both some days because my hair gets really greasy and oily[very ucky]. I don't use too much conditioner, but the brand is also OGX and it's something like Repair &amp; strengthen. OGX cleans my hair best. I seldom use conditioner, as everything I've tried makes me hair frizz worse. Which sucks big time.\n\nI picked up Shea Moisture-- Kalhari Melon Oil-- Curl Stretch Refersher spray on an impulse at Walmart. Not smart, I know, but I decided earlier that day that I wasn't going to fight my curls/wavy-curls--?-- any longer and that I was going to embrace them. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips?
