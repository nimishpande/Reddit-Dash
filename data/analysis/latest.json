      "title": "My 6 month journey thus far... 47yo Male.",
      "content": "My 6 month journey. April 2025 - October 2025.\n\nMale 47. Had full head of hair up until 41-42 when i started to notice thinning (im sure the thinning started long before but that's when it started to be noticeable), but was slight so i just put it down to aging. \n\nThe thinning accelerated from 44. Again, put it down to aging and accepted it. Then early 2025 at 46, I stumbled on this community and started my research.\n\nStarted treatment in early April 2025 (first pic).. second pic was taken Thursday 23 October. Both with dry hair and no products. My hair \"was\" naturally shinny before treatment hence why first pic looks a bit moist.\n\nMy routine: Just the basics! - no fancy shampoos, washes, honey or herbal shit that gets thrown around on here.\n\n1mg oral Fin and 5mg oral Min (morning)\n\n1ml 5% topical Min (evenings)\n\nDerm stamp weekly. 1mm at temples and hairline, 1.5-1.7mm rest of scalp where hair is thicker. Then apply the Min directly after stamping. I get no irritation doing this, but it may be different for everyone.\n\nLifestyle - Family man, gym 3-4 time per week, fit/athletic build, ordinary diet. No real change in this for the last 10 years.\n\nResults - well i think the pics show how that's going. I'd say I've regained about 70-75% of where i was in my early 40's before i noticed the thinning. Temples and hairline have recovered well. Crown has been slower to come beck but there is definitely progress. Overall I'm very pleased.\n\nSides - i haven't experienced any of the unmanageable negative sides some on here have experienced. Blood work prior and during treatment shows I'm within the normal ranges for everything. in fact, the most recent bloodwork showed a reduction of prostate cancer indicators, which i assume due to the Fin being originally a prostrate med. \n\nFurther.. i feel like i don't have to take a piss as often now. This is really evident at night. I would wake normally 2 times a night to take a piss... but in recent months.. its only been once and nights where i haven't needed wake is becoming more and more frequent!\n\n\\- no issues with sex life, if anything its been even more active.\n\n\\- As min is a vasodilator has caused some nasal congestion as I have narrow passages, but easily fixed with nasal sprays and decongestant meds when needed.... but on the flip side it has made me super vascular and look super jacked at the gym with a full pump.\n\n\\- The topical Min has definitely changed the texture of my hair, Its much coarse and dry. But im ok with this.\n\nHoping the regrowth gains continue on and excited to see where I'll be at the 12-month point, but im stoked with the result thus far and thankful i found this community when i did.\n\n  \n",

      "content": "Hi! I started using 2% AA serum from Minamalist around a month ago, but the past two weeks are when I've been consistent with AM/PM skincare. \n\nI started using it to reduce hyperpigmentation due to a hormonal acne flare-up on my skin. My skin type is mostly combination/dry, sensitive and acne-prone. \n\nThis serum has worked wonders with reducing hyperpigmentation with acne scars and I'm so grateful for it.\n\nThe only downsides I've had to this is the skin dryness. I've read that the HA in the serum craves moisture and since the weather is getting drier with winter on the way, it's been stripping my skin of moisture in areas of high pigmentation. This was mostly around my mouth, undereyes and sideburns. \n\nAM:\n- Neutrogena Lime &amp; Aloe Vera Oil Balancing Cleanser \n- Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin Serum\n- Johnson's Face &amp; Body Lotion\n- Bioré Sunscreen (I tend to skip this because I'm usually indoors, in a very dark room)\n\nPM:\n- Neutrogena Lime &amp; Aloe Vera Cleanser\n- Johnson's Face &amp; Body Lotion\n\nNOTE: I'm definitely looking to switch to a lighter, unscented moisturiser like Hymos to repair my skin barrier. The one I use right now has alcohol and light scents, and with combination skin, it irritates it a bunch.\n\nI hope you've all had some great progress using this as well! This is the first time I've added a serum into my routine and I'm thrilled that I didn't suffer through any weird side effects! (touchwood) 🤞\n\n",

      "content": "Ok  after some advice from hair stylista...so I've booked a consult and patch test a few days from now and I would like a bit of advice on how to convey my wishes/concerned to my new stylist.\n\nI am wanting quite a drastic change and going from my natural mid brown hair with Grays ATM to  full colour (dark red/brown) and highlights (cool blond -as lighter shade as they can manage framing my face where my gray is coming through to match with my gray pattern-maybe a chunky ribbon of blonde through the back too)\n\nI'm happy to spend the money required but I stopped having salons dye my hair a while back when I failed to find someone who could meet my expectations. Not had a hair dresser in a long time that I feel has listened, not since I moved  a long way and lost my fave hairdresser (who did my hair through my teens and twenty's and never disappointed she has since retired so returning is not an option)\n\nSo first things first, I haven't dyed my hair in 14 month but for the past few years prior to this i was box dying  brown to match to my hair colour and cover the grays. Decided to see where my gray is coming through and so have left it alone for well over a year. I am aware that despite this break from box dye there will still be dye in the ends and a portion of the lengths- I am happy to have a large chunk of that chopped anyway as I need a good cut as having fine hair it looked healthier/better not so long.\n\nHere's what I'm scared of and why I stopped getting salon dyes.\n\nI have had my hair lightened in the past with ...mixed results... The only times I have been happy with the shade achieved and my hair has not felt hideously damaged after is when they have done the bleach in 2 rounds. 20min on the lengths and then wash out and reapply and a further 20min inc roots.  This method seems to work best  for achieving the colour I want and doesn't leave my hair in bad condition. This is how my old hairdresser used to do it and I was always happy with the results...everyone since and (i've attempted lightening 3-4 times with stylist over the years) always wanted to bleach for 45min to an hour applied allover at once roots and lengths. This always leaves me with completely lightened roots but minimal changes to the lengths and my hair feeling terrible despite their reassurances that method is the best way to do it (leaving it on longer but only doing it once/putting it all on at once) and despite my warnings that this method has been unsuccessful previously in achieving the shade I want/an even result -they always decline to do it any other way. It's difficult because I'm not a hair dresser and I don't want to come off like I'm telling someone their business but it's really frustrating to pay a lot of money to get fucked up hair that you don't even like the colour of and I don't know what to do.\n\nWhat should i be asking for? Was my old hairdresser wrong to do it the way she did? Cant see how as it worked so well and I never experienced the level of breakage I do when they leave the bleach on so long.\n\n I don't want to appear rude but like i know my hair and I want the hair dresser to listen. I've had a rough couple of years health wise and getting my hair done is important to me to feel good about myself...so I've been saving, staying away from the box dye and finally feel brave enough for a salon bleach/dye for the first time in a long time after years of frustration, damaged hair and disappointment.  I'm not returning to any of salons that didn't listen to me -done a bit of research and found a new one to try with good reviews. I just don't know what to ask for or how to covey to my stylist the issues I've had without sounding like I'm trying to tell them their business. Help.",

My past routine was mielle’s pomegranate and honey detangling and moisturizing shampoo with the mielle P&amp;H leave in conditioner which both didnt really change the results of my hair texture, or curls. Anyways, the first photo is a year or two before having my son, the second photo is 8 months into my pregnancy and the third photo is from today. My curls have completely disappeared, from what I’ve seen IF they were to come back they should have by now since my son will be two in December. My question is, is there quite literally any possibility that I can get my curls back or is it completely done for? I know it’s the hormones that changed the texture but has anyone else has this happen and it came back later than usual? I never straightened my hair ever because I loved my curls. I would take care of them so well and make sure my hair was moisturized and well kept as to not damage my curls. So for this to happen due to friggin hormones kills me and I think about it multiple times a week if not a day since it’s happened. I felt like I lost a part of myself :,( thanks in advance.",

But she is a toddler, some weeks we need 5 hair washes. we always air dry.\n\nI only brush her hair when conditioner is in, and I let it sit for as long as she wants to bathe. I have some detangling spray too, I use that if I see any big tangles and usually fix it with my fingers instead of brushing.\n\nAm I doing this right? Do I need anything else?

I came to the salon because I bleached my hair myself and didn't like how yellow it turned out. My stylist told me that despite doing it myself I created a good and pretty even base for the result I wanted.\nThe third pic is what it looked like after my appointment. My roots and some darker strands are pitch black, some inbetween layers are a black brown and the bleached parts are grey, not blonde.\nI also told my stylist that I wanted the roots to match my natural hair colour, so that my hair could grow out softer. By the time of my appointment, my hair had already grown out quite a bit and my natural hair is a lighter brown, not black. I also told her that I had tried black hair on myself in the past and didn't like it because dark colours wash me out.\nThe last pic is after trying to dye over my grey hair with a blonde box dye which I now realize I shouldn't have done, because now it has a green-ish hue, so honestly this only keeps getting worse.\nI can't go out like this, so if anyone has any ideas how to fix this (and ideally reach the initially wanted result) please please let me know!!",

      "content": "My first post got removed because I forgot to include my routine 😅 I meant to come back and fix it, but life with a baby meant time slipped away from me.\n\nIt’s now been a month since I started treating my hair as “curly”. Before this it was just frizzy and poofy. I used a hot smoothing brush every day and used claw clips everyday. I wasn’t expecting ringlets or anything, but I knew there was some kind of texture under the frizz.\n\nI’ve added new photos from this morning. I’m definitely in wavy territory now, with a few juicy curls sneaking in here and there. My routine is a bit heavy right now but honestly my hair has been so dry for years it’s just drinking it up. When I go lighter on products, I get a bit more curl definition, but I’m not stressing about that yet.\n\nThe biggest change I’ve noticed in the last few days is that the front sections of my hair which I’ve straightened since I was a kid (had a fringe for years) are finally starting to curl towards the root. Small victory but feels huge 🙌\n\n\nI do everything in the shower. A quick routine was really important to me going into this. I wanted to start embracing my natural hair so my daughter grows up seeing that as normal, not something to hide or fight with, especially as her dad has really tight curls so she could go either way. \n\nPlus, it had to be quick so I can get straight back to baby duties 😅\n\n\nBefore shower:\n\n\t•\tBrush once before washing\n\n\nShampoo:\n\n\t•\tHead &amp; Shoulders Smooth &amp; Silky — does what it needs to do \n\n\nConditioner:\n\n\t•\tCantu Shea Butter Sulfate-Free Hydrating Cream Conditioner Drench mid to ends so it’s super slippery, smooth a bit through the roots too (works for me)\n\t•\tLeave in while I shower\n\t•\tDetangle with a Tangle Teezer, then rinse really well while brushing to help get all the conditioner out and avoid frizz from finger-rinsing.\n\n\nStyling (on soaking wet hair still in the shower):\n\n\t1.\tTilt head to the side and shake to encourage clumps\n\t2.\tSPARINGLY Glaze in Cantu Coconut Curling Cream through mid to ends, then scrunch gently\n\t3.\tAdd a bit more water so it’s still sopping wet\n\t4.\tApply Eco Style Olive Oil Gel using prayer hands, lots through mid to ends, a little at the roots, then lift and scrunch gently, holding for a few seconds to squeeze out water\n\n\nDrying once out the shower:\n\n\t•\tUse a microfibre towel or muslin cloth (baby supplies are multipurpose in this household 😂) to gently scrunch out water\n\t•\tAir dry or diffuse\n\t•\tOnce dry, do a big shake and some days finish with Got2b gotGLOSS shine spray (a tiny bit kills frizz but too much makes it greasy)\n\nIf I scrunch too much it goes frizzy so less is more - unless I’m diffusing then weirdly the goal is to go as frizzy as possible as it then settles into waves. \n",

Still working on figuring out a routine, although I’m quite happy with where I am now at least on wash days (first picture).\n\nI don’t want to wash everyday and ideally also not have to completely re-wet everyday because I’m a lazy b**** 😅 when I simply try spraying it with some water, the definition is alright but I get a lot of frizz. If I try reapplying a bit of mousse on misted hair, it gets really stringy and unkempt looking. If I apply gel mixed with water on misted hair (as in the second picture), the result is the best so far, but still quite frizzy and chaotic looking especially on the top of my head. \n\nFiguring out porosity is difficult for me, I guess high porosity at least on the top, maybe medium for the rest? \n\nCurrent routine: \nWashing every second/third day with Balea Med Shampoo (german brand, nothing special just for sensitive scalp), conditioning with Being bye bye frizz, wet hair in T-shirt because I hate dripping, then Umberto Giannini Curl Foam, sometimes the Umberto Giannini Curl Jelly gel, too. Mainly hover diffuse until 80% dry. I don’t get a cast from these products. \nEvery second wash I also use the Being mega no-frizz mask before conditioning.\n\nAll tips are welcome, thank you 🙏 ",
