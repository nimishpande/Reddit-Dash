      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "First photo is immediately after coming home from the salon. Second photo is 4 months ago. Third photo is last week. \n\nTo start, I walked into the salon yesterday with my hair curly. Typically I’ve walked in with my hair up, curls not visible. The stylist who I’ve seen for 10 years, who typically just gives me a blunt cut that allows me to wear my hair both curly and blown out, takes a look at my curls and says “oh! I love your natural hair. Are you wearing it like this now?” I say yes, that I haven’t blown it out in over a year. \n\nShe says she wants to cut my hair dry and give me layers. I tell her very strongly that I don’t think this will look good because my hair is very very fine and I don’t have a ton of density. I tell her that if she does layers it will look straggly and thin at the bottom. She says “trust me!” I say ok. \n\nAfter she cuts it dry, she washes it. She then tells me that I can either diffuse my own hair in the chair myself (she asks me if I typically diffuse at home. I say no, I let my hair air dry almost always) or she can diffuse it for me. I kind of look at her horrified and stunned because she has been towel drying my hair (😭🤯) and is attempting to put styling products in my towel dried hair. I tell her, ummmm well I always put styling products on dripping wet hair. She doesn’t do or say anything, almost like she hasn’t heard me. She then takes the diffuser and starts tossling my hair with one hand and diffusing it with another (wtf!!!). \n\nI sit there silently horrified. It looks so incredibly awful, like a drowned rat that has lost most of its fur. She then turns to me and keeps saying how great it is. I know she’s lying. She then charges me $150 (not with tip). I cannot believe she let me walk through the salon, telling me how great it looked, charged me as if everything was normal and ok. I’m so mad I don’t even know what to do. Also, she cut it in a way that won’t look good blown out, so I can’t even wear it that way now. ",

      "content": "Hey all! I posted this on r/KoreanBeauty but thought I’d share it here as well. I’m semi obsessed with Korean Skincare and spent 10 months testing out 3 different wrinkle serums, and wanted to share my honest thoughts on each product!\n\nThe products:   \n\\-VT PDRN   \n\\-Depology Peptide 10%   \n\\-CISL Ultra Wrinkle Correxion\n\nA little about me:  \nI’m in my late 30s, combination skin, I have some small forehead and smile lines, with slightly deeper 11 lines, so I really wanted to focus my energy on wrinkle prevention. I also wear a full face of makeup daily, so a product that layers well under my go-to makeup products is a must!   \n  \nBreaking down each product:  \n  \n**VT PDRN**   \nTexture and feel- watery, but super hydrating, sinks into my skin quickly   \nResults after 12 weeks- great for hydration, gave a really plump dewy feel early on. I noticed my skin texture improved, but didn’t see much softening of my forehead and smile lines Overall thoughts- loveddd this for hydration, would be a great option for my girls with dry skin. I could see myself reaching for this in the winter especially.\n\n**Depology**   \nTexture and feel- slightly milky feeling, a bit tacky at first   \nResults after 12 weeks- my skin felt firmer, but the results were harder to see. I liked how supported and firm my skin felt, but it took a while to get there.   \nOverall thoughts- This product wasn’t a standout for me, so I don’t see myself repurchasing in the future. Could be good for someone who really wants peptide support, but wasn’t for me.\n\n**CISL**   \nTexture and feel- definitely the silkiest of the 3, the texture is lightweight and falls somewhere between a serum and a cream   \nResults after 12 weeks- my skin felt smoother and more filled in after a month, and by the end of the 3 months I noticed my forehead lines had visibly softened!  \nOverall thoughts- I think this one gave me the best balance of hydration, firming, and wrinkle smoothing. It feels more active than the other 2 without feeling harsh on my skin, plus I like the way it layers with my current skincare and makeup products. This one is definitely my fav, and I’ll be keeping it in my routine.\n\nWhile all three products are a solid choice, CISL and VT were my favs, with CISL edging out the competition (this is mostly based on wrinkle reduction). I will say I got the most compliments on my skin when using CISL, so that makes me think that more people notice the difference than just me.   \n  \nHappy to share more details of trialing these 3. Feel free to ask anything. Hope this helped!!",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I wanted to get a second opinion from the community regarding some advice my dermatologist recently gave me. I’m not trying to discredit her — I actually agree with some of her recommendations — but a few things she said don’t seem to line up with the research I’ve been able to find, so I’d appreciate hearing what others think.\n\n**My previous treatment:**\n\n* Finasteride 1 mg daily\n* Oral minoxidil 2.5 mg daily\n\n**What she recommended switching to:**\n\n* Dutasteride 0.5 mg\n* Oral minoxidil 5 mg\n* Both taken **Monday to Friday only** (weekends off), and possibly reducing to **just 3 days per week** in the future\n\nI actually *agree* with the switch to dutasteride + higher-dose minoxidil. I’ve seen a lot of people report better results with this combo, especially if they didn’t respond strongly to finasteride.\n\nHowever, some of what she said really threw me off:\n\n# 1. She said finasteride “stops working after one year.”\n\nI haven’t found *any* study supporting that claim. Everything I’ve read suggests the opposite — that finasteride maintains or improves results beyond year one, with long-term stability for many users. If anyone has seen research that supports her statement, please let me know.\n\n# 2. She told me to take dutasteride + minoxidil only Monday to Friday, and maybe reduce to 3 days/week eventually.\n\nThis is where I’m most confused. Everything I’ve read about *oral minoxidil* suggests it should be **taken daily**, since missing days can reduce its effect due to its short half-life. Dutasteride I could understand less frequent dosing, but minoxidil seems like it needs consistent daily administration.  \nIf anyone has experience with intermittent dosing, or knows why a doctor would recommend it, I’d love to hear it.\n\n# 3. She recommended mesotherapy.\n\nI know some people swear by it, but the clinical evidence looks mixed. I’m not necessarily against it — just unsure whether it’s worth doing, and whether it adds anything on top of dutasteride + oral minoxidil.\n\n\n\nSo basically:  \n**I like the medication switch she proposed, but I’m unsure about her claims regarding finasteride losing effectiveness and minoxidil not needing daily dosing.**  \nIf anyone in the community — especially those using oral minoxidil or dutasteride — could share their experience or any evidence, I’d appreciate it.",

I used about 4 to 5 drops of serum. \nEverything was fine for a week, didn't get any drastic change but progress was visible. All of sudden from second week, pimples started dropping aa bombs all over my face. My whole face was covered with pimples and weird white kinda pimple thing that looks awful. \nI stopped using these two for time being. Can you give any suggestions of whether should I be using these two and possible reason of outburst?\nYou help and attention is appreciated🙂🙂🙏",
