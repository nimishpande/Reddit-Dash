      "content": "I remembered this video by the Perfect Hair Channel:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoK5l80O5lg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoK5l80O5lg)  that showed the case of an old man back in 1986 who fell on hot coals in his fireplace at home and suffered  full-thickness burns across his scalp, then 6 months later the 78 year old had grown terminal hair in the region where he got burnt. This case demonstrated it IS possible to regrow hair in areas where the follicles were suppossed to have \"died\" a long time ago due to the action of DHT although of course this occurrence could never be replicated (that we know) as to develop an actual cure for baldness. The video goes into more detail and the scientific sources that verify this story but I want to know your opinion about this peculiar case and what it could mean for future treatments that might alter the scalp conditions and actually regrow hair in previously bald areas (and yes PP405 is the more obvious candidate for such a discussion and YES we should not be generating immense hype about something we know next to nothing about). Needless to say I DO NOT recommend anyone burning their scalp at home to see if they get lucky and end up with a mane.",

I also have fine hair, that's prone to breakage and being weighted down by products. \nIm starting to feel like its not worth the effort to do my hair routine since the curls usually end up looking terrible and it's easier just to brush and let it air dry where it usually ends up being half straight half wavy.\nI'm also afraid that I'm forcing my curls and I've deluded myself into thinking I have curly hair since everyone else in my family has curls.\n\nI use Pantene Curly shampoo and conditioner, and suave clarifying shampoo once a week. I section my hair into three sections (bottom to top) and use 1 pump of Umberto Giannini Curl Whip per section. Then I go in with Umberto Giannini Curl Jelly. First I scrunch with my hands, and then scrunch with a cotton T-shirt. \nTo dry my hair I hover dry with the diffuser and then when it's about 80% dry, I diffuse each side of my head while at a 90° angle. \n\nI've tried curl balms and creams but in my experience they just weighed my hair down and made it greasy. \n\nI just really don't know what to do anymore. It always looks stringy and frizzy and I usually end up brushing it out and putting it in a bun.\n\nI would be so thankful for any advice or suggestions!!\n",

They feel dependent and I need to stop this constant re-application habit for good.\nI need quick, practical advice.\nWhat are the best, low-ingredient, non-addictive healers I can use very sparingly? Think single-ingredient moisturizers or occlusives. I want to heal, not get re-addicted.\nI'm considering the Kama Ayurveda lip balm as a potential, more \"natural\" step-down option (ingredients look like pure oils/butters/beeswax).

I’ve always had clear, normal-to-dry skin, but over the past few months, I’ve started noticing acne-like marks and small breakouts, especially around my chin and sometimes on my cheeks. I also have quite a bit of facial hair, and since waxing doesn’t suit my skin and laser is too expensive, I started using a razor to remove the hair. I don’t get immediate breakouts after shaving, but ever since I started, my skin feels different — like it’s constantly irritated or not as smooth as before. Recently, I began using The Ordinary Glycolic Acid hoping for clearer, glass-like skin, but it seems to have made things worse. I used it carefully, once a week, followed with sunscreen, and only used it about three or four times, but still ended up with more irritation and small bumps. I’m not sure if the problem is from shaving, the glycolic acid, or something else entirely. I’d really appreciate any advice or suggestions from anyone who’s faced something similar or knows how to fix this.",

I have some really nice loose curl patterns, but together it just looks super straggly. I'm thinking of buying a pair of hair scissors and just popping a third of the length off to get rid of the struggle and weight. \n\nI used to do the curly girl no poo method during lockdown and it worked, but it was a lot of effort and no matter what hold product I used, my hair would feel sticky.\n\nDo you think chopping off all the sad dead weight would be enough for now until I could find some products I like?
