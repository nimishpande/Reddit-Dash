      "content": "Not here to sell anything, and I’m not speaking for every provider or clinic. This is just what I’ve consistently seen move the needle for people’s skin over years of working in medical aesthetics and consulting with regulated health-care teams.\n\nSkincare can feel overwhelming, but the ingredients that work long-term are surprisingly consistent. Here’s what actually delivers noticeable improvement when used correctly and consistently! \n\n  \n**For pigmentation and stubborn** discolouration\n\nHydroquinone (at least 2%)  \nStill one of the strongest short-term options for targeted pigment concerns. Usually used in cycles because it’s potent.\n\nNiacinamide (Vitamin B3)  \nGood for general discoloration, redness, and supporting the barrier.\n\nAzelaic Acid  \nGentle, versatile, and effective for pigmentation, redness, and texture issues.\n\nTranexamic Acid  \nOften helps with melasma-type uneven tone and overall brightening over time.\n\n**For anti-aging and long-term skin quality**\n\nRetinol or Tretinoin  \nStill the most reliable ingredient for improving texture, fine lines, and overall skin quality.\n\nVitamin C + E + Peptides  \nA brightening, antioxidant-rich combination that helps support healthier-looking skin.\n\nPeptides  \nUseful for strengthening the skin and improving resilience when used consistently.\n\nSunscreen  \nThe ingredient that protects all of the above from going to waste.\n\n**For hydration and barrier repair**\n\nHyaluronic Acid  \nBest used on damp skin and sealed with a moisturizer to prevent moisture loss.\n\nCeramides  \nEssential for repairing and reinforcing the skin barrier.\n\nUrea (low percentage)  \nHelps with smoothness, hydration, and softening rough patches.\n\nCicaplast Baume B5  \nConsistently helpful for calming irritation, supporting barrier repair, and restoring comfort when the skin is stressed or over-exfoliated.\n\n**For acne-prone or congested skin**\n\nSalicylic Acid (BHA)  \nKeeps pores clear and helps reduce inflammation.\n\nBenzoyl Peroxide  \nStill one of the most effective tools for managing acne-causing bacteria.\n\nAdapalene  \nA beginner-friendly retinoid that supports both acne control and long-term skin refinement.\n\n**General principles that make the biggest difference**\n\n\\- Consistency is more important than product count (can take sometimes months to see real permanent change, give a product at least a month of consistent use before deciding if it helps you or not) \n\n\\- Barrier health should always come first\n\n\\- Introduce new products slowly\n\n\\- Use one strong active at a time\n\n\\- Water intake and a balanced diet genuinely impact skin behaviour\n\n\\- Sunscreen determines how well all other products work",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I hit my late 20s and suddenly started noticing more hair in my hands after a shower. At first, I told myself it was “just stress.” Stress from a failed relationship. Post uni, no work stress, and general stress about life.   \n  \nHowever, after a few months, I knew I was dealing with the beginning of male pattern thinning. Like most guys, I went straight to Google and fell into the endless black hole of “best men’s hair growth shampoo” reviews.\n\nSo yeah, I tried a bunch. Some smelled amazing, some left my scalp burning, and one literally made my hair feel like straw. It’s kind of wild how every brand claims to be the one, but after months of trial and error, I realized something: shampoo can’t magically regrow your hair, but it can make a difference if you pick one that focuses on your scalp, not just your strands.\n\nThe ones that helped the most were usually mild, not the “tingling” types that promise instant results. They didn’t foam too much, didn’t strip my scalp dry, and after a few weeks, I noticed less shedding and less itching. I started paying more attention to ingredients. Things like caffeine, biotin, saw palmetto, and amino acids seem to actually support growth instead of irritating your scalp.\n\nI also made some small changes that surprisingly worked: massaging my scalp while shampooing, avoiding hot showers, and just being consistent. You can’t expect results overnight, it’s more like a 3-to-6 month commitment.",

      "content": "Hello!\n\nDisclaimer:\nMy partner had been DIYing my hair for about a year, but we decided it would be good to start going to a professional stylist, especially because I needed a colour correction. I hadn’t been able to get my roots done for a while due to medical complications as I was in the hospital a lot so my hair had to take a back seat. I do know it was my fault for not being able to do it every 6 weeks at that point. \n\nThe stylist was lovely and gave me the option of foils or a bleach out, which I chose. She said both options would be about the same in terms of safety. At the end of the service, she mentioned she wished she had pushed for foils more because she didn’t realize my hair was in the condition it was in (more on that later) though I did attend a consultation beforehand and didn’t try to hide anything. \n\nThere was a lot of shedding during the appointment after the bleach and tone was done. Some of it might have been telogen effluvium from my medical conditions over the summer, but some pieces of the hair that came out was kind of gummy. She assured me there was no overlap and that she used Olaplex as a barrier, but I worry that some overlap might have occurred when my hair was in the bag with the level 30 bleach on the parts that needed colour correction? Is that possible? She said though that none of my hair was compromised and suggested the shedding likely happened when rinsing out the bleach, and that some of it may have touched the already lightened hair for even just a minute. \n\nShe also used a hairbrush kind of roughly on the top of my\nhead to blow-dry my soaking wet hair, which I feel caused a lot of hair to come out. I asked her to stop because I thought brushing freshly bleached hair while wet could damage it, and she respected that request. She did mention that brushing wet hair is normal, so maybe I was just anxious.\n\nHair shedding is never fun, but I hope it was mostly related to my medical condition. A lot of hair did come out, though, but she did say she has seen worse and it’s pretty normal and she wasn’t worried until I got worried. \n\n⸻\n\nMy main question:\n\nWhat level are my now fixed roots? \nThe first photo is from the very first tone taken after it was dried but she sprayed the bottoms (so the ends look a bit crazy lol) to prepare a second tone that i requested because to me it looked too yellow. The stylist explained that the bottom part soaked up the toner faster because it was more porous than expected so she was afraid of leaving the first toner in too long because it could turn my ends silver. \n\nShe said my roots are a level 10 and the hair below is level 11. I want a second opinion without disrespecting her expertise.\n\nThe second photo is the next day with the second tone.. i will say when wet, the second tone looked a lot more orange but she said it didn’t. I’m really starting to wonder if i might be colour blind ;-;\nThe very front pieces underneath, which were done last, are much darker too. I can provide a photo if needed.\n\nIs there a safe way to fix this? Does it need to be fixed? I feel like perhaps i’m over reacting. I was trying to be okay with it especially she took the time to tone it a second time until I walked out and my younger brother said, “Why are you so yellow?” haha. \n\nShe did say nothing can be really done and i’ll just have to wait out until my hair grows out so the colour matches. It’s just a lot more yellow and darker than I was hoping for. I do know my original hair was yellow, but I also had never toned it and only used purple shampoo as it once turned completely silver and was afraid to do it myself again haha. \n\nThe third and fourth photo were right before we started bleaching so you can see what my hair looks like without having done anything to it since about June \n\n\nI also know I should had gone to a professional to do my hair the first time so it’s likely my fault. \n\n\nThank you in advance for your advice! \n\n",

Looking for suggestions to clear up red marks, and also ways to prevent them from recurring. \n\n\nI've had issues with strange blemishes for several years now. My dermatologists have been no help at diagnosing what is causing this and wouldn't do any cytology(?) testing. I've been told it's probably acne, or dermatitis, and other generic diagnoses. Usually these blemishes start as small bumps in the surface of the skin (never above nose level, most commonly around jaw) with an itch that's much deeper than the surface of the skin, which develops into a small sore that grows and slowly spreads/migrates. The spots will sometimes itch or burn, other times they don't. As it starts healing, another will form right next to it, and it slowly grows and migrates around until I can finally get it healed and wait for the next episode. You can see the migration path in the red scarring. Some scars are also white around the jaw line. The blemishes/sores stay for MONTHS, getting better then worse again, and it takes forever to get under control and then heal. Makeup seems to make it worse or trigger a new flare up, but I've found a liquidy foundation serum that I can handle for occasional daytime use. ANY SPF other than zinc oxide can trigger a flare. It seems sunlight exposure *might* also make flares worse.\n\nI've tried: \n\n-PanOxyl face wash (did nothing) \n-Nizoral dandruff shampoo, in case it's fungal (maybe helped but didn't heal)\n-Prescription antibiotic ointment that treats bacterial or staph infections like impetigo (will help for a few days then does nothing and they get worse again)\n-dial antibacterial sensitive hand soap (helps heal the most) \n-hydrocolloid patches (best for getting under control)\n-multiple types of spot treatments for acne, including those with salicylic acid (can make worse)\n-plain aquaphor or vaseline\n-i also wash my hands frequently, keep my nails short during flare ups, and change my hypoallergenic pillow case weekly.\n\nI currently do NOT have an active breakout (yay! 🎉) following starting an AM/PM routine in September 2025 that includes: \n\nAM\nDial antibacterial hand soap OR a gentle face cleanser from The Ordinary (T.O.)\nT.O. GF 15% Solution\nEight Saints Pep Rally Serum (HA, Vit C &amp; E, MSM)\nThe Inkey Hydro-Glow serum\nEight Saints Cloud Whip Vitamin C moisturizing face cream\nZinc Oxide SPF 50\n\nPM\nT.O. gentle foaming face wash\nGlycolic Acid 2x weekly\nRetinal 0.2% Emulsion 1x weekly\nT.O. GF 15% solution\nEight Saints Night Shift face gel (peptides, Vit C, MSM, antioxidants)\n\nI'm really trying to keep my skin clear, and so far I feel the Glycolic Acid makes the most difference, as does the Dial antibacterial hand soap I sub in once every day or every other day. \n\nI now have these dark long scars on my cheeks and jaw though and I want to know what I can use to help them fade! I'm open to products or other professional treatments.\n\nIf you have suggestions on preventing recurrence, OR can help me reduce the red path of destruction, I would be so appreciative! ",

      "content": "Hoping for some advice here from people who are having the same issue. My front and sides are decently curly but my back is only wavy in comparison. Of course, this gets elevated by sleeping on it and so on.\n\nI'll do my usual routine, as stated below, and diffuse with Dyson, then scrunch curls when fully dry. Sometimes I use one drop of hair oil for this step, sometimes not, just whatever I feel like doing that day.\n\nI've tried stronger hold gels to no effect, did finger curling, tried upside down styling exclusively, I even used the Bounce Curl Brush. I have rather fine hair and this thing makes my hair so incredibly shiny and frizz free but sadly sucks out all the measly volume there is. The best way to handle the back of my head for now is to style regularly and then diffuse upside down but this often leaves me with a lot of mess (as well as some stronger curled waves). Problem is, to get rid of this mess, meaning some unwanted parting, I use my flat iron to even things out. Most of the time this means killing some of the pretty curly waves. Even finger combing before diffusing to get some order into my hair does not help anything.\n\nNicer waves/curls + messy back of my head or pretty loose and shiny waves. It feels like I can't get one or the other. My sides are nice and bouncy and hold up so nicely even with me only using mousse. A curly cut is already off the table since I'm worried this will make me look like a spaghetti monster.\n\nCurrent routine (just 1 of each):    \n1. Pantene Volume &amp; Body OR Ouai Detox OR Wella Nutri Curls shampoo     \n2. L'Oreal Glycolic Gloss Conditioner OR L'Oreal Bond Repair Conditioner    \n3. Every 4th wash K18 mask    \n4.

And of course moisturising afterwards.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations of a good gentle cleanser to pair with the epiduo whilst I’m using it? Cerave products seem to have broken my face out worse in the first place.\n\nAny help would be so appreciated 😊",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

But the wax definitely isn’t too hot. I spoke to my waxer and she said it might be a “graze” or skin lifting because my skin seems thinner than usual.\n\nThe only things I’ve changed recently are: • I started taking 4000 mg of myo-inositol daily (for PCOS) • I started using CeraVe Facial Moisturising Lotion every day (AM in the morning and PM at night)\n\nThey’re the only things that’s changed in my routine, because honestly… I didn’t really have one before 😅 Previously, the extent of my skincare was occasionally using Tropic Sun Day SPF, and using a Tropic cleanser maybe once a week when I wore makeup\n\nI’m 32 and have started noticing dullness, early ageing, and some dry patches on my face, so I decided I should finally take better care of my skin.\n\nHas anyone had waxing sensitivity like this pop up out of nowhere? Could my moisturiser be making my skin more fragile? Or could the inositol actually be affecting my skin somehow?\n\nIf you’ve dealt with this, what moisturisers or products helped? And what should my ideal routine look like?\n\nThanks in advance — I’m getting tired of looking like I’ve been attacked by a tiny dragon after every appointment 😅",
