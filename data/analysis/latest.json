      "content": "\nHi everyone,\nI’m a 26-year-old male and work in acting. I had early hairline recession but no major thinning or crown loss. Because of my profession, hairline design was extremely important to me. Almost every successful lead actor in India has a strong, well-designed hairline, and I wanted something similar—customised and slightly aggressive, while still looking natural.\nFirst surgery (top celebrity clinic in India):\nI initially went to one of the most reputed clinics in India that operates on many celebrities. The plan was hairline enhancement. However, the team mainly worked on the fronto-temporal angles and didn’t significantly improve the central hairline or peaks. The result was okay, but not what I had envisioned. It lacked personalisation and refinement.\nTo be fair, I fully understood their concern about keeping the hairline conservative in case future baldness progressed. Still, I felt the execution didn’t match my expectations, especially considering my case was mild recession and not active baldness.\nAfter around 6 months, once growth became visible, I decided to restart my research.\nSecond surgery:\nThrough Quora, I came across Dr Abhinav Kumar (Patna), an ex-Eugenix surgeon, repeatedly praised by patients for customised hairline design and attention to detail. After detailed discussions, we went ahead with a second surgery focusing purely on hairline aesthetics.\nCurrent results (5 months post-op):\nI’m sharing my current results—a Shubman Gill–style hairline (inspiration only, not replication).\nWhat I’m genuinely happy with:\nStrong but natural peaks\nFlat, well-blended temporal points\nVery fine, single-hair grafts in the hairline\nSmooth transition between hairline and temporal zones\nI’m honestly in love with the hairline. It looks natural, age-appropriate, and camera-friendly.\nFinal thoughts:\nThis is not an endorsement or advertisement. I’m simply sharing my experience to highlight that:\nAll hair transplants don’t have to look unnatural\nCustomisation matters a lot, especially for hairline work\nSurgeon’s aesthetic sense and attention to micro-details make a huge difference",

      "content": "I’m looking for impartial advice about my curly hair.\n\nI grew up never being taught how to care for curls (I was always told to brush it), so I kept my hair very short most of my life. A stylist recently told me I have strong natural curls and recommended growing it out for \\~6 months. I’m about 4 months in.\n\nI’m having a hard time telling whether what I’m seeing now is a normal curly grow-out phase that just needs shaping—or whether my curl pattern/head shape genuinely works better with short hair. I’ve gotten mixed feedback in real life, which makes it difficult for me to evaluate clearly.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n1. Is this current length/shape a normal curly grow-out phase that will pay off if I keep going?\n\n\\- Or does my curl pattern/head shape honestly suit short hair better?\n\n2. If the answer is “keep growing”, should I be doing maintenance shaping (sides, neckline, around the ears) to keep it looking intentional?\n\n3. If the answer is “cut it”, is there a shorter curly style that still works with my natural texture rather than against it?\n\nPhotos are anonymized. I’m genuinely open to either outcome—I’m just looking for curl-informed, impartial feedback.\n\n**Routine**:\n\nI shampoo and condition daily using Paul Mitchell Shampoo Two and Paul Mitchell Detangler conditioner.\n\nAfter showering, I do not towel dry. I let my hair air dry.\n\nWhile my hair is still damp, I apply a light Moroccan oil and DevaCurl cream using my hands. I apply both by scrunching the hair upward while my head is upright, letting the curls form naturally as they hang.\n\nI live in a humid area, so the products are mainly to control frizz.\n\nI do not currently use any protection while sleeping (no bonnet, scarf, or satin pillowcase), and I do not have a refresh routine on non-wash days.\n\nIf there’s anything else I should include for routine context, let me know.",

I’m indoors most of the time.\n\nSince I’m pregnant, I’ve stopped most actives and I’m very cautious with products. I run everything by 15 Minute Beauty, so my routine is pretty conservative.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n\t•\tCleanser: CeraVe oil-based cleanser (night only, in shower)\n\n\t•\tToner: HaruHaru Black Rice toner — 2x/day\n\n\t•\tMoisturizer: La Roche-Posay Triple Repair Cream — AM + PM\n\n\t•\tHyaluronic acid — night only\n\n\t•\tVaseline — morning only\n\n\t•\tHumidifier — about 3x/week overnight\n\nNo exfoliation, no retinoids, no acids.\n\nDespite this, my skin keeps peeling and moisturizer just seems to sit on top.\n\nQuestions:\n\n\t•\tIs HA making this worse in winter?\n\n\t•\tShould Vaseline be at night instead of morning?\n\n\t•\tAm I overdoing toner?\n\n\t•\tAny pregnancy-safe tweaks to actually repair my barrier?\n\nThanks!

The last couple of months i have used \"pure willpower\" \n\nNow I call this \"pure willpower\" because normal willpower nowadays is fueled by phonk songs overlaied pictures that give people a 4 minutes motivation window before they are back to Gooning and watching subway surf videos. \n\nYou have to put away your phone and optimally put in flight mode, 5g signals don't interfere with willpower per se but has a an effect on bludflow. \n\nWell basically i have every day been repeating to myself \"massive regrowth, Norwood 3 kill, norwood 2 destroying, Norwood 4 shot in the head. Norwood 1 give me it. I have also looked in the mirror and screamed maximum regrowth and also just said out loudly \"grow hair motherfucker\" \n\nIf you gardening folks claim that talking to plants help them grow why wouldnt pure willpower TM 100mcg work??? \n\nI think i have stumbled on something huge. This a non hormonal non evaisive methad of increasing growth. I can defitive tell a growth on my Scalp\n\nOk its a bit invasive for the neighbours when i scream maxium bludflow and smash up the living room with my sword, thats the more extreme part, pretending Iventory is those damn androgen receptors and RNA that programmed them to be sensitive to androgen aaaaargh smash fuck you androgen hairloss \n\nPure willpower + 5ar inhibition + ru58841/ketoconzale should be the big three. There is a good reason i dont like minoxidil it affects calcium channels which maybe can affect your \"pure\" willpower. And we know it can mess with your heart rythm and make you hold water ",

Recently i’ve been developing milia right under my eyebrow and just a but above my eyes and it’s driving me crazy from how prominent it is. I’m actually unsure if this is milia or not but i will leave a photo below just in case.\n\nI think that these ‘spots’ appeared because i’ve been bringing my skincare up to my eyelids (moisturiser and serums) for the past two months because i saw the skin there flaking. Just fyi, i’ve had milia under my eyes before but they disappeared after a week of not putting anything on my skin, but those one are way smaller compared to the one on my eyelids. I’ve done some research on reddit and was recommended tretin or bha/aha but i’m unsure if it’s even safe to bring up to my eyelids. \n\nSo please!! Is there anything else i can do at home before going to a doctor or dermatologist? Both of the options are not really affordable to me right now so i hope there is something else i can do at home.\n\nThank you all !!",

That was on the 18th, but since then (24th, 26th, 29th), and across two or three washes, I have not managed to reproduce that; it feels that I either end up with hair which is less defined (curls are more frizz than anything) or less \"moist\"-looking, or even both. Perhaps I am overanalysing this, but if anyone could perhaps suggest what is wrong specifically with my hair, I would appreciate it!\n\n  \nRoutine (Has not changed much since the 18th):  \n**(All products applied by raking)\\***  \n**WASH**   \n\\- Aunt Jackie's Moisturising or Clarifying Shampoo  \n\\- SheaMoisture Moisturising Shampoo or Sleeek Argan Smoothing Conditioner (only used the latter once)  \n\\* I used to use a Cantu moisturising masque, but fears about too much moisture led me to discontinue its use shortly before the 18th.  \n\\- Comb: \"Bounce brush\"  \n\\- Rinse out (I have been trying using the \"squish to condish\" method, with mixed results)  \n  \n\\- Out of the shower: Lottabody Leave-in conditioner, followed by Curl Keeper Styling Gel, then the curl brush, with occasional use of a spray bottle to keep my hair wet. I finish by scrunching it.\n\n**STYLING (morning)**  \n\\- Curl Keeper Styling Gel only; I get my hair decently wet using the spray bottle, then apply the gel, using it to detangle and redefine my curls. Once done, I do not touch it until it is dry, when I scrunch it out. On the latter, I actually tried olive oil two times before the 24th, and after the 18th, but did not find it was useful at all, and so these days I scrunch it with my dry hands only.\n\n**\\*On raking:** I attempted the \"praying hands\" technique a few times, but did not find it worked. I might try it again for morning styling, where I find a lot of gel is needed to hold my hair together. However, the last time I tried this method, the results were supbar, unless I was mistaken about what I saw. ",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

The spiro seems to be helping, I haven’t had a new breakout for the past 2 weeks. I’ve heard so many horror stories about winlevi and I have a tube I picked up today and I’m staring at it insure if I should try it out. I’ve heard it causes terrible cystic acne for some and I’m scared to try so came here to ask if anyone has any similar experiences?

It gets very greasy very quickly and I’ve been told by my hairdresser that training it just won’t work, which makes sense because I’ve tried. Any product other than hairspray weighs it down and makes it look dirty.\n\nWhat can I do it keep it from getting greasy and maintaining keeping down my cowlicks? Also styling advice would help, but prioritizes right now are trying not to look like I just had a fight with a Brillo pad. Thank you! ",
