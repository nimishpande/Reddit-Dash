It’s so dry I can’t use an exfoliant more than once a week. I’m also super oily. BHA does nothing for me.

Lately i’ve noticed these bumps appearing on my scalp. im starting to worry if this could cause permanent hair loss. Could my oiling routine (especially leaving onion juice overnight) or the heavy oils be clogging my scalp pores or irritating my skin? Any advice on what might be causing this or how to fix it would really help(and i use aroma magic moisture boost shampoo, any good shampoo recommendations for dry scalp would be really grateful)",

I have tons of it. It’s now at the point where I am starting to hate the upkeep. This is the longest it has ever been (I cut it myself when I was 4). Losing length isn’t a problem for me over all - I will slowly transition back to pixies and I want to have a few fun cuts in between. My hair has been extreme levels of closely cropped pixie so, seriously, no issues with drastic cuts, lol. I actually love to see my face and look change. \n\nBUT, I’m not ready to go that short yet. \n\nI was thinking alt style wolf cut (or something similar, I know there are variations, mullets, shullets, jellyfish, and the list goes on, I have been doing homework). My stylist is 100% up to any such task, she’s amazing, and of course does her own expectation management. I only want to know how to properly convey myself to her - even after 15 years. \n\nI want a cut that takes all the weight off and looks good - right now it’s gorgeous and all but it’s boring and washing/sleeping are becoming a problem. Not to mention my drains. \n\nThe first several inspo are just examples of the direction my head is going - crazy wolf cut that can be generally medium length but with long “tails”. \n\nThe last two are future plans. I really think the very long shullet will work for me, but im not ready to go from this current length straight to short bangs. I need a transitional cut or two!\n\nWhat do you think? Thank you for reading!\n",

I’m needing some hair advice/help! \n\nMy hair seems to be constantly oily at the root but very dry everywhere else, doesn’t grow very much at all, not shiny or silky, and on thinner side. \n\nFor some context: I do get my hair professionally done occasionally but it sometimes can be longer than 8+ months before I get the blonde highlights touched up and my hair doesn’t appear to be “dead.” I just recently spoke with my stylist and she said my hair did not appear to be dead at all and seemed to be growing. Although I will say, I have been growing out my hair for over 6 years and it is maybe 5-6 inches past my shoulders. It’s not “short” but it is definitely not as long and thick as I would like. Also, I do use heat occasionally but not all the time. I will sometimes blow dry my hair- usually not even all the time. And less often, I will straighten it, but usually only on nice occasions. \nMy mom and grandmother, from what I saw, both had similar hair to me, so I’m not sure if it’s genetics or if maybe there’s some super products I can use to help! \n\nSo here’s a couple questions I have: \n1. How do I get my hair to not be so oily on the top but dry all around?? I hate having oily hair so I struggle not washing it in the shower and dry shampoo makes me feel gross- but I know washing less often will probably help this.\n2. How do I grow my hair to be longer and thicker?? Product suggestions?? Tips and tricks?? I want longer and thinker hair so I am able to do different hair styles and curl my hair without it looking so flat and like I am bold… right now I practically ALWAYS wear it down  \n3. How do I get my hair to be shiny?? My hair always looks so dull and frizzy!!! I want shiny and beautiful hair!! \n\n",

      "content": "hi everyone, I am a long time lurker but I’m finally at my wits end so am posting here hoping to get some help! \n\nI’m going to book a haircut tomorrow but I don’t know what to ask for. These pics are what I’m currently working with and it’s been 6+ months since my last cut. My hair is quite thick and doesn’t look good just hanging down around my face so I wear it half-up pretty much every day just to keep it somewhat controlled, but I don’t like it that much. \n\nI want to go get a haircut that will give it a nice shape when down and complement the waves! Does anyone have any advice for what kind of cut would suit me? I have quite a square face so a style that softens that would be better.\n\nLast time I got my hair cut I asked for long layers and face framing but it turned out horribly - the guy cut these big chunks around my face that didn’t blend into my hair at all, imagine a set of stairs, that’s what it looked like. My fault for getting enticed by a £25 cut. You can still see it a bit in pic 2. The hairdresser I’m going to this time comes recommended by my friend who has an absolutely stunning head of red ringlets so fingers crossed. \n\nMy current routine is Tesco citrus shampoo and coconut conditioner (don’t judge, I’m poor) but I just ordered the Aveeno rose water shampoo and conditioner as I want to see if sulfate free anti-frizz products work for me. I use Umberto giannini curl foam and then a small bit of Umberto giannini curl jelly to hold down the frizz, then let it air dry. Hairdryers / diffusing makes the puffiness/frizz a million times worse. I’ve tried scrunching in my products vs smoothing them over my hair but I haven’t noticed a difference in the end result, the waves still appear in their usual pattern. I’ve tried so many different methods and products over the last 2 years and this is the best I have found so far.\n\nSorry for the long post, I really really want to sort my hair out! My main question would be what kind of cut should I go for but if anyone has more general advice I welcome that too! Thank you in advance !",

I have tried a slew of products and even home remedies, but none seem to help.\n\nSo, seeing this and seeing how my skin has changed in the last year or so to just look... bad... I was wondering if anyone had any product recommendations.\n\nCurrently, I am using an oil cleanser and The Ordinary's niacinamide serum. It does seem to be helping slightly, but I am open to anything else. \n\nDon't be fooled by the sheen in the photo - my skin is naturally dry. It doesn't matter how much I moisturize, I know that my makeup will forever look dry.\n\nI am working on diet changes and increasing water intake to help, but is there anything I can do for the (what I presume to be) sebum plugs and pores? I know that skin has texture, so I don't expect glass skin but I am hoping some improvement can be made.\n\nThank you! Xx",

(when i absolutely felt like i had to, i would use rosehip seed oil.) but my actives weren’t really doing their job and my closed comedones would linger around for way longer than they’re supposed to. i’ve used actives long enough to know how quickly they should be going away. once i added the honey balm, i noticed that some of the closed comedones started clearing faster, but others are still hanging around.\n\ni also have these weird tiny bumps on my chin that look like closed comedones (like right under the middle of my lips), but when i went to the dermatologist, she said they’re just normal texture that everyone has. they’re not super visible unless i prominently “push” my chin out, i don’t know how to describe it.\n\nso i guess i’m just wondering: • is there anything in my current routine that might be slowing down the turnover of those stubborn comedones? •\tany other ingredients i should consider adding (or avoiding) to help with that? • any tried-and-true tips for under-eye bags or prevention of early aging signs besides what i’m doing? • any better ways to fade marks from cystic pimples? no matter how little i touch them, i feel like they ALWAYS leave something behind. (currently drinking spearmint tea nightly and on spironolactone already) • how would you say my overall skin looks as of rn? i feel like i’m my own worst critic\n\nthanks so much! ",

I’m not asking to look 30 again, but I wouldn’t mind being mistaken for 36 or even looking excellent for my age. Is this just genetics and I should give up on spending thousands a year?

I thought it was over-exfoliating, so I stopped. No change. I thought it was my diet, my laundry detergent, my pillowcase lol 😭\nI was so fed up I decided to get methodical. I started a \"skin diary\" in my skincare app and my Notes app. Every day, I'd list the AM/PM products and take a quick selfie in my bathroom mirror.\n\nAfter two weeks, I was looking back at the photos. The only days my skin looked red and extra bumpy were the days I used my calming K-beauty moisturizer.\n\nI looked at the ingredients. It was packed with Niacinamide. I thought, \"No, that's supposed to be good for your barrier.\"\nThen I looked at my other products. My toner? Niacinamide. My Brightening serum? Niacinamide. My sunscreen? Niacinamide.\nI was layering it 4x a day without even realizing it. I was overdoing it on a good ingredient.\nI cut everything with niacinamide out. I bought the most boring, simple ceramide cream from the drugstore.\nIt's been 10 days, and the bumps are 90% gone. The redness is gone. My skin is calm.\nI'm so mad I was blaming everything else. Just because it's a holy grail for everyone else, check your labels, people! Anyone else sensitive to this stuff?",

I'm already pushing it with the price of some of the other products I use.\n\nI used to use a mandelic serum from a small acne/aesthetician clinic but it was almost $70 for a 1 oz bottle and it made my skin so irritated and discolored I had to stop. It did clear my skin up nicely, but the discoloration/irritation wasn't worth it.\n\nBecause I had success with mandelic acid clearing my skin in the past, I've decided to try this one made by The Ordinary. I've been using it only every third night for the last week and so far it is not irritating my skin.\n\nHas anyone had success with this brand of mandelic acid? Is there anything else I could be using along with it for greater success?\n\nMy skincare routine is this:\n\nAM: CeraVe foaming facial cleanser, Dieux air angel moisturizer, Alastin Hydratint sunscreen\n\nPM: Dermalogica pre cleanse, CeraVe foaming facial cleanser, The Ordinary mandelic acid, Dieux instant angel moisturizer\n\nI don't wear makeup on the daily, if I ever do it is BareMinerals brand powered foundation.\n\nThanks for reading through this and for any advice!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
