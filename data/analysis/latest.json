      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I eat a lot of sugars, reduced carbs and take whey protein. I have facial hairs due to PCOS so i use  facial hair trimmer twice a week.\n\nAbout the products🦩:\n\nFacial Skincare🫧: \n1. Paknet (derma suggested)🪼: skin feels cleared and very smooth. I did a little research and got to know benzoyl peroxide reduces pimple causing bacteria. So i guess it helps reduce pimple. I gently move my hands in circular motion clockwise and upwards to let me skin absorb it and then wash. (AM PM)\n\n2. Acne oc- moisturiser (derma suggested)🪻: reduces pores and moisturise my face. Regulates oil production on face. I have seen some change in my pores and oiliness. I again apply it and move my hands upwards to let it soak in.(AM PM)\n\n3. Adapalene (derma suggested)🦥: it has benzoyl peroxide so it helps reduce pimple causing bacteria and in turn help prevent pimples. I take a very little of it and again in circular motion upwards apply it all over the skin but not on sides of nose, under/close to the eye and in sides of my mouth. Once in two days. Can irritate skin if over used.(AM -use sunscreen after)\n\n3. Moisurex-hydra (prev derma suggested) 🐚: i apply it same way , circular clockwise upwards till absorbs. Its water based so good if you have dry skin.  (AM PM)\n\n4. a. Aziderm (prev derma suggested)🐝: it reduces pigmentation, pimple and pimple marks. Also helps in detaning. My new derma hasn’t suggested it, but it works well so i’m using it. Same application - upwards and in circular motion. I use it as night as you need to save your skin from sun after these products. Use it a little like adapalene as it can irritate skin as well (PM)\n\n4. b. Clindamycin (derma suggested)🐥: no idea what it does but i have to apply it everyday in the morning. Doesnt irritate. Same application - circular, upwads) (AM PM)\n\n5. Deconstruct vitamin c serum ( self suggested) 🪽- my skin has got tanned so started using it recently. Still waiting to see if it works. Read application on the bottle(AM PM with sunscreen)\n\n5 b. Pixi toner -(nykaa gift) 👾- its good, no idea what it does but doesn’t do any harm so yeah, good so far. I apply it with cotton in circular upwards motion. (AM PM)\n\n6. Sunscreens 🌞-( all doc suggested current and prev) - uv doux is best but is tinted. It feels heavy so i will get the non silicone based on from uv doux. Others are fine. (Every two hours under sun, 2x pinky finger size)\n\n7. Vaseline (self suggested) 👄- i have pigmented lips, used it daily whenever i felt my lips have gotten dry, started observing them getting pink and less dark.\n\n8. Meds ( derma suggested) 💊- green one is omega - good for hair and skin. Black one is antioxidant, and peach one is for pimple reduction. I take them everyday\n\n9.shatavari juice (self suggested)🍶- i have pcos, so i take it every day after meal at night, helps with pcos and inflammation i guess. Im using everything so dont know how exactly is this working. I have to drink it for another month or so.\n\n10. Medicube collagen night mask, vlcc detan mask, detan scrub (self suggested)🎭- once a week for tanning.\n\n11. Turmeric and red sandal (self suggested)🎭- got them recently, good for face, clears , depigments brightens. I use it twice a week, it leaves yellowish color, so use it at night.\n\nHaircare:\n1. Ordinary 👩‍🦰: (self suggested): reduces hairfall and dandruff. Works like magic. I have seen hair fall reduction and new baby hairs (PM )\n\n2. Serum (self suggested) 🪮- makes hairs manageable inturn less breakage. After wash or whenever im using heat.\n\n3.  Soul flower serum (self suggested) 🫤- unsure, but i would bot recomment too many stuff ordinary is best.\n\n4. Soulflower oils 🛢️- (self suggested) - best ones for hair growth and thickness. (An hour before hairwash)\n\n\nAll these products are what i use, not suggesting that they work like magic or will work for everyone, but my face is now pimple free and when i touch my skin now, smooth and soft🥰. With PCOS your skin, mood and everything becomes twice complicated😅, i’ll aways suggest doctors when you think skincare and health🔎. If you are in bangalore and looking for the doctor, i have some names. I’m can help you🙃.\n\n\nThanks and have a great skin and hair ♥️🌸\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I’ve tried aveeno oat gel, neutrogena hydroboost, eurecin urea repair, olay daily face moisturizer. Most of these either gave me closed comodones or weren’t hydrating enough. Maybe the closed comodones were temporary and I should have waited them out? I cleanse with neutrogena hydroboost and I like this.

So anyways, my washdays are rarely ever good, and never really end well. SO that's why I got to the \"Reddit is my only chance of success\" level of hair. So if anyone can tell me how to fix this HEAP OF DEFORMED RAMEN on my head, that would be awesome.\n\n\n\nHere's some info and a routine:\n\n\n\nHair Type: 3A, 3C\n\nPreferences: Volume and Definition, Shine\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Current Routine (wash day):\n\nI start with using the Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Defrizzing Shampoo. I coat my hair in this PURE LIQUID GOLD.\n\n  \n(Warning, Unknown Product) Then I use the Arvensis 2x1 Hair Mask for Coily and Kinky Hair. I distribute it throughout my hair and use my Tangle Teezer to get it everywhere. Then I clip it into a bun using 2 mini claw clips on each side, then let it sit for about 7 to 10 minutes.\n\nAfter, I rinse it out and use the Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Defrizzing Conditioner and get the final knots outs with my Tangle Teezer.\n\nThen, once done, I wrap my hair in a microfiber towel and get ready.\n\nAfter, I usually add a leave in or a curl cream. Usually, I'll use the Morrocan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream. However, if I need extra moisture, I would use the Aunt Jackie's quench! Moisture Intensive Leave-In Conditioner.\n\nI'll add the Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Gel after that.\n\nFor a more natural look, I'll add either the BIOSILK Silk Therapy Beach Texture Spray or the FOXYBAE Beach, Please Sea Salt Texturizing Spray.\n\nAfter, I use my Dyson Diffuser until there is NO wetness whatsoever and then pick a random hair oil from my collection.\n\nI let my hair stay in the bonnet for a bit, and then voila! Beautiful hair that lasts only  for a day! \n\nPLEASE HELP\n\n  \n\n\n",

Initially, they boosted my confidence and listened to my needs, but after about 2-3 years, they stopped paying attention and didn’t give me the cuts and styles I wanted.\n\nMy most recent stylist specializes in curly hair. She helped me embrace my natural curls. She made me feel so confident that I even cried happy tears during my first visits in 2022. However, for the past year, I've asked her for a curly shag haircut, showing her many photo references. Unfortunately, she keeps giving me the same cut, which I dislike. My last appointment with her in August was the last straw.\n\nIn September, I started looking for a new stylist. I found one with great reviews and reasonable prices, and I booked a cut and color. Sadly, I left with one of the worst cuts and colors I’ve ever had. I tried to fix it myself, but it didn’t help much.\n\nIf my favorite stylist no longer makes the cuts I love, and new stylists with good reviews disappoint me, I feel stuck. I'm scared to try to find another stylist. I've been unhappy with my hair for a year, and now it’s worse. I really don’t know what to do anymore. Has anyone else dealt with this?",

      "content": "Hello! I have two collages for you guys to look at and some brief context of why I think my waves are so messy and frizzy. I have changed hair products A LOT and have dyed my hair many times, but since taken a break. I am currently using the Native brand and Soapbox brand for shampoo and conditioner. I had their sprays too, but after some research I found a lot of people were dealing with thinning and frizz. I too.. am dealing with thinning and frizz. For extra moisture I use the soapbox brand too. I’ll put shea oil in my hair on extra frizzy days. \n\nDuring 2021 I used Cantu, but they’ve changed their recipe sooo much over the years and I can’t rely on that anymore. I cannot recall what I was using for shampoo and conditioner, but I honestly think it was Dove shampoo and Suave. I feel like my hair was so much fuller and bouncier in 2021! \n\nExtra info: I air dry my hair and do not blow dry at all. I sleep with a bonnet sometimes and use a silk pillow case ALWAYS. I do not go to bed with wet hair. \n\nWhat should I do? Go back to the basic routine even though they’re full of sulfates or try something new again? I think a hair cut is due for starters. ",
