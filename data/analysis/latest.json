The curls went a little flat. Usually when I practiced this style I didn’t let it sit for ~an hour between drying and styling. But I’m fairly happy with how it turned out. So frazzled that morning so I’m glad i practiced so much before!\n\n",

She did my colour, I usually dye my hair bright red (I get the products myself online and mix a good red base with a pure red mix), have been doing that for years without any issues. I told that hairdresser and showed her pictures and she said no problem I got the colour, let me take care if it.\n\nIn passing I heard her say \"burgundy\" and for a sec got worried. I told her again, no other colour than red, showed her my MIL tee shirt that was bright red and said that colour, nothing else.\nYou can guess where I am going. She does the colour, washes my hair and I end up looking purple ... Like bright Aubergine/eggplant purple. You should have seen my face... The hairdresser was asking why I looked so grumpy and that the colour was nice.\nNeedless to say I will never go there again.\n\nNow to my hair question. I am not a pro with colours other than red. I have been told that if I apply red right away on my hair now it will not look good as in the purple there is probably some black/blue color that will react with the red and give a weird mix if I apply the red right away.\n\nIs there a way I can \"cancel\" the purple? By apply an other colour that negates it or bakances it? Or do I apply the red right away? Will it work?\n\nThanks again for any tips and advice",

Now that I'm older this all kind of blurs together, its easy for me to remember distinct products/looks/etc- but lately I am finding that I simply cannot remember the website that all these youtubers were using and recommending.\n\nIt was veryyyy similar to Ulta and Sephora, but they had smaller indie brands (I remember they were one of the few places to sell lime crime), and I believe a pink design/theme. I am almost convinced that it was based in the UK or AUS and they shipped worldwide, I also believe they had the word \"glam\" somewhere in their name or logo. \n\nI'm mostly looking for nostalgia, but also because it was great to be able to buy all the different brands in one place.

I tried various kinds of oil-free products, mattifying gels, and lighter creams, but nothing really made a difference. By lunchtime, my T-zone would usually get shiny, and my cheeks often felt tight at the same time, which never made sense to me.\n\nOne week I randomly washed my face with cooler water because my bathroom heater broke, and my skin seemed to calm down a bit. There was less tightness and my T-zone didn’t get as greasy by midday. I didn’t change my cleanser or moisturizer; the only difference was the water temperature.\n\nIt seems that hot water can strip away some of your natural oils, causing your skin to produce a little extra to compensate. Using cool or lukewarm water can help your skin feel more balanced. Just avoid ice-cold water because it can irritate sensitive skin. Even this small change made a noticeable difference for me, and I did a quick search online and found some studies suggesting that cooler water can indeed help maintain the skin barrier and reduce excess oil.",

Wednesday conditioner \"wash\" without fully washing it off\n2. Saturday shampoo, wash it off, leave conditioner/mask for few minutes, then wash it off.\n3. Since my hair gets bed hair in the morning (if i shower in the evening rather than in the morning) i put mixture of water and conditioner on my hair with spray bottle.\n4. I put my mousse 2 times a week after conditioning my hair\n5. When putting product i scrunch my hair\n6. I dry it by leaving it air dry mostly, but i pat my hair slightly or if its late at night i plop.\n\n**Questions regarding routine, cgm etc:**\n\n* How many times a week can i put mousse?\n* My hair gets curly on top (big difference from before), but not as much curls as i want to probably beacuse my lenght is not as long? I'am a guy who is letting his hair grow to bit shorter than shoulder hair (surfer hair), so i don't have as much hair on sides as on top. Note: mousse defines curls much more and i get better curls, and i get better curls if i dont shower in the morning and i put conditioner water mix afterwards.\n* General advice regarding my hair for CGM?\n* Is it possible to get greekish curly hair on a wavy type?\n\nThanks for all,",
