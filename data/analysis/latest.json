I’m not joking, I ditched 2.5mg dut, stopped 5mg oral minox, stopped listening to dermatologists who are clearly paid actors, and just went upside down every morning. Blood finally reached my scalp the way nature intended and boom, temples filling in, crown closing, even my barber asking me what I’m on. This confirms my initial belief that the reason why we lose hair isn't DHT. It's the fact gravity is pulling our follicles back in, until they suffocate and explode. Doctors won’t tell you this because none of them can even hold a handstand for 10 seconds, so studies are limited for now. Might update in 6 months to see if this is permanent.",

A stylist recently told me I have strong natural curls and recommended growing it out for \\~6 months. I’m about 4 months in.\n\nI’m having a hard time telling whether what I’m seeing now is a normal curly grow-out phase that just needs shaping—or whether my curl pattern/head shape genuinely works better with short hair. I’ve gotten mixed feedback in real life, which makes it difficult for me to evaluate clearly.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n1. Is this current length/shape a normal curly grow-out phase that will pay off if I keep going?\n\n\\- Or does my curl pattern/head shape honestly suit short hair better?\n\n2. If the answer is “keep growing”, should I be doing maintenance shaping (sides, neckline, around the ears) to keep it looking intentional?\n\n3. If the answer is “cut it”, is there a shorter curly style that still works with my natural texture rather than against it?\n\nPhotos are anonymized. I’m genuinely open to either outcome—I’m just looking for curl-informed, impartial feedback.\n\n**Routine**:\n\nI shampoo and condition daily using Paul Mitchell Shampoo Two and Paul Mitchell Detangler conditioner.\n\nAfter showering, I do not towel dry. I let my hair air dry.\n\nWhile my hair is still damp, I apply a light Moroccan oil and DevaCurl cream using my hands. I apply both by scrunching the hair upward while my head is upright, letting the curls form naturally as they hang.\n\nI live in a humid area, so the products are mainly to control frizz.\n\nI do not currently use any protection while sleeping (no bonnet, scarf, or satin pillowcase), and I do not have a refresh routine on non-wash days.\n\nIf there’s anything else I should include for routine context, let me know.",

      "content": "Hi! I’ve come a long way with hormonal acne around my chin — it used to be much worse (you can still tell from the acne scars). Right now I take zinc and DIM daily. For skincare, I wash with Vanicream, leave it on for about 15 minutes, then use Vanicream moisturizer. I wear sunscreen when I’m in the sun, and sometimes I use clindamycin lotion at night. Other than that, my routine is very simple.\n\nMy issue is that I still get these tiny under-the-skin bumps that eventually turn into pimples, and I cannot get rid of them. I’ve switched toothpaste, I’ve been gluten-free since I was 4, and I tried cutting out dairy but didn’t notice much of a difference. I drink a ton of water and use a silk pillowcase.\n\nIs there anything else I can do to help calm these down or prevent them? Could something like peanut butter or Greek yogurt be contributing? I do go to the gym and eat a pretty high-protein diet, so I’m wondering if that could be playing a role too.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "I know, I know.. if I decide to cut my own hair, then I should be willing to accept that there is a large chance that it’s not going to turn out well. And yea, it happened but I think I’m just frustrated with my hair as a whole and not just because of this cut. My hair looks and feels healthy after the cut, which is why I did it. I spent 2years of growing it out cuz I couldn’t afford the $$$ haircuts and was finally fed up with how bad my ends looked. Bought hair cutting shears this weekend and cut it 2 days ago. Pics are my hair this morning. It’s looks extra raggedy now lol\n\nI think the culmination of seeing my hair look so chopped made me snap this morning lol. I’m just so exhausted by my hair with the amount of $$ I’ve thrown at it before (styling products, tools, hair cut $). And when I talked to my friend about it and how I was looking ‘choppy’ she had to say ‘well I wish I had your hair!’ 🤪… I’m pretty upset to say the least. I understand why she says that cuz curly hair can be so beautiful, but for some reason mine has never cooperated with me for the last 32 years. Doesn’t help that I have parents who think I should just brush it out and it will solve all my problems. SIGH! \n\nI guess to end this, does it look like there is anything I can do to fix my hair or should I accept my loss and keep it tied up for the next year or drop $300 for a stylist to look at it? Maybe I need to look up more hairstyles and see if that’ll save me..\n\nRoutine:\n1. I double cleanse with a clarifying shampoo (raw sugar the deep cleanse) and moisturizing shampoo (dove deep cleanse) then condition with dove intensive repair.\n2. After shower I use miss jessies leave in conditioner. After I section and comb out my hair with a touch of combing cream from Lola from rio. \n3. After brushing out, I use ouidad vitalcurl+ mousse and scrunch it in.\n5. Diffuse and pray",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

My neck looked completely different from my face and chest, and it made me feel very insecure.  Recently, I consulted a dermatologist, who suggested some creams like Glyco 6 and Epilite hydroquinone, and also recommended a test for insulin resistance, as I have mild acanthosis on the one side of my neck but test came normal. I was so happy that I didn't have diabetes . I had a glimmer of hope that the pigmentation might improve significantly with these creams. But I tried them for three months, and I didn't see much difference. I saw posts from some people who had seen results with brightening creams, so I tried Fix Derma's Skar Fix cream, but I haven't seen much improvement with that either. And now I'm following this current skincare routine👇🏽\n\nAm routine \nCera ve sa cleanser &amp; dove soap on alternate days\nDeconstruct 10% niacinamide &amp; 0.3% alpha arbutin acid \nMoiz lmf 48 face &amp; body lotion\nSunscoop brightening sunscreen\n\n Pm routine \ncleanser \nMoisturizer \nAqurea 20% cream &amp; skarfix tx cream on alternate days\n Has anyone been able to fix their pigmentation? please share your experience.

The last couple of months i have used \"pure willpower\" \n\nNow I call this \"pure willpower\" because normal willpower nowadays is fueled by phonk songs overlaied pictures that give people a 4 minutes motivation window before they are back to Gooning and watching subway surf videos. \n\nYou have to put away your phone and optimally put in flight mode, 5g signals don't interfere with willpower per se but has a an effect on bludflow. \n\nWell basically i have every day been repeating to myself \"massive regrowth, Norwood 3 kill, norwood 2 destroying, Norwood 4 shot in the head. Norwood 1 give me it. I have also looked in the mirror and screamed maximum regrowth and also just said out loudly \"grow hair motherfucker\" \n\nIf you gardening folks claim that talking to plants help them grow why wouldnt pure willpower TM 100mcg work??? \n\nI think i have stumbled on something huge. This a non hormonal non evaisive methad of increasing growth. I can defitive tell a growth on my Scalp\n\nOk its a bit invasive for the neighbours when i scream maxium bludflow and smash up the living room with my sword, thats the more extreme part, pretending Iventory is those damn androgen receptors and RNA that programmed them to be sensitive to androgen aaaaargh smash fuck you androgen hairloss \n\nPure willpower + 5ar inhibition + ru58841/ketoconzale should be the big three. There is a good reason i dont like minoxidil it affects calcium channels which maybe can affect your \"pure\" willpower. And we know it can mess with your heart rythm and make you hold water ",

The photo of me in the bathing suit is when my hair gets frizzy and just loses all curl definition. My hair is currently the longest it’s ever been and my ends and roots are not loving the cold dry weather up here. Any recommendations to a curly specialist from my curly headed Edmontonians? \n",

      "content": "Context- I am thinking I should layer a untinted mineral spf under a tinted spf but I wonder if just tinted is enough. I know derms say it is but I want to really be sure as sunscreen is the only real aging prevention. \n\nI am going to buy the Bubble spf 40 tinted. It has only 12% zinc oxide and was wondering if I should wear an untinted spf below - either 1) Trader Joes spf 40, 20% zinc oxide or 2) Prequel spf 50 pa++++, 18% zinc oxide I believe. \n\nI have a few questions - \n\n1) TJ's has a higher zinc content but lower spf than Prequel - which makes Prequel still more protective, right? \n\n2) I worry tbh about buying from smaller brands like Prequel with less R&amp;D- I imagine than bigger companies like TJ's (though its ofc not a skincare company) but I imagine TJ's has a bigger reputation to uphold. Too many times have skincare brands been proven to actually have less spf content than they claim to. \n\n3) I wanted to use just the Bubble spf alone but being only spf 40 and 12% zinc oxide makes me feel I should either wear a 20% zinc product under OR an spf 50 under (or some product that has both of those things - like eucerin/banana boat/babo botanicals) and use the bubble more as a skin tint to offset the white cast from my base sunscreen. Like use two fingers worth of my untinted sunscreen and then a little tinted on top. \n\n4) does using 2 different sunscreens with different formulations of course affect the performance? If i wait 5 min between the untinted and tinted is that okay? \n\n5) does wearing a tinted spf provide more benefit, even if its only spf 40, than an untinted spf 50 - simple because tint helps with hyperpigmentation? \n\n6) Do you think two fingers worth of Bubble tinted spf 40 is actually protective enough? (With no other spf under). I worry that spf 40 doesn't provide enough UVA protection. \n\nThank you",

I spent four years with a dermatologist trying every single topical treatment out there to get rid of my super bad cystic acne and after years and thousands of dollars, none of it worked. I started trying oral medication and it worked but only slightly and always came back. Got on accutane and it completely cleared up my skin. Four months after being off it my acne came back so I had to go back in for another 6 months round of accutane. Yet again cleared it up then started breaking out again. I got on minocycline and tretinoin to try to help with the acne and it’s doing a good job at keeping it at bay but now I have a bunch of hyperpigmentation, sun spots and texture that I want to get rid of. What would be the best bang for my buck to get rid of it? I heard laser and chemical peels are good for all of that but I don’t know if one is better than the other, I want cheapest but best option. If laser is 100x better then a chemical peel, even though a chemical peel is cheaper I’ll go and get laser done. I just want a nice fresh base again.",
