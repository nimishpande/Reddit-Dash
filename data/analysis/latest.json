      "content": "I saw the same hairstylist for the past 5 years and they’ve seen me through all my hair phases: pixie, short bob, long hair. The first photo is how they cut my hair the first time I saw them since I was growing out my pixie and realized I have naturally wavy hair. This was 2 years ago and I’ve since grew my hair out well below my shoulders. Looking back at pictures with my short hair, I really missed that era and went to cut my hair with them again. I showed them the reference and explained exactly how I want it to look but (third picture) this is what my hair looks like right now after trying to somewhat decently style it. The fourth photo is immediately after the haircut. I just don’t know what went wrong or what I should do… I realize my hair probably has to grow out before I do anything else with it but how do I go from this to the voluminous, wavy hair in the first and second photos? Any advice will be greatly appreciated 🙏\n\nMy usual styling routine are the Odele volumizing shampoo and conditioner, then the Twist by Ouidad lightweight styling gel and a styling foam. I usually diffuse my hair but it looked horrible with this haircut so I ended up straightening it. ",

I have dozens of these in my hair. A few times a week I sit down to search for these in my hair, and cut them off. I am worried it will start to make a difference in the length of my hair. I would love to avoid having to cut my hair like this. Does anyone have ANY tips on how to prevent these tiny single-strand knots? Is it OK if I just leave them there, and don't cut them off?? Because I would be down to do that, if there isn't a problem with it. it's SO FRUSTRATING because these knots are most often near the middle of the hair strand instead of the very end. I just cant resist cutting them off!!! Here is my routine:\n\n\\* 2 days a week I wash my hair, this is when I fully detangle by brushing it out with a Wet brush  \n\\* I let my hair air dry which takes several hours  \n\\* on wash day, I use two different leave in conditioners and curl cream  \n\\* every night I finger-detangle my hair (mostly) and put it into two braids  \n\\* every night I oil my hair while it is braided\n\nAs you can see, I try to minimize tangles as much as possible. But since my hair is so long, it's so hard, its practically always tangled. Please give me tips!",

However, I live somewhere that gets very dry/cold winters and my skin barrier gets a lot more damaged during that time.\n\nWhen I slow down on the actives to repair the skin barrier, my acne comes back in full rage, and when I try to add richer moisturizers, they just clog my pores more.\n\nDoes anyone have advice or product recommendations on how to keep my skin hydrated/moisturized in a harsh winter environment while still keeping my acne managed?

It's been about a year since I did so, and now, I notice that my hair thinning has been exacerbated.\n\nA hair transplant centre suggested 6 sessions of PRP to me, and said I will notice regrowth after about 3-6 sessions (each session being a month apart from the other). My research on Google, ChatGPT and Perplexity suggests that PRP will helpful, and will thicken my hair.

I wash my face at night with the vanicream cleanser and put the Rhode glazing milk. Then I wait 1h and put a small amount of tretinoin. Then I wait another hour and put the vanicream daily facial moisturizer. The first time I didn’t put anything else but yesterday I added the Avene cicalfate on top. This morning I woke up with my skin flaking (mostly around the chin and forehead)… I “washed” my face with water only, put the vanicream daily facial moisturizer and the cicaplast b5 balm from La Roche Posay. It’s been only an hour and my skin is flaking again… Should I use a face cream more moisturizing than the vanicream? Do you have any suggestions regarding my routine? (I also have the dermalogica powder exfoliant, should I use it while on tret?)\n\n(I’m not really acne prone, I’m using tretinoin because I have large pores, a few black heads and acne scars from when I was younger. I also use it for anti-aging purposes and to help with my complexion).\n\nThank you!",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

I tried to tone with a red conditioner, which did not work. Then I put brown box dye (Garnier Olia  darkest platinum brown) which just made it muddy sooo then… I finally added lunar tides magic Salem (dark purple) which did help reduce the muddy mess a little but it’s still green in the sunlight/flash.. so how can I fix this at home? I bought arctic fox just in wrath but I am scared to add more and make my hair even more muddy. Any help is appreciated and I did this over a span of a month or two. ",
