      "content": "Hey reddit! Looking for some advice on this crazy curl pattern change. Over the last two years, my curl pattern has gone from the beautiful texture you see on the first slide to the flat, sad pattern in the second, and I’m so lost trying to figure out why. I didn’t change my routine until after the change had occurred, stayed with the same amazing curly hair stylist for years, and didn’t change locations (i.e. water stayed the same). \n\nHere’s the routine I was using 2-3x per week:\n- Oribe hair alchemy shampoo (2 washes) + conditioner\n- Oribe leave-in conditioner\n- Oribe curl gloss\n- Oribe curl mousse\n- Scrunched dry with a microfiber towel, then diffused on low heat. Finished with kerastase oil and oribe anti-humidity spray. \n\nAfter I really started to get frustrated with the change, I tried:\n- Two different heat protectants for over a year, thinking maybe heat damage was the culprit\n- AG Care Renew Clarifying shampoo once per week, thinking buildup may be contributing\n- Innersense True Enlightenment scalp scrub once per month \nThese changes did not make a difference :(\n\nI have consistently used a silk pillowcase and silk bonnet to sleep, both before and after the change. \n\nI fear that, after doing some research, the culprit may be hormonal changes associated with a change in my birth control, or maybe this is just aging-associated change that I can’t control. But, before I jump to talking with my doctor about making major medical changes, does anyone have any other ideas I can try? \n\nTIA for your help and for reading, I miss my curls and really appreciate your help getting them back!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Applying sachiko frizz cream while wet &amp; combing out hair with a wide tooth comb.   \n3. I then wrapped around heatless overnight curls, still wet.  \n4. I use silk pillow cases. It’s just as bad without the overnight curls and worse if I blow dry it.  \n\nCould it be a diet/nutrient thing? Am I totally off base with products?  ",

It dries pretty fast if I air dry. \n\nThis is what I used and is pretty typical for my weekly routine:\n\nType 3C Curl\nShampoo: Wella - Fusion Intense Repair Shampoo &amp; Dove Daily Moisture Shampoo\nConditioner: Wella - Fusion Intense Repair Conditioner \nDeep Conditioner: NYC EVA Hair Therapy Mask\nLeave-in: As I Am Classic Leave in Conditioner\nOils: Castor Oil (didn’t put on in these photos)\n\nToday I scrunched with old tshirt to soak up extra water. I put on my bonnet while a tad bit damp. \n\nI tend to struggle with frizziness. Especially in the back of my hair. More in a specific spot it’s frizzy and doesn’t like to curl up like the rest.

At that point, it does give more “order” to my hair, but at the expense of the “fluffy” look.\n\nThe pics shown have been taken on different days throughout the last week to show how much my hair’s appearance can vary. Lately I’ve been washing it 3 times a week because I want to prevent it from being over-dry, but I do like how it looks immediately after being washed better.\n\nOut of the pics, I like pics 8 and 9 best.

      "content": "Hi, guys. After nineteen years, my hair curled/got wavy when I trimmed the dead ends-- This was early october. With it now being January and my hair not having reverted, I figured I was stuck. I used to hair straighter/maybe a bit wavy hair, amd no one else living in my family had this hair(My maternal aunt did, but she passed as a teenager, unfortunately, long before I was born) and no one knows how to care for it. I am doing my best after neglecting my new curls.\n\nI have not acquired a 'Routine' yet, as I have not proper done research and have not done been very responsible. I know I have damaged by hair. I use a regular hair brush, but my mom suggested using a wide comb(she is slowly doing research with me) so I will be picking one up. My hair is also very, very thick; very long. My hair also likes to frizz. It also does not like to sit in generic hair ties very well. It was always a nightmare, now it's worse.\n\n I do not have a refresh routine, I air dry my hair, I do not style with any products, and I do not \"protect my hair while I sleep\". I also do not dye, bleach, straighten or curl my hair. I do not part my hair. These are all things I really have to do some research into and care for. It's all very... overwhelming, almost.\n\nI use OGX for Shampoo and I alternate between Bond Repair Repair &amp; Protect, and their Clarifying Strength+ Refresh and Clarify; I am a woman, and I have cycle, during that cycle I use both some days because my hair gets really greasy and oily[very ucky]. I don't use too much conditioner, but the brand is also OGX and it's something like Repair &amp; strengthen. OGX cleans my hair best. I seldom use conditioner, as everything I've tried makes me hair frizz worse. Which sucks big time.\n\nI picked up Shea Moisture-- Kalhari Melon Oil-- Curl Stretch Refersher spray on an impulse at Walmart. Not smart, I know, but I decided earlier that day that I wasn't going to fight my curls/wavy-curls--?-- any longer and that I was going to embrace them. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips? Brand recommendations? Hair care? Anything at all? I'll gladly take any advice or suggestions you have.",

      "content": "I’ve been trying the Foxtale Oil Balancing Moisturizer for about 3 months, but very sparingly. Every single time I apply it, I get huge, painful pimples/pustules. Because of that, I stop using it. After 2–3 weeks, once my skin calms down, I try it again… and the same thing happens.\n\nThese aren’t small bumps. They’re big, painful pimples that take weeks to go away.\n\nI initially thought this might be purging, maybe because of azelaic acid or some other active in it, but I’m confused now because:\n\n\t•\tI’m not using it regularly (only once, then I stop)\n\n\t•\tIt’s been 3 months and the reaction is the same every time\n\n\t•\tThe pimples stop when I don’t use it\n\nMy routine is very simple:\n\n\t•\tChemist at Play face wash\n\n\t•\tSometimes Garnier Neem Face Wash (this actually helps reduce my pimples)\n\n\t•\tIn winter, I occasionally use Nivea cream (the white one) and that does NOT break me out\n\n\t•\tNo other actives, no serums, nothing else new\n\nSo this Foxtail moisturizer is literally the only different factor that causes these breakouts.\n\nAbout my skin:\n\n\t•\tI’m 25\n\n\t•\tOily skin in summers\n\n\t•\tNormal to dry in winters\n\n\t•\tI don’t use moisturizer daily — only when my skin feels dry\n\n\t•\tHonestly, when I just stick to face wash, my skin seems fine, like it has enough oil on its own\n\nMy questions:\n\n\t•\tIs this actually purging, or is my skin just reacting badly to this product?\n\n\t•\tIf I start using it regularly, will my skin “get used to it” and stop breaking out?\n\n\t•\tOr should I just stop using it completely?\n\nBecause right now, this is not fun anymore and the pimples are painful 😭\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone who’s experienced something similar.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

I also like to appear somewhat androgynous (idk if I do though) but sometimes I like presenting fem sometimes or masc!\n\n(any other fashion tips and dressing advice would be appreciated if you see potential but please be kind &lt;3)\n\nP.S. My current routine includes the OGX Coconut Curls Shampoo and Conditioner. I run the John Frieda Dream Curls Hair Gel through my hair after this then use a diffuser to dry upside down. \n\nSometimes to style I use the Schwarzkopf Curl Flex Crème (especially during mornings to refresh and fix my bangs!) When my hair was longer a bonnet really helped but with shorter hair it didn’t really work so I use a silk pillowcase with a bandana on top with bangs out. I wash my hair every 2-3 days.\n",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m very new to skincare and honestly pretty ignorant about most of it, so please be gentle 😅\n\nI’ve been really lucky with my skin my whole life. I’ve never had acne or breakouts and usually get maybe one pimple a year. Because of that, I’ve always been hesitant to put products on my face and have kept my routine extremely minimal.\n\nRecently I decided to start taking my health and skincare more seriously (eating better, drinking more water, etc.). A friend gave me the Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water (pink cap) and since it’s marketed for sensitive skin, I thought it would be very gentle and safe. I did a lot of research beforehand and only saw good things. The bottle also says you don’t need to rinse it off.\n\nThat night, the only thing I used was the micellar water. I wiped my face afterward with a warm towel (which is basically all I ever do for skincare, just a warm washcloth morning and night). I also used salicylic acid, which I’ve used in the past without ever having an issue.\n\nWhen I went to bed, my skin looked fine. A few hours later, I noticed in my phone reflection that my face looked really bumpy. I checked the mirror and had tiny white bumps all over my face. I’ve never experienced anything like this before and it honestly really upset me. It’s been about two days now and it hasn’t improved and if anything it might be slightly worse. I’ve just been gently wiping my face with wet towels, but I’m not sure if that’s helping or making it worse.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this with this product? Does this sound like irritation, a reaction, or something else? Should I be doing something to help it go away, or just leave my skin alone?\n\nIt really sucks that this happened on New Year’s when I’m trying to get my life together, and now I feel like I messed up my skin 😞 Any insight would be really appreciated.",

Thank you to everyone who has helped. People mentioned swatches on my jaw and neck for best match. I’m thinking Armani shade 3?? Also, what is my undertone? Ulta and Sephora say I’m cool toned but any foundation with pink in it looks white or to warm. \n\nWhich shade looks best, if none look good please tell me. If you know of another shade that would look better please lmk! Thanks 😊",
