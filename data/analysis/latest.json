      "title": "What is the science behind 'less damaging' hair dryers such as the Dyson?",
      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "My dermatologist instructed me to use adapalene 0.3% by waiting 30 minutes after cleansing (so skin is completely dry), then applying a thin layer, and **not** applying anything else before or after—not even moisturizer. She emphasized this multiple times.\n\nI’ve tried searching for the rationale behind this, but I haven’t found any clinical sources or guidelines that support a “no moisturizer” approach with adapalene. In fact, most reputable dermatology sources and clinical advice suggest using a moisturizer to help reduce irritation and dryness, especially during the initial adjustment period.\n\nTo give more context:\n\n* This is the dermatologist my family physician referred me to.\n* I waited 6 months to see her, and both times I met her, she was very evasive when I asked questions.\n* When I brought up my confusion (since I couldn’t find this advice anywhere else), she just said, *“Don’t believe everything you read on Google.”*\n\nNow, two years later, I still get acne (though slightly reduced), but I also have persistent dry, flaky spots that never fully healed—despite using healing ointments on them (outside of my adapalene time window).\n\nI’m on another waiting list to see a different dermatologist, but in the meantime, does anyone know the medical justification (if any) for using adapalene completely alone, with no moisturizer before or after?\n\nLike adapelene, or adapelene + moisurtizer didn't clear my acne. But I DO KNOW that just using adapelene definitely made my skin barrier worse.\n\nSo it seems my acne isn't even gone and my skin barrier is more damaged using her approach.",

I’ve been following the curly girl method for a two months, but I’m still not happy with what happens after wash day.\n\nRight after washing and styling, my hair looks pretty nice overall — defined, soft, bouncy (well maybe there’s still some cast)(pics 1-2) But after just a few hours (especially by the evening), it loses definition and shape (and maybe cast). The curls get frizzy and stretched out, especially on the top layer.\n\nHere’s my routine:\n\t•\tWash and condition my hair\n\t•\tApply leave-in/cream\n\t•\tDetangle\n\t•\tScrunch\n\t•\tApply gel\n\t•\tScrunch again\nI let it dry naturally \n\nI used to use mousse before gel, but I didn’t really see any difference.\n\nAnother problem is that the hair on the top of my head is much less curly than the rest — it tends to stay flatter and frizzier.\n\nOn the last photo you can see the products I’m currently using.\n\nAny advice or product suggestions would be super appreciated. I really want to figure out how to keep my curls defined and consistent throughout the day and actually make the whole hair curlier, make my top layer look better 💫\n",

      "content": "My hair is struggling to curl. It only curls at the ends, and i feel like for the most part it's because my haircut has no layers (i only have face framing pieces).\n\nHere's my issue : last time i went to the hairstylist (first pic is the most recent, 2 months after i went there), she refused to give me layers and told me my hair was too thin for that. Individual strands are indeed thin (would the right term be fine hair?) but i feel like my hair is still a bit dense, and with a blunt cut, i kinda look like a cocker dog. \nIs she right, or just lying to me cuz she wouldn't know how to style it?\n\nThen, she proceeded to cut it as straight as she could and for a few weeks even my ends stopped being curly.. She once tried a curl \"routine\" on my hair but just dried it, brushed it and then added a curl cream. The detangling part was really rough too. It obviously looked terrible.\n\nHere's my routine and what i know about my hair :\n- honestly any shampoo, sometimes a sulfate free one. doesn't seem to change a thing\n- sometimes garnier banana hair mask/cocoa butter\n- garnier avocado conditioner or energie fruit coco conditioner\nI add a very small amount of banana hair mask as a leave in after every wash. I make sure my hair is not stuck to my roots and i scrunch properly. When i refresh, i spray water mixed with my leave in. I wash every 4 to 5 days, and these days i sleep in a braid since my hair won't curl correctly anyway.\n\nI don't use a gel because i don't like how it feels; it's hard to remove the crunch and i mess it up most of the time. It looks better when i stop at the leave in.\nI just stick to drugstore products because i'm tired of buying stuff that doesn't seem to do anything.\n\nI think my hair is low porosity and it seems to be straight at the roots. I don't think it's a routine issue, it's just how my hair is supposed to be. It looks wavy overall but i can see small curls pretty much everywhere and if that matters, it's even curlier around the neck/ears. That's why i'm wondering if it could look curlier.\n\nShould i search for another hairstylist or should i stick with this hairstyle? If you have good reference pictures, i'd like to see them! btw i'd prefer it if i could keep my length.\nenglish is not my first language so i hope it wasn't too hard to read..",

      "content": "Hi there! This is a very unique situation, but I'm hoping someone can help.\nI work as a jeweler and my hands, arms, face, and neck get pretty dirty throughout the day due to a polishing compound we use, little pieces of metal flying everywhere, dust, etc. I love having good skin and had a great routine going before this job, but lately have been struggling with breakouts, clogged pores, dry skin, and fine lines because of how rough my work environment can be. I try to wear a mask and gloves when I can. I have found a good hand lotion which creates an invisible barrier so my hands are easier to get clean. I was wondering if there are some product suggestions people may have for my face and neck too.\nI'm looking for suggestions or ideas to keep my skin clean, make it easier to wipe dirt off, or keep skin plump and hydrated.\nI also noticed recently when I focus really hard I purse my lips and get kind of more noticeable laughing lines - would it be silly to wear something kind of similar to an under eye mask but on my laughing lines around my mouth underneath my N95 mask? Like a small collagen sheet mask? I don't care if it is silly...I'll try it!\n\nI use a Cetaphil moisturizing cream in the morning so it will last throughout the day, but my N95 mask will typically absorb some of it when it comes in contact with my face. I also worth with flames and chemicals that tend to dry out the air around me, so my moisturizer doesn't seem to go as far as it should.\nIt also doesn't seem to help much with preventing the dirt/soot from sticking to my face and I have to do a lot of tough scrubbing to get it off. \nWhen I come home I have to double cleanse even after wiping my face off and you'd be amazed how gross my washcloth looks! \n\nAny thoughts or tips are appreciated!",

      "content": "im in my early 20s and i have pretty normal skin. its never dry or oily and i don't have any issues with acne or pimples. for most of my life, i never really had a skincare routine and just slapped on any moisturizer ever morning and called it a day. this past year or so, i decided to actually try taking better care of my skin even if it feels low maintance, and i noticed that my skin starts to look dull later in the day. i love the initial glowly, hydrated, and smooth look i get after i apply my skincare, but of coure, later in the day it just gets dull and my dark circles start to look more prominent especially in bright flourescent lighting (my work has these lights everywhere). im wondering if there any recommended products i should probably use or any changes i should make to my current routine to keep my skin from looking dull later in the day?\n\nmy current routine (morning and night):\n\n1. wash my face with warm water (i used to use a cleanser but i stopped when my bottle ran out lol)\n2. la roche posay triple repair moisturizer on damp skin\n3. (only in the mornings) beauty of joseon rice + probiotics sunscreen\n\ni used to have more skincare products like cosrx snail muscin serum, the ordinary products, exfoliating scrubs, etc. but i didn't feel much of a difference from using them so i just stopped :/ i also recognize that i don't drink enough water every day and i've been tracking that better lately so hopefully that helps too. my biggest concerns are overall dullness later in the day and my dark circles. any tips/recommendations would be MUCH appreciated thank you !!!",

I already tried tretinoin and completed a full isotretinoin course, but my skin still breaks out mostly on my cheeks and jawline. I’d describe my skin type as combination with an oily T-zone, and I feel like my acne might be hormonal.\nMy routine is simple: a gentle cleanser each morning and night, a light moisturizer, and daily sunscreen. I’m careful with diet and don’t use many products. Still, the inflamed pimples keep coming.\nHas anyone experienced something similar or found a solution when topicals and isotretinoin haven’t worked? I’d appreciate any advice on what to try next or what might be the underlying cause.\nThanks in advance.\n",

      "content": "Hi there! I only started experimenting with styling my hair wavy/curly earlier this year after years of bleaching and coloring, but I’ve honestly never styled my hair wavy/curly even when I was younger so this is all new to me. The first photo is from one of my first attempts at styling it wavy/curly, then I cut it short to start over fresh, and the next photos are some of the progress I’ve had with the last photos being the most recent. I cannot air dry my hair, while I have finer strands I have a LOT of it and it takes hours if not an entire day to air dry, so whatever style I do, I have to be able to diffuse it to mostly dry. I only wash a couple times a week max due to the time investment and I don’t have super greasy hair. \n\nMy current wash day routine is:\n- Loma moisturizing shampoo and conditioner\n- “It’s a 10” leave in conditioner and detangle with wet brush\n- (The rest of the routine is bent over with hair upside down)\n- With sopping wet hair, rake in some Loma curl cream and Paul Mitchell sculpting gel\n- Brush through with bounce curl brush and gently shake to form curl clumps\n- Scrunch and pulse with hands (I get a nice squish sound when I do this)\n- Scrunch in a little bit of Loma volumizing mousse (doesn’t provide much hold)\n- Scrunch out extra water with microfiber towel\n- Cradle ends of hair in towel and start diffusing upside down, once a little bit of a cast is in place, then gently lift roots and tilt head until I’m right side up again, and finish diffusing right side up.\n\nI’m hoping to get some guidance on:\n1. I’m not getting a very good cast most days, but I feel like the best wave and curl definition I get and least amount of frizz is when I have a decent cast. Is this an issue with my products or with my technique?\n2. I struggle with getting a consistent curl pattern, it seems like I have some clumps that want to wave, some that curl, and some that have a complete mind of their own, but it looks different every single time! Is this normal?\n3. I don’t currently do any “refreshes” throughout the week. Once my waves/curls have relaxed a couple days in, I brush them out and wait until the next wash day. Any tips for getting the definition to last longer?\n \nAppreciate any tips or product recommendations!!",

I already tried tretinoin and completed a full isotretinoin course, but my skin still breaks out mostly on my cheeks and jawline. I’d describe my skin type as combination with an oily T-zone, and I feel like my acne might be hormonal.\nMy routine is simple: a gentle cleanser each morning and night, a light moisturizer, and daily sunscreen. I’m careful with diet and don’t use many products. Still, the inflamed pimples keep coming.\nHas anyone experienced something similar or found a solution when topicals and isotretinoin haven’t worked? I’d appreciate any advice on what to try next or what might be the underlying cause.\nThanks in advance.\n",
