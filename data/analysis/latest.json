      "content": "I got my first ever curly cut march this year and I absolutely loved it. My curls were healthy and I loved the shape. The curls in the first photo is from September this year so about 3 months ago, and the second photo I took at the beginning of this month. I’m extremely upset with the way my curls have been looking. I know that the longer your hair gets, the more the curl pattern stretches out. However, I don’t understand how so much can change in such little time. In the second photo the shape is off and my curls are really..thin? I’m not sure how to describe it. I’m noticing some pieces start really thick and then towards the bottom it really thins out. I’m not sure if this is breakage? I haven’t really done anything different so I don’t understand why this could be happening. I shampoo and condition once a week, I sleep with a silk bonnet, I detangle my hair with a detangling brush and lots of conditioner, I don’t use any heat besides diffusing, ect. I have always had the same routine and it has always worked for me. I just don’t understand why suddenly my hair appears so damaged. After my curly cut I wasn’t getting regular trims because my hair seemed to be growing healthy and I didn’t feel the need so I don’t know if that could be the reason? Now I’m thinking about doing a big chop but I’m not sure if there are anyways I can save my curls?",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I’ve always had 3B hair, but after a boxed dye job and a lot of blow-drying, I’ve lost quite a bit of my curl definition. The damage happened slowly, so I didn’t really notice until recently.\n\nI don’t think my hair is damaged enough to need a big chop, so I’m planning to slowly cut it over time and experiment with lengths/styles till most of the “damage” is gone by midsummer. While I do miss my curls, I’m trying to embrace my looser pattern (around 2B/2C), and honestly I kind of like them.\n\nMy main issue right now is frizz/poofiness. When my hair was curlier, it was easier to accept frizz because the curls were more noticeable, but at its current state its much \"poofier\" and simply looks uncared for by Day 3..\n\nIs there anything I can do to make it look shinier and clumpier? I’ve been looking into products with a laminating effect, but I’m not sure how healthy that is long term. Has anyone tried hair gloss?

I have watched a lot of makeup tutorials (some are helpful, others are not) and I am very overwhelmed. I have many questions, (some are stupid) for each makeup step and I hope I could get some answers/advice./help, Thank you in advance (it's a lot of questions, sorry in advance), My skin is combo in the summer/spring and dry in the winter/fall\n\n(When I ask \"How do I know it is blended\" I mean how do I know if there is a harsh line and if it looks even because after staring at myself for so long, my face kind of looks like one blob)\n\nOverall: What does patchy mean? What are some things that I should avoid while doing each makeup step? What is good lighting to do makeup in? What is the right steps to do makeup?\n\ntools: What are some brushes I need for good application? Brushes or sponges or other tool? What tools are the best for each step?\n\nskin prep: what are some good ingredients for skin prep?\n\nfoundation/concealer/skin tint: How do I know it is blended? How do I know it is the right shade? (if I step outside after applying, how do I know it will look the same/be the same shade?) What does \"cakey\" and \"creasing\" mean?\n\ncontour/bronzer: What is the difference? How do I know it is blended and doesn't look like mud? How do I choose the right shade? Are both necessary?\n\nblush: How do I know it is blended? How do I choose the right shade? How do I tell if it is emphasizing my texture? Should I do cream then powder or vice versa (and when in the routine)?\n\nhighlight: How do I know it is blended? How do I know if I put too much? How do I know choose the wrong/right shade?\n\neyeshadow: How do I choose the right pallet?\n\nmascara: Are falsies or mascara better? What does \"clumpy\" mean? Should I choose volume or length?\n\nbrows: How do I know if they look natural or \"blocky\"? What is a good natural brow routine?\n\nsetting powder/setting spray: Pressed or loose powder? Should I do setting power then setting spray or vice versa?\n\nlip: How do I choose a lip liner shade? How do I know if it looks good on me?\n\nThank you so much in advance, also please leave any makeup recommendations if you feel comfortable",

Used curlsmith styling soufflé to scrunch in large sections and air dried. Then curlsmith bond oil to get out some of the crunch. \n\nI’ve liked keeping it long, but am looking for a cut that will help highlight my hair type, and how to find a curly/wavy stylist. \n\nWhat type of cut do you ask for when you get your haircut??

I asked her directly if extensions would still work and blend well with that cut, and she assured me it would be fine.\n\nWhen I left the salon, I initially thought it looked okay, but once I washed and styled my hair myself, I realized the top layer is WAY too visible. It honestly looks ridiculous — you can clearly see where my natural hair ends and where the extensions start.\n\nI have a lot of natural hair, and it tends to puff up, get frizzy, and gain volume very easily. Because of that, it literally looks like I have my real hair on top and then two thin strips of hair hanging underneath from the extensions. There’s no blending at all.\n\nAnother issue is color. My natural hair has reddish/orange undertones, and while I do have blonde highlights, the extensions are more brown with blonde, and something about it just looks off and mismatched in real life.\n\nI already booked another appointment to add more hair, because that’s the only solution I could think of, but now I’m not even sure if adding more extensions will actually fix the problem — or if the cut itself is the real issue.\n\nHas anyone dealt with extensions not blending because of a butterfly cut or very short top layers? Would adding more hair help, or does this need a recut / different placement / different color match?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated. I’m feeling super frustrated and disappointed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h6gmlv5afw9g1.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e21b09261c59a63b4427fd5c6ee6ecbd89867bcb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/isbodzhbfw9g1.png?width=492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bee2736980c33e223e16c112d170a19661997b5d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5u2wlmcfw9g1.png?width=446&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbb66e1035ea00503d114a73065d8654e008c80a\n\n",

I don't know what to do to make it better. I've looked up makeup plots and how to make facial features look more masculine, but it always turns out I'm looking like drag or barely noticeable.\n\nIn the first picture is my most recent attempt using a contour/concealer stick (palladio cinnamon) where I feel it's too soft/not very noticable. The next set is me using eyeshadow (LA colors cool) The final set I feel looks good, it was done by a drag king though a few years ago, and I've been trying to replicate it.\n\nSo anyone have any tips or suggestions so it doesn't look like drag but isn't light enough so it's not noticable?

I've been lurking on this reddit for a while and checking the guides, so here it goes.\n\nMy hair is dark and dense (I think), and based on what I've seen, I think it is type 3. My porosity is low. I uploaded some pictures from today with no products on. I was trying to figure out what type it is.\n\nI've been using Cantu Products for, like, two years because I used to never let it grow, but I've been liking the curls. Here's my routine: I wash my hair every week with Cantu Sulfate-Free Cleansing Cream Shampoo and Hydrating Cream Conditioner. I detangle with a wet brush and then apply Leave-In Conditioning Cream and Moisturizing Curl Activator Cream. During the week I apply Wave Whip Curling Mousse or a little bit of the Activator Cream. For styling, all I do is rake my hair with my fingers then shake my head and hope for the best. I tried finger coiling but it was a mess hahaha\n\nSo long story short, I guess I just want to confirm what type of hair I actually have and what products would work best for me and how to take care of it because now I live in RI and it's winter, and I don't know if that can have severe impacts on it too.\n\nThank you in advance for reading my post and offering guidance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c2c5217lv9g1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85a7092b72c10666451e8dc2ec1ccc975d6afbdc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k2jltf17lv9g1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=544e5406a58f8b8fb3d0daae3cf91ff78b3318c0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dcapo217lv9g1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5ddabffcf8f1e380dbee50d145cd242125a1211\n\n",

I wear light makeup on most days and I feel if I don't double cleanse I won't get any make-up off. I don't want to use anymore oil cleanser as it's giving me a stye when I use around my eye make-up and I recently got a lash lift which won't hold long if I use oil cleanser. \n\nCurrently my routine is:\n\nEveryday AM: cleanser, toner, vitamin C, moisturizer, sunscreen.\n\nPM routine: oil cleanser, cleanser, toner, vitamin C, moisturizer.\n\nPM routine (3x a week): oil cleanser, cleanser, glycolic acid cream. \n\nThanks in advance.
