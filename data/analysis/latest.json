      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\nThought I’d share my 4200-graft HT journey since this sub helped me so much when I was deciding what to do.\n\nI’d been thinning pretty fast in my late 20s. My hairline was almost gone and the mid-scalp wasn’t looking great either. After months of lurking here and stalking results, I ended up going with Dr. Heena Kudyar. A few people here had mentioned her, and I liked how natural her hairline designs looked.\n\n\nConsultation:\nSuper straightforward. She checked my donor, talked honestly about what could/couldn’t be fixed, and suggested around 4200 grafts to rebuild the hairline + add density through the front and mid-scalp. No pressure, no sales pitch.\n\n\nSurgery day:\nLong day but surprisingly chill. They drew the hairline (looked way better than anything I’d tried imagining myself), numbed me up, and the extraction/implantation was smooth. I was awake the whole time and the team kept checking if I was comfortable.\n\n\nRecovery:\nFirst two weeks were the usual paranoia: “Did I sleep wrong? Did I knock a graft out? Why do I look like I got head-butted by a goat?”\nBut everything healed normally.\nResults:\n\n\nMonths 3–4: sprouts\nMonths 5–6: big jump\nBy month 9, honestly… I couldn’t believe it.\n\nMy hairline looks natural, density is way better than I expected, and people who hadn’t seen me in a while literally thought I just “changed my hairstyle.”\nZero regrets.\n\nPosting because I know how scary it is to commit to 4k+ grafts. If you’re on the fence, I get it. Feel free to ask anything—happy to help someone the way this sub helped me.",

The before photo was considered a very good skin day.\n\nCleanser:\nLukewarm water in the morning. Nothing else.\nIn the evening, any gentle cleanser- Cerve Foaming Cleanser or Aveeno Calm+Restore Oat Cleanser.\n\nAcne:\nAccutane 30mg every other day (started at 20mg).\nFinacea 15% Foam (Azelaic Acid) 2x daily after cleansing.\nSalicylic acid 2% (Paula’s Choice BHA Toner) 1-2x weekly after cleansing.\n\n    Comments- Talk to your doctor about low-dose accutane. Side effects are usually minimal and it works wonders. \nAzelaic acid is way underrated. Helps with redness, acne, and irritation. Prescription foam formulation is less irritating and dries fast with no pilling. Insurance pays for it, savings card on their website if copay is high (n/a for Medicare/Mediaid). ANUA has an excellent OTC option. \n\nTexture:\nGlycolic Acid (The Ordinary) 1-2x 2eekly.\n\nMoisture:\nSkinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream 2x daily.\n\n    Comments- A GAME CHANGER. Currently on sale and 1/3rd the price of Skinceuticals’, while performing the same if not better. \n\nSun Protection:\nSupergoop Unseen Sunscreen every morning. \n\nGo slow and pair back the routine at the first signs of irritation.

      "content": "Hello!\n\nSo a few months back my hair did a complete 180! I went from a very, very slight wave to tighter ones and even some ringlet formations. I’m pretty sure this was because I finally had a medical problem being addressed that was affecting my hair growth and overall health. But because of this, I’ve had to endure a steep learning curve on how to take care of my wavy/curly hair.\n\nIn the summer it wasn’t too bad — I live in Ireland, so the summer climate is kind of mild and didn’t affect my hair too much. But winter? Ugh, it’s so bad 😩 Yesterday, I spent ages styling my hair, but all the rain, humidity, and cold made it fall flat so quickly and left me with fuzzy frizz. I was so disappointed.\n\n**My routine yesterday:**\n\n* Shampoo: Ouai Detox &amp; Redken All Soft\n* Conditioner: Redken All Soft\n* Leave-in &amp; heat protectant: Redken 25-in-1 + heat protectant\n* Before diffusing: Keune Spring Loaded\n* When 60-70% dry: Umberto scrunching jelly\n* Method: S2C and rise it out completely\n* Sleeping: Pineapple hold\n\nI diffused with a claw clips yesterday near my roots and it actually worked pretty well, and my hair looked gorgeous once dry! I was really happy with it.\n\nI’m thinking maybe the products I’m using aren’t the best for this kind of weather, so if anyone has ideas, recommendations, or just general advice, I’d really appreciate it. I do live in Europe, so some products are harder to come by, convenience is a bonus.\n\n**About my hair:**\n\n* Low-medium density with medium-thick strands, so very heavy products weigh it down\n* Flat roots and curls start closer to eye level but those around my face which are layered start closer to the root.\n* Looking for some volume, but I don’t know where to start\n\nI see so many beautiful people on here with flawless curls, and I’m so envious!!\n\nAny tips, product recs, or advice would be amazing. Thank you in advance! 😊",

Some pictures from that long ago seem to at least suggest to me that my hairline is consistent for the most part. \n\nFor some context, I started working on losing weight in April, and lost 85 lbs as of today, about 7 months later, but my blood work shows no D3/B12/Iron deficiency (other than higher than normal Ferritin and Iron-Binding Capacity for some reason, despite normal Iron level) so I don't know if this was actually from losing weight. \n\nI have a physical coming up and waiting on a referral for a dermatologist, but in the meantime, I was hoping to see if any of you have some insight into this.

I live in a super humid part of TX and am constantly running around campus, so I originally thought a matte setting spray would be perfect (ngl I chose it almost entirely bc I hate how sweaty my upper lip gets). But now my makeup is looking really cakey and almost powdery (not sure how to describe it, but it's like separating on my cheeks)\n\nFor context, my skin is: dry, sensitive, textured, acne scars, and lately some cystic acne on my chin. I’m a brown girlie so I have some hyperpigmentation too\n\n**Current Skincare Prep:**\n\n\\- TORRIDEN dive in serum\n\n\\- BRINGGREEN Cica Moisturizer\n\n\\- BoJ Aqua Fresh Sunscreen\n\n**Makeup Products Used:**\n\n\\- CONCEALER: \n\n* nars soft matte for acne &amp; radiant creamy for under-eyes \n* I also have the nyx bare with me but it feels rlly drying and separates so badly on my face T\\_T\n\n\\- SKIN TINT: alternating between the Armani &amp; NYX buttermelt glaze\n\n\\- BLUSH: house of hur dewy &amp; rare beauty cream blush\n\n\\- POWDER: I always set with the OneSize pink powder to prevent transfer\n\n\\- SETTING SPRAY: I only have the Milani Matte setting spray right now and I'm trying to finish it before committing to something new, but it just feels weird on the face and it makes me so dry.\n\n  \nI’d really appreciate any advice on makeup prep for dry skin and if you’re familiar with the products I’m using, I'd love any tips for making them work better (mostly bc IDK if the other products are what's causing the seperation)🙏 \n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY, I desperately need **hydrating/dewy setting spray recommendations** (drugstore + high-end). I don't really mind if the longetivity isn't that great, but I really want something to help melt everything together and stop the cakeyness. \n\nLiterally any help or advice at all is appreciated !!!\n\n",

I have been using cerave blemish control cleanser with salicylic acid more recently) \nMoisturiser (another Simple one, whichever is available) \nSimple’s SPF 50 invisible UV fluid \nAt night I wash and moisturise with the same products. \nUp until a few months ago this routine has done me well for years. \n\nI noticed the small bumps about a year ago, and after some research decided to introduce a salicylic acid face wash into my routine (please note I have incredibly sensitive skin). My skin got worse, but I was expecting a purge so just carried on until now. Now not only do I have angry, bumpy skin, but it seems some areas of my face look coarse too. I’ve given up all products for a week (including moisturiser) to see if the inflammation reduces, but my skin doesn’t seem to have changed. \n\nThe bumps aren’t itchy or sore, but I do have combination oily/dry skin. The rest of my body is completely blemish-free. I haven’t changed my shampoo, conditioner, or any other products in this time. \n\nIf this is a broken skin barrier, how should I go about fixing it? If not a broken skin barrier, does anyone have suggestions on what this could be? Fungal acne maybe? This is making me so self conscious. Thank you! ",

I’d washed it once or twice since (aside from washing the dye out afterwards). Everything was fine until last night.\n\nI put Not Your Mother’s Beach Babe dry shampoo in before going out; I think I used more than usual. I ended up sweating because I was dancing (not sure I’ve ever used it and gotten sweaty afterwards. I ended up with a little bit of a rash behind both my ears/on my neck. And there’s a spot or two on my scalp that itches, too. Also, this is a bottle of dry shampoo from 2021 — I had no idea about the class action lawsuit over benzene until now.\n\nJust trying to figure out whether I’m reacting to the dye or the dry shampoo. Isn’t 2.5 weeks a really long delay for an allergic reaction? I washed my hair and took an antihistamine an hour ago but it’s still itching. I’m going to try hydrocortisone now.\n\nI plan to stop using the dry shampoo entirely and try a path test with the dye first if I use it again.

They have helped, but I just switched pills which reduced my antibiotic amount, and my acne is already really bad again. I was hoping maybe if I try to cut down on sugar and drink more water it would help reduce my acne by a good amount. I can't stand my acne anymore, especially being the only friend in my friend group who struggles with it. I also feel like that's the only thing stopping me from feeling pretty so it's even more hard to deal with it. my acne is on my cheeks primarily where there's a bunch of tiny bumps (fungal) and then i get 2-3 big pimples on each cheek region. I don't mind the pimples' size tbh its the redness that bothers me. so if you also have any tips to reduce the redness it would be greatly appreciated.",

      "content": "Hi, my partner is self conscious about body hair. She has a cheap thing that she uses but as it is cheap, it is naff. \n\nI want to get her a good hair removal product for Christmas to help with her self confidence but being a man I don't really know what I'm looking at or for. \n\nThe money isnt too big of an issue and I've seen the two screenshots attached with some good reviews. \n\nThis seems to be a better option than going for actual laser removal which per session would be well over 100 pounds.\n\nCan anybody please advise me on potential products I can look into or buy?\n\nIm also not sure on the difference between the two models on the screenshots and what one does compared to the other. I've also seen Philips Lumea which I believe to be similar?\n\nPlease help any advice appreciated ",
