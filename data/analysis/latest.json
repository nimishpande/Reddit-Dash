      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Pretty normal, right? I have said that I do not need them, because I already have a figured out routine suitable for my hair type. “But you are not curly! You do not need to spend 2 hrs on styling!” On WASH DAYS. And simply because my hair is dense. And low porosity. My brother has a hair type that naturally curls on its own. But my hair (fine, dense, low-po, 2b-2c) needs more support to achieve its full potential and true pattern and tightness. My routine is my self care and grounding that really helps with my mental health. But no. I am called “delusional” and that I “complain”. \n\nHas anyone had those experiences before?

But it really is a struggle.\n\nWould love to get some advice on:  \n1. Maybe even getting more beautiful curls  \n2. How to deal with the knots. Do I need another comb? brush? something? Should I start with using conditioner or?\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "title": "My skincare journey",
      "content": "My skin was totally clear until sixth grade. And ever since then I have had extremely deep and painful cystic acne all over my face. I went to a dermatologist whilst my face was full of deep red acne and the dermat said that in my age (14) it is normal and hormonal. She prescribed me ahaglow facewash and zitmoist as mousturizer. That was all. \n\nMy experience with both was very bad. Bad in the sense that neither of it did absolutely nothing for my acne. The facewash felt too drying for me and the zitmoist gel felt like nothing. It was not at all hydrating or moisturizing. \n\nI switched to a more hydrating moisturizer (Johnson's milk+rice cream) and a different gentler cleanser (Neutrogena extra gentle cleanser). I would say in terms of hydration these were better but my acne was still super bad. \n\nThen I began researching into skincare and nutrition. I cut down on dairy especially milk and sugar. And I decided that I had to use an active to target my acne. I ended up buying the Cosrx BHA serum. I used it for nearly 1.5 years and it did help with my acne to some extent. But it works extremely slow. Took me about 6 months to notice a reduction in my acne. I started using plum gel moisturizer also and Joy 5.5 hydrating gel face wash. \n\nAfter that I used tranexamic acid and alpha arbutin serum from minimalist for all the scars that had formed on my face. I absolutely love alpha arbutin for scars and hyperpigmentation. And for the active acne I started using The Ordinary glycolic acid. I had high hopes for it but it did not do anything for my acne. 😭 It had absolutely zero effect anywhere either on my face or body😢\n\nAnyways this is my current routine now which for me has been working absolutely fabulously. I only get a few acne during my periods, they are like surface level white heads and they just dry out in a day and pop on their own and don't leave scars. So I'm not really bothered by them. I'm very happy with how my skin looks and I'm going to stick to this routine.\n\nMy skin is by no means perfect. I have quite a few icepick scars from the acne plus there is hyperpigmentation as well. But imo those are part of my natural skin and this is just how I look and I'm totally okay with it. Acne is tough to live with, I know. You just have to be patient and find the products that works for you. It took me more than a decade to get here and who knows it might come back later too. But believe you me acne is not going to stop my life, nor has it ever😇\n\nCURRENT ROUTINE\n\nAM \n\n1. Simple barrier care replenishing cream cleanser\n2. Aziderm 10% gel \n3. Cosrx snail mucin. \n4. Cerave moisturizing cream \n5. UV Doux silicone sunscreen gel spf 50\n6. Foxtale lip balm\n\nPM \n\n1. Simple barrier care replenishing cream cleanser\n2. Benzac AC 5%\n3. Cosrx snail mucin\n4. Cerave moisturizing cream \n5. Boroline on lips\n\n",

      "content": "Please help: Men’s skincare problems\n\nRequesting some expert advice for men’s skincare. Here are the symptoms: irritated skin, periodic pimples on irritation, and recent over exfoliation\n\nSome background info:\n\nI have been trying to perfect my skincare routine. Unfortunately I need to shave daily, which also means i have to exfoliate daily in order to make the hair soft enough and to get a clean shave. From what I understand, this is totally possible to do, i just need to know what is causing my skin to peel as if i just got sunburned. and how i keep managing to break out with about 4 pimples/zits/red bumps scattered across my face any given week (they are always different). Here is my daily routine currently:\n\n1. Neutrogena hydroboost daily exfoliant with hyaluronic acid while in the shower.\n(i suspect this is the problem that caused the peeling because i recently got it and used to exfoliate with a weekly locitaine exfoliation mask, and used the daily exfoliant the day after i used said mask. Should i stick with this after my face heals from the over-exfoliation)\n\n2. Lather Bump Patrol cool shave gel, let sit for a minute, re-lather\n\n3. Shave using gillette labs razor, shave with grain, re-lather, shave perpendicular to grain.\n(this could potentially be a problem for my skin, but i feel as though my hair doesn’t cut well after one pass with the grain. Should i switch razors to a safety razor like henson?)\n\n4. witch hazel textured pad wipe to tone and ease redness of bumps and irritation.\n\n5. Bump Patrol Max Strength aftershave, let sit for 10 minutes. \n(This is the only product I use that will hold my peeling at bay long enough for me to go out in public.)\n\n6. Moisturize with kiehls facial fuel for men, let sit for 10 minutes\n\n7. Cologne\n\nI think my biggest problem is over-exfoliation, but there has to be a way or a product for me to exfoliate before i shave. And am i just bad at shaving or should i switch razors to something that gets closer and doesn’t nick? or is it something else?\n\n ",

I think I'm not using enough product but then when I do, sometimes my hair feels heavy and still frizzy yet gelled- you know the look? Sorry the pic isn't super clear, it gets curlier than this but on a regular day of just wetting + product it's kinda wavy like this.\n\nSo my main curiosity to anyone reading is- I often feel afraid to put a sufficient amount of product on my hair every single day, so I often resort to just waking up and putting my dry hair in a bun and then of course when i take it out, the curls are all bent and patterns are messed up. (Wetting it and putting oil isn't enough.) I don't know if it's financial reasons, lack mindset reasons, or I'm scared to damage my hair but what would actually make me feel good about myself is having my hair down and moisturized every single day, and put it up with clips if needed so I don't bend and ruin it. **Do you all think it's okay to put a good amount of leave-in or curl cream every day?** (I guess idk what the alternative would be anyway, except just keeping it back some days.) Routine:  In this picture I wet it, put cantu curl cream, cantu argan leave-in, and then some eco gel (probably too heavy but the regular tresseme gel sometimes feels too thin and just frizzes my hair lol). I usually air-dry my hair. Should I just keep trying more quantity of product? Or a different product/routine you recommend? I wash once a week or every-other week. Thank you! ",

The problem is, I always knew how to care for my virgin hair, but not for dyed and bleached hair. Last year, I dyed part of my hair red, and I really loved how the color turned out. The problem? It completely ruined my hair's shape. It was like it was too dry, and the curls wouldn't hold the same. I let it grow out, and now I only have a little of that dye left, but I want to try it again. At the time, I used a dye and a color enhancer. My routine is simple: shampoo, a hair mask, and conditioner. Then I use very little (almost none) of the hair mask for styling and gel. After that, I use a moisturizing mask once a week or once every two weeks. I define my curls with scrunches and curl them strand by strand once a week.

Most days it looks like the first or second picture. Sometimes it's super wavy and curly in places when I've done nothing at all. \n\nI am mixed race. My mum has very curly thick hair (British) and my dad has thick black straight pakistani hair. My hair is somehow both and I think this is why no routine works. \n\nI've tried doing the cast method but it just looked wet and stringy, leave in conditioners make it greasy. Diffusing works only for a bit. It honestly looks the best when I've been caught in the rain and I've let it dry naturally, it goes kinda curly then. Salt water has nice results but made it sooo tangly. At the moment I'm using head and shoulders shampoo because the dry scalp is crazy, I've tried not using that because I heard it wasn't cg friendly but the itching never improved. \nI use garnier hair foods conditioner and in between washes I use inecto hair serum, my hair doesn't get weighed down by that. \n\nI have no idea if my hair needs more protein, more hydration, more nothing. I'm just wondering if I'm beating a dead horse maybe? Any advice welcome before I give up completely. Thank you for reading. \n\nFirst photo is my hair two days after wash day.

Now I love my hair and I'm trying my best to take care of it but I can't tell what type it is or if there's something wrong with my technique or products. I have to restyle it every morning and I'm not sure how to style it so it's soft instead of in a rigid middle part. \n\nSo my routine is this so far. I start by shampooing my hair thrice, once with a gentle wash, then with a curly hair shampoo then with a two in one shampoo and conditioner. I then use coconut conditioner, brush, ten minutes and wash. After that I apply Aunt Jackie's Leave in, brush and separate into the top part of my hair and the bottom. Apply mark anthony curl cream and Aunt Jackies mousse to the bottom and curl with a curl brush. Do the same to the top. I'm not sure how to use gel without it creating wet frizz so I don't use it anymore. Scrunch with a silk cloth and let it air dry. That's it! I'd love any advice!",
