Goal wasn’t “most talked about,” but “most positively talked about.\"\n\nMethod in a nutshell:  \nScraped 60+ “what Vitamin C should I buy?” threads and product rec Megathreads  \nUsed GPT-5 + Gemini 2.5 to extract product mentions and classify sentiment  \nScoring = 70% positive vs. negative differential + 30% positive/total ratio  \nManually merged name variants so duplicates didn’t inflate scores (e.g., “CE Ferulic,” “C E Ferulic,” “Skinceuticals CE” → one entry) also used some other sentiment metrics, won't bore you with all the nerdy stuff.\n\nIf you want see the full sentiment and raw comments, check it at: RedSummary dot com/best-vitamin-c-serum (or just google RedSummary)\n\nWould love to get your feedback!

      "content": "Over the past 6-7 months, the curl pattern on top of my head has basically become nonexistent and it frustrates me so much. I've tried so many things to bring it back and am not 100% sure why this happened, and frustrated because the bottom half of my hair curls just fine?? Even though it has friction damage and split ends?? I have a haircut scheduled on Wednesday with a curl specialist I haven't seen for a while due to distance/pricing, and I'm hoping she'll be able to help.\n\nThe first three pictures are from October 2024, and then pictures 4-8 are all from the past 2-3 months, with the last one being the most recent.\n\nMy main guess is that my haircut I get changed. Previously it seemed like the gal who cut my hair was doing more of a curly cut, whereas the person I've been seeing for the past few months has been doing more of a mullet/shag cut with razor, which I really love for fine texturing but is it possible that it could make the hair have a hard time curling?\n\nThe only chemical changes that I have done to my hair are continue to bleach my bangs and the side pieces on my hair, which in October 2024 was being done professionally, and as of the past 1-2 months, add in color, but the top layers were flat even before I added color.\n\nEven when I get out of the shower with freshly clean hair or scrunch the top layer with products, it just won't curl. The most I get is a wave or it stays limp. \n\nI use a variety of products since I've been trying to figure out how to bring it back. Here's my routine:\n\n1. Shampoo: Typically use Innersense Pure Harmony Hairbath, but yesterday I bought Olaplex No.4 (bond maintenance shampoo) if clarifying, which I do once a month, I use the Kristin Ess Deep Clean Clarifying Shampoo\n\n2. Conditioner: Innersense Hydrating Cream Conditioner. I also have the Olaplex No.5 Bond Maintenance conditioner but haven't used it yet.\n\n3. Other products (leave-ins): Typically use some form of leave-in conditioner after showering which is the Innersense Leave-In. I also use Not Your Mother's Bonding Leave-In Protector. Today, I used the K18 Leave-In Molecule Repair Hair Mask. \n\n4: Other products (styling): AG Care Foam Weightless Volumizer w/Heat Protectant, Innersense I Create Curl Memory (although I've been too lazy to use it recently), topped off with either Verb Ghost Oil OR Trader Joe's Pure Jojoba oil.\n\n5. Drying method: InfinitiPro Diffuser by Conair, low air, cool heat. Hover for the first 5-10 minutes, then pick up curls into the diffuser cup and hold for about 1-2 mins, repeat around head until 80-90% dry. Scrunch with oil when 100% dry.\n\n6. Anything else to know?: I have high porosity hair, so I try to keep a balance of moisture and protein which has always been difficult for me. I've been trying to grow my hair out for forever but always have to get the ends cut because of split ends and damage from friction due to sleeping with no protection. As of the past 2 weeks, I've started to wrap my hair in a silk scarf and put a bonnet over it when I sleep. When I'm not sleeping, I'm usually wearing my hair down. I use the BounceCurl brush to 'clump' and style my curls once the product is in, and it makes my bottoms layers curl nicely, but it just makes the top even more straight, no matter what angle I use or how I curl the brush.

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Hi!! \n \nLooking for some advice and I feel like I’m getting desperate. I want to improve my skin texture, especially around my eyes, but I’m not sure where to start. I’m very unhappy with the way my makeup turns out and even without makeup I feel like the fine lines and bumps beneath my eyes are so incredibly prominent. I look back at photos taken recently and I feel so discouraged with my skin in general, but especially my under eyes. I’m 27 but I feel like my skin ages me so so much. I eat well - mostly vegetarian - I drink tons of water every day, I do pilates 3-4x week and I walk about 4 miles daily. I will admit I have trouble sleeping at times, but I wouldn’t think sleep alone would be the cause of my skin issues. \n\nI’ve always struggled with acne, currently I use CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser with 2% Salicylic Acid face wash and CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion morning, night, and after workouts. I’ve been using differin gel nightly for about eight months. I feel like this routine has helped with my acne, but I could still use some improvement. But I feel like lately my skin just looks so dull, creased, and aged. I’m open to changing up anything at this point to get skin that looks fresh, moisturized, healthy.  \n\nBased on the research I’ve done I know I need to add an SPF and I think some sort of retinol eye cream will help. But I’m so overwhelmed with the amount of products out there. Honestly, would the best options involve prescription tret and maybe some Botox? I know you guys are not dermatologists, but any advice or product recs while I wait for an appointment with one would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you!!",

I've never bleached my own hair before, so I would like some advice regarding the products and the process i should follow.\n\nAs you can tell by the first picture, my hair is dyed with a copper/reddish color bath (mixed with 10 volume peroxide), but my natural hair is closer to dark brown. I've been reapplying that copper color for a year now. Since I only want to bleach my bangs, I'm not sure if I should use a color remover on them beforehand. Also, I was thinking of using a 30 volume developer, but I'm not sure if that would be a good idea given that my hair is already very dry and I'd like to avoid unnecessary damage. I'm also not sure if I should use foil.\n\nWhat is the most effective and healthy way to achieve a blond close to the one on the second picture?",

I've never bleached my own hair before, so I would like some advice regarding the products and the process i should follow.\n\nAs you can tell by the first two pictures, my hair is dyed with a copper/reddish color bath (mixed with 10 volume peroxide), but my natural hair is closer to dark brown. I've been reapplying that copper color for a year now. Since I only want to bleach my bangs, I'm not sure if I should use a color remover on them beforehand. Also, I was thinking of using a 30 volume developer, but I'm not sure if that would be a good idea given that my hair is already very dry and I'd like to avoid unnecessary damage. I'm also not sure if I should use foil.\n\nWhat is the most effective and healthy way to achieve a blond close to the one on the third picture?",

I cannot always rely on diffuser for 15-30 mins every time, so ive been air drying my hair for the most part. Now it's getting cold and it's taking much longer to dry, also i don't think it's good to just chill around with wet damp hair during winter. I used to tie and tuck my hair in the towel cap thing, but this flattens the curls to nonexistence and makes them VERY frizzy. Is there a similar alternative for wavy hair? Would bonnets help? Also my hair is always frizzy sometimes less than others and my curls/waves hold 2 days max.. losing my mind rn lol\n\nCan't post without including my routine:\n- shampoo twice\n- conditioner\n- leave in\n- curl cream sometimes, then brush with definition brush\n- gel and scrunch",
