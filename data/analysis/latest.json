I recently just cut off 3 inches of my bleached under dye to try and get rid of all of my split ends and breakage so on my acknowledgment of trying to keep my hair healthier I don’t know how often I should be washing my head. Should I base it off of how quickly my hair gets oily or should I wash it like twice a week which is what I do now.\n\nmy routine since it’s mandatory\n\nI use the not your mother’s curly bonding shampoo and conditioner on Sundays. I use the eva NYC deep conditioner.\n\nto style I use skala as my leave and not your mother‘s moose and the big papa gel\n\nusually all air dry if I have time, but if not, then I diffuse, which makes my hair look like shit. I don’t know if I’m just doing it wrong.\n\nalso, I use silk hair ties and the silk bonnet every night to sleep",

      "content": "I’ve been going to the same hairstylist for about two years now. We have great conversations, she sometimes gives me free trims, and I’ve recommended her to a lot of people (I’ve brought her multiple new clients). I was also one of her first regulars after she graduated cosmetology school, so we’ve kind of grown together.\n\nHere’s where I’m struggling.\n\nIn my area, there aren’t many hairstylists, especially blonding specialists. Recently, I’ve been low-key stalking the Instagram of another stylist. the girl who works at the chair behind hers. I LOVE her work. She focuses heavily on hair health and does the exact style I’m looking for.\n\nSome of the issues I’ve had with my current stylist:\n\t•\tShe bleaches over already bleached hair\n\t•\tMy balayage isn’t blended the way I like\n\t•\tMy inspo photos never really turn out how I want\n\t•\tI’m worried about long-term hair health\n\nI’ve tried to trust the process, but after two years, I still don’t feel like I’m getting the blonde I want.\n\nThe hard part is the emotional side. She calls me one of her favorite clients, we genuinely get along, and I feel bad because she’s been generous with me and I’ve supported her business from the start.\n\nBut at the same time… I’m spending a lot of money on my hair and I don’t love the results. The other stylist’s work aligns perfectly with what I want, especially her focus on keeping hair healthy.\n\nSo now I’m stuck between loyalty/guilt and doing what’s best for my hair.",

      "title": "[Routine Help] Woken up with dryness around my eyes - possibly Aquaphor related?",
      "content": "Hi guys - I need some help as I’m not sure what’s going on… A couple of months ago, I noticed that I was getting dry, flaky skin on my eyelids. I assumed this was caused by, a) the winter weather and the heated air indoors, and b) migration of harsher products onto the more delicate eye skin during/after my routine. \n\nI came to reddit and one of the suggestions was to put Aquaphor on my eyes at the beginning of my routine, as in before any other products, to keep harsher exfoliants etc. away from them. Aquaphor was also recommended as being super moisturising. \n\nSo, I started using Aquaphor as my first product on a morning and evening and covered my whole eye contour with it. Then I would use my other products around it on the rest of my face. In the first couple of weeks of doing this, I did notice that the flaky skin on my eyes was healing up and the skin felt moisturised, so I kept doing it. \n\n After a month or so, it felt like the Aquaphor was less effective at healing up the dry skin (there was no flakiness anymore but still a slight redness and sensitivity on my eyelids), but it was preventing any new dryness from occurring and maintaining relatively healthy skin. \n\nFast forward to this morning - I wake up with very slight itchiness around my eyes, look in the mirror, and… I have huge dry patches mapping almost exactly on to where I have been applying the Aquaphor. \n\nI do not think this can be a reaction to the Aquaphor or any of its ingredients since I have been using it for weeks with no issues before now. Instead, I wondered whether putting the Aquaphor on at the start of my routine (before any of my moisturisers) had left my skin too dry in those areas since I was applying water and then nothing else except an occlusive? \n\nAssuming that using only Aquaphor with no moisturiser was the issue, I put my CosRX Snail 96 essence on this morning under the Aquaphor and it feels slightly better. But still, I’m confused as to why this reaction has happened so severely and so suddenly when I have made no recent routine changes - should I stop using Aquaphor altogether? \n\nAny help would be massively appreciated! See separate comment for current routine \n\n ",

It fizzed beautifully in the water. I poured the water, let the bath bomb drop in, and settled down with a cozy towel nearby. The water changed color in a fun way, and I started feeling relaxed almost immediately.\n\nIt was the first time I noticed how little I’d been taking care of myself. My muscles relaxed, my mind slowed, and I actually had a few quiet minutes to just breathe. I ended up drifting in and out of dozing, realizing I’d been more tired than I thought.\n\nLooking online, I saw some fun designs on Alibaba and other marketplaces, mostly to see what kind of ingredients or colors were popular. Local shops also had small artisanal options that looked so cute I almost didn’t want to use them.\n\nI can’t believe I missed this for so long. I’ll definitely be adding bath bombs to my self-care routine. It feels simple, but the impact on your mood is huge, and it’s such a fun way to treat yourself.\n\n",

I’m looking for advice on if this is a communication mistake on my part or if something went wrong. Either way I plan on asking for a revision. \n\n  \nI have previously gotten a partial balayage from this person before and they did great. I have never gotten a full balayage or highlights, just partials, on my current hair. I decided I wanted to have a more dramatic hair lightening experience so I opted for a full this time. I didn’t show them a photo but I previously had pretty bright highlights so it seemed obvious to me that that’s what I am into. The hair dresser suggested I do some low lights with the balayage to add back in some more definition, which I happily agreed to. Then he asked me if I wanted him to “bring it all the way to the ends or not“ which he suggested not to do because it would be “too streaky.” I was hesitant but agreed, and I thought we were still talking about the low lights only. Then he got to work. \n\n  \nPhoto 1-3 is my hair after, 4 is before, and 5 is what I expected. What should I say? Is this my fault somehow? ",

      "content": "hello, i’m struggling with skin issues.\n\ni’ve had chronic eczema for over 5 years now, mainly near my knees, breasts, and a few other parts of my body. i’ve seen two different doctors in the past. the medicines usually help while i’m on them, but the eczema always comes back once the course ends.\nfor the last 7–8 months, i’ve been under a lot of stress due to personal reasons, including the demise of a close family member. since then, my body and skin condition have become much worse.\n\ni’m 5’2” and currently weigh 64 kgs, which puts me in the overweight category. i’ve never been this heavy before, and i honestly don’t eat that much, so i was thinking of getting blood tests done to rule out any underlying issues.\n\nlast month, i visited a government hospital because the clinic i used to go to was getting too expensive. the doctor there diagnosed me with: \nscabies with eczematisation,\nlichen planus hypertrophicus with oral lesions and,\nwell-defined itchy plaques. \n\nshe prescribed me:\npernil lotion, \ncetirizine, \nitin 12 mg,\nomnacortil (steroid), \npantoprazole, \nhalovate ointment (steroid), \nand moisturex cream.\n\nwhile i was on these medicines, the eczema on my breasts started clearing up. however, once the medicines stopped, it came back even itchier. i also feel like the steroids caused my skin to break out badly.\n\nbecause that doctor is in another city, i visited a local doctor here. he said the breakouts are acne caused by steroid use and prescribed doxycycline capsules and acnestar cream. i’ve had a few pimples earlier too, mostly on my forehead and above my upper lip, but those usually appeared during or before my periods.\nover the last year, i’ve also noticed a few brown spots under my eyes. i’m not sure if they’re sun spots or freckles. i actually like how they look, but i hope they’re not harmful.\n\nas for skincare, i use, \ncetaphil / cerave cleanser\nre’equil moisturizer\ntonymoly mochi toner\nsnail mucin\n\nto be honest, i’m not very consistent with applying these products.\n\nany advice or similar experiences would really help. thank you for reading.\n",

      "content": "I have oily skin (including my scalp) and never used to need lip balm. Last winter, my lips became extremely dry, and the skin around my mouth started flaring badly. Lip balms (I’ve tried cicaplast, nutritic, vaseline, aquaphor, etc…) initially felt soothing but eventually made my lips even drier and didn’t help area around my lips. The only thing that helped was face moisturizer.\n\nI used Sebamed moisturizer for oily skin (light texture, helped irritation), later I got Sebamed moisturizer for dry skin just on my lips and area around. \n\nOnce the weather warmed up, the issue mostly went away. Occasionally my lips and area around it would get dry, but using face moisturizer once in the morning was enough.\n\nRecently, things have gotten much worse again. At first, I thought it was perioral dermatitis, but after looking at photos, it seems more like lip licker’s dermatitis, even though I almost never lick my lips. If I don’t constantly reapply moisturizer, the irritation around my mouth becomes severe (and even with moisturizer, the redness is still there).\n\nThe skin around my lips is very dry, red, flaky and itchy. It’s painful and honestly affecting my confidence; I hate how it looks and don’t even want to go out anymore.\n\nThis is my current routine for my face overall (unchanged for a long time): \n\nCerave cleanser for oily skin\n\nGood Molecules niacinamide serum \n\nCetaphil mattifying acne moisturizer\n\n\nQuestions:\n\nDoes this sound like lip licker’s dermatitis? \n\nWould La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume be okay to try? Or would something else be better? \n\nShould I change anything in my regular routine?\n\nTL;DR: Oily skin, but severe dryness and redness around lips (likely lip licker’s dermatitis). Looking for product recommendations and advice on whether I need to adjust my routine.",

Honestly, I've always been clueless about my curly/wavy hair and no one to ever ask tbh.\n\nMost conditioners usually weigh down my hair a lot and I struggle with finding hair products that I'm not allergic to.\n\nFor a year my hair routine worked great until my hair started shedding like a dog, I was mortified because it came out of no where! I have kept the same gel and mousse but my new shampoo/conditioner is super drying. I tried to soak my ends in coconut oil but it was like it just vanished in my frizz.\n\nI was using volumizing shampoo and conditioner from Native (yikes, I know, but I swear it was working) Now I'm using Maui Moisture lightweight shampoo/conditioner. (Waaaay to drying.)\n\nThen I finger comb and squeeze curl mousse and gel from Herbal Essences and air dry.\nI wash my hair twice a week and use Eva Nye freshen up dry shampoo maybe once a week when my roots get a little greasy.\nI also only use satin pillow cases. A little note to make, I have two lock of hair I usually keep braided like rat tails, but they're usually two big ringlets. Rn they're so dry and frizzy though.\n\nNow, here's my problem. I have A LOT of allergies. I cant have any sort of proteins like soy or nuts, nor gluten or eggs. I know that's definitely hard when looking for good curly products.\n\nSince I have my two little \"padawan\" braids, my hair is at two different lengths unstyled. I knowwwww it looks pathetic right now trust me, taking a picture of the back of my head felt like a JUMPSCARE 😆🤡 The first picture was my curls at their peak even while using Native at the time.

I’m newer to being in LA while caring for my curls and I don’t trust a lot of “curl specialists” because wavy hair is kinda fragile and I’ve been burned in the past. Im overdue for a cut, and a fitting hair style is harder to find when there isn’t an existing one. Not looking for that same shag style cut everyone’s pushing for with coils hair because that doesn’t feel like me and I want to be able to do different styles. \n\nWash Routine: detox with Christophe Robin sea salt exfoliating scrub, shampoo with Curlsmith moisture cleanser, and then condition with Authentic Beauty Concept hydrating conditioner (gel like consistency, ran out of Curlsmith). I did squish to condish (scrunch with conditioner) and then tied it up in a bun to finish washing and shaving and then rinse. \n\nStyle/Dry Routine: After showering I brushed and then used Curlsmith hold me softly hair cream and then Curlsmith frizz rescue curl retainer gel and let air dry with some clips in. This is just scrunching in after brushing and no brush styling (trying to only brush style for holidays/special occasions). Still has a cast because I will use oil and scrunch out tomorrow using pineapple and a bonnet. \n\nWhat are you wavy ladies doing to find your wavy/textured stylist and haircut? Do you have any recommendations for someone who can find a style to accentuate your face structure / style? ",

My hair was healthy, thick and had beautiful bouncy curls. It was going well... but then 1 year ago it started to get really thin. The ends were a disaster and i was losing so much hair. I was also trying to lose weight and plus i was a vegeterian(still am). I was eating less than i was supposed to but i wasn't aware of it. So i think this was the number one reason why my hair got weak. I went to the doctor and she gave me hair lotions but i wasn't able to use them regularly... i also have iron deficieny anemia so she also said to take my pills regularly. At first i did but i haven't been using them for the last 4 months. I know i am irresponsible but i want to fix this. Last month i cut my hair below my shoulders. I did a terrible haircut btw. Now it feels even lesser than i already had and my curl pattern is not like how it used to be. I really want to have long hair but with the way my hair is right now, i don't think it will look good. Everyday i look at my hair and i swear it looks so bad. The haircut, the length, my curls... everything. I am thinking of getting a haircut above my shoulders maybe? But i know that it will effect me terribly. For that reason i am very scared. I'm hoping maybe it will look better but i really don't know. Please help me, what should i do?😓\n\nMy current routine is; curl cream, styling, mousse, gel. I stopped diffusing my hair i let it air dry.",

      "content": "26M | Oily Skin | Routine Review + Barrier Safety, Retinol &amp; Product Suggestions\n\nHi everyone,  \n  \nI’m a 26-year-old male with oily skin and wanted some help reviewing my current skincare and hair care routine. I feel I might be overdoing certain actives, and I’m also noticing slight darkening on my forehead, possibly due to regular hair oiling. I’d really appreciate feedback and suggestions.\n\n# Current Skincare Routine\n\nFace Wash:\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid + LHA Cleanser – 2 times a day\n\nSerum:\n\n* The Derma Co 2% Kojic Acid Serum – morning &amp; night after cleansing\n\nMoisturizer:\n\n* Minimalist Vitamin B5 10% Moisturizer\n* Re’equil Ceramide &amp; Hyaluronic Acid (alternate) (Currently not using)\n\nSunscreen:\n\n* Aqualogica Glow+ Dewy Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ – morning and when stepping out\n\nWeekly Exfoliation:\n\n* The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution – 2x a week (Monday &amp; Friday)\n\nLips:\n\n* Vaseline Lip Balm\n\nBody Care:\n\n* 1% Salicylic Acid Body Wash – daily\n\n# Hair Care Routine\n\n* Shampoo: Arata Super Shampoo – 2x a week\n* Hair Oil: Rosemary + Lavender Hair Oil – used regularly after hair wash\n\nI don’t have hair fall issues, but I feel frequent oiling may be causing product buildup and contributing to forehead darkening or clogged pores near the hairline.\n\n# What I Need Help With\n\n1. Barrier-safe routine: I often see the term barrier-safe here.\n   * What does it actually mean?\n   * Am I overusing actives like salicylic acid, kojic acid, or chemical exfoliation?\n   * What are early signs of a damaged skin barrier in oily skin?\n2. Retinol guidance: I’ve never used retinol before.\n   * Should I add retinol at my age and skin type?\n   * What beginner strength should I start with?\n   * How many times a week is safe initially?\n   * Do I need to stop or reduce other actives if I introduce retinol?\n3. Sunscreen recommendations: I’ve seen many sunscreen suggestions in this sub.\n   * Is my current sunscreen okay for oily skin or should I switch to something more matte/oil-control?\n   * What should I look for in a good sunscreen (PA rating, filters, texture)?\n   * Is sunscreen necessary indoors?\n4. Snail mucin &amp; hydration products: I keep seeing snail mucin and barrier-repair products mentioned.\n   * What does snail mucin actually help with?\n   * Is it suitable for oily skin?\n   * Can it be used alongside actives like retinol or exfoliants?\n5. Hair oil &amp; forehead pigmentation:\n   * Should I reduce oiling frequency or change the oil type?\n   * Any tips to prevent oil-related pigmentation or breakouts near the hairline?\n\nMy goal is to build a simple, long-term, barrier-safe routine rather than using too many actives.  \n  \nThanks in advance, would really appreciate your guidance.",
