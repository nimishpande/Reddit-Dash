      "content": "So I've been taking finasteride for years now and it's helped pause my hair loss but I decided randomly to stop taking it for two months just because.\n\nFirst off I thought I didn't have any sides as generally I've been able to have strong erections and have sex about 1 or 2 times a week with my long term girlfriend and didn't really notice anything else out of the ordinary.\n\nNow that I've been off of the meds for a little over a month and a half l've noticed a HUGE increase in my sex drive. Like I literally have to have sex or masturbate if my girls not available every day.  I didn't even know I had a reduced sex drive as I considered myself to have a relatively normal and healthy sex life but man it's constant now.\n\nl've also noticed a difference in my mood. I never had a low or bad mood while on fin but off of fin l've noticed I'm more energetic and slightly happier/more confident. It's more subtle than the sex drive part but it's noticeable. I noticed I'm just kind of having more fun in general. It's hard to quantify.\n\nThat being said I've just started noticing more shedding and my scalp feels sorta irritable. I don't want to loose my hair so I'm going to end up going back on fin but I wanted to post my story for others as I thought I had zero side effects but in reality I just didn't noticed them. There are trade offs with this kinda thing especially when you're altering hormones so you gotta decide what's important to you.",

      "content": "Hi all. I’m feeling pretty lost and could really use some advice.\n\nI’ve been dealing with hormonal acne for the last 3 - 4 years, starting in my late twenties. I previously saw a post on here about Epiduo and it genuinely helped. It didn’t completely clear my skin, but it significantly reduced how often I broke out and how severe the breakouts were.\n\nRecently, I decided to see an esthetician to try and improve my skin further. They recommended ZO Skin Health. For the first month or so, my skin actually looked great. Since then, it has completely gone downhill and is now the worst it’s ever been. It’s also incredibly painful, inflamed, and sore.\n\nThis was my routine:\n\nAM\n\n1. Gentle cleanser\n2. Exfoliating polish\n3. Calming toner\n4. Rozatrol\n5. Daily Power Defense\n6. Tinted sunscreen\n\nPM\n\n1. Gentle cleanser\n2. Calming toner\n3. Rozatrol\n\nI slowly worked up to daily exfoliation which seemed to be fine but now I’ve stopped the exfoliating polish completely. At the moment, I’m only using cleanser, Rozatrol, and Daily Power Defense.\n\nI’ve been re-prescribed Epiduo, but I’m honestly scared to start using it again in case I make things even worse. I don’t know if this is purging, a damaged skin barrier, or if ZO just isn’t right for my skin.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar with ZO, or with restarting Epiduo after using it before? Should I strip my routine right back, push through, or stop everything and let my skin reset? If anyone can also recommend a way to deal with the pain while this settles (it's just the under the skin cysts that are hurting) I'd be really grateful.\n\nAny advice or personal experiences would be hugely appreciated. My self-esteem has taken a real hit and I’m feeling pretty defeated.\n\nThank you so much ❤️\n\nEDIT: I'm trying to upload a couple of images so you can see how bad it's gotten but the format is a little new to me.\n\n[After ZO skin](https://preview.redd.it/9nbdwuiqnt7g1.jpg?width=2047&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1374843f231d239a4f29f339633c85a0ffbc64e9)\n\n[Before ZO skin](https://preview.redd.it/aewi1viqnt7g1.jpg?width=1412&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=878486dba6f651f2d54c20a8ff88c1edf0a684f4)",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

(you'll see that i'm in a toxic codependent relationship with the ordinary due to their prices lol)\n\ni am 31F with horrible irish genetics (combination skin, eternal battle vs acne, unremarkable at best). does anybody see any possible negative interactions between CE Ferulic &amp; my current routine? i've parsed my routine down but have been looking for an AM heavyweight champion. would CE Ferulic be appropriate?\n\nsecondly, i introduced the ordinary's salicylic acid last month due to some dreadful hormonal breakouts, and am really liking it. i've been wondering: should i avoid alternating between salicylic acid &amp; mandelic acid (previous staple), and just stick to one direct acid? i am forever worried about my poor skin barrier. currently, my PM routine alternates bt 1) retinol, 2) salicylic, and 3) mandelic. seems like alot! especially if adding CE Ferulic into the mix /:\n\nAM:\n\n1. cerave hydrating facial cleanser\n2. \\*\\* the ordinary saccharomyces ferment 30% milky toner: LOVE THIS, but is there possible incompatibility with CE Ferulic? the ordinary's website states that the toner should not be used with direct acids. if so, i'd insert CE Ferulic here. what do yall think?\n3. cerave daily moisturizing lotion\n4. neutrogena ultra sheer face sunscreen (LOVE)\n\nPM #1\n\n1. cerave hydrating facial cleanser\n2. the ordinary saccharomyces ferment 30% milky toner\n3. the ordinary retinol 0.5% in squalane\n4. cerave daily moisturizing lotion\n5. the ordinary cold pressed rose hip seed oil (LOVE LOVE)\n\nPM #2/3\n\n1. cerave hydrating facial cleanser\n2. the ordinary salicylic acid \\*OR\\* the ordinary mandelic acid\n3. cerave daily moisturizing lotion\n4. the ordinary cold pressed rose hip seed oil\n\nthank yall for your help!! for any other 30+ year olds out there cursing the old gods for their neverending battle vs acne, this current routine is working well for me!

Even in highschool I had clear skin and that was with bar soap and barely washing my makeup off. \n\nAt the beginning of the year I went through some very stressful stuff and the acne just started multiplying and was very inflamed and red. After the situation was dealt with the acne stayed (although it improved significantly). Even now, months later I’m struggling though I don’t feel stressed at all.\n\nRight now I’m only using the Cetaphil gentle SA Cleanser because I want to just take a minute to figure out what to do before making it worse. But I’ve also tried mandelic acid, Dr gross exfoliating pads, retinol(if that helps?), oil cleansing(made it worse). \n\nI’ve looked into Microneedling but my injector/esthi I told me that she’d rather I clear the active acne first. \n\nI’m so discouraged and I don’t know what to do. My skin has never really been sensitive! Should I book a dermatologist appointment and try tret? I just miss feeling comfortable in my own skin. :.(\n\nThis is bared faced and the other side is similar but not as extreme. It’s really localized to my jaw and cheeks. \n\nThank you all for your help in advance, its really gotten me discouraged. ",

      "content": "Hi all! \n\nSo, I'm hoping to ask if anyone has advice on a good shampoo (+ conditioner) for tight curls that are washed daily. (Sorry for the long post!) \n\nMy siblings and I all have curly hair, but different tightness of curls. My older sister is currently in the process of learning how to care for her hair for the first time, and since I have experience with my own curls, I'm making her a gift basket with products and instructions/guides/resources (including this subreddit!). \n\nMy concern is that my sister washes her hair every day and is super not open to co-washing or skipping days. (She gets germ anxiety, so daily showers are really important to her.) Her hair is already pretty dry and since she washes daily, I'm wondering if people have recommendations for good shampoos that are easy on dry hair for daily washing. I know its trial and error! But hoping for advice on a good starting point.\n\nShe has ringlet curls (not super tight/small, but moderately tight, defined, spiral curls through most of her hair) that sits at about her shoulder blades. I can tell its dry and I have plans to give some nice conditioner(s) (daily, leave in, and deep condition), but I'm worried that most curl-friendly shampoos I've used before will be too rough for her daily routine. I know to avoid sulfates and silicones and whatnot, but I'm wondering if anyone could provide specific recs or suggestions for daily washers. \n\n(She's also on estrogen/hrt, which I know can affect things, but I figure that's more trial and error.)\n\n\n[The routine I'm planning to recommend: with lots of trial and error recommended\n\n-- start with a clarifying shampoo for initial wash (reuse clarifying shampoo only when product builds up - I used to do once a month, but I'll recommend adjusting based on what she sees)\n-- some sort of soft shampoo for daily use \n-- deep condition (im looking at the wiki guide for advice) (planning to recommend that she starts by deep conditioning 1-2 times per month)\n-- air drying daily (hopefully diffuser for events/big days, but she doesnt like to spend much time) \n-- curl creme for daily use \n-- curl gel for events/big hair days \n\nI think that roughly covers it?]",

I also work rosemary oil into my scalp regularly, and I stay consistent with my supplements — ashwagandha, vitamin D3 with K2, omega-3, and a men’s multivitamin.\n\nTwice a week, on Wednesdays and Sundays, I microneedle with a 1.0 mm roller. For my washing routine, I use Nizoral once or twice a week for scalp health, and on my regular wash days I stick with the Hims shampoo and conditioner.\n\nFrom time to time I use a little coconut oil to keep my scalp hydrated.",

It worked great but I didn't like the side effects and didn't like the idea of being on it forever. I consulted with my derm and I went down to 50mg for 2 weeks and then switched over to taking 100mg of doxy. That was 2+ months ago. I am having horrendous back and chest acne when that was NEVER an issue of mine before. My face has also been bad but not near as bad as chest, shoulders and whole back. I emailed my derm 2 weeks ago and went up to 100mg of doxy twice a day. However it's just getting worse. I've been using the dove anti bacterial and like nothing else to avoid irritation. Anyone have suggestions, timelines or testimonies from struggling to come off of spiro? I'm doing everything in my power to stick with it and not go back on but it's affecting my confidence completely.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
