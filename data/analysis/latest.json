Shampoo every other week with Briogeo Clarifying Rice shampoo ($13 on sale at TJ Maxx). Rotate between Not your mother‚Äôs curly shampoo/ Ouidad humidity shampoo when not clarifying. (I shampoo approximately every 5 days or so). \n**Today I brushed shampoo through hair with 4 row denman, separating bottom half from crown. \n\n2. Condition with Aussie curl quench (head upside down and finger combing before a light rinse) \n\n3. Thick layer of Cant√π leave in (squish with couple handfuls of water to clump curls) \n\n4.  Two gentle scrunches with cotton t shirt, before a generous dollop of tresemme curly mousse applied with prayer hands \n\n5. Pink Eco Brand gel (about a shot glass full) squished throughout \n\n6. Flip head over and make sure curls are laying as desired before spraying whole head lightly with alcohol free hair spray \n\n7.

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe‚Ñ¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I rarely went to a hairdresser and used to dye it myself at home.

I had been switching between red and dark brown dye constantly, and it ended up really uneven and choppy. They managed to fix my color, and I was so happy! I also got extensions because I had my wedding in June. I kept them until August, then had them removed because my natural hair had grown so much, and I actually liked it.\n\nI really like the color, especially when it‚Äôs freshly done, but I‚Äôm not sure about the haircut. It feels a bit too heavy, or maybe I just don‚Äôt know how to style it properly?\n\nMy next appointment is coming up next week, and I want to change something, but I‚Äôm not sure what. I‚Äôve been thinking about maybe getting a blunt cut? Any suggestions?\n\nIn the long run, I‚Äôd like to keep growing it out. It would be amazing if I could get it to the length of the extensions!",

      "content": "I‚Äôm recently 29 and developed under-eye bags about a year ago that haven‚Äôt gone away. I do have allergies, but I keep them well managed with a strict (and I mean strict) routine, and even when I feel much better overall, my under-eyes still look the same every day - no fluctuation. I don‚Äôt have good days they‚Äôre all just bad. I‚Äôve seen two dermatologists who both said it looks like fat pads and recommended seeing an oculoplastic surgeon though they suggested against surgery solely because of age. Which kinda leaves me with nothing if I‚Äôm just going to get turned away. I also got a blood panel to rule out health issues.\nFor the obvious questions: yes, I sleep well/upright, don‚Äôt drink alcohol, and don‚Äôt eat a high-sodium diet. I already have a strict low inflammatory diet for gut reasons. I‚Äôm trying to be smart since I‚Äôm young, but I also can‚Äôt keep living looking tired and twice my age. Has anyone else been through this, and what worked for you?\n\nfirst two pics feb/august 2024, all others from Oct 2024 - now",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n¬†\n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n¬†\n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n¬†\n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n¬†\n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n¬†\n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you‚Äôve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you¬†\n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I recently bought the Prequel Enzyme Multi-Acid enzyme peel because I saw that it had good reviews + I saw people recommend AHAs over BHAs for closed comedones (before this breakout I would use Paula's Choice BHA a few times a week). I only got the enzyme mask this past week, and I use it around every other day, but I'm wondering if I should get mandelic acid as well (I was thinking the Ordinary's but I'm willing to take recs). I have a habit of overdoing it when I'm breaking out, so I don't want to be too harsh with my skin, but I reallyyyy want these closed comedones to go away ASAP because I have so many, and I just want my skin to look nice again. Any thoughts on whether adding mandelic acid into my routine is a good idea, or if I should leave it with using the Prequel Enzyme mask a couple times a week?\n\n(for context my skincare routine right now is evian water spray, prequel half and half milk, prequel enzyme mask on some days, prequel moisturizer, april skin spot treatment, and sunscreen in the mornings)",

      "content": "I‚Äôm a 19-year-old male, and I‚Äôve been dealing with hair fall for the past 2-3 years. There‚Äôs a strong history of baldness on my dad‚Äôs side of the family, almost everyone is bald. My hair loss seems to be following the same pattern as my dads. His hair density is extremely low, although his hairline is  intact. For me the density has decreased a lot. \n\nI finally decided to visit a dermatologist, but i was pretty disappointed with the experience. The doctor did the basic hair pull test (I had washed my hair earlier that day), and only a few strands came out. The doctor asked about vitamin deficiencies, I mentioned that my Vitamin D was very low at one point, but I had supplemented for 2 months and assumed it had improved.\n\nI was expecting something more direct like finasteride, especially since the hair thinning is clearly genetic. Instead the doctor prescribed a biotin supplement, ketoconazole shampoo, and a saw palmetto extract serum. The consultation wasn‚Äôt cheap either, and I honestly don‚Äôt think I can afford to see another dermatologist any time soon. \n\nshould I just go ahead and start finasteride without a prescription? Pls tell me what I should do, I feel like I am wasting my time and money. Would appreciate any advice üôè",
