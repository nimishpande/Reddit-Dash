      "title": "[misc] I had antifungal-resistant Ringworm for 15 months across 4 doctors and 6 different antifungals. Lessons Learned.",
      "content": "*Not Medical Advice. I'm just a biotech and computer engineer. YMMV.*\n\nSo the CDC’s been [documenting](https://www.cdc.gov/ringworm/aboutemergingringworm/index.html) a bit about these fungal infections. This post is only about ringworm on the skin. I don’t know anything about nail infections, etc...\n\n**Here are some thoughts. It’s more comprehensive than anything I’ve found.**\n\n1. Topical Antifungal Protocol:\n   1. Mix and match topical antifungals!\n      1. Chances are one will work better than another for resistant ringworm. \n      2. I went through 6 creams before getting rid of the fungus.\n   2. You can (and probably should) leave most antifungal creams on near 24/7. \n      1. I had two doctors tell me this is ok. \n      2. How? Just put a ball of cream over the spot, then put a band-aid/gauze wrap/tape over it. \n      3. Consider letting your skin air out for a couple hours every day so it’s not wet with cream 24/7. Don’t want your skin to get soggy.\n   3. Don’t use antifungal creams with corticosteroids! \n      1. Non optimal - [CDC Source](https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/treatment/index.html)\n      2. PCPs will still prescribe this.\n   4. I kept using the cream for months after the rash went away.\n      1. It still came back until I used the right cream for months.\n   5. Look for cheaper ways to get the antifungals. OTC creams will probably cost you a fortune.\n2. Cover the fungus when you sleep. It's probably best to do this at all times too.\n   1. You don’t want it spreading when you toss and turn in the night.\n   2. Some think that moderate sunbathing can help kill the fungus\n      1. Unsubstantiated, AFAIK, but the mechanism of action is reasonable. I tried it during my last round of antifungal.\n3. Wash every bit of clothing and sheets on high heat with soap.\n   1. I washed my bedsheets, pillowcases, and blankets biweekly, even when covering my ringworm at night.\n   2. Your cat or dog can get it too.\n4. You can get fungal susceptibility testing or PCR identification.\n   1. Eg, they take a sample of ringworm to the lab and they’ll get back to you with a recommended antifungal.\n   2. Sometimes there’s not a place that offers this nearby ):\n   3. This can sometimes be inopportune because you need a visible infection\n      1. Ask your doctor if you can schedule the day you see the fungus growing back so you don’t have to have an untreated active infection while you wait for an appointment.\n5. If you do want to take an oral antifungal, you can get bloodwork with your liver panel done before *and while* you’re running it to see if it’s straining your liver.\n6. Contact Sports: If you’re going to go back, at least wait until the rash is absolutely gone, then wait another week. Wear your rash guard. Put cream on before class.\n   1. For hard-to-kill infections, remember it’s just hanging out under the skin. Sweat can pull it out. \n      1. I had sweaty skin-to-skin contact with my partner for months with an “invisible” infection and never gave it to her, except for a single time when I had an unnoticed visible infection.\n7. I don’t know anything about bleaching or burning fungus off, but topical antifungals are meant for fungus and won’t destroy your skin.",

It’s low porosity, virgin (never dyed). I sometimes used to do DIY overnight curls without heat (added pics too).\n\nI’m not totally sure about my texture and density, but i'm sure my hair is low porosity since it doesn’t absorb water quickly and oils also just sit on top. I’ve tried many oils from coconut, mustard, olive, to castor but none seemed to work except almond oil, which feels a little better. (All the oils I used were 100% pure, not mineral/mixed.)\n\nI think my hair is wavy. Since childhood I assumed it was just frizzy and dry, but recently I realized it’s not straight, it’s actually wavy. I’d guess around 2a/2b, but not fully sure.\n\nI’ve never tried CGM (since I only own shampoo and conditioner), and I’m here mainly to get product recommendations that could work for my hair type and needs.\n\nMy current routine:  \nShampoo: Pantene Lively Clean (2–3x a week) not looking for alternatives.  \nConditioner: Dove Hairfall Rescue (every time I shampoo). looking for alternatives.  \nHair oil: Hamdard almond oil (1–2x a week) not looking for alternatives.\n\nCare:  \nI sleep on a satin pillowcase every night.  \nI also sewed myself a satin bonnet and some scrunchies.\n\nWhat I’m looking for recs on:  \nConditioner  \nLeave-in conditioner  \nCurl cream  \nGel  \nHair serum  \nA brush similar to Denman\n\nAlso, can I use almond oil on my ends as the last step after serum or use only serum?\n\nAnd if you know of any good hair brushes available in India for wavy/curly hair, please share! I’ve seen videos of people styling with the Denman brush ([link here](https://youtu.be/5UCwGkbkAUw)), and I feel like I could try the same curling technique after washing.

Last picture is my hair normally \n\n Any advice on how to deal with the frizz on top that would be appreciated!! I think my hair is 3b/c. My dad is black and Mongolian and my mom's hair is so straight and fine she can't use any accessories since they'll just fall out. \n\nPlease don't take my routine seriously as I haven't been able to find a good routine and still trying out quality curly products. I'm currently using through everything I have in my supplies before buying anything new. The bottom of my hair usually feels amazing and soft and curls perfectly and then the top of my head gets this weird frizz. I saw this may be the top of my head is holding too much water and is causing frizz?  \n\nI live in Baltimore, MD. It's very hot and humid and the weather can be all over the place! I've been using Skala because I find our weather conditions are a lot like Brazil, and Brazil has so many mixed race people, I figure my hair type is very similar. My stepmom is from DR and a stylist and mentioned to me my hair takes very well to Hispanic products. \n\nShampoo and conditioner:\nGet hair wet in shower once a week with conditioner (Raw sugar The Grow Pro conditioner). Shampoo every 3-4 weeks with Curl Smith frizz control cleanser. If it doesn't need a full cleansing then I'll use Skala #Mais Cachos for a quick rinse. \n\nStyling products: \nSkala #Mais Cachos 2 in 1 conditioner and styling \nCurl Smith Shine Fragrance Free gel \nUse a brush with a cylinder to set curls \nCurl Smith 7 oil hair revitalizing spray for refresh day. (I haven't liked this that much! It was expensive and I feel like it gives my hair a high protein crunchy feeling) \nSauvecito Sauvecita Pomade (occasionally, I used it in the first picture to help lay the hair around my edges a bit) \n\n\nProcedures:\nSleep in a bonnet, pineappling never worked for me, I recently tried banana clips though and that's better :) \nEither finger curling or using a brush with a round bottom to curl \nI will use a mister in the morning refresh curls as well \nApply product if refresh is needed \n ",

      "content": "Looking for recommendations on how to improve several skin issues!!!\n\nHello! Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable when it comes to skincare and ingredients, but right now I am finding myself overwhelmed with how to manage my skin best - my main concerns are just my overall tone (PIE and sun spots) and texture (pores, etc.). Skin type is Combo/Oily. \n\nSome background: I have had hormonal acne for as long as I can remember. I currently manage it decently with hormonal birth control (pill) and Spironolactone (100mg/day) but do still get around 1-2 large cystic spots, usually around a week or so before my cycle.\n\nI do have some eczema on my face, mainly above my eyebrows and a couple patches on my forehead. I also do get some facial redness as a side effect from a biologic medication I take for eczema, and I manage that with topical Tacrolimus.\n\nI have always struggled with my large pores/skin texture, but am fully aware that this is likely just down to my genetics for the most part. \n\nOkay, whew, anyway - on to my current routine: \n\nAM:\n- Rinse with water \n- Aveeno Protect and Hydrate Face Sunscreen/Moisturizer SPF 60\n\nPM:\n- Cetaphil Gentle Face Wash\n- PanOxyl 10% BP Face Wash (~3x/week)\n- Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizer \n- La Roche Posay CicaPlast B5 Baume (as needed) \n\nI have used TONS of various active ingredients in the past, but have taken a pause over the past few months to manage my eczema/medication side effects effecting my face. I finally feel like I’m ready to slowly start incorporating stuff again!\n\n",

So now i have been doing a curly hair routine for like the past year, which is this: \n\n-alama curl shampoo (2 times)\n-alama curl mask\n\ni brush my hair only in the shower after the mask, and after im out of the shower scrunch a little my hair with a cotton shirt and i put:\n\n-alama curl amplifier\n-adorn curl cream\n-just sometimes a little gel/mousse as i hate the texture and it does a mess in my hair \n-perfect curl oil pantene\n\nthen i brush again to mix all the product in my hair , scrunch again with the cotton shirt and let it air dry because it takes ages to dry it with a blow drier with the curly thingy 😭😭\n\nam i doing everything right? is my hair not wavy and i just have to deal with it and stop forcing it? 🥹🥹\n\n\nthanks to everyone in advance!\n",

      "title": "A year progress (May 2024 to July 2025)  [Acne]",
      "content": "hello everyone, I want to share my progress from the Before photo (May 2024) to the last \"skin photo\" I took (July 2025). I am F27 with acne prone skin and eczema. I am not from Canada but I have been living in Canada for 6 years. In the Before photo that was when my acne was at its worse. At that point I have tried Differin gel but after 3 months I didn't see any changes so I decided to bring out the Tretinoin gel my mom sent me from my home country. It was a game changer. After some fixing with my routine, here is all the products I am pleased with. There are a few I forgot to take photos of but I will add below.\n\nAM routine:\n\n\\- Clean my face with Dove Dryness relief bar. Yes, my skin can't tolerate most cleanser and I actually didn't use cleanser for my face in the morning for 6 months until I decided to buy Dove bar to replace my shower gel. This bar changed my life. It is the best cleansing agent I have ever used on my skin and I will continue to stick with it as long as I can.\n\n\\- Spray skin with Hypochlorous acid. I spray both my face and my scalp. I bought a giant bottle on amazon for 30$ and refill my existing bottle.\n\n\\- Thayers mushroom milk toner: Me and K-beauty can't be in the same room but I love the texture of milky tonner. I like this one and she is pretty cheap.\n\n\\- Aveeno calm and restore+ serum: Because of my eczema, I tend to use anything that have oats in it. I tried the Ordinary skin barrier serum but I didn't like it as much. I find this one feels better and absorb better into the skin.\n\n\\- Niod survival 0: I can't tolerate vitamin C but I also want some anti-oxidant for my skin so this one is my choice.\n\n\\- Thayers Let's be clear moisturizer: Lightweight moisturizer with 5% azelaic acid.\n\n\\- La Roche Posay Anthelios sunscreen (not tinted): I cant tell how many bottles I have used. I have been using the same sunscreen since 2020.\n\nPM Routine:\n\n\\- Palmer's Skin therapy cleansing oil: I started to clean my skin with oil since 2017. I have tried most brands since. When I was in Asia my choice was Muji light cleansing oil, however, after moving to Canada I realized oil/balm cleansing wasn't very popular here. I tried Pond's cold cream, Bath and Body work chamomile cleansing butter, Byoma cleansing balm, etc.. (I tried so much). Nothing ever came close to this random cheap brand I picked up from Walmart. Clean like a dream. Downside is it smells... kinda bad. It has a rose water scent that I hate- like a old rose powdery scent but it doesn't matter because I will clean it again afterwards.\n\n\\- Clean again with Dove Dryness relief beauty bar.\n\n\\- Once a week I will use the Rosette exfoliate gel. It is a soft gel that helps me with some sebaceous filament. I bought this in Japan when I was there in February but I think it is pretty common in K-beauty space. The only K-beauty product I can use.\n\n\\- Spray skin with Hypochlorous acid.\n\n\\- This is when I use my active. I rotate between tret, azelaic acid and a rest night.\n\n\\* For Tret night:\n\n\\- Apply Thayers tonner, calming serum, Aquaphor around under eyes and corner of the mouth.  \n\\- Using a tiny dot of tret. Top with Aveeno Baby Eczema therapy (this very specific moisturizer. I cant tolerate any other version)\n\n\\*For Azelaic night:\n\n\\- On clean dry skin after spray, one pump of Regime lab. I used to use La roche posay B3 on this step but I find the Regime Lab is a better active.\n\n\\- Let it dry. Apply thayers toner, Aveeno calm serum, moisturizer.\n\n\\* For rest night: I do the same without active and a layer of Aquaphor on top.\n\nI found this routine has worked out really well for me. I will brace myself for the upcoming winter to see if it needs any changes.",

      "content": "I want to know what protein products are for in general? Just wanted to know if it’s healthy for this type of hair? I keep hearing conflicting things on protein- either that your hair can get too much protein which can cause problems or that it’s helpful(not sure what for). And since all hair is different it’s hair to know which type it’s good for. I did read that clarifying at least once a month helps. But I’d like to know the scientific basis on what protein is good for? And how do you know you are buying a protein product other than just the label? Is it for daily use? And does hair ethnicity matter when it comes to using protein products? \n\nThank you! ",
