I also feel like my curls are very forced, and i have to use a lot of water to make them pop, I’ve also switched to silk pillow recently which helps a bit i guess",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nI recently tried oil cleansing for the first time, without much research prior. I have a combination of oily and dry skin on my face, mainly oily. I have struggled with bad blackheads on my nose prior.\n\nI used the “coxir ULTRA HYALURONIC CLEANSING OIL,” and it seemingly worked great at first! It got everything out, and I got a little trigger happy and used it maybe three times that week. After, I would hop in the shower and clean my face with Cetaphil Gentle Face Washer. I did notice my skin on my nose drying because of it.\n\nI stopped for a bit, and about a week or two after, I got a really big breakout on my nose and cheek area. Tiny whiteheads and big pimples, with red irritation and dry, peeling skin. It was so bad it looked like I got sunburned!\n\nIt’s finally calming down now, but I do notice some texture on my nose and cheeks still. I wanted to try again thinking maybe I’m doing something wrong? Or is it a product thing? It was the only thing that ever really got rid of my blackheads, which is a big insecurity for me.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, or product recommendations on the less expensive side, I’d love the help! Thank you.",

Chubby curl leave in conditioner (pea to dime size drop)\n\n4. 1 to 1 1/2 pump of pattern curl styling cream \n\n5. Wide tooth comb to push back the sides and comb down the back. \n\n6. The top has a tighter curl pattern, so I use a pick to gently lift and flip the top and front pieces backwards to flow with the intended style. \n\n7. Air dry only. It takes forever, but it keeps things in the position I want them without frizz either. \n\n———\n\nI’m currently in the process of growing my hair out. (Just started a month ago from a length slightly shorter than this) \n\nMy goal style is in the 3rd picture. I know the goal has a looser curl pattern than me. That’s okay, I know mine is most likely capable of doing something similar with more length and weight. \n\nWhen should I expect for my hair to start dropping below my ear line and to start resembling my goal more? Is there anything I can do to optimize hair growth? I started taking biotin and I’m already high protein because I regularly go to the gym anyway. Do I look like I’ll be prone to breakage? ",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m looking for advice because I honestly have no idea where to start with my hair.\n\nI recently did a big chop (first image). My hair used to be mid-back length, but it was very damaged, so I cut it shorter to try and start fresh. I have not created a routine at all yet so I am unable to provide one I’ve been mix matching between creams, mousses, gels, oils and leave-ins trying to find something that works. The first picture is no product but it is diffused to the best of my ability. I hover dry for 15 minutes and pixie diffuse for another 5 minutes until completely dry. Other than that I use head and shoulders shampoo and conditioner as this is the only thing that has seemed to work for me.\n\nI’ve had curly and frizzy hair since I was a kid, but it was never really taken care of properly. Both my parents have straight hair, so no one really knew how to manage curls. It was almost always brushed out and pulled into a low ponytail or slicked-back ponytail, which definitely didn’t help.\n\nOn top of that, I started using heat on my hair every day from around age 13, and I’ve only just recently stopped at 21, so I’m sure that contributed a lot to the damage and loss of curl pattern.\n\nWhen I was younger, I did actually have spiral curls, and even recently my hair can still form curls, but they feel inconsistent and hard to maintain.\n\nI also went to a hairdresser for my 21st birthday hoping to get my curls styled and shaped properly, but it was honestly a terrible experience. Their website advertised curl-focused styling, but they barely put effort into defining or styling my curls, and the result didn’t reflect what I was hoping for at all (second image).\n\nRight now my biggest struggles are frizz, flat roots with no volume at the scalp, curls forming more on the ends but looking limp or weighed down at the top, and not knowing whether I should focus on moisture, protein, lighter products, or something else.\n\nEverything I’ve tried so far seems to either weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy and undefined.\n\nIf anyone has advice on how to help curls become healthier, how to get volume at the roots, what kind of routine or products might suit fine to medium curly hair, or even just where to start when you’ve never really learned curl care, I’d seriously appreciate it. Also I’m from Australia, so preferably Aussie products!\n\nAny advice is welcome because I feel pretty lost and overwhelmed. Thanks so much!",

Going forward now I had long 2a hair but eat very healthy and excercise, but i don't do anything special with my hair because the products seem too complex for me to work out what to do, I get a haircut a few weeks back and now my hair is much more curlier than it ever has been, like almost 3a hair while short, its considerably curlier to the point people think I did something special with my hair.\n\nSo that begs the question, can eating a healthy diet actually make your hair curlier, or is this some kind of cognitive bias I have and Im forgetting how curly it used to be?",

      "content": "Okay so long story short, I had bleach blonde hair with grown out roots (two days ago) and tried to dye it an ashy brown, it picked up ALOT of ash and looked almost grey/silver. So I went to a salon the next day where they put a warmer brown in, it made my roots orange/brassy and my lengths still ashy brown. She told me to go home and try a blue shampoo. I did a few times and it got rid of some of the ash but the colors are still completely different. \n\nAny help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I was thinking a dark toner with a more blue undertone to neutralize the orange?? Help PLEASE lmfao",
