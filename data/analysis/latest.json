I always had curly hair but grew up in southern Oklahoma and they’re definitely not training boys on their curly hair. This sub came in clutch in helping me explore what works best for my hair. \n\nAnywho, here’s where I am seven years later, before and after. :) \n\nWearing a bonnet to sleep was the most impactful routine change I made. It took awhile to adjust to it; I had to try different ones until it worked right. But eventually it worked. \n\nI cowash about once a week. Always diffuse. Aunt Jackie’s product has been the most consistent product for me to use. I started with their leave in conditioner and slowly bought their mouse and gel. It’s worked perfect for my hair. I use a clarifying shampoo about once a month or less. Post clarifying shampoo, I do a longer hair mask. \n\nAnywho, anyone doubting their hair; KEEP AT IT AND TRUST THE PROCESS! Seriously. Trust the process and just know you’re going to go through a lot of different trial and error. But the more you do it, the more you’ll fall in love with yourself. Anywho, first pic is about 7 years ago and last pic is today. \n\n",

Getting the natural pattern back has been a struggle!  It seemed like no matter what I tried it ended up looking like a frizzy mess. I was in utter shock the entire time I styled with the bounce curl brush at how well it worked.\n\nI don’t have much CG products yet - ordered a few things but they are in transit. Here is the routine I used prior to this photo:\n\n1. Wash and condition with AG Haircare ACV Balance shampoo &amp;  conditioner - squish to condish \n\n2. Rinse, scrunch while wet and wrap with microfiber towel\n\n3. Section hair and brush with bounce curl brush to create curl clumps. I scrunched immediately after each section with Giovanni LA hold styling gel.\n\n4. Blow dry mostly upside down with Dyson Supersonic &amp; diffuser attachment\n\n5. Let it completely air dry then scrunch out the crunch with a tiny bit of jojoba oil\n\n6. Stare at hair in mirror completely shocked",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I feel like whenever I start micro bangs far back into my scalp, they're way too thick to lay flat. Am I cutting too wide? Is this a styling issue? Is it a hair density/texture thing? Is it a hairline thing? Is there a way to achieve it with layering bangs? \n\nHow do I achieve micro bangs that are truly micro on the forehead but start further back on the scalp and lay flat/didn't give that bowl cut vibe??? \n\nVideos on how to do it myself or how to instruct my hairdresser would be incredibly helpful.

Either way, it's very flat. Sometimes I dry my hair out of the shower, other times I air dry, it doesn't change a thing. I don't do much to add volume but when I DO style it, the style tends to fall after an hour or so. I shower daily, full wash every 1-2 days, and shampoo my bangs daily or else they get too oily. I only condition my ends, only shampoo my scalp.  Idk how people keep their hair looking like this all day, but I was hoping for some advice on that. \n\nI'm thinking a soft wolfcut, a little shorter than this. I'm wondering: is this hairstyle possible without endless product and sprays and curls to keep it in? I don't want to ruin my hair but I also want to put volume in my hair. thanks!",

      "content": "TBR: I'm a primary caregiver to a disabled child. Even with an abundance of support from my partner, basic personal care is extremely difficult.  I've got fine, wavy/curly hair, and I'm considering going very short, like above my chin or shorter pixie cut to reduce maintenence.  Is it actually easier with this type of hair? \n\nLonger explanation: \nEven with as much support in place as we can manage, I can barely wash my hair 1-2x a week. Styling *only* happens after bathing. My hair lives in a bun or ponytail 6-7 days a week. I hate it. I hate it touching my face. I hate the headache it gives me from being up all day. I hate how it looks. \n\nMy child is very emotionally disabled and I've gotten my hair cut once in six years. I've been doing the ponytail method at home, resulting in several not great cuts. My wavy/curly hair hides alot of it. But I haven't had a cut I like in at least four years. \n\nI've never had shorter than tips of my shoulder length when dry. And I'm considering going very short simply to not have to fucking deal with it anymore. I also happen to think short hair on women looks fantastic. \n\nBut I've heard mixed opinions on whether it's actually easier (I know it varies hugely by type), and unless I felt comfortable buzzing it myself, I'd have to get it cut regularly. My hair doesnt grow fast though. I'd consider almost any length to make this easier. But also since my hair doesn't grow fast, it would take me years to get back to my current length. So it feels super risky if I didn't like it or it was much harder to take care of. \n\nAnd if you can't tell, I'm in a situation where the smallest thing can set the dumpster of my life on fire. 🫠😂\n\nI'd appreciate feedback!",

It's just, after all of this, my hair is STILL SO FRIZZY. So I thought I needed more products, but using them all at once makes my hair no longer curly 😭😭😭 \n2. I don't own a hair dryer. I've got a touch of the 'tism and they overstimulate me WAY too bad lol. My hair sees NO heat or chemical treatments like hair dye.\n3. I sleep with a satin pillow, but with my hair down because I don't know how to braid, and I'm not even sure if that would preserve my curls or not.\n4. I only wash my hair every 3 days or so, otherwise it dries out my hair/skin, again, I RARELY put ANY product in my hair other than shampoo/conditioner, not even a leave-in most of the time.\n5. I don't clarify often bc I rarely use any products in my hair. I currently don't even own a clarifying shampoo lol\n\n**This time, for my styling, I washed my hair, let it air dry, styled my bangs, slept on it on my satin pillow, then soaked my hair w/ water and added the** ***As I Am Coconut Leave-In Conditioner,*** ***Garnier Fructis Humdity Milk*** **and the** ***Shae Moisture Papaya &amp; Neroli All Day Frizz Control Milk Gel*****. I let it air dry and then scrunched out the cast, which was much... castier than it was expecting.**\n\n# Actual Post:\n\nThis is my hair when I **don't** add any product, just let it air dry after shampoo and conditioner:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6zy79z8mpeuf1.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a801ff726201a523888e7c0e0d56cc158a22bf6\n\nWhat I like about this is that the curl clumps are very big and well defined, even if it doesn't look so in this picture because of the lighting. (It's hard bc my apt doesn't have good lighting and my hair is dark and I am pale, so it's actually very difficult to photograph LOL). So what I've mostly been trying to do is work on taming frizz and anytime I put ANY product in my hair, I feel like it ruins my curl pattern. This is my hair with the bolded styling routine mentioned above:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rijc4q2vqeuf1.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb40a333174184d7520d3e1f6b78732e920b7b35\n\nThe things I don't like about this:\n\n1. The layering/cut is CHOPPED. Idk if this is on my stylist or of it's just growing out, but I HATE the shape of my hair and when I style it, it accentuates it's shape. Rn I'm growing it out to start over and will probably make a post later abt how to properly ask for a haircut.\n2. **I get more curls, but they're all so thin and stretched out??** They separate from their big clumps, and I HATE that. :(\n3. They look stretched out, I have significantly less spirals now and they don't go back to shape.\n4. Despite 2/3 of the products I use being meant specifically for frizz, my hair is still REALLY frizzy.\n5. **I think that this just looks like a hot mess!** My hair doesn't look curly or pretty like it does with no product, it looks... like bedhead.\n\nSo what do I do to keep my large clumps of curls, but less frizzy? Are my products too heavy? Or is this what my hair *wants* to do when I add product? Does this not look as bad as I think it does? Have I been influenced? I'm just trying to achieve the same style as the first pic but with significantly LESS frizz and a bit more shine.\n\nThank you so much for all of your help in advanced!!\n\n",

      "title": "My little skincare and haircare routine 🩰✨🫧",
      "content": "🦋\nAbout me 🎀: My skintype is combination(oily on large areas and dry on another). I have large open pores and pigmentation. I easily get whiteheads and redheads if i don’t wash my face to reduce the oilyness. I have PCOS ⚡️and i go to gym like 2 days average in a week. I eat a lot of sugars, reduced carbs and take whey protein. I have facial hairs due to PCOS so i use  facial hair trimmer twice a week.\n\nAbout the products🦩:\n\nFacial Skincare🫧: \n1. Paknet (derma suggested)🪼: skin feels cleared and very smooth. I did a little research and got to know benzoyl peroxide reduces pimple causing bacteria. So i guess it helps reduce pimple. I gently move my hands in circular motion clockwise and upwards to let me skin absorb it and then wash. (AM PM)\n\n2. Acne oc- moisturiser (derma suggested)🪻: reduces pores and moisturise my face. Regulates oil production on face. I have seen some change in my pores and oiliness. I again apply it and move my hands upwards to let it soak in.(AM PM)\n\n3. Adapalene (derma suggested)🦥: it has benzoyl peroxide so it helps reduce pimple causing bacteria and in turn help prevent pimples. I take a very little of it and again in circular motion upwards apply it all over the skin but not on sides of nose, under/close to the eye and in sides of my mouth. Once in two days. Can irritate skin if over used.(AM -use sunscreen after)\n\n3. Moisurex-hydra (prev derma suggested) 🐚: i apply it same way , circular clockwise upwards till absorbs. Its water based so good if you have dry skin.  (AM PM)\n\n4. a. Aziderm (prev derma suggested)🐝: it reduces pigmentation, pimple and pimple marks. Also helps in detaning. My new derma hasn’t suggested it, but it works well so i’m using it. Same application - upwards and in circular motion. I use it as night as you need to save your skin from sun after these products. Use it a little like adapalene as it can irritate skin as well (PM)\n\n4. b. Clindamycin (derma suggested)🐥: no idea what it does but i have to apply it everyday in the morning. Doesnt irritate. Same application - circular, upwads) (AM PM)\n\n5. Deconstruct vitamin c serum ( self suggested) 🪽- my skin has got tanned so started using it recently. Still waiting to see if it works. Read application on the bottle(AM PM with sunscreen)\n\n5 b. Pixi toner -(nykaa gift) 👾- its good, no idea what it does but doesn’t do any harm so yeah, good so far. I apply it with cotton in circular upwards motion. (AM PM)\n\n6. Sunscreens 🌞-( all doc suggested current and prev) - uv doux is best but is tinted. It feels heavy so i will get the non silicone based on from uv doux. Others are fine. (Every two hours under sun, 2x pinky finger size)\n\n7. Vaseline (self suggested) 👄- i have pigmented lips, used it daily whenever i felt my lips have gotten dry, started observing them getting pink and less dark.\n\n8. Meds ( derma suggested) 💊- green one is omega - good for hair and skin. Black one is antioxidant, and peach one is for pimple reduction. I take them everyday\n\n9.shatavari juice (self suggested)🍶- i have pcos, so i take it every day after meal at night, helps with pcos and inflammation i guess. Im using everything so dont know how exactly is this working. I have to drink it for another month or so.\n\n10. Medicube collagen night mask, vlcc detan mask, detan scrub (self suggested)🎭- once a week for tanning.\n\n11. Turmeric and red sandal (self suggested)🎭- got them recently, good for face, clears , depigments brightens. I use it twice a week, it leaves yellowish color, so use it at night.\n\nHaircare:\n1. Ordinary 👩‍🦰: (self suggested): reduces hairfall and dandruff. Works like magic. I have seen hair fall reduction and new baby hairs (PM )\n\n2. Serum (self suggested) 🪮- makes hairs manageable inturn less breakage. After wash or whenever im using heat.\n\n3.  Soul flower serum (self suggested) 🫤- unsure, but i would bot recomment too many stuff ordinary is best.\n\n4. Soulflower oils 🛢️- (self suggested) - best ones for hair growth and thickness. (An hour before hairwash)\n\n\nAll these products are what i use, not suggesting that they work like magic or will work for everyone, but my face is now pimple free and when i touch my skin now, smooth and soft🥰. With PCOS your skin, mood and everything becomes twice complicated😅, i’ll aways suggest doctors when you think skincare and health🔎. If you are in bangalore and looking for the doctor, i have some names. I’m can help you🙃.\n\n\nThanks and have a great skin and hair ♥️🌸\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For reference, I have oily t-zone, sensitive, and somewhat acne prone (I think I've controlled it more, explained below) skin. I also have closed comedones (or fungal acne?) all around and acne scarring/hyperpigmentation on my cheek.\n\nMy current skincare morning/night routine:\n- Soon Jung whip cleanser\n- SK-II pitera clear lotion\n- SK-II pitera essence\n- Anua Niacinamide 10% + TXA 4% Serum (targeted on my cheeks)\n- Shiseido white lucent eye cream\n- Vaseline intensive care (yellow bottle)\n\nI've tried other cleansers, like Anua Quercetinol Pore Deep and Innisfree Green Tea, which were ok but didn't seem to really help. I recently got the Soon Jung one and I really like it so far, my skin actually feels clean after washing but also not stripping. The SK-II seemed to have help control my oiliness a little as well as acne, which I've been using since January 2025. I think the Anua Niacinamide helped a little but then plateaued, so my scarring is still there just not as obvious as better. Ngl Shiseido eye cream didn't seem like it did anything but I thought there's no harm in using it since I don't have any other eye cream. Vaseline lotion I've used for multiple years at this point, I had tried Illiyoon ceramide cream but I think it made me break out (couple years ago, I don't remember clearly).\n\nI want to get rid of my bumpy texture from closed comedones, acne scarring on my cheeks, and control my oiliness! Any and all advice would be appreciated!",

From the title, I have an asymmetrical face and also a forehead dent (though ig its not too noticeable in these photos(?)) and it has really been a big insecurity of mine. Was thinking of getting bangs to hide the dent but I heard thats not good for asymmetrical faces :(( I kind of have a cowlick too, and a widows peak. Would appreciate haircut suggestions!! Thanks!",
