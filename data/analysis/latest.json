Thank you so much for that. \n\nBut I also appreciate all the feedback and took the advise of those who said I probably needed more product in my routine to help hydrate my hair. \n\nI took the time to section my hair and apply leave in and gel to each section. \n\nI used miss jessies curly pudding for my leave in  and not your mother’s curl talk flash gel. I then used my bounce curl to curl each section and finished by defusing my hair. \n\nI still see a bit of frizz at my root so I probably needed a bit more gel there. But over all I’m happy with how my hair turned out for last nights event. \n\nI will say my day two hair is still struggling a bit especially at the root but it was extra foggy this morning and wet so that probably did me in.

      "content": "Early male, 20s. I have two toned lips but nothing really helped with that pigmentation, so I'm not gonna talk about it and I made peace with it. I'll review the spf and non-spf ones separately:\n\n#SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Chaptex spf 15 🟢\n\n- My derm prescribed me this when I had extremely dry and cracked lips (turned out to be cheilitis)\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, no fragrance, doesn't taste bitter, has humectant (D-Panthenol)\n\n- Has only spf 15. I see most people suggesting to use at least spf 30 or higher. I wish they made a spf 30 version\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##2. NMFe spf 40 🟢\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, has slight fragrance (I like it), has humectant (aloe vera extract)\n\n- It tastes bitter, that's the only complaint I have\n\n- Overall: 9.5/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##3. Sebamed spf 30 🔴\n\n- Has slight fragrance (didn't like it), very expensive, wasn't that moisturizing\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##4. Minimalist spf 30 (not in the picture) 🟢\n\n- Super cute packaging (but the lid broke after a few months 🥲), fragrance free, has humectant (Hyaluronic acid)\n\n- it's waxy, not quite easy to spread\n\n- Overall: 8.5/10. Will probably repurchase.\n\n___\n\n___\n\n#Non-SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Vaseline lip therapy Creme Brulee 🔴🟢\n\n- The caption under it says *for deliciously kissable lips* which hurts even more because it reminds me I have no-one to kiss 😭💀\n\n- It smells exactly like the Vaseline lip therapy cocoa butter one, it's very hard to differentiate the smell. Quite moisturizing, love the smell obv\n\n- Little heavy on the pocket (probably because it's imported?)\n\n- Overall: 8/10 (subtracted 1 for the caption). WNRP\n\n___\n\n##2. Vaseline skin protecting jelly (indian version) 🟢\n\n- Almost every Indian household has it lol. It's good, does its job\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##3. Vaseline BLUESEAL pure petroleum jelly (imported) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT! I wish they sold this here in India everywhere instead of the skin protecting jelly\n\n- I bought it from Amazon but I was skeptical initially because of the picture the seller put on Amazon lol.\n\n- It's AMAZING! Seals the moisture very well and I also use it for slugging in the night. It's smoother and more buttery compared to the Indian version we get\n\n- I don't use it on the lips alone, I'll be mentioning my current routine which is helped me the most at the end of the post\n\n- Overall: 11/10. WRP! HG\n\n___\n\n##4. Nipcare 🔴\n\n- Bought it at the expense of weird looks from the pharmacy guy (didn't know it is used by lactating mothers for sore nipples)\n\n- It smells really awful (Lanolin, can't complain), didn't really do much for my lips and it's also not easy to spread it\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##5. Laneige Lip sleeping mask (berry) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT 🐐 helped me so much with my dry lips. Not a big fan of that smell but it doesn't bother me. Leaves a white film on lips and I rub the entire thing off in the morning after waking up and there you go, plumpy soft lips!\n\n- It's probably a little overpriced but it lasts really long so can't complain ig\n\n- Overall: 10/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##6. LRP Cicaplast B5 baume 🔴\n\n- I didn't know you can also use it as a lip balm until I read some of the comments here but it didn't do anything for my lips and they felt even more dry in the morning \n\n- it's good as a barrier repair cream tho, helped me with redness and irritation near nose corners when I increased my tret frequency \n\n- Overall: 0/10 for lips, 8.5/10 for barrier repair\n\n___\n\n##7. Vaseline lip therapy tin (cocoa &amp; original) 🟢\n\n- It was a pain in the a*s to open the packaging but I bought the original one recently and it was super easy to open. Glad they changed its packaging (not sure about the cocoa one tho)\n\n- It's thick, does its job as an occlusive\n\n- Both of them are good. The cocoa one smells heavenly but I personally found the original one to be better.\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##8. Vaseline lip care total moisture (tube) (not in the picture) 🟢🔴\n\n- I love the smell, it's amazing! Very glossy finish and hydrates well. Affordable!\n\n- Hard to apply with that spherical base and I don't like touching it \n\n- Overall: 7/10. WRP\n___\n\n##9. Nova ayurvedic cream 🔴\n\n- My grandma suggested me this one. It's good with the hydration part but the fragrance is veryyy heavy and the lips kinda burn initially after application \n\n- Overall: 3/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##Current routine:\n\nAM: NMFe\n\nPM: Laneige lip sleeping mask + Vaseline BLUESEAL \n\nThis routine helped me so much with dry lips. But not applying lip balm for even 1 day makes my lips dry again. My derm suggested that I use lip balm at least thrice a day and asked me to reapply whenever they felt dry. \n\n___\n\n##HONORARY MENTION: Brillare natural coconut lip balm \n\nWHAT DO I EVEN SAY? Hate is a strong word and I hate this lip balm with a passion. The texture of it is ugly af, it literally sticks to my finger. It smells like shit. I have tried applying it only once and was weirded out with the texture but still wanted to try and apply. This idiot doesn't even spread, it's that thick and sticky. THE WORST LIP BALM I'VE EVER SEEN 🏆",

      "content": "Hello my fellow curlies!  It’s been a long couple of years trying to figure out how to manage the chaos that is my curls, but I’m finally figuring it out!  The biggest thing I’ve learned is to not fight what your hair naturally does.  For years I was self conscious about how flat my cowlick is.  So I put way too much emphasis on volume and that caused years of bad frizz and was just way too poofy.  My hair dresser has helped immensely with figuring out my routine.  Chat GPT was also a game changer as well.  \n\nAlright so let’s talk about the routine.  I use Ouidad vitalcurl shampoo.  Right now I’m on day 4 without it, yesterday I used as I am coconut co wash and honestly I probably won’t need to shampoo for a couple of days.  When I shampoo or co wash; I use verb hydrating conditioner after.  And I’ve learned to always always always apply leave in conditioner while still in the shower.  I use Sheamoisture leave in conditioner with Jamaican black castor oil everyday.  I very gently detangle with a detangling brush when I use my leave in.  After that I take a handful of water and scrunch upwards.  The detangling brush just ensures that the product is evenly distributed, and be gentle when detangling curls, cannot emphasize that enough.  \n\nAfter the shower, I use a microfiber towel as little as possible.  I only use it when I have drops of water falling out of my hair while getting ready for the day.  So I’ll just lightly push upwards to give it a light scrunch as gently as possible to remove that excess moisture.  And then I just try to avoid touching my hair as much as I possibly can while it’s drying.  In the past I have used deep conditioner and olaplex no. 3; the routine I’ve had up until about a week or so ago was probably the only reason I needed that stuff.  I probably won’t need it anymore.  \n\nThe only hard part of my routine now is just trying to avoid getting the leave in into my roots, when that happens my scalp just gets kind of itchy. But today I think I figured out the trick, had almost no itchiness.   \n\nNow I just need another year or two to pass to get my hair at the length I want.  Figuring out the right routine was the hardest part.  Now I just need to continue the good habits and I’ll have my dream hair in a matter of time, I’m super excited!  ",

I’m a male in my 20s and I’ve always had oily skin and acne. (Though the acne has thankfully gotten a bit better recently after I got sober and changed my diet some.) I wash my pillow cases and sheets every 2-3 days; I never go past 3 days regardless of how busy I am. \n\nI was reading through the sub a bit and saw that too much salicylic acid could worsen it, and should be used with a hydrator as well. I worked at Target when I was younger and typically heard people speak highly of CeraVe. Are these 2 that I attached a good combo? \n\nI’d prefer to buy something in-store instead of waiting however long for something to be delivered. **I’m also looking for whatever I buy to be fragrance free.**\n\nI’m pretty clueless about the whole skin care routine stuff and would hate to worsen my acne buying stuff on a whim. So, I figured I’d ask people that are much more knowledgeable on the topic than myself. I’m open to all advice and would be very thankful. :) (I believe this is the correct post flair.

I read that the shampoo I’ve been using isn’t great for everyday washing (I work in a barn and my hair gets disgusting and stinks of horses if I don’t wash it everyday) due to excessive protein. I’m not sure how true it is, but I was hoping to get some advice on different types of shampoo &amp; conditioners that help with growing out my hair, breakage, and shedding. I don’t know what is and isn’t “safe” products, I’ve heard of products leaving harmful films on hair so I would like to steer clear of them. Any suggestions and recommendations would help :) Thank you!",

I’ve used 2 colour strippers in it from the colourless brand and I’m happy that it stripped most of the pigment but as you can see it’s still there. I used schwarzkopf live purple and pink in the permanent option on my natural dark blonde hair. However I have a trip in January and wish to get foils to maybe achieve a honey blonde. But I don’t know whether that’s possible or recommended since it might damage my hair or simply not work. If that’s the case is there any solutions I can use to strip the colour out completely or should I just wait it out?",

I don’t know what products actually matter for this style, and the only thing that’s easy for me to find are glitters, but they’re almost always too chunky. I’m specifically looking for that very fine, delicate shimmer, not big sparkles\n\nSo I wanted to ask:\n\nWhat kind of products are usually used for looks like this?\n\nIs it more about toppers, shimmery bases, pigments, or technique?\n\nAre there any key products to start with without buying a lot?\n\nAny advice, product recommendations, or even keywords to search would really help.

I have recently met with a curl specialist and she's getting me on the right track, but I won't see her again until February. The sides of my hair are shorter because I used to do burst fades.\n\nThe back curls are chefs kiss and I love them and they're perfect and I wish they were all over. The top of my head...not so much. They are thinner and have a different curl pattern, which causes it to look like I have a piece of lettuce on my head (in my mind). Any thoughts on how to give the top curls more lift? \n\nPics are on wash day, fully dried. Product applied.\n\nLocation: Florida. Hard water. High humidity. Heat.\n\nRoutine: wash every 2-3 days with Innersense Pure Harmony Hairbath. Condition with Innersense Pure Inspiration daily conditioner (only when I wash). A baby spray of Innersense Sweet Spirit Leave In. Then Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Featherlight Volumizing Foam. Diffuse on high heat, low speed hovering the hair. Then scrunch with a tiny bit of Verb Ghost Oil if I feel I need it. If I don't diffuse, I just air dry and scrunch. Sometimes I do a \"raw\" day where I don't put anything in my hair after a wash. Idk if that's allowed Imao, but I do it.\n\nRoutine Bonus: clarify once a month with K18 peptide prep shampoo and innersense detox hair",

I have fine curls that when I followed a routine and thought I did everything right most of the time they would not clump, come out stringy, and fall flat and limp and thin. I tried different products in different orders,  on different levels of wetness, etc, and eventually chalked it up to humidity and things out of my control. \n\nI was under the impression that since my curls were fine it was very important to get as much water out of my hair as possible (I almost never diffuse, and airdry instead) as to not weigh them down. After applying my product on wet hair I would use a cotton shirt and scrunch upwards and pulse as much water out as possible. Doing this also removed a lot of product and therefore reduced the hold, and my clumps would get ruined. \n\nAnyone else find this to be the case? What I’m doing now is applying my product to super wet hair out of the shower, use a cotton shirt to scrunch and pulse upwards the same but this time only doing a couple passes, before I would do it continuously until I got it as dry as possible. So my hair now air dries more damp and my routine seems to be working alot better! Not perfect but a good improvement!\n\nHair type: fine, oily\n\nEvery other day: double shampoo roots with garnier curl nourish, (will sub out for Nizoral or ouai detox shampoo as needed based on buildup, usually atleast 1x/week) \n\nAs needed (maybe 1x/month): exfoliate with ouai scalp scrub and scalp brush\n\nOn soaking wet hair in order: Not your mothers leave in spray curl talk conditioner, tresseme extra hold volumizing mousse, and curlsmith in shower style fixer gel\n\nApplication method: with head tilted, rake in and praying hands with tension to form clumps, then gently scrunch upwards only a couple times. Use cotton shirt to scrunch upwards again to absorb some water but not all, and air dry damp, in the morning I scrunched out the cast. I didn’t pineapple or anything over night (it always gave me mixed results)",

I feel like I look more traditionally \"pretty\" with longer hair, but I hate fussing with it all the time - washing it, brushing it, dealing with stray hairs everywhere, all of it is annoying to me. A sensory nightmare. Short hair is a lot easier for me to manage &amp; feels a bit more \"me,\" but I feel like I end up looking less attractive and not feminine enough with it. Those closest to me very kindly encourage me to do whatever I want with it, but at this point I don't know what that is, so I was hoping to get some strangers' inputs on what looks best. ",

I cant get rid of the sheamoisture and Cantu at this time, so i thought j might as well solve the other issue. what are your recommendations for a protein masque and conditioner which balance cost with effectiveness?
