My current routine is the Ordinary squalene cleanser followed by the rhode barrier butter. I’m not sure about the rhode but my sister got it for me for Christmas so I’m trying it out. I like that it makes my skin feel hydrated but it feels a bit heavy on the skin. I’d like lighter weight products that will clear up my skin and keep my skin nice and plump and hydrated. Bonus points if you know how to help dark under eyes 😢 I’m coming to terms with them slowly but any advice is welcome",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

The first few photos of the darker hair is my hair today/recent between trying to figure out how to style it niceley, and the brighter blonde is 1 year ago when i didnt do much to it.\n\nIm gonna likley overexplain everything i know.\n\nMy routine i used for the first few photos was brushing my hair in the shower then scrunching the conditioner with water, then added Not Your Mothers definition cream and gel, then i went in 3 sections and (very badly and unsure i did it right) finger curled my entire head, i didnt know how to add volume whatsoever so i just used a claw clip then let it air dry then difused to break the gel cast and used ogx nourishing coconut milk anti breaking oil and a tiny pea drop of gisou oil on my hair.\n\nMy routine in my brighter blonde photo, i dont remember my routine but i know i used a bunch of gisou, and i did my curly hair routine every day (before i knew how to preserve curls) i think i used truesemme bouncy curl mousse, garnier curl sculpting cream, ganier gel, and garnier leave in conditioner (...?)\n\nProducts i used for my daily routine right now are not your mothers  (NYM for short) leave in, NYM curl defining cream, NYM curl mousse, NYM gel, and ogx coconut milk anti breaking serum oil, and sometimes next of us curl reactivating mist\n\nI really dont know if i have 2b hair or. 3a hair, i think its around that range though? my hair is thin and is damaged a bit from hair coloring and heat damage. i dont even know what purosity means, i dont know if my hair needs moisture. im clueless. I am at this point begging for help, my hair has been my biggest insecurity latley and ive tried so many routines and im not finding any help and its stressing me out so so so much.   \n  \nI dont know what i want my hair to look like, kinda like how it was last year with its shine, but maybe more definition? I dont know. I dont know anything about curls still and i keep comparing my hair to other peoples and its been making me struggle and getting extremely frustrated with my hair.

For the past 2/3-ish years, I have been using SLMD's Salicylic Acid Cleanser, Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer, Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Lotion, and Retinol Resurfacing Serum. I also use Thayer's Witch Hazel. These products have been holy grails for me, but I've only recently realized how oily my skin is after using them. I have tried many products, but SLMD has been the only product that has worked for me and clears any breakouts I have, very quickly. \n\n  \nWhen I don't use these products, especially the Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Lotion, my skin becomes super dry. I don't know what to do as these products work for me, but my skin being oily isn't an enjoyable feeling, and I think it contributes to my pores being clogged. I wash my face twice a day and only use the Retinol Serum at night. Should I use a different face wash to help with the oiliness? Or do I need to find completely different products? Any advice would be helpful! \n\n  \nIf it's of any use, here is the order of how I do my skincare:\n\nSalicylic Acid Cleanser -&gt; Let skin air dry -&gt; Thayer's Witch Hazel -&gt;Let skin air dry again -&gt;  Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Lotion -&gt;  Retinol Resurfacing Serum (only at night) -&gt; Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer.\n\n",

      "title": "My Hair Journey- opinion on brands I’ve tried",
      "content": "I thought I’d give folks my opinion after using various products (US specific so probably only useful for those stateside)\n\nBackground is I’m now in my late forties and hair loss runs through all of my family so thought I couldn’t really escape it.  A few years ago the top was very thin and receding quite a lot but thought I’d see what I could do to try and slow it down.\n\nFirst Attempt- Kirkland Minoxidil Foam. Was ok for a while and helped a little with growth. However, I stopped using it as I was sick for a few days and when I started again my scalp would really burn when I applied it so I stopped.\n\nSecond Attempt- Happy Head Topical Fin and Min. Chose this as it was the highest concentration I could find for a topical at that time and had hydrocortisone. This was where they suggested using a .25 roller and I think the combo really worked.  Crown regrowth was very good and receding hairline stopped but no regrowth there.\n\nThird Attempt- had a hair transplant (4000 grafts) at the front and stopped using Happy Head for around 6 weeks (2 weeks pre and 4 weeks post surgery). Really noticed the non-transplanted area start to thin and losing hair. Doctor said shock loss from surgery but I’m thinking it was stopping the Fin and Min.\n\nFourth Attempt- thought I’d try moving away from topical and went for Locklab. Thought I’d signed up for the 4 in 1 that included Dut but turns out in the checkout process I made a mistake and ordered the one with Fin and Min and Biotin only. Roll forward a couple of weeks and loss is getting worse so add topical back (still taking Locklab)\n\nFifth Attempt- Ro Mane Spray. Still in its trial phase with me but definitely seeing improvement and regrowth.\n\nSixth Attempt- will start next month. After leaving Happy Head and being a customer for 2+ years they tried to lure me back and have a new slow release once a day 10 in 1 serum topical that they offered for a year at a heavy discount.\n\nSo here’s my thoughts on each:\n\nKirkland Minoxidil Foam- was working until my scalp reaction and the cheapest option\n\nHappy Head Fin &amp; Min Topical- used this for over 2 years and happy with the outcome on the crown area. However, it makes your hair look greasy and stains pillows yellow! Also, the actual topical arrives transparent and as the month progresses you see it start turning yellow despite storing as per their guidance.\n\nLocklab - I know it takes time to take effect so jury is out and since I’m using a topical as well it’s tough to know its effectiveness. Maybe I’ll stop topicals in march and see.\n\nRo Mane Spray - I actually really like how this is formulated as it doesn’t look greasy at all. However, it’s a weaker concentration to Happy Head and directions say apply once a day only whereas Happy Head is twice. Also, it says max four pumps but given I want the fin to stop hairloss and min to boost growth takes more than 4 pumps to get a good coverage and massage in. So using this twice a day with an extra pump or two means my 3 month supply is probably going to finish in 6 weeks or less which means double the price\n\nHappy Head 10 in 1 topical - I’ll come back on this one once I start.\n\nFor me, I think the end state will be Locklab or a pill that works for me (hopefully)vs topical in the longer term but I can say that, for me, happy head fin + min really made a difference and the next iteration will either be Ro Mane (really like the non-greasiness or staining) or the Happy Head 10 in 1.\n\nHope this helps other folks thinking about their journeys.",

My face is also incredibly red and splotchy in the forehead area too so I could use help with that too 😣. I went to an endocrinologist and she gave me spirolactone to help my skin as well as help my pcos. I’ve been using Dr Althea products and they’re not really helping either. I feel like I’m losing it because nothing is working and it’s really effecting me and my confidence/ self esteem. It’s been 2 months on spiro and I’m being patient but I really cannot see anything that has improved. What can I do? What should I do???",

(I avoid ashy tones because it makes my hair look greenish-muddy, but considering how cool toned I am gold would completely wash me out).\n\nI bought and used Paul Mitchel’s The Demi 7NB + 8NB with a volume 7 processing liquid 2% peroxide. \n\nBasically it got me to the LEVEL I wanted but hollyyyyy how is it brassy. Like orange! You can see at the top of my head at the roots however the cool natural color I am. \n\nI am attaching he results along with reference images for the tone I was going for, and need advice on what to do to reach the inspiration (or at least close to it).
