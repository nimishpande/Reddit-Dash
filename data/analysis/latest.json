Conditioner is Aussie curly conditioner, perfect and lightweight for my hair.\n\nI do all of my styling routine with my head upside down. Starting with the Noughty Curl spray on hair that is dripping but not smoking wet. I brush that through and then cup and scrunch with my hands, and then again with a microfiber towel. Then the Bed Head Foxy Curls Mousse, I usually do a blob with about 2 inch diameter. I have alot of hair but the strands are thin. Then the Noughty Jelly, just a bit distrubuted over my hair as thin and even as possible. Then the heat protection and after that I diffuse, usually takes me around 30mins for complete dry hair on low heat and low speed. I hover diffuse and then cup diffuse.\n\nIm really pleased with my hair and I think I finally have my perfect product match up for my hair 😁",

Keeping length is really important to me as my curls are so tight, it takes a while to get any length. I feel like the hair dresser took off more than needed and my hair is shorter than when I first had it cut 6 months ago. \nI've uploaded two videos for reference, sorry if they're not that good, I barely take photos or videos 😭  the one posted is the current cut. I feel like it's very short and round. I'll post the other vid in the comments. It was from last week.

I know looks aren’t everything, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m aging in fast forward while everyone else gets to look young a little longer. The vanity part stings, but honestly the confidence hit is worse\n\nDating apps made it very clear how much people care about hair. My matches dropped like 90% as soon as it started thinning. It’s depressing to realize how quickly you become “less attractive” over something you can’t control.\n\nI play battlefield with friends most nights and even in the chat, jokes get tossed around about my hairline like it’s just harmless fun. Maybe for them it is. For me it’s a constant reminder.\n\nSo I’m asking guys who’ve been through this:  \nDo I just shave it and move on?  \nDoes confidence really make that much of a difference?  \nHow do you accept a change you never wanted?\n\nI don’t want to feel embarrassed about something that’s just genetics but right now I do.",

I used to use the Vanicream Vitamin C daily but stopped it a few weeks ago as I thought it was causing the issue.\n\nIt used to work well for me, but then I stopped doing skincare for about a year due to the habit breaking. I’ve been doing it again now for ~2.5 months, and my skin has gotten worse after doing it. My moisturizer and cleanser are not expired as they’re new. I get most of the breakouts on my left cheek. That is the most sensitive part of my face, and I don’t think it has to do with sleeping position, face touching, etc as it’s also the only part of my face that will have marks where the pimple was. These marks only go away after a couple months. \n\nI know my skin type is very sensitive, dry skin. What could be causing this break out? Any recommendations on how to fix this? Any help is appreciated! Thank you!",

My hormones are a fucking mess along with my face shoulders back and neck. \n\n\nWhere should I start with skincare to get back to a baseline? I have sensitive skin. I think I need some sort of exfoliation- should I do Paula’s choice BHA stuff? Should I stick with all pregnancy safe products so I can keep using them into pregnancy? Any advice appreciated. I’ve been so low maintenance up to this point because accutane and Botox are a god send. \n\n\nSkin pre pregnancy: normal to dry, sensitive, rare breakouts, 2 accutane cycles as a teen, low maintenance. A wash here and there, good-ish at sunscreen, moisturizer. Cerave products exclusively.\n\n\nPregnancy skin: oil pit. Terrible texture. Non stop breakouts. Cysts, white heads, black heads, all of it.\n\n\nCurrent state: TBD - loss was yesterday. Skin still oily and zit-y. \n",

My biggest complaint is the acne on my cheeks, but the whitehead situation on my chin is also a bother.\n\nThe only skincare/routine I use is nightly hydrating Olay daily facials water activated dry cloths. Occasionally I use Green glowup cream by tovegan. I do wear makeup 4–5 days a week, using CC cream rather than foundation.\nI have a Nexplanon implant; I'm not sure if the new hormones could be contributing to this.\n\nI'm very embarrassed by these photos but I need a solution. I know this isn't *super* severe, but as someone who has always had quite clear skin, this is definitely affecting me. Going to a dermatologist is not an easy option for me at this time, so I'd like to exhaust any advice from you guys before I consider it. Extra points for budget options.\n\nThanks so much for listening to my rant and possibly sending some advice my way.",

      "content": "Disclaimer\n\nI am a teen (f) and discovered that I have PIE(post inflammatory erythema) in my cheeks. Earlier I just thought that they were acne scars. It has been atleast 5-6 months since I developed these. Before that I had acne. Also I have closed comedones on my forehead, blackheads that are really visible on the nose and chin. But tbh my main problem is dealing with PIE and dark circles. The pictures don't clearly show them but they are pretty much visible and dark . My current skincare routine is Cetaphil cleanser,\n\nMinimalist nicinamide 5 percent serum\n\nMinimalist barrier repair moisturizer\n\nDermaco suncreen\n\nI'm thinking of changing Cetaphil cleanser with simple face wash because I want some lather and I'm thinking of going with tinted sunscreen now after this finishes. I don't use that many actives on my skin because my skin barrier was damaged.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aoe95kdlziyf1.jpg?width=314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c05cac36ebc21f73b87808c72aab314d8aa52831\n\nI'm thinking of buying plum undereye vitamin c cream. is it good?

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
