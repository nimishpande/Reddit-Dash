I’ve tried a bonnet, but they typically slip off his head while he’s sleeping so now I do a loose bun on top of his head. Sometimes in the morning, I can take out the bun, wet the hair that gets frizzy around his face and it’ll do in a pinch. If I want the curls to look nice again though, I completely wet it with water and leave in conditioner and comb it out. This definitely works, but I feel bad sending him to school with damp hair, especially in the colder months. Are there any other options to keep his curls overnight or to refresh them in the morning without getting his hair completely wet? Any suggestions would be so appreciated!\n\nI have straight hair and my husband has much thicker curly hair so these types of curls are new to him too so we’re both trying our best to learn as we go.\n\n(The first picture is of his hair still a little damp and freshly washed and the second picture shows his hair let down from sleeping in a bun and fixed up as much as I could without starting from scratch)\n\nOur wash routine: We wash with Honest shampoo and conditioner, then use finger comb through a bit of Alaffia leave in conditioner and let air dry. \n",

I started breaking out pretty badly on my face this past month , started off with little white spots on my chin area I could scrape off easily but I tried not to do , covered them with patches. but now im seeming to get these slightly painful pimples that are really red and have a white center. no major changes in my routine , cetaphil face wash and cetaphil moisturizer as of lately , I used retinol occasionally but not enough to make me purge like this i believe, I stopped a while before the breakout began. I do wear heavy makeup but I’ve never been caused to breakout like this before. I shave my face about once every two weeks with a Phillips lady electric shaver , I do clean the head on it each time. i have however been using those clean towels from target to dry my face but could those be causing this?? I thought they’d help me accumulate less bacteria! any feedback would be great, lots of important events coming soon 🥲😭🤧",

Also I can pull the same almost everyday.\n\n3rd is hardest and takes quite a while, also depends on the humidity &amp; temp of where I am, if too humid I wouldn't be able to pull this off. Rarest.\n\n4th is doable, but not very easy like 1&amp;2 and need a haircut specially for this, not very manageable but again doable, need short sides and medium middle length.\n\n5th is for the lolz.

Here's some info in case any of this is important:\n\n*I'm mixed (half black, half white) &amp; in my 40s.\n*I do straighten my hair sometimes using a Chi Lava plate straightener which is at 250 degrees &amp; always use heat protectant.\n\nRoutine: I don't always use the same products &amp; don't always use a diffuser, but this was my routine today when these pix were taken. However this is an issue no matter what the routine is. \n\nSol de Janiero shampoo, Garnier Fructis Sleek conditioner in the shower. Sprayed a little conditioner/water mix &amp; used a detangling comb for detangling. Small amount of Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine for heat protection. Mizani True Textures Curls, Coils &amp; Waves for definition. Diffused until mostly dry (had to go somewhere &amp; was running late) with a TGIBedhead diffuser (dont know the name but its the one thats JUST a diffuser) on medium heat &amp; high speed.\n\n I'm including pix that show my whole head of hair also so you can get an idea how the majority looks vs the problem areas. I've spent my entire life figuring out how to work with my hair &amp; its still a work in progress so please be nice 🙏🏼. All pix are from today since I needed to include the routine. I would love to know any tips on getting the curl texture back or making them look better. Thanks in advance. ",

I have Multi-racial hair and have struggled on how to take care of it for years and I dont have anyone close to me with that sort of hair anymore :(\nI have Caucasian, African American, and Hawaiian hair and its been hard trying to figure out the right products/care routine to really bring the curls out and enjoy them for long periods of time (plus the amount of tangles throughout the day is insane).\nThe products i use for shampoo and conditioner is Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Shine. Only problem is it causes quite a bit of my hair to fall out during the washing process. I let my hair air dry itself out since I've had bad experience with Towel and blow drying (the tangles were awful). Im also unsure how often I should be washing my hair in general, I wash it every other day and sometimes after 2-3 days and I cant tell a difference between both.\nSide products I am currently using are Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Ultra Moisture and Nourish Oil. Have not had a bad experience from it but it doesn't seem to be doing much either.\nI have also started using Curls Aloe and Blueberry Juice Curl moisturizer and it has caused a lot of tangles a few hours after using it. \nI usually spray the products into my hair and then finger comb it through it.\n i had once tried using a pick on my hair but it seemed to fluff out the curls and caused it to get all frizzy so I've stuck with just finger combing through it and the tangles are horrendous! :(\nI try to finger comb it twice a day but im unsure if I need to do it more than that or not.\nI also sleep with a satin bonnet every night but I dont use it for any other occasion.\nI would really appreciate any sort of help for dealing with my hair type, I had gotten frustrated and got it cut short per the photo above after a really bad day at work and figured it would be a bit easier to take care of as well (i used to have it midway through my back and it wasnt very fun to take care of).\nThank you all in advance and I greatly appreciate it! 🙏 😊 ",

      "content": "Hi there, I desperately need your help :(\nMy nails are basically separating into layers. This happened once before in 2020\n1 and only went away after about 2 years. I have no idea why it started and no idea why it stopped. Before that I had strong nails (always natural, never used nail polish, don't wear any sort of fake nails, never used oils or anything).\nFor two years I couldn't even touch stuff without breaking something.\nAnd now it's returned.\n\nSince I've been \"blessed\" with cystic fibrosis I'm getting a giant blood panel every 3 months so I know that my iron/ferritin, B12 and vitamin d as well as my thyroid are fine. My other values are good too.\nBtw: I have the actual numbers and not just a dismissive \"it's fine\" from a doctor so I know my values are on the higher end for what's normal for the vitamins and iron.\n\nI have used various types of nail hardeners like sililevo, SI nails, Opi repair mode vs. nail polishes like OPI nail envy or Miro cell that you reapply every day for a week - except despite the nail polish the upper layer of my nail excuses itself long before I'm even able to reach a week.\nI use acetone free nail removers.\n\nI also supplement biotin and basically all vitamins (no drug store products but actual medication, again due to my cystic fibrosis and doctors orders).\nThe CF also isn't the reason why this happens. At  least my doctor's know of no other patient with this issue.\n\nMy toenails don't have this issue, they keep slicing through my socks like it's what they've been born to do. My hair is fine but strong enough to build bridges from.\n\nI use a glass nail file. I try to protect my hands with gloves when cleaning and washing dishes. I don't think I wash my hands too often.l because o only wash when I have a reason (cooking, coming in from outside, toilet).\n\nMy nails used to be so strong but ever since the first time I had this issue they have been weak no matter how much nail oil I use. And now the plague is back and parts of my nails keep chipping off during the day (mostly thumb, pointer and middle finger). Please help!\n\nIf you can recommend helpful products that would be great, especially if they were available in Germany where I live.",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
