I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

      "content": "I genuinely don’t know what I’m supposed to do anymore. I have tried everything. I used every stronghold gel on the market and yet my hair turns straight. Most curlyheads rave on about getting a poofy mess in the morning after waking up when mines the complete opposite, I wake up with thin pin straight hair and if I don’t add water or some type of leave in conditioner, it will be stuck straight forever. Is my hair some type of hybrid???\n\nMy routine:\n\nI shampoo and condition once a week using the based shampoo and conditioner. Then I style with either the As I am bond leave-in or the based leave in followed by the based curl creme and gel. I usually like to switch it up and use different products such as multicultural curls or pillow soft curls from miss jessies or something like the bee girl gel from doux.\n\nI also co-wash once a week using the based conditioner and following it with the same routine above.\n\nFor every product I usually scrunch it in or brush style, but if I’m feeling fancy I’ll finger coil(this takes WAY too much time though).\n\nTo protect my hair while I sleep, I use a silk bonnet but sometimes I get lazy and just sleep without it, I don’t think this really matters because I also use a silk pillowcase.\n\nFor drying, I diffuse my hair until it’s a complete gel cast and I scrunch it out with this generic jojoba oil from my local dollar store. Sometimes if I’m in a rush, I just diffuse until its at least 50% dry and just it air dry for the rest of the time(still using oil after tho).",

Thank you all for any responses!\n\nRoutine:\n\n1) shampoo and condition with Aveda curly hair line\n2) sometimes instead of conditioner it's a 10 keratin leave in conditioner\n3) boucleme curl defining gel scrunched in\n4) air dry and scrunch at intervals\n5) refresh as needed in the morning by wetting the hair only as much as I need to get a.vrush through comfortably (keeping roots dry) and addi g a tiny bit of extra gel if necessary.

      "content": "I had a whole mental breakdown in 2020 during quarantine and went complete buzz cut. yeah it looked good etc. but that's not the point. as it grew back out I kept the sides short. it was like that for years until my family started telling me \"your brother's wedding is in a year you should grow your hair back out\" and I realized I'm not about to wear a wig to his wedding so it's basically gonna grow back out. I never ended up going (money) but continued to grow it back out. I was using argan oil on the roots after washing and conditioning to help. At one point ordered Spoiled Child so it can grow faster. Eventually getting into the awkward phase, I used smaller curlers to keep them stay tame. If I didn't use curlers ...well ....I'd have a frizzy head. The strip down the middle of my head is still curly. the sides....not so much. I'd have 2C hair on bad days and 3A hair on good days. But the sides? A constant \"tucked behind the ear and stuck\" look. I want my curls back! I feel like if I'm not artificially curling the hair on the sides, they're not gonna curl anymore. It's not straight hair just....goes out into a weird arch around my ears 😐\n\nRoutine for reference: I've been mostly using OGX shampoo and conditioner and Shea Moisture curl cream afterwards with Shea Moisture frizz serum as well. I'm down to using Tresemme shampoo and conditioner plus Cantu curl cream cuz I can't afford any decent product right now. Back when I was working in 2022-2023 I would use Nexxus. That's so far been my favorite brand. I don't wear a bonnet to bed. I hate things touching my neck, forehead, and ears (got a bit of the 'tism) and I don't have a silk/satin pillow. I've tried the cotton T-shirt method to dry overnight and it still doesn't stick.\n\nMy question is, did I mess up by continuing a buzz cut on the sides and letting the rest of my hair grow normally after a full buzz cut? Did that, by any chance, have an effect on how curly my hair is going to grow back out? If so, what can I do to get it back? My hair is now layered from ear to shoulder length. Somewhere between short and medium hair. I would post pics but I want to stay private. ",

I moisturize head to toe immediately after every shower and without fail I’m back to being uncomfortably dry an hour later. And if I go too long without moisturizing I start flaking so much I can see dead skin all over my clothes. It’s gross. Ive tried an array of different body oils paired with lotions and body butters and I’m tired of buying things that aren’t working🥲 the most success I’ve had so far is with the la roche posay triple repair lotion, but I go through each bottle so quickly and it hasn’t been great for my budget.

I grew up as a teenage girl and have had acne issues since I was 10, especially after hair removal (waxing, shaving, threading, nair, etc.) I would have horrible rashes, ingrown hairs, bumps, etc.. But I have been using clindamycin &amp; benzoyl peroxide since I was like 15 and its worked really well on my skin for 1x/day use. Anytime I try something different I get painful breakouts, it sucks.\n\nAnyway! On top of that I also have trichotillomania, so I pull out my hairs with my fingers due to anxiety. It used to be my eyebrows, but I stopped from ages 18-24, however its recently come back, my thing has now been pulling my beard hairs on my chin. This is irritating because I have to shave it since it looks horrible if I recently picked hairs out, but I would like to keep it long if possible. (I'm working on the trich trust me, its just a horrible habit that is hard to stop especially when I'm stressed) I've noticed the acne has worsened and it can be sensitive to touch, I often have little red dots with white tips and ingrown hairs to pluck. I'm unsure if its from my pulling of the hairs or if it could be fungal acne. Its only in my chin area where I pluck.\n\nI know no one here are experts but just some opinions would be helpful, I am considering trying antifungal shampoo products after reading the guide to fungal acne. I wonder if anyone has other suggestions 🙏😬",

There are acne, acne marks, visible pores, redness around the nose, etc.\n\nMy current skincare routine is quite basic: Simple Gentle Cleanser + Minimalist Moisturizer + Neutrogena Sunscreen. I skip the sunscreen at nighttime. I also use benzoyl peroxide for spot treatment.\n\nShould I change these products and/or add to this routine?\n\nPS I’m really hoping to get some advice on this community-based group because, other than going to a dermatologist which I might still do, I don’t know where else I can get personal advice like this.

      "content": "Hello! Unfortunately I have been dealing with persistent PIE following breakouts - it’s a bit of a viscous cycle with closed comedomes appearing, tret purging them, and then being left with PIE marks (upwards of a year). \n\nFor treating the PIE, I have tried multiple azelaic acid products over the years (finacea 15% prescription cream, ordinary azelaic acid, peach slices azelaic acid, naturium azelaic acid) at all different frequencies (2x/day, 1x/day, every second day, etc). I have unfortunately never seen an improvement in my PIE, and I’m actually convinced that using the azelaic acid (specifically the finacea) causes an increased number of closed comedomes for me, almost like it’s a constant low level purge. I’m at the point I feel like azelaic acid just might not be helpful for my skin. Also the tret doesn’t help fade the PIE for me. \n\nI’m wondering what other products people have had success with in terms of clearing their PIE? My skin in sensitive to niacinimide so I try to avoid that. I’ve read about tranexamic acid but it sounds like that’s better for PIH? Also considering caudalie vinoperfect despite the mixed reviews. Any recommendations or insight would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you!",

I'm starting to experiment with the curls now though, and I'm a little torn. I feel like I have to shorten it a bit to really get the look I want, and honestly it is pretty thin and dead at the bottom. but I'm attatched to my length, I feel like its a part of me and I've never really had it cut before. I've thought about layers but my hair isn't particularly thick so I don't want to risk it getting too thin. \n\nthis isn't really a search for personal advice and more of a discussion about the curly long hair question. for my routine: I oil before shower once in a while (olive oil and black seed oil). when I shower I just shampoo, then either use conditioner or the kerastase nutritive mask. then I will either blow dry it, or if want to fix the curls I use a curl cream and gel.",
