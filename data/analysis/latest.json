First 2 pics are wash day, 2nd two are next day. I don't break the cast. We'll see how the rest of the week goes. Got a long walk to an appointment tomorrow no idea what the weather is.\n\nRoutine this time was clarify, wash with curlsmith moisturizing shampoo, deep condition with amika (protein), rinse with cold water, redken acidic bonding 16%, chi thermal protectant, pretty curl girl strong hold gel, brush and then define and scrunch. I did add a tiny bit extra all over and the top right before diffusing.\n\nOh yeah and the cast sets quicker than the curlsmith souffle gel I was using. I wanted a cheaper price point and this new one is not cheaper but if it works better/longer then I will use less often and hopefully save money. It's concentrated so it says use less but I feel like I still used kind of a lot. Only comes in 100 or 250ml I think. Hopefully the place selling it restocks soon because it's like 30% off right now ;-;",

However, I really just don’t know where to start. I’ve tried various methods (albeit using the same products) and it always comes out frizzy and messy, rather than defined neat curls.\n\nThese pictures were taken about an hour after hair washing. My routine was:\n\n-Washed hair with Tresemme repair shampoo once\n-Left tresemme conditioner in hair for about 5 minutes and then rinsed it out\n-Squeezed excess water out of hair, dried excess hair with micro fibre towel\n\n-let air dry for about 15 minutes \n-ran Tresemme Curls leave-in conditioner through ends and then blow-dried\n-ran Elive oil through hair (I don’t tend to do this but was told it would stop hair-clumping, which was an issue. Regardless it ended up more or less the same as without)\n\nThe result has, so far, always been a few nice curls which is ruined by extremely frizzy hairs and a lot of hair that just hasn’t curled properly. It leads to a sort of half-curled blob that looks more like an unkempt mess than anything nice.\n\nI’m aware I need a haircut too, but I’m unsure what I’d ask for, I want to promote curling and continue to grow out my hair but I don’t even know how to do that with product, let alone a haircut.\n \nAny help would be massively appreciated, I’d really love to have pretty, curly hair, and on the rare occasion I will get a very curly hair day, but I can never recreate it.",

Based on these pictures, do I have the kind of \"dark spots\" that things like vitamin c serums are supposed to fade? Or are these faint post-acne spots actually a different thing? And just overall, what skin concerns would my skin appear to fall under?\n\nSome of the things I bought to start using (but let me know if I'm on the wrong track) are\n1) Cleanser (Garnier Micellar water, and Naturium naicinamide cleansing \"gelee\")\n2) distilled Witch Hazel toner (Dickinson's)\n3) Serum (E.L.F. Bright Icon Vitamin C)\n4) A DIY moisturizer I make at home from jojoba and castor oil w/ frankincense (deep down I am a little Crunchy)\n5) Exfoliant (Naturium BHA)\n\nBefore today, I really only used the moisturizer and a cerave cleanser bar regularly. As you can see my skin isn't bad or anything, but I will be getting married in a few months and so I thought why not see how much I can improve things in that time! At the very least it can be a fun experiment and self-care-hobby. \n\nThank you :p just very curious to see what your verdict is!",

Highly recommend for that summery, natural highlighted look. \n\nI was going to dye my hair purple at the end of summer so I have a pot of purple semi-perm (manic panic purple haze). \n\nI wanted to experiment with putting some purple dye into my Marc Anthony Argan Oil conditioner and seeing if that removes some brassiness. I like the brass honestly, I just want to see if this sort of thing would work and experiment for fun! If it goes wrong, I’ll just dye my hair purple (still with a semi permanent dye). \n\nWould this mix work? And what ratios would you recommend? Will update if I try it out! ",

I'll admit I'm pretty lazy, but nothing I do seems to help so I go low maintenance. \n\nOne major problem is that it stays curly in the back, but looses curl in the front (probably because I'm always messing with it or putting it behind my ears). I also have two cowlicks in the front, think devil horns, and a terrible hair line, so I never know how to part it. Also I sweat a lot along my hairline, so it gets messy very easily. Most days, if I even try to make it look nice, I'll end up putting it in a messy bun before 10am. \n\nRoutine below, but I'm hoping for any advice on how to care for my hair, daily styles that work with my mess, and fancier styles that might work.\n\nRoutine: \n\n1. Wash and condition with argan oil products\n2. Wrap with a microfiber towel\n3. OXG argan oil defining cream\n4. Air dry\n5. Usually sleep on it because I shower at night\n\nThanks to anyone that can help, I'm hopeless :/\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nt34rqs59b0g1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3383c90f4120724fa840b258edd67770bbe3b450\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qx4pdqs59b0g1.jpg?width=1841&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af811688fdd8b1ebf9b24ba2d7ca25d897d3d01\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbrp7qs59b0g1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2690cdfe38405338241a44dde34fc02a6e41ef1f\n\n",

      "content": "hi!\n\nI'm sick and tired of my hair never looking anywhere similar the day after I shower ;(. I've tried a bonnet before but I think my personal issue is my hair gets under me while i sleep, flattening it. So, the bonnet doesnt help. My hair is thin and not that long so when I try to put it up to sleep in, the hair tie/scrunchie crushes it all, i guess. So, putting it up flattens it more basically. I have a satin pillowcase too.\n\nIn the picture I know my roots are also flat which I don't like. However, I'm trying to focus on one issue at a time (My hair flattening when I sleep) so I'm not worrying about that right now but I'll still take any advice. I think my hair is 3a. Also, my hair is still a bit wet from my shower in the picture but it looks like how it usually does after I shower by now (more or less)\n\nMy routine:  \n  \nShea moisturizer conditioner and shampoo. I brush my hair in the shower with the conditioner with a brush. After I shower, I use Carol's Daughter born to repair curl cream to brush my hair with my hands and then I do the ouidad method (idk if thats what people actually call it lol) and like \"flick\" my hair so it curls naturally. Then, I take the Curl Quencher ouidad gel and scrunch my hair with my hands. Then, I use a towel to continue scrunching.  \n  \nI just got a shea moisture mousse to try as I have thin hair and ive heard that mousse is better than gel for that reason. But I have used a different mousse before and i didn't see a difference between it and the gel honestly. I used the shea moisture mousse for the first time today. I let my hair air dry. \n\nI appreciate any advice! Thx in advanced\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ephttk8spa0g1.png?width=590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dd9bc354a5e9d67fd208e971a12446f0d363503\n\n",

      "content": "Hi, i didnt know whish to apply for 'help' or 'discussion' as its my first time doing this. So I have been wondering of trying to do my hair curly cause i grew up straightener it or just blow dry them and for a while now I've been wanting to make do them but have no clue where or how to begin. I've seen people talk bout hair mask, deep conditioner during the shower and leave in conditioner, mousse and gel. So yea confession it is haha.\n\nI've got (maybe) 3c-4a type of hair and would sometimes while showering notice puffy root. Since i live in a small city its hard to find stores for curly hair but theres delivery for a reason. I usally use TREsemme (the red one) shampoo and conditioner but i bought Garnier (the og one) shampoo, condition and mask to try them out. So far ive only used them once so nothing to say really. I've noticed i might have low porosity but it could be cause of hair (heat?) damage.\n\nRoutine:\nI usually wash my hair with shampoo, condition it, wash myself then brush it and rinse off everything. After drying off i would air blow/blow dry them. Since my hair is alot sometimes it takes long time too do them but if it gets too late i would straighten it other days, which is most of the time.  \n\nI've seen people talk about Umberto Giannini and SheaMoisture but as im a beginner with everything i want to begin from beginning. To fix my hair thats damaged to curing it back to curls (i guess😅).\n\nWould appreciate some help and shoot(not really shoot but u know what i mean) if theres any questions!",

      "content": "Hello y’all,\n\nFirst of all, this long war against the nature is really a shit.\n\nTo talk about my story,\n\nI started to use 1 mg oral fin ED and topical minoxidil 2 years ago. I had great gain and thickening, followed by stopping my hair fall. Last september I added 1x 0.5mg dut to my 7x 1mg fin regimen. I even improved my hair thickness for 6 months. BUT I started to shed after the end of this 6 month.\n\nIn march 2025 I started to shed like crazy… This shed lasted until today, and still going. I tried to increase my dut dosage up to x2 and x3 with x7 fin per week but nothing changed.\n\nTo clarify, I do not use generic brands. Only propecia and avodart.\n\nSo, the question rises now: What should I do?\n\nA) Stop dutasteride fully because it gives damage (?) to my hair and only stick with finasteride. 9 month is already enough.\n \nB) 2-3x dut is not enough so increase it to ED.\n\nFor the option A,\nI do find it weird to be honest because some people say that I might not be responding enough to dut But dont forget, I have never stopped using 7x fin.\n\nCould you guys help me, or just share your ideas please? I am planning to see a doctor but they are generally useless since they are mainly not pro fin/dut in my country.\n\nI appreciate all the support \n\nBest",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
