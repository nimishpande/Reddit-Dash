      "content": "Hello skincare addicts, sharing my journey with skin, expectations, and a bit of self-realization.\nI’m 38M. For most of my life, skincare simply wasn’t something I thought about. No proper routine, no sunscreen, and very little attention to skin health overall.\nMy work later required long hours outdoors, often sunrise to night, several days a week, for a few years. Constant sun exposure, dust, and heat gradually took a toll on my skin and hair. At the time, I didn’t really notice because it was just part of the job.\nIn 2022, a small incident made me pause and look at myself more closely. I happened to really observe my skin in the mirror for the first time in years and realized how much sun damage, tanning, and uneven pigmentation had built up over time. That was the moment I started thinking seriously about skincare.\nAround 2024, I began following skincare discussions on Reddit and social media. Seeing people’s progress motivated me to improve my own skin.\nBut enthusiasm quickly turned into overdoing things.\nI started buying almost every product people recommended, serums, creams, actives without fully understanding what suited my skin. I ended up with more products than I could realistically finish, and mixing things randomly actually irritated my skin instead of helping.\nI did consult a dermatologist and was given a basic routine, but I kept getting distracted by new recommendations instead of sticking to consistency.\nRecently, after learning more about skincare fundamentals and setting realistic expectations,\nI accepted a few important things:\nSkincare takes time and consistency matters more than product quantity.\nYears of sun exposure won’t reverse quickly.\nGenetics determine baseline skin tone, chasing fairness isn’t realistic.\nHealthy, comfortable skin should be the goal, not lighter skin.\nThat realization simplified things for me mentally.\nNow I follow a minimal routine: cleansing, moisturizing, sunscreen, and patience. No product hoarding, no rushing, just steady care. Honestly, this approach feels much better both physically and mentally.\nStill learning and open to advice, I’d genuinely appreciate constructive feedback or shared experiences.\n\nAlso, these are the products I currently have not including the ones already in use or the ones I’ve finished.\n\nTL;DR\nIgnored skincare for years → sun damage → product overload → irritated skin → reality check. Now keeping it simple and focusing on healthy skin, not fairness.",

Sometimes I will add Coconut oil, but I always use Cantu curling cream and the leave in conditioner.\n\nI just let my hair air dry after squeezing out the excess water and towel drying.

It’s very cheap and gives you so much more control than regular spray bottles. I’ve found that my hair absorbs products better and maximizes volume more on damp hair rather than soaking wet hair, which is how I used to apply my products.\n\nI also ordered microfiber towels from Amazon and stopped using regular shower towels. Lately I’ve been dealing with a lot of frizz. Normally I don’t mind frizz at all and think it adds character, but it’s been excessive, so I’ve been finger coiling more and it definitely helps tame everything better.\n\nOverall, this routine has made a noticeable difference in how my curls look and feel, especially with volume and frizz control. I’m still tweaking things, but I’ve been really happy with the results so far and wanted to share in case it helps anyone else.",

      "content": "Hi, I need advice and help!\n\nI've been struggling with acne for a few looong months now (I've never had acne like this before) and I can't help myself anymore...\n\nIt started with slightly red pimples appearing on my face - that's when I went to a beautician for the first time with the idea of ​​recommending cosmetics - she recommended a set from skin1004, so I bought it with the idea that it would help me, but the opposite was true and these cosmetics completely ruined my skin barrier...\n\nlater I took matters into my own hands, started researching and so I bought LRP - effaclar, later toleriane (which I've been using so far, but it doesn't seem to be doing me that well, I don't know...)\n\nand then baume b5 (it helped me with inflamed areas, repaired my barrier, but at the same time it clogged my pores, so comedones formed).\n\nI also tried cosmetics from Avené (it was horrible), then Purito cream (also completely wrong...)\n\nMy acne, inflammation and comedones were getting worse. At that moment I found the LRP Baume b5 (which I mentioned before) and after this time (closed comedones) I made an appointment with a qualified cosmetologist for an examination. The cosmetics she recommended were great at first, but after a month the barrier repair cream started to close my comedones (again😔) and every time I put on the cream (a pea-sized amount) I felt like I had a thick mask on my face.\n\nand now? my face is still back at the beginning of this whole journey - closed comedones, red spots and acne... I don't know what to do next and what's wrong.\n\nIn the last days, I do research and lot of people (influencers) recommend - neutrogena hydro boost water gel - This is such a terrible cream - it made me even worse than before...\n\nI hope I have described my situation at least a little bit clearly… 🥹\n\nI am already desperate that everything that seemed good will soon do the complete opposite… everything what is ,,non-comedogenic” is for me like hell…\n\nthe only thing I noticed is that in the past I used more natural brands (and they don't hurt me at all - they suited me) although when a pimple appeared - they didn't do anything to it, but they didn't hurt either…\n\nwhat brand of cosmetics would you recommend? I have oily, but now also dry skin in some places, sensitive…\n\nwhen I was looking at the brands, I really liked medik8 cosmetics, do you have any experience with it?? It seemed it can be better than LRP\n\nThank you to everyone who read this far! I appreciate every single comment!🌸✨",

Now you’ve taken it to a whole new level.\n\nI’m curious who thought it was a good idea to utilize a 6-month-old baby in an ad called “slow hair growth” and showcase that same baby at 17 months with beautiful hair as though the baby’s hair actually flourished because of your oil?\n\nChildren grow. Their hair grows. It’s called science. You didn’t invent evolution.\n\nLet’s talk about your lack of common sense - you aren’t even a brand that specializes in children. What was the reason you used an infant in an advertisement, in order to have parents feel that their child is growing at an unacceptable rate?\n\nThis isn’t marketing, it’s desperation and to do so using an innocent infant.\n\nShould you, instead of using infants to gain emotional sympathy, focus your time on developing a solid product for adults? You already have a damaged reputation.\n\nSome brands really will stoop to any level to sell.",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",
