Usually can only get away with doing this on the ends of the longer parts of my hair, as if I try on the sides it just weighs it down and makes it look all mushy.\n\nFollowing this, begin hover diffusing on low heat to hopefully make a cast. As well as gently cupping the roots with diffuser to make some lift. Then afterwards, begin hanging head upside down and swaying slowly to work with all different sides while cupping on medium heat.\n\nEither dry completely or leave semi dry to air dry the rest.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Or even just the kind of Dewey look. Mine goes straight up oily looking every time. It’s NEVER matte, not right when it goes on, not a few minutes or an hour later.\n\nIn these pictures, I have on Covergirl’s Clean Matte BB Cream, and sprayed NYX Matte Setting Spray. Like… these products HAVE to do SOMETHING, right? I feel like I’m missing something because they have great reviews, but they do absolutely nothing for me. Heeeeelp. Or recommend powders that don’t look powdery, I guess. I’d rather a sunscreen, lotion, or light coverage of something.\n\nThank you. 🩷",

One side is looser somehow and there is a weird lump in the start of my braid on the other side. Bun? It pulls my hair right on the top of my head so my hairline gets screwed up in the top front. Ponytail? Baby still finds it and pulls it, or it just falls out. I feel like I can't win. I practice and practice, and can't do any style to keep it out of the way that actually stays, looks good and doesn't rip my hair out. And don't even get me started on how much fell out thanks to postpartum hair loss. I feel like I only like it freshly washed and down, but that isn't really feasible with a baby. I just wish I could actually do my hair! I also don't even know if cutting it would help, because when it is shoulder length, I hate the weird flip it does. Guess I just needed to vent. Lol",

      "title": "Curly Hair Questions",
      "content": "Context: I’ve always kept my hair short as long as I’ve been alive. Longest I’ve had it was enough for a regular comb-over, however some friends encouraged me to grow my hair out so I decided to try it. I got a buzz cut in March of 2025 and since then I’ve been growing it out, and it turns out I have curly hair. I never knew this so all of this is new to me and I don’t really know what to do with it and I’ve got a lot of questions that have arose in my mind since I found out my hair is curly. So I’m hoping I can get some clarification from people who have more experience with this than myself. \n\n1. How often should I be shampooing and/or should I  be shampooing routinely? I’ve asked people and everyone has a  different answer. Some of the people I asked said they don’t really shampoo unless they’ve been using a lot of product and they feel the buildup or if they’ve sweat a lot and their hair feels dirty, while others say they shampoo once or twice a week. I also read the post in this subreddit saying it differs for everyone, but how do I figure out what is the correct shampoo schedule for me based on my hair? What signs should I look for and how do I know if the shampoo is damaging my hair? \n\n 2. How do you guys deal with cold weather? I live in a place that drastically experiences the 4 seasons. And now we’re in winter and I get cold. For a while I was just toughing it out and not covering my head or ears at all however I got sick and I’m not about to di that again, so I’ve started wearing a hood however if it’s on for more than 5 seconds my hair is ruined (it becomes very flat as if I have straight hair then water makes it curl back up again) so I just wear the hood all day at uni until I get home. Is there some substitute to this or do I have to choose between having nice hair and being warm? \n\n3. Should I be using product in my hair and if so what product should I be using? My current routine is shampoo once a week using the Function of Beauty curly hair shampoo that someone got me, and I’m conditioning every other day using ORIBE intense conditioner for moisture and control. For the most part that’s my hair care routine then when I want to go out and wet my hair and scrunch dry it and it usually looks pretty good imo. Someone recommended to me that I get the As I Am leave in conditioner which I bought however I only really use leave in conditioner like once a month I’ve I’m feeling special and I use moose (Functions of Beauty wavy hair zero gravity styling moose) even less than that. Most curly hair people I talk to seem like they’re using much more product or using it far more often than myself. So am I doing something wrong? I’ve also noticed that why I use leave in conditioner my curls are looser than when I just use water and scrunch my hair, is this expected or am I doing something wrong?\n\n4. Is there any other secrets I should know? Since I never actually knew I had curly hair I feel like maybe I missed the learning curve so I’m curious what are some tips or tricks that I could benefit from that I might not know since I’m new to all this?\n\nI think those are my main questions/concerns for now I apologize the long message and I would really appreciate any advice you guys have. I’m a guy btw incase that makes a difference. ",
