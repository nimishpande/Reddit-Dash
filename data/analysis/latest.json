      "content": "After 20 years of straightening (I was so insecure about my hair due to sexist and racist comments my ex's mom made constantly, actually), I chopped my hair off in September 2024! That's where the pictures begin. After struggling to get a good hair cut, I finally found my curly cut girl in a friend who had just finished an intensive course on curly hair (pic 8).\n\nBy convincing me to go back to short, she saved me and I have felt gorgeous and cool af since. I'm growing it out now, I want a short bob as shown in pic 5 (you can't tell the back was a hot mess) just because I think it really highlights the beautiful silver of my hair and shows off I have ridic telephone cord curls. Honestly, I know I'll cut it short again, probably before it gets long enough to call a bob lol!\n\nIt took too long, but I am so glad I finally got fed up with trying to mimic white beauty standards when I'm a proud Puerto Rican. I feel like me 100% and I see a beautiful, whole person who owns herself when I look in the mirror. I look like my mom again and that is so comforting. I feel sexy and I must be because I get beau coups of attention now, when before my unnatural hair just didn't suit me (I see that now). I am so happy.\n\nMy mom always tells me to not get so emotional over my hair, but it's been a source of pain my whole life. I have been harassed, touched against my will, had my hair yanked, had many people make racist comments, the list goes on. I am reclaiming my beauty now. No one can tell me anything other than \"you have beautiful curls!\" and \"your silver is amazing!!\" or I'll Miss Piggy karate chop them—hiiiiii-yah!!!!! I am so proud of myself for removing what was a huge thorn in my side.\n\nRoutine: I use the tgin rosewater collection. Shampoo, conditioner, leave-in mixed with a little castor oil, then hair lotion. I twist then scrunch, then let air dry and scrunch/fluff it again for body.",

Because of chronic headaches, I must comb my hair for relief at least once every 2 days.\n\n• Drying Method: Mostly air dry, but I use the Revlon One-Step Volumizer brush to manage the frizz and texture.\n\n• Sleep Protection: I sleep in a loose bun or a loose braid.\n\n• Refresh: I do not have a refresh routine.\n\nThe Issue:\n\nI know my hair is curly, but it never clumps into defined ringlets. It stays in this \"cloud\" or \"frizzy\" state regardless of the masks I use. I am considering adding the Kerastase Overnight Serum to help. Any advice on how to get my curls to actually stick together?",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I'm in need of some advice or product recommendations; primarily conditioner and 1-2 styling products. For the last 3 years I have been on an exhausting journey to find truly fragrance free products that make my curls look, at the very least, decent-ish. I have very fine hair that is prone to frizz and without products with a lot of slip, my hair looks like an absolute mess. For a long time I was using Innersense I Create Volume and it gave me the most gorgeous, smooth, shiny, well-defined curls of my life. Sadly, due to contact allergies I had to stop using it. I have tried so many products and have switched back and forth because the reviews were so positive, but my experience with them was very much lacking.\n\n  \nCurrently, I don't have a very set routine as I have been cycling in and out of products, but this is what I am currently using:\n\n1. Shampoo 1x a week (more or less as needed) with SEEN shampoo.\n\n2. Condition daily with Ouidad Unbreakable Bonds Fragrance-Free conditioner (pretty sure I'm allergic to this and will be removing it from my routine)\n\n3. Apply SEEN Curly Cream and Color WOW Dream Coat for Curly Hair. \n\n4. Scrunch out excess water and plop in hair towel before air drying. \n\n  \nThis routine is kind of meh and only about 50% of the overall satisfaction I'm looking for, but its the best I've come up with so far. As far as other products I've used, its as follows:\n\n  \n\\* VaniCream/Free &amp; Clear Shampoo and Conditioner -- Shampoo completely stripped my hair and I had to use an enormous amount of the conditioner to keep my hair soft.\n\n\\*VaniCream/Free &amp; Clear Styling Gel -- Way too heavy even in small amounts. Left my hair limp and crunchy even after scrunching all day. \n\n\\* Innersense Clarity Shampoo and Conditioner -- Worked really well but ended up being allergic to it. \n\n\\* LOVE UR CURLS 3-in-1 Styling product -- Too sticky and left my hair frizzy and limp. \n\n\\* Curlsmith Fragrance Free Conditioner -- Definitely NOT fragrance free. Contained allergens. \n\n\\* SEEN Conditioner -- Again, had to use a bunch of it to achieve a desirable effect. \n\n\\* SEEN Hair Serum -- Even one drop mixed in with other products left my hair greasy. \n\n\\* Color WOW Dream Coat -- Truly fragrance free and helped with frizz, but it left my hair a bit shapeless on its own. \n\n\n\nWhat I have recently tried but have yet to fully incorporate into my routine:\n\n\\* The Ordinary Behentrimonium Chloride 2% Conditioner -- Read a lot of revies about how it was very high slip and made curls look great. However, my experience has been that it is NOT high slip and didn't leave my hair very soft. \n\n\\*FRAGFRE Styling Gel -- Read that it was a very strong hold and to water it down. Tried it straight and cut with other products. Either way the application of it left my hair limp and very... poofy? \n\n\n\nPlease help. ",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

My Innisfree serum is almost empty, and I’m wondering what to try next. I’d like to move up to a slightly stronger retinol now that my skin has gotten somewhat used to it. I’ve started noticing some lines on my forehead becoming more visible (probably genetics), but I’d like to see if I can improve them.\n\nIf anyone has input on the rest of my routine, that would also be really helpful.

I have seen Torriden Dive In smoothing cream , Celinax Dual Barrier Cream or Avene mentioned on here a lot.\n\nIs one better than the other? Should I look into a different moisturizer? Is a moisturizer a good idea to layer over the other two products or should I use a different method?\n\nI’m afraid of breaking out again or the bumps coming back.\n\nAny feedback using either or recommendations for moisturizer for barrier damaged skin?\n\nI appreciate the feedback!",

Light subcision, picosure + halo laser for hyperpigmentation, erbium profrac for scars, and skincare. $5500 for two treatments.\n\n2) Ms. C. Wants to put me on skincare to treat discoloration and deep congestion (mostly retinol + hydroquinone) then, 6 weeks later, do a VI peel. Then, spot treat scars with non-ablative laser. Unsure on price.\n\n3) Ms. L. She says if I do laser now with my currently congested skin (blackheads), I'll break out like crazy. Wants to do 3 months of extractions every 11 days with a salicylic acid wash applied each time. This could be covered by insurance. Then, we'll spot treat scars with a non-ablative laser, 2-5 times. Could be anywhere from $1,500 to lots more with more laser sessions.\n\nWho would you choose?",
