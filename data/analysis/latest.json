This is the same routine I’ve been doing for a couple of years, but now it turns out terrible.\n\nMy curls won’t clump they’re super stringy and frizzy when wet. When it dries it’s even frizzer, mainly in the back and on top of my head and it’s incredibly crunchy. Scrunching out the crunch with hair oil just seems to make it frizzier. \n\nDoes anyone have any product or styling suggestions? Is it the water or the change in humidity?

The Japanese FDA determined that the starting dose of dutasteride for treating androgenetic alopecia should be 0.1 mg and that, if necessary, doctors can titrate up to 0.5 mg.\n\nhttps://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(13)01171-7/abstract\n\nOne study used as the summary basis of approval for low dose dut in Japan suggests that one may expect slightly better hair growth with 0.1 mg oral dutasteride compared with 1 mg or even 5 mg oral finasteride; Harcha et al. randomized 917 men with androgenetic alopecia to dutasteride 0.02 mg, 0.1 mg, or 0.5 mg daily, finasteride 1 mg daily, or placebo for 24 weeks. They found dutasteride worked in a dose dependent way, and the 0.1 mg dose produced higher hair counts and thicker hairs than placebo, with results that generally trended better than finasteride 1 mg, even though the clearest and most statistically robust superiority over finasteride showed up with 0.5 mg.\n\nIt may be that this lower oral dose of dutasteride is intended for someone who wants to further reduce scalp DHT but doesn’t want to fully commit to the 0.5 mg dose, or for someone who doesn’t tolerate 0.5 mg well and still wants to use the drug to some capacity.",

      "title": "Low Porosity Hair Not Being Styled With Soaking Wet Hair Or A BounceCurl Brush, any ideas or tips?",
      "content": "\nHOW TO KEEP THE FOOF BUT ALSO HAVE SOME DEFINITION, I AM DYING OVER HERE. I don't want to use the BounceCurl method for forever. Maybe special occasions. It's long, tedious and I just want a quick routine for during the week.\n\nI hate that unless I do my usual routine to an exact T, I look wavy at best.\n\nListen, I don't know who to go to in regards to this. I am very self conscious about my curls. Honestly, I found a routine and pairing with the bounce curl brush that makes it look \"good\" mostly but I am constantly fluffing it. I find the bounce curl brush leaves me with a lack of volume. (I have tried both brushes) My hair is thin and low porosity. The bounce curl defines my curls but just lacks the volume I want. Even after separating they always go back to that form and ends up looking flat. If I have the proper volume my hair doesn't look as thin. When I brush out my hair it goes full poodle. I want like a semi controlled poodle look but also something that has a little definition. \n\nAnyways, I saw a routine that said Low Porosity hair needs to be more on the damp side in order for our curl type to soak in the products. Otherwise the hair is to full of water to soak up everything you use. My brain immediately was like oh this checks out maybe. So this morning I decided to try it. (Now I did not was my hair, just rewet it, I have strands on the back of my neck that straighten out quickly as they are more wavy, so by day 2-3 it looks ridiculous next to my curls) I squeezed out excess water. Got dressed. Came back. \n\nPer video instructions I did:\n\nApply leave in conditioner on damp hair (I used curlsmith light leave in cream)\n\nBrush through with a regular brush\n\nApply gel (I used innersense gel)\n\nFlip head over, comb hair with fingers longways going down the hair shaft, hold the bottom of your hair and \"wobble\" (aka shake) as she says, once completed take your fingers side ways through your hair then \"wobble\" at the ends (I don't think I wobbled enough idk)\n\nOnce done it said brush again once more with head flipped over (said with a wide tooth this time but I can't find mine) \n\nThen apply the oil to help seal in the moisture which makes sense to my brain\n\nThen diffuse (with the styling on damp hair, it made the process much quicker to diffuse at least)\n\nUsually I use a mousse then put gel on last but I decided to follow instructions. I think I failed at the wobble wobble part? Idk. But I'm going to throw in a picture on what my hair looks like during my weekly weekend wash vs what it looked like today lol. 🥲\n\nDoesn't help that my husband was like you look good, and I was like really? Sarcastically of course. To insinuate that my hair obviously looks different than what he is used to and he played dumb like he had no clue what I was talking about until I said something and then he was like it doesn't look bad. As if that's a compliment 🥀 I am very much self conscious about my hair on a day to day. If my hair doesn't look how I want it to look then I generally don't have the best days because I will keep trying to fix it throughout the day.\n\nAnyways. Any thoughts behind the theory? Anyway I can keep the foof without loosing my definition?\n Obviously this way was way easier on all sides of the spectrum, no sectioning, no bounce curl, just gel and raking through. Even drying was nicer because it didn't take as much time.  I would like to just mix these two pictures together somehow lol. Would adding the mousse before gel help potentially? \n\nFirst picture is of today's routine\n\nSecond picture is my usual weekly wash and style. Help",

I knew of one girl who got her curly hair cut by her and it was really pretty so ! felt comfortable asking her.\n\nI didn't exactly expect the best haircut but what I got was really not what we talked about.\n\nThe first three pictures are the haircut I got last March and even then I thought it was super short but I ended up really liking it. Then the next two pics I took after coming home from getting my haircut. It's so fucking short and choppy and I don't know much about curly haircuts or haircuts in general but I really don't think the layers are blended and the bottom section has much less hair compared the rest. The last three pics are after I finished styling them. It does look way more curlier which is what I wanted but I did not want it this short. She has curly hair and has dealt with curly hair so she knows it shrinks up, we even discussed the longest layer and it shrunk up beyond that, even when she cut it dry it was past the point we agreed on. It was obviously too late to say anything so I just let it be and came to terms with it.\n\nI'm so used to having long hair and this is the shortest I've ever gotten. I don't really think it's hit me completely, I'm trying to tell myself it looks good and it's a good change but I feel like it makes my long and big face pop out more than I want it to, and it makes me look so much bigger. I feel like the haircut looks more like a bob than layers. I can't even put it up in my bonnet how I usually do.\n\nI don't plan on going back to her or asking her to fix it because that would just mean going shorter.  She suggested doing different hairstyles but I think it’s too short for that, plus, my back is way more exposed than I’d like so likely no. I don't really know what type of help I'm asking for. Usually my hair grows a bit fast but I go back to school tomorrow and I'm really dreading it. This is so different from what I'm used to and I find it hard to see me getting used to it. I really hope she doesn't have Reddit or is active on this subreddit be that would be really embarrassing.\n\nRoutine: (apply products all together then section and brush style)\n\nNYM curl talk bond shampoo\n\nV&amp;Co curly hair conditioner\n\nRizos curls refresh and detangle spray\n\nNYM curl cream\n\nMarc Anthony strictly curls curl enhancing styling foam\n\nPineapple method then bonnet\n\nNo refresh routine",

It was not lifted enough, very hot roots with yellow/brassy ends.\n\nI wanted to just have her cover it with an even darkish ashy brown. Goal color picture I sent her is the final one attached to this post. She used only toner on the balayage, even after I asked that she used permanent dye instead because my hair doesn’t take toner well. I’ve only washed it once, and the orange/brass is back with new greenish tones.\n\nHow would you recommend I cover this? I’m going to do it myself. I am tempted to just get a 6N permanent dye or something similar, but I don’t want to make it more green or too dark. Or damage it. I am familiar enough with mixing my own color from Sally’s, but really want some guidance on colors and if filler colors are needed for this!\n\nPlease help :( I’m so tired of brassy hair.",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I'm looking for some insight before my dermatologist appointment tomorrow. The Backstory: About 2 years ago, I \"nuked\" my skin. I was stupidly using a high-strength AHA/BHA 25% peel and Retinoids at the same time. I'm certain I broke my skin barrier because I developed insane cystic acne immediately after. Current Situation: The \"Hard\" Acne: I have deep, cystic-like lumps that have been present for 2 years. They have become hard to the touch and haven't budged or come to a head.\n\nNew Breakouts: I'm still getting new acne in the same areas. Texture/Scars: I have significant PIH (dark marks), PIE (red marks), and what looks like ice-pick scarring. Current Routine: For the last 2 years, I've stopped all actives. I only use Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. Spf sunscreen. Location: I'm currently in Delhi and using tap water to wash my face. I suspect the hard water/chlorine might be making things worse.",

My face was itching and irritated, and I almost threw the bottles in the trash. But I decided to stick with it.\n\nNow, 25+ days in, the irritation is totally gone.

I knew of one girl who got her curly hair cut by her and it was really pretty so I felt comfortable asking her.\n\nI didn’t exactly expect the best haircut but what I got was really not what we talked about. \n\nThe first three pictures are the haircut I got last March and even then I thought it was super short but I ended up really liking it. Then the next two pics I took after coming home from getting my haircut. It’s so fucking short and choppy and I don’t know much about curly haircuts or haircuts in general but I really don’t think the layers are blended and the bottom section has much less hair compared the rest. The last three pics are after I finished styling them. It does look way more curlier which is what I wanted but I did not want it this short. She has curly hair and has dealt with curly hair so she knows it shrinks up, we even discussed the longest layer and it shrunk up beyond that, even when she cut it dry it was past the point we agreed on. It was obviously too late to say anything so I just let it be and came to terms with it.\n\nI’m so used to having long hair and this is the shortest I’ve ever gotten. I don’t really think it’s hit me completely, I’m trying to tell myself it looks good and it’s a good change but I feel like it makes my long and big face pop out more than I want it to, and it makes me look so much bigger. I feel like the haircut looks more like a bob than layers. I can’t even put it up in my bonnet how I usually do.\n\nI don’t plan on going back to her or asking her to fix it because that would just mean going shorter. I don’t really know what type of help I’m asking for. Usually my hair grows a bit fast but I go back to school tomorrow and I’m really dreading it. This is so different from what I’m used to and I find it hard to see me getting used to it. I really hope she doesn’t have Reddit or is active on this subreddit bc that would be really embarrassing.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I have cut them before (October 2025) and occasional snips just to clean them up. They are much shorter than the rest of my hair and I can’t cut them fully off yet. I let my hair air dry, and the rest of my hair is shinny and healthy. For reference I accidentally pulled a comb through this part of my hair when wet about a year ago and ripped the hair out. Yes I know, horrible.  It doesn’t bother me that much and I can work around it and it’s really not noticeable. I use good conditioner, leave in conditioner, hair oil, I’ve even tried K18, but I just don’t feel like I have the answer. \n\nAny advice? Again, I can’t cut it right now, it’s already too short at the front of my head- I cut it myself and tried to get as much of the original dead stuff off. I cut my hair from about my belly button to about 2in below my collar bone.",

      "content": "Hey all,  \nI'm currently recovering my skin barrier from overexfoliation with the CeraVe SA cleanser. It's been about 5 weeks now since I've stopped any actives whatsoever and have focused on only four products:  \n  \nAM: wash face with water -&gt; CeraVe Hydrating Moisturizer -&gt; Eucerine Oil Control Dry Touch SPF 50+ (tinted)  \nPM: CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser -&gt; CeraVe PM niacinamide cream\n\nSo far in those 5 weeks the skin has been doing way better than it did during the SA purge. My breakouts are diminishing and the pimples that are coming up now are mostly surface level and they disappear quickly, about 1-2 days for them to drain and flatten. \n\nHowever, my face experiences constant sensory activity in the areas where I had the most inflammation - cheeks, folds of nose, temples and forehead. It doesn't matter whether it's day or night, pre skin care routine or after, I have some tingling feeling, phantom itches in spots where nothing is happening, sometimes slight burning, though it's not as hot, just the sensation resembles burning. Upon reading up online it seems these are normal symptoms of a recovering skin barrier, however I am wondering how long these persist and I'm a bit afraid they will transition into inflammation again. \n\nThe skin doesn't seem to be flaky or dry, quite the opposite, it looks nourished and upon touching it, it seems soft and supple. Perhaps this is also the reason why the breakouts are going away so quickly...\n\nHas anyone also experienced this?\n\nI used SA for 9 weeks daily, then tapered down to 3x a week for another 6-7 weeks and discontinued it completely 5 weeks ago.",

It helped clear acne, controlled sebum, gave my skin a healthy glow, and most importantly, it never dried my skin out. I was using it along with a few other Minimalist products, and my skin was honestly in great condition.\n\nI eventually got lazy and stopped doing skincare for a while. A few days ago, I decided to restart my routine and went back to this cleanser since it used to be my go to product.\n\nBut now it feels completely different. It is drying out my skin much more than before and just does not feel the same overall. My skin feels tight and slightly irritated, which never happened with the older version.\n\nSince Minimalist was acquired by Unilever, I am wondering if the formulation has been changed.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this cleanser feeling more drying or different recently?",

I’ve tried everything, even cut 14 inches off. Even when rain hits it or when I work out, like I’ve cried about this on many times. It looks great, just the smell just won’t go away.\n\nToday, I tried to do a root touch-up and used Vaseline on the old straight parts to protect them. Now my hair is a disgusting, stuck-together, greasy mess that won't wash out, and the sulfur smell is still there. I did a hair mask, clarifying shampoo, and apple cider vinegar wash. Safe to say I’m never doing an at home treatment ever again.\n\nI’m going to be in Chicago in a few days and I’m going to go to a professional because I can't do this anymore.\n\n1.

It helped clear acne, controlled sebum, gave my skin a healthy glow, and most importantly, it never dried my skin out. I was using it along with a few other Minimalist products, and my skin was honestly in great condition.\n\nI eventually got lazy and stopped doing skincare for a while. A few days ago, I decided to restart my routine and went back to this cleanser since it used to be my go to product.\n\nBut now it feels completely different. It is drying out my skin much more than before and just does not feel the same overall. My skin feels tight and slightly irritated, which never happened with the older version.\n\nSince Minimalist was acquired by Unilever, I am wondering if the formulation has been changed.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this cleanser feeling more drying or different recently?",
