      "content": "I fell in love with the Bounce Curl Brush when I purchased it for the almost perfect ringlets it gave me. But over the maybe 3yrs I've been using it, my hair has not grown an inch.\n\nI don't like the hair typing system, but just for reference:\nI have around 3c-4a hair.\nMedium density\nMedium porosity\nMedium strand thickness, although I've found some thicker strands &amp; some thin strands of hair in my head.\nMy hair is all Virgin, no dye or bleach. (Pictures I post with hair color is hair wax, which is an product overlay, not a dye)\n\nWhen I use the brush, I make sure my hair is FULLY DETANGLED with a wide tooth comb &amp; Tangle Teaser before styling with it. I'm positive it's not user error that there's lots of hair stuck on the brush &amp; that my ends are splitting. I find myself having to trim more often than most because my hair starts feeling rough.\n\nI only straighten my hair approximately 1-2xs a year in the Winter because I live in the South. I straightened my hair for my birthday in January &amp; decided since it was straightened, it would be easier to see any damage. I used the search &amp; destroy method to go through as many sections of hair as possible &amp; snip off damage. The amount of single strand knots, split ends, breakage &amp; even keyhole splits I had in my hair was insane.\n\nKeyhole splits in particular, I read, are mostly caused by mechanical damage, i.e. brush styling, high tension, pulling &amp; playing in your hair too much, etc. I'm almost certain most of this damage &amp; the breakage is coming from the Bounce Curl Brush &amp; I'm going to stop using it to see if this is the cause of the breakage. \n\nRoutine &amp; Products:\n\n1) Pre-wash detangle using a wide tooth comb on damp hair &amp; a light leave-in conditioner to provide slip.\n2) Shampoo with Tresemmé Rich Moisture. Clarify 1x a month or as needed with Paul Mitchell's Shampoo 2.\n3) Condition with the Tresemmé Rich Moisture &amp; on Clarify Shampoo days, I use Ouidad's Coil Infusion Triple Threat Deep Conditioner. \n3) On wet hair, I apply Camille Rose's Curl Love Moisture Milk as a leave-in in sections using my fingers.\n3) I section my hair and apply Camille Rose's Spiked Honey Mousse with my fingers. Then I take smaller sections that I want to style, make sure it's fully detangled with a pass through with a Tangle Teaser, then do one pass with the Bounce Curl Brush, using the tension &amp; tilt the brush into the divots as it's supposed to be used.\n4) I scrunch in a little bit of the Ouidad Curl Quencher Gel on styled sections (I didn't care for this too much but I'm trying to get rid of it lol).\n5) Hover-Diffuse blow dry my hair for about 20-30mins. Let the rest air dry.\n6) Scrunch out the crunch &amp; separate curl clumps with Mise En Scene Perfect Serum.\n\nFor bed, I pineapple with a scarf &amp; put on a bonnet.\nIn the mornings, I let my hair get some steam in the shower, take off the bonnet, shake, use a little serum, finger coil a few wonky strands if needed. I wash 1x a week.\n\nTL;DR: I feel like the Bounce Curl Brush's high tension styling causes breakage &amp; other forms of mechanical damage.\n\nWanted to know if anyone else felt the same way!",

      "content": "*Sorry for the long text and all the pictures. It’s my first time on this sub, so I hope it’s okay here. (Please bear with me, English is my second language🙏🏻.)*\n\n**Quick summary :**\n\nBasically, I would love to achieve a slightly longer hairstyle and be able to retain volume without losing coverage on my forehead. As explained below, I struggle with my texture, so any suggestion/advice/opinion would help (haircut, products, knowledge...) I feel like my hair is a weakness, and I want to change that 😉\n-----\n\nSo, I cut and style hair for friends and family all the time, but I never figured out my own 😅. Every time I come close, the texture changes…\n\nFor most of my life, I had wavy hair. But the older I get, the curlier it becomes, and recently the change has been particularly noticeable. I’m actually excited about it — I love textured hair — but I’m completely lost right now.\n\n**About my hair:**\n\n• I think I have low density, coarse hair\n\n• I have a large, square forehead, which makes it hard to get a full-looking fringe. \n\n• My front section grows in the opposite direction -- *when I get a buzz cut there's a clear V-shape above my hairline where the hair changes direction*\n\nBecause of this, my hair naturally wants to stand up on top of my head, and I have to get it wet every morning to lay it back down. \n\nAs a teenager, when my hair was straighter, I would wake up looking like Syndrome from The Incredibles (included last picture just for fun😂).\n\nNow that it’s more curly, some days it’s giving Bob Dylan, some days Edward Scissorhands… and very rarely, it’ll look acceptable and I won’t touch it (picture 1 and 2 was one of those days.) *Still very messy, and the fringe is looking boneless 😬.*\n\n**Routine/Styling:**\n\nI’ve been meaning to grow my hair out a little — I think it would balance out my strong bone structure in a nice way — but every time it gets longer, I struggle. So for now, I just keep it short and style it like when it was straighter.\n\n• I wash it about 3 times a week\n\n• I use a mask. *currently, no conditioner*\n\n• When it’s wet, I lay it down and arrange it so it air dries nicely. For hold I either use matte paste when wet, or iI'll use powder later when it's dry. *At this point, it looks very flat and thin (picture 3,4 and 5)*\n\n• Once it’s dry, I rearrange it — with or without powder on my fingers (separate the strands, lift up the roots, etc.) *I add hairspray on windy days.*\n\n*I have no specific sleeping routine and I just refresh with water without adding products.* (Styled hair on picture 6,7 and 8)\n\nIt works for now, but I don’t actually love this flat hairstyle on me — somedays I feel like a playmobile and honestly, styling my hair is the worst part of my mornings…\n\nIn the past, I did try defining the curls with leave-ins or gel (although it’s been over a year, so it might look different now with tighter curls?) and it would always look weighed down and boneless, with my scalp showing — even with the smallest amount of product. Maybe my hair is just too thin to be in clumps 🤷🏻‍♂️.\n\n**Product list :**\n\nShampoo - Pantene (volume line)\n\nMask - Garnier Fructis (currently, the banana superfood one)\n\nMatte paste - Taft (molding styling clay)\n\nStyling powder and hairspray - Taft (volume line)\n\n-----\n\nOkay, that was all the important details, I think.\n\nSo basically, my goal is to get a longer, more free/natural-looking hairstyle, that compliments my texture. I would like to retain volume without losing coverage on my forehead. And if it could be low maintenance too, at least in the morning, that would be life-changing 😩.\n\nThanks for reading!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

Either they are   \n  \nI) not moisturizing enough and leave skin raw/sensitive/burning  \nII) they are too heavy and cause breakouts  \nIII) Gel Moisturizer on Gel Cream leaves the skin wet/sticky/greasy for hours after applying. \n\n  \nMy general routine is Apply Taz at night before bed, and put a moisturizer almost immediately on top of it afterwards. Moisturizers I have used:\n\n**Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** \\- This is the kind of the holy grail for me in terms of moisturizing. Absolutely no redness/irritation/sensitivity after using this and it keeps the skin super moisturized. But the biggest issue here is this causes closed comedones / white heads / acne breakouts. I tried it twice a few months apart just to make sure, and it still results the same breakouts.\n\n**Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Soothing Gel** \\- This is the closest I have gotten to a moisturizer that somewhat keeps the redness away but this is a gel, and applying it on top of Taz Gel leaves my skin wet/greasy/sticky for hours. Currently working with this. Most effective after Illiyoon gel, very minor redness left to deal with but the greasiness is extremely hard to handle.\n\n**ETUDE SoonJung Hydro Barrier Cream** (Gel Cream Version) - This one kind of work, but same issue as the Illiyoon Gel, takes hours to dry and in my opinion is slightly less effective than the Illiyoon Gel.\n\n**ANUA Rice 70 Intensive Moisturizing Milk** \\- Used as a morning lotion to help reduce redness with less effective primary moisturizers. Quick to dry, and provides low moisture.\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors** \\- Can't remember since it was a while back but either it was not effective for me or caused breakouts\n\n**La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ Triple Repair Moisturizing Cream** \\- To be fair, I didn't give this too much time to test, the pump was so bad and broken I couldn't use it properly for long. Wasn't too effective for the day or three I tried it though.\n\n**PURITO Mighty Bamboo** \\- Left my skin burning, not sure if it was due to the ingredients or because it was ineffective at repairing the skin barrier\n\n**Vanicream** \\- This worked initially, but is ineffective with Taz, and leaves the skin burning since its not able to moisturize enough / repair the barrier enough.\n\n  \nI might have missed one or two more but those are the major ones I have tried. \n\nI am looking for a single moisturizer I can use with Taz 0.1% gel, that is probably a lighter weight cream or lotion I suppose so it doesn't leave my greasy for hours, and keeps the barrier solid and skin healthy and pain free. \n\nI know people suggest buffering the Moisturizer first or layering with additional products, but I find that a hassle. I find myself to be a lot more compliant/consistent with just the two products than if I have to use more. \n\nCurrent products I am considering but extremely open to recommendations outside these as well. Thank You in advance:\n\n1) Illiyoon Lotion (Some reports that lotion causes same problems as cream?)  \n2) ETude SoonJung Rich Cream or Light Weight Cream (non gel version, some reports that reformulation is irritating or causes similar issue as closed pores/comedones/white heads)  \n3) Aestrua ATOBARRIER365 Cream or Lotion (Twice as Expensive as most other options, so hesitant to make it the primary if it works but willing to go this route if no other options)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",
