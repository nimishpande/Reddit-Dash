This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

      "title": "How curls thought me to accept myself.♥️",
      "content": "Hi curly heads ♥️ I embraced my curls and started growing them out about a one and half year ago. I say \"embraced\" because I used to think I had just ugly hair that I had to straighten and it wasn't until I was 25, that I realize that it was just misunderstood, haha. After many years of straightening, it was difficult, not very pretty, and I was quite unhappy about it, but at the same time, I never felt more like myself. Those messy ringlets and occasional frizz defined me much more than my forcibly straightened, polished hair.So I started trying different techniques, products, etc. Trial and error. Not everything suits you, we all have different hair. Eventually, I found a technique and products that help me keep my curls in presentable condition so I don't look like Hagrid, and let's face it, there are days like that haha. Curls have a mind of their own, but I don't hold it against them, I've learned to accept them as they are, to accept myself. On good days and bad days. \n\nBelow, I share my routine and products. Hopefully, it will help some of you. And if you're just starting out or halfway through, don't give up—curls are a gift, they're fun, and they're like life. They twist in all directions, but once you understand them and learn to love them, they are absolutely beautiful♥️\n\n*Routine*🫶\n\nSince I have very dry hair, I apply a coconut oil mask the night before washing it. I massage it into the roots while watching series or something. It also promotes growth, which I think is mainly due to the massage! ♥️\n\n1. I use Giovanni shampoo 2x and conditioner—the line for damaged hair.\n\n2. Then I dry my hair with a cotton T-shirt, gently squeezing it but leaving it still quite damp.\n\n \n\n3. Now comes the fun part haha— \n\nFirst—Giovanni Leave-in Conditioner.\n\nAt this point, I comb my hair while leaning forward and at the end I give each strand a little \"wobble\" to make it wavy again, and then I continue with the products. \n\nSecond - Curl Keeper Original Liquid Styler (this is also great for refreshing and reducing frizz) \n\nThird - INNERSE Volumizing Foam at the roots \n\nFourth - Giovanni Styling Gel on the lengths.\n\n*TIP 1- Once every 2-3 months, when I feel that my hair is heavy, I wash it with Pretty Curly Hair Reset Shampoo. It helps remove all the products and makes my hair much lighter and airier. Just buy the smallest size, it will last.* 🙏\n\n5- Then comes the diffusing. I diffuse my hair while leaning forward from the roots and flip my hair from side to side to create volume. I do the ends last. At  the very end, clapping the curls to break up the gel. \n\nFinally, I add coconut oil again.\n\nThe whole process takes me about 35 to 40 minutes, including drying. I wash my hair once a week, usually in the morning on my first day off so that it stays nice haha. I usually refresh it after three or four days.\n\n*TIP 2- I think Length matters a lot—the third photo is about 7 months old, my hair is shorter here after a haircut, and you can see that the curls looked smoother and more defined. Since then, my hair has grown, and the curls are completely different—more airy, and because they are longer, they are heavier, so they are not as defined. It depends on what you like better. I've always wanted long hair, so I refuse cut it, but I thought it was worth mentioning.*😊♥️\n\nSleep\n\nI sleep with my hair in a high ponytail—a pineapple in a satin bonnet. The ponytail is very important; the bonnet alone is not enough. In the fourth  photo, I tried to show where it should be, really almost at the forehead. (A ponytail is enough for me, but if you have longer hair, I know that girls put it up in a loose bun.)\n\nThe point is that you don't lie on your curls and put pressure on them, so they don't flatten and get ruined. You'll look like Lord Farquaad at night, but in the morning you'll be princesses, haha.\n\nBecause of it the curls will stay nice for 3-4 days. Then I wear them in a high ponytail during the day, but they still look good, just less defined.\n\nOf course, I moisturize them every morning and add oil to damp hair throughout the week. \n\n*TIP 3- When I take off my bonnet and let my hair down, I gently separate each curl on both sides with my fingers. This aerates  hair and restores its volume. Then I dampen it and add Curl Keeper. After refreshing my hair like this, I no longer use gel, but instead use mousse to strengthen my curls while keeping them light.  I let it dry naturally.* \n\nIt may all seem complicated, but with practice, it takes me no longer than putting in my contact lenses. It's all about habit.\n\nSorry for the long text, but I wanted to write everything down, haha.\n\nI hope this helps someone. ♥️If you have any good products or tips, I'd love for you to share them too in comments♥️\n\nGood luck on your curly journey!♥️",

I shampoo with off brand head and shoulders every other time (I think this might be part of the issue, I know I need new shampoo. Recommendations would be helpful.) Then I use OGX coconut miracle oil conditioner every time. Usually use a little herbal essences mousse, then diffuse, then when It’s dry I oil it with jojoba. \n\nIn the past I never used mousse, &amp; was using shea moisture power green shampoo (seldomly) &amp; love beauty and planet conditioner but it has become too expensive for me.

I’m not a professional at hair care, but I’ve tried basic things before like coconut oil and similar treatments. Unfortunately, the dryness never really improves and every strand seems to have a mind of its own.  \n\n\nI currently use a curl-defining cream, and it does help a bit, my hair looks better compared to nothing ,but it’s still far from what I want. On top of that, most curl creams make my scalp itchy, which is super annoying.\n\nSo I’m looking for alternative solution\n\nI’m open to:  \nHair care routine  \nProduct recommendations  \nTreatments  \nSemi-permanent solutions\n\nIf there’s anything that can last 1–3 weeks, that would honestly be amazing. Even if not, I’m still very open to solid care advice and product suggestions.\n\nThe closer I can get my hair to the style/texture shown below(in the replies), the happier I’ll be.\n\nThanks in advance, I’d really appreciate hearing your experiences and suggestions \n\n",

I’m a brunette who was born with blond wavy hair, as I got older it got darker and more straight to the point its mostly straight at the roots and as it gets longer it gets more wavy; sometimes I even catch small loose ringlets. \n\nGrowing up and even now I struggle with varying levels of dandruff and itching, sometimes it would even get so bad as to have scabs building up on my scalp. I like my hair more dry, it gives it more volume as my hair is kinda thin, so I often wouldn’t use conditioner or I would do a second shampoo after conditioning. I’ve tried washing daily, that just made it worse, so I stuck to washing every 2-3 days. I also deal with MAJOR fallout, any time I brush my hair my hair brush has a handful of strands, when I shower and run my hand through it I’m pulling off so much hair. It’s not to a point I’m balding or anything but it really feels like a lot. \n\nMy main issue is that my hair looks greasy, and sticks together like I haven’t washed in DAYS just 24 hours after I wash, but it FEELS dry. I’ve swapped through many products but mainly stick with wavy hair care from Aussie because I genuinely like it. Is there any advice you can give to me? I really just want my waves to pop and my hair to not be flat and looking gross :( thank you. (Photo is a tiny bit old my hair is longer now, and it was looking how I like in this photo) ",

Even the \"for sensitive skin\" ones... \n\nAquaphor doesn't make me react, but it's practically Vaseline, I can't put it on my face everyday, it feels very gross... \n\nMy skin type isn't oily, I'd say it's pretty decent, maybe a tiny bit on the dry side in some places, like when I get out of the shower, the skin around my lips, nose, and brows flakes away. Also does it when I just wake up. \n\n\nI don't use soap on my face, just water, on rare occasions I'll use my unscented sensitive skin dove soap bar, and that makes me break out a bit ;-;\n\nI have a few wrinkles, smile lines, no significant acne (4-6 pimples when approaching my period, otherwise very clear) and I'm just looking for a routine to hydrate and keep my skin nice, soft and healthy.

      "title": "HELP!!! Is this conditioner worth it? My mom (&lt;3) saw it and brought it for me, havent used it yet. Im nervous because of all the mixed reviews, and its so expensive here...",
      "content": "For context, im not in the 4 range and at most I'm probably 3a. Maybe a 3b on some impossibly good day. But that rarely ever happens \n\n**BASIC INFO:**\n\nThe thin top layer of my hair is hard to maintain a good curl, and is probably the driest. The upper middle layer of my hair is pretty consistent with its curls and they look good when curled. The 3rd layer gets less curly (wavy at best) and the layer of my hair nearest to my nape is the smoothest, *silkest*, straight hair I've ever touched in my entire life. I was born with the silky hair, until my texture changed and turned super dry and frizzy (Hermione in the first movie, complete with the personality!) until my mom got sick of it and shaved it all off during the pandemic. When I grew it out, it looked *so* good with no styling (consistent, picture perfect 3b) and then it got longer and years went by. Now we are here. Bit disappointing, honestly :( but hey I still look cool. As for the environment, its either really hot and dry, or really cold and wet.  Either the sun or airconditioner/wind gets to me. Its also very humid here. \n\n**MY HOPEFULLY PASSABLE ROUTINE:**\n\nIve been using drugstore shampoo latley (head n shoulders) but most of the time I use Eversoft shampoo and conditioner. Its great for everyone's hair and I like it. However, its been months since I've used that conditioner since we ran out and we only ever restock when my relatives from Singapore (its quite the staple brand there) ship us some. Right now, Im only using their shampoo, and I switch to head n shoulders if I really want a deep clean. (is that healthy?) \n\nSo Ive been using the Creamsilk line, which is the norm in The Phillipines. I mostly use Hairfall Defense, not because I have any hairfall, I just use it. I also switch to Ultimate Reborn when we ran out of that, and nothing seems to be wrong. It is to be noted that its not really marketed for curly hair, and its like the basis of what I think \"okay\" is. If anything underperforms it will be considered horrible, and anything that outperforms it will be considered  good to me. \n\n**STYLING:**\n\nAs for styling, I've given up on finger curling (for now) in the shower. Im probably just really bad at sectioning, but whenever I do it lately the frizz gets worse, and it barley looks like a curl. One \"curl\" gives up halfway through and the roots just look matted/like Ive never touched them. (it was never like this. I haven't changed my finger curl method, this always used to work.) \n\nSo whenever I finger curl, I do it out of the shower with curling cream. They end up looking like really thick coils. (think Shirley Temple, but not as neat and not meticulously parted.) Only on super special occasions.\n\nNow, I do regular detangling and scrunch my hair in the shower, and just scrunch cream into it. Its got some curl to it which is consistent and will last the whole day if I do it good. I put it in a square headband (glasses with no glasses, essentially) which makes me look like a puppy dog with ears. \n\nBut most of the week I just put it in a high ponytail to go to school, no nothing. (either desert hot/cold rainy-windy outside or aircon inside ) Its def giving me gradual traction alopecia, so I try to put my hair out of its misery by pushing it all back with a headband at home. My headband doesn't hurt me, and my hair is thick enough to use a headband AS a hairtie if I push it down my neck, so its not squeezing my head. \n\nIve also got a diffuser. I use it with no heat but if I'm rushing I use the full power without the special curl cup shape (mine is detachable and can be swapped for normal shapes) straight into my roots.  \n",
