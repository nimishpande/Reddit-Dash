I've been depressed and su***dal for almost 4-5 years, never ever thought of socializing but I've started working (new corporate majdoor) I want to fix myself, fix my looks and fix my confidence.\n\nSo, I'll appreciate if anyone can help me 🥲.\n\nI've always been insecure about my looks, idk if I should shave my beard look because personally I don't like keeping up a beard (Unc look). Also, my hairline is receding,for which I'm thinking to start min fin from next month.\n\nSorry mods Ik the post is not just related to skincare but also other issues, but I just want a lil help from anyone here.\n\nAnyone can dm me straight, you can criticize my looks and also give constructive advice on what to fix so that I become more approachable and attractive to the opposite gender.\nThanks.",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Most of the time, it ends up just looking like tight waves that curl at the end. But when I diffuse, the curls go up higher, and even where it’s not quite a curl I can see that there is a spiral, it’s just extremely stretched out. \n\nThere are also times when I don’t change my curl routine at all and I get full on ringlets and curls in some places. I know this isn’t just a case of me having an uneven curl pattern (though that’s probably true too) because it’s different pieces of hair. I honestly don’t know why this happens and how to replicate it because it’s so random. I think I’m probably styling it wrong, and I also think my hair might be too heavy since it looks like stretched out spirals, though I’ve had it short before in my freshman year of highschool. It looked a bit more defined but not by much (though I’m not sure I was really styling it much that could be part of it.) I’ve tried changing my routine in different ways and while it helps it doesn’t fix it. Can someone please give me advice 😭 \n\nI did bleach and dye my hair, which I know doesn’t help but my hair doesn’t really seem changed at all.\n\nRoutine-\n\nCurrently I exclusively use Not Your Mother’s curl talk products. (With the exception of the clarifying shampoo)\n\n\n\nI wash my hair maybe once a week, maybe more but never more than a couple times a wee. When I wash it I use their bond building shampoo and conditioner. \n\n\n\nI do the rest of this everyday regardless if I washed it or not but I always wet it in the shower- while my hair is still wet I spray in leave in conditioner and brush with a curly hair tangle tweezer (I brush it as little as possible but I have to brush it daily since it gets extremely tangled). Then I put their curl defining cream through my mids to ends and make sure it’s completely distributed by brushing it through a little. If it ever starts to dry during this process I spray it with water. Then I add their curl definition gel then scrunch, then I let it air dry.\n\n  \nOh and i also clarify occasionally if it feels like there’s a lot of build up with Maui Moisture Scalp Care Clarifying Shampoo but I don’t count that as part of my routine since I don’t do it often.\n\n  \nI probably have a lot of product build up but I’ve gone through phases where I only used detangler and my hair was a lot poofier,  frizzier, and undefined.\n\n  \ntldr: My hair usually looks mostly wavy but curly at the end, but sometimes it makes ringlets/tigher curls and it’s different pieces and randomly",

I use the bowl method as that seems to work better at bringing out the curls than not using it. \n\nI’ve tried plopping before diffusing - up to 5 times with a different towel each time for maximum absorption. Not mention I squeeze a ton out over the bowl beforehand. \n\nI’ve tried diffusing hoods. \n\nI’ve tried just regular diffusing attachments. \n\nNo matter what, I’ve never been able to dry my hair all the way because I usually give up after about three hours. Besides which, I don’t have three hours+ in the mornings to spare while getting ready for work. Also, I have to refresh my hair every day even if I sleep with a silk bonnet.  There’s just so much hair and again it’s so fine that I have to redo everything or else it starts falling. \n\nI’ve tried air drying and that’s always a horrible mess. My hair is very long (I’m 5’7” and it touch the very tippy top of my butt) and so it moves a lot or else I have to move it a lot out of the way. This gets in the way of a cast forming. I’ve tried clipping my hair up which usually results in the ends of my hair looking n okayish but then the bulk of my hair is still wet. \n\nI can include my current “routine” but it should be noted that as of right now I’ve given up on taking care of my curly hair because the drying part is too onerous. Right now I just wash with a clarifying shampoo every other wash (Suave something or other, it’s blue and cheap) and I condition with The Ordinary’s conditioner when I use that shampoo. The other shampoo I use is the Maui Moisture one with flaxseed. Then I’ll “condition” with Alikay Natural’s Knots Be Gone.\n\nHow does anyone get their hair to dry?! This is awful! I’m so sick of throwing money at this stupid hair all for it not to behave the way anyone else’s does. ",

Overall my skin soaks up product immediately and still feels a bit raw/tight and dry.\n\nShould I cut everything out? Switch moisturizers? Start differin again?

I have fairly normal skin with few issues other than I'm 42 and would like to keep my face looking the way it does without surgical intervention.\n\nI tried to ignore the fact that Clinique was bought by Estee Lauder a long time ago, but I just can't anymore. I was going to switch to Murad, which is sadly owned by Unilever, and Laroche is owned by L'Oreal so I'm a bit lost.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on decent skincare brands that are not owned by horrible corporations? I would hope to find products of a similar quality, definitely some kind of retinol/anti-aging and at a similar (or ideally lower!) price point. I am UK based so a big plus if it's a brand that is made here. Thanks for your help.",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m really hoping for some help because I’m completely at a loss with my curls right now. I’ve been obsessed with hair care for years and have had lots of ups and downs with it but lately it’s been looking so bad that I genuinely struggle to look in the mirror most days. These photos were taken right after drying.\n\nMy main issues:\n\nThere’s a strange separation between my bangs and the sides that makes it look like I have a receding hairline (seen especially from the side)\n\nThe sides of my hair stick out awkwardly\n\nMy crown/top is very flat\n\nThe back never looks right and feels undefined\n\nMy curls completely fall apart overnight, so I have to wash and style every morning\n\nSleeping in a bonnet actually makes my hair look worse, not better\n\nCurls form into these big coils that just look like worms, especially seen at the picture from the top.\n\nHalf my hair is defined, half is frizzy af\n\nI’ve tried many routines and products over the years and feel like nothing is working anymore.\n\nCurrent Routine!!\n\nShampoo &amp; Conditioner: Bali Curls moisturizing shampoo and Bali Curls conditioner\n\nI shampoo normally, then detangle my hair in the shower with the Bali Curls conditioner using my fingers. I rinse the conditioner out fully. Once a week I use a deep conditioning mask.\n\nStyling:\n\n1.\t⁠I lightly scrunch out excess water and briefly plop to remove dripping water \n\n2.I  apply a pea-sized amount of Bali Curls Curl Cream upside down, raking then scrunching it in, then style a bit with a Denman brush (not that much, i usually don’t have time, i just try to break up the big curls)\n\n3. I plop again\n\n4. I apply a small amount of Bali Curls Volumizing Mousse (also upside down), scrunching it in.\n\nDrying:\n\nI mostly diffuse upside down with a diffuser (a dyson knockoff) farther away from the scalp, then closer as the hair gets dryer.\n\nIf there’s a cast, i put a small amount of bali curls oil in and also scrunch.\n\nDespite all this, my hair ends up flat on top, puffy or awkward on the sides, and strangely separated in the front. I don’t know if this is a technique issue, a product issue, or something else entirely. Any advice especially for fixing crown volume, bang separation, and side shape would be incredibly appreciated. I feel like right now my hair looks so messy that it makes me look like a slob (sorry). Whenever i tell people i spend an hour on my hair everyday they’re like. Really? Nooo.. :(",

      "content": "Hi - 38/m. \n\nI went Norwood 3 very quickly around 26, which I could style, suited me just fine, and remained almost completely stable until I was about 35.\n\nIt again very quickly progressed to Norwood 4 around 36.\n\nIn summer of 2024, I began applying topical Minoxidil. At first, Rogaine spray but this gave me a very itchy scalp. I progressed to the foam which I applied far more than directed every night before bed, to both my thinning crown and my receding hairline.\n\nThis made absolutely no difference whatsoever, and my hairline continued to worsen.\n\nIn November 2025 I switched from Rogaine Minoxidil foam to Sons combination spray, which is topical Minoxidil, Finasteride and Tretinoin. I considered taking Finasteride oral, however due to some unrelated medical conditions I have, my GP recommended against it.\n\nThe instructions say to use 4 sprays per day, however I shower twice a day, so I have to apply it twice, and also four sprays simply doesn't cover the areas well enough, so I end up using between 5 and 8 sprays. I then massage it in with my fingers.\n\nDespite applying twice a day AND using more than directed, I am still experiencing absolutely no hair changes at all. Nothing. No vellus hairs, no density increases in what's currently there, nothing.\n\nTo summarise, I've been on topical Minoxidil for 15 months, before switching to topical Min+Fin for 2 months. Zero changes at all.\n\nJust after any tips, advice, or if anyone has experienced anything similar? Should I keep on the Min+Fin for longer? Or is it time to give it up?\n\nThanks",

I’ve tried a lot of procedures, and I’ve bought lots of skincare products both from local stores and from Alibaba. So far, I haven’t been able to see the result I crave. I know some of these products require time and consistency, but I find it hard to stick to a particular routine. For these past few months, I’ve battled with low self-esteem, and I’ve relied so much on makeup. As someone who has never been a makeup person, this new change has not been an easy one. \n\nI was reading online when I saw a person’s review of a Hydra facial machine. According to her, she said the machine tackles hyperpigmentation and other skin issues. These days, I tend not to believe every review I see because I have fallen prey to products that didn’t work. However, I am thinking of visiting a spa for a session with this machine because I seriously need results. \n\nHas anyone here used this procedure before? Did it work? I would hate to try another procedure or product that will not deliver what it promised. Also, aside from this Hydra facial machine procedure, are there other procedures that can help cure hyperpigmentation completely?",
