      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I bought it after seeing all the ads and I regretted it for a sec much since everyone bashed it but honestly, here is my hot take based just on my experience: \n\nPros: Leaves no white cast on my face. I layer it with a Serum, Moisturizer and then sunscreen but it hardly feels oily (maybe cuz I have dull skin). The texture feels good on the skin and mixes well. Feels very light. I hate the feeling of being plastered when I apply sunscreen so this felt good for a change.\n\nCons: Everyone keeps saying the SPF protection is not as good. I personally didn’t feel that way, since my face didn’t get any darker. It did give it a subtle suppleness, and i am getting no unwanted tan yet either. \n\nI think i’m gonna stick with it irrespective of what i might hear, if something works for you- it works! It is what it is. \n",

I recently ran out of my facial cleanser (it was the CVS dupe of the laroche posay hydrating cleanser) which worked pretty good! but I was low on money atp so I grabbed some cerave hydrating cleanser that was on clearance at the store that I used for a couple days. i also recently tried Garnier micellar water. im not sure if this is breaking me out or not!! I also used beef tallow which wasn't irritating my skin for several days before this, but it could be that? I bought the cosrx snail mucin moisturizer a few weeks ago because it was on sale and used to work great for me but now my skin hates it i guess so ive been trying to find something else that works. I had a few of these red spots on the tops of my cheeks before the product changes (including adding the beef tallow) and im just not sure how to fix it :(( any advice is appreciated!! \n\nand for reference, I have dry sensitive skin. I dont know if it helps at all either but I do have lupus and im on an immunosuppressant.

      "content": "Hello lovely people! I’m getting married soon and could really use help from the curly community (or anyone who’s DIY’d their wedding hair).\n\nI’ve attached a photo of my natural hair for reference. \n\nI know for sure that I want to wear my hair curly, but I'd love for it to look a little bit different than it does every other day. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to find a curly hair stylist near me, so I’m hoping to DIY my looks.\n\nI’m aiming for three different styles across events:\n1) A loose, romantic bun (if it’s possible with my length)\n2) A half-up half-down style\n3) A natural curls-down look that can survive hours of dancing \n\nWhat I'm struggling with is that most tutorials I’m finding are either for much longer curls or assume I already know what I’m doing, which I do not. \n\nSo I’m looking for:\n- Beginner friendly curly hair updo tutorials (if it says twist the front sections back, I would love to know how to actually do that without looking like a mess)\n- Tips or hacks for short-to-medium curly hair\n- Products for strong hold (happy to use non-CG hairspray if needed)\n\nMy other big concern is if I use strong hold hairspray/gel for the bun or half-up style earlier, will that ruin definition for the final curls-down day? Or is there a way to reset without fully washing again?\n\nAny advice, product recs, easy step-by-step guides, or “don’t make the mistake I did” stories are very appreciated!\n\nThank you from a stressed out but determined bride-to-be ✨ \n\nRoutine: \nI wash with a generic shampoo and the Cantu shea butter conditioner a couple of times a week (endurance sports + swimming). I then use the Asbha leave in conditioner and gel when wet, scrunch with a tshirt, lightly diffuse and then allow to air dry completely. Apart from this, I use satin pillowcases protect my hair while sleeping.",

My first appointment was the only one she wasn’t late to. \n\nMy appointment was originally at 4 today and I got a call at 345 asking if I could come in at 430. Sure no problem.\n\nI get in at 4:27, and get greeted by the front desk lady. She says she’ll check where my stylist is at…and disappears. She doesn’t come back. Red flag. \n\nThen I see her. My stylist. She is walking a client over to the shampoo bowl to wash out color. \n\nI think to myself, no way she is going to cut dry and style her too. Then she whips out her shears. I internally want to explode. \n\nI agreed to come in at 430, a half an hour later than my original appointment and now I get here and she still has 30-45 minutes to go to finish  her clients hair. Absolutely not. Not to mention I pay around $270+ tip for a single process color and haircut. \n\nI walk back up to the front desk and politely ask to cancel my appointment without being charge. The woman agrees and apologizes. Then she asks if I wanted to have another stylist do my hair and I said no. I felt that would be awkward and uncomfortable…\n\nI’m so aggravated. Getting my hair done is literally the only thing I do for myself and I really liked the way my hair came out every single time I got it done but being disrespectful of my time is something I can’t look past anymore.\n\nIs there a way to salvage this or should I just move on? The woman at the front desk said someone would reach out to me, but I’m not sure if I want to go back….\n",

It could be ingrown hairs, razor bumps, shaving irritation, pigmentation, or marks left from old acne. The area feels like it has a lot of tiny clogged pores or trapped hair roots. I want to understand what this condition actually is so I can fix it properly. If anyone has had something similar or knows what this might be, please tell me.

I found quite a few Reddit posts in this sub and other subs, as well as posts on many other websites and blogs recommending glycolic acid for milia.\nI bought the ordinary glycolic acid and use it by soaking a cotton bud just till it’s wet (so the dry cotton bud doesn’t rub and irritate my skin), lightly rubbing it over my milia area and then leaving it to absorb. I realised my milia was becoming more noticeable so I did some googling and came to the conclusion that I need to use it more frequently, so instead of just once in the evening I applied it in the morning and afternoon also. \nNow the milia is MILES more noticeable/worse and has even spread to an area on the side of my nose where I’d accidentally been applying the acid. \n\nCan anyone offer any explanations/advice/insight on the product, how to get rid of the milia, why this could be happening? I’ve already seen a doctor but in my country you can’t get them extracted unless you pay thousands for private treatment so the doctor just recommended exfoliating more. ",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
