      "content": "I'm a later in life runner (started in my 30s, early 40s), and I don't know if it's running that does it, or what, but I periodically get chest/shoulder acne that flares up during the year.\n\nUsed to be, I thought this was related to laundry detergent. I have sensitive skin, and sometimes it just gets irritated. But earlier last year, I felt like I had a flare that was lasting longer than normal, so asked my (new) dermatologist if I could try something specific for it. She said she'd normally recommend a benzoyl peroxide wash, but that might be too harsh for my skin, so prescribed clindamyacin wipes and a sulfur wash.\n\nSulfur wash seemed to do nothing (dermawash was the brand). I tried the clindamyacin wipes and, although they seemed to start working, within a week, I had an entirely different rash that was itchy and spreading. I believe this was a fungal reaction...I guess the bacteria was killed off and yeast took over. At the time, I was traveling, so bought antifungal cream and head and shoulders and things started to calm down.\n\nEnter: now. Several months later, and I'm still battling this persistent acne. I've tried 10% benzoyl peroxide wash, ketaconazole shampoo (2%), alternating each twice per week...things will clear up, then I'll break out again. I started using a friction stick (gold bond) across my chest and shoulders before runs: that helps a little, but I still get breakouts. I shower immediately after workouts. I've tried periods of just using soothing, basic cleanser followed by a basic lotion (vanicream), but the breakout persists.\n\nSo my question here is: what actually works for you?? I can't figure out if my skin is just too sensitive for anything active (and therefore reacts), or if I'm using the wrong thing entirely. I know some people have success with zinc bars (from reading, these can be too harsh for sensitive skin and cause problems), some people swear by benzoyl peroxide wash (same deal... sensitive skin doesn't play nice), salicylic wash (way back when I saw the dermatologist, I was using this and I was still having breakouts). I'm so frustrated and just want clear skin 😭",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I’ve used a sponge and brushes, and changed my base so many times yet it’s always ending up like this. Here’s some parts of my routine:\n\n•\t⁠I always used ceravee foaming cleanser, the ordinary glycolic toner, their niacinamide and a simple moisturiser. I’ve used the neutrogena water gel moisturiser before, as well as the ordinary moisturiser and still the same. I didn’t always use the niacinamide, however on days without same as above.\n•\t⁠I’ve used silicone primers, no primer, (today I tried no primer) and still the same outcome. Current primer I have is nyx shine killer, previously used a revlon primer, as well as the nyx pore filler, and a rimmel one (I can’t remember the name).\n•\t⁠I wait ages between moisturiser and primer if using.\n•\t⁠I drink a lot of water regardless\n•\t⁠I have an oily tzone and always use less product there\n•\t⁠I’ve tried loose and pressed powders, and only use a small amount\n•\t⁠I use urban decay setting spray, not always but today I did and same result as other days without\n\nAny advice would be needed! It’s so frustrating as when I was in my 20s I feel like this never happened! I’m really not sure what the issue is, I’ve done silicone primers, matte primers, and I check to make sure my primer is compatible with my foundation. I don’t like to be too matte, however couldn’t try glass skin or dewy as with it being oily it would be too shiny for me. I’ve tried using less foundation also. It just always seem to cake in smile lines, my chin, nose and sides of my mouth. I know the cold weather can be drying, however I spent Christmas on holiday and my makeup did the same in heat. ",

It was fall of 2023 when the learned that I could use meditation to improve my hairline.\n\nEthnicity: South Asian, male, 37.\n\nFirst image: left picture is from January of 2024. Right picture is from September of 2024. I used the same camera, same location, same lighting, same hair length (3 days after trim).\n\nSecond picture (just one pic) was taken December of 2025. Location is different, lighting is different, I think it was about 5 days of trim.\n\nProduct: Hims 0.3% fin, 6% min. In 2024 I used derma pen once a week with 1.5 mm cartridge. In 2025, I rarely used it as I ran out of cartridges and got lazy. But towards the end of 2025, I started to use derma pen again once a week with 1.5 mm cartridge.\n\nAdditional products: in fall of 2025, I also added 0.3% of dut, hence why second picture has yellow tint on the scalp.\n\nProgress: As you can see the progress in 2024, not much of a progress from September of 2024 to December 2025. I think progress has been plateaued maybe with some hair getting thicker is some areas.\n\nFuture plans: should I try oral dut on top of topical fin/min? Or should I go HT route?\n\nThank you\n\n[First Picture](https://preview.redd.it/ewbgdjq1secg1.jpg?width=1924&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf4aae7498dbe3e112c0cbe99730b9ddda2eae7f)\n\n[Second Picture](https://preview.redd.it/qswd9mq1secg1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f70efba72b3f4c8fe58e370471db72bfc72c193)",

I struggled over the years but now have a decent routine that prevents breakouts overall. I’m 28 now btw. I live in the desert and struggle a lot with dryness and my cheeks often being very red still. My skin has come such a long way and this is honestly so good compared to where it once was, but I’ve dreamed for years of clear, beautiful skin, especially since I don’t love wearing makeup most of the time.\n\nI’m wondering if I should do chemical peels, microneedling, a different procedure, or add something into my routine to help with the scarring and with the redness?\n\nI currently use L’amarue clarify and control protocol (cleanser, toner, serum, moisturizer) as well as one of their facial oils, but admittedly I only do my routine once a day most of the time. It does help with the redness immediately after but comes back after a few hours.",

Whenever I leave a salon, I don’t notice a difference in my texture, either. My mother has super wavy hair even though she doesn’t do anything and brushes it out twice a day. Am I doing something wrong? If I had to guess, it’s medium porosity. Am I doing something wrong or did I completely misinterpret the texture of my hair?\n\nMy routine: Suave clarifying shampoo once a week (oily scalp), the L’oréal Ever Pure volume shampoo, and the L’oréal Elvive Glycolic Gloss conditioner. For other products, I use the Aussie Sprunch mousse and the NYM curl cream. I plop for 15-20 minutes then air dry (since I don’t have a diffuser)and use a silk bonnet but I haven’t noticed any changes. \n\nPHOTOS IN ORDER: \n1) before shower \n\n2) A strand of hair 💀\n\n3) A super curly piece of hair next to me ear, right side.\n\n4) Post wash/plop\n\n5) Post wash/plop, underneath.\n",
