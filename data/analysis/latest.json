      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

The underneath section of my hair near my nape is naturally much more straight, has a bit of wave, while the top of my hair is ringlet curls. It has always been this way since i was young no matter the length of my hair, it’s not from damage I swear. I am growing my hair out for the first time in years, it’s always been cut around my collar bones. But now i’m running into the issue that since my hair is much more fine (fine as in strand size) and straight on the underneath section, it keeps getting tangled and matted when i sleep with a bonnet or any other way, or also just by going through my day normally. It used to do this when I was young and i forgot until now (maybe why I had it cut shorter in the first place lol). Does anyone have any advice? I’m not sure if there’s anything I can do tbh. I never really get any knots anywhere else in my hair only this section. \nMy routine is AG ultra moist conditioner &amp; shampoo, AG fast food leave in conditioner, and auntie jackie’s curl boss coconut curling gelée (highly recommend this one). Then I just diffuse. The photos are taken a few hours after washing, so this is what the underneath is like in its best curl state lol (which is saying a lot)\nplease help! lol thank you",

      "content": "Hey! So i was balding pretty intensely and noticed it got really bad sometime around early 2025. After looking and getting over the fear mongering surrounding taking finasteride, i decided to pull the trigger and go with the first option that i saw, which was Hims topical fin+min. I started on August 27th, 2025 (first and second photo) and i am three months in! (third and fourth photo)\n\nDosage: Fin .3% Min 7% Ketoconazol 2.2% Biotin .2%\n\nApplied once a day to both sides of hairline, Top of head, and crown at night\n\nAlso wear a bonnet to sleep as i have a pet dog\n\nHere are a few things i’ve noticed both good and bad and what i wish i would’ve done differently\n\n• What would I have done differently?\n\nI would have started sooner. Although the progress is amazing and i’m really hopeful that most if not all of my past hairline will come back, i know that if i would’ve started this treatment sooner, i would’ve been able to go out in public without a hat. So if you’re noticing any type or hint of balding, don’t wait!!\n\nbe proactive, not reactive.\n\nIf your having to ask people if they think your balding, just assume you are and start treatment early.\n\n• Cons of treatment\n\nDefinitely the price for me. Although Hims is great and it def working, i do feel like there are some cheaper options out there. do your research and find the best option for you price wise\n\nChoosing topical products over oral. To me, it wasn’t worth the risk of ED as my “little man” works out pretty often…if yk what i mean. With that, studies show that topical has less of a chance to have adverse side effects compared to oral, although i have seen that oral does have a bigger chance to work at a higher rate. Not saying topical won’t work, it just might take longer.\n\nBrain fog like a MF. While taking topical fin+min, i started getting mad brain fog around week 5 of usage. Although it’s only usually in the mornings, it does hinder my ability to wake up and get ready for college, and usually lasts a good while. a great work around for this i found is just staying active. go gym, go run, and eat healthy!\n\n• Pros\n\nYOU GET YOUR HAIR BACK!\n\nI will be honest, it’s not coming in as fast as i hoped, but there is an amazing deal of growth here.\n\nin all, this is a journey and i’m very hopeful and excited to get my old head of hair back! If your questioning if instead is safe for you, take the leap. if your worried about ED being caused from finasteride, that’s okay and it’s smart your doing your research, that’s the whole reason i chose topical treatment instead of oral. Which ever you choose, just be proactive about it!",

      "content": "I want to share my recent experience with Maelys Cosmetics **(A SCAM COMPANY)** in hopes this will help someone avoid the headaches I went through. I’ve documented and saved screenshots/receipts from almost every interaction I had with them, and I’ll be including them in this post.\n\nA couple months ago, I kept seeing Maelys ads on Instagram. They pushed their products along with a **Try Before You Buy (TBYB)** program. I had seen this brand sold at Ulta, which made it feel more legitimate to me, I assumed a retailer as large as Ulta would thoroughly vet the brands they carry, or at least ensure they weren't operating with deceptive or predatory practices.\n\nEven so, I was still a little skeptical being this was my first try before you buy experience and kept a second eye out throughout the checkout process. I read every line of fine print and it seemed to all look good. The only things I knowingly agreed to was:\n\n* Pay shipping upfront\n* Trying the product for 3 weeks - starting from the delivery date of the product\n* I could return it within the 3 week trial window if I didn’t like it to avoid being charged\n* If I didn’t return it, then I would pay for the product\n\n**What actually happened: they refused to honor the trial period AND tried forcing a subscription on me that I never consented to. Here is the timeline of how things went down.**\n\n**7/2 (PIC #3)** **—** Ordered the B-Tight TBYB product. Paid $6.47 (shipping + tax)\n\n**7/10 —** TBYB product delivered. 3-week trial period starts\n\n**7/30 —** I was very consistent with applying the product for weeks but unfortunately saw no results. Last day of my 3-week trial, I reached out via their return chat to initiate a return. **No response from them**\n\n**7/31 —** I contacted them again the next day. This time they responded but said I “missed the window.” I honestly blamed myself for not reaching out a day or two earlier before the last day window(7/30) so I was okay with paying for TBYB products and accepted the charge of $43\n\n**8/2 —** I suddenly receive an order confirmation for $49.47 for ***a subscription.*** **I was extremely confused**\n\n**8/2 (PIC #4) —** I immediately go to their website and contact their chat. They tell me, ***“Your initial TBYB trial converted into a subscription as designed.”*** **This was never disclosed anywhere during checkout process.** They said they’ll cancel my subscription, I assumed this meant they would cancel/not ship out the subscription that just got confirmed earlier in the day and stop any further charges\n\n**8/4 —** I receive an email that the subscription has been shipped\n\n**8/4 (PIC #5) —** Frustrated and fed up with this bs, I file a Better Business Bureau(BBB) complaint with screenshots of my checkout process and question why they can start a subscription service on my account without ever disclosing it. This is also when I realize **there are thousands of similar complaints like mine on the** [**BBB site**](https://www.bbb.org/us/ny/staten-island/profile/skin-care/maelys-cosmetics-usa-inc-0121-87147134/complaints?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=PMAX+Startnow+20&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=6830342630&amp;hsa_cam=23267566799&amp;hsa_grp=&amp;hsa_ad=&amp;hsa_src=x&amp;hsa_tgt=&amp;hsa_kw=&amp;hsa_mt=&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23262540642&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADmhR62vzHEqMQ2_5reT6o8ahMOnm&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA55rJBhByEiwAFkY1QL6ZeIIkh2HTpky4KGNa6e8stlhHLtpgFHJV1mYiq1dygiN-9C8GRhoCSNUQAvD_BwE) against this company. It's disgusting D:\n\n**8/5 (PIC #6) —** Maleys responds through the BBB complaint and basically repeats what their customer service chat had previously relayed **“subscription started upon checkout of your TBYB order. It has now been cancelled.”** **They ignore the lack of disclosure/consent.** (They state my order was placed 8/25, when it was only 8/5.. I think they just copy and pasted a template without ever looking into my order.)\n\n**8/5 (PIC #7) —** I go to their website and reach out to their customer service again and try to arrange a return for the subscription they shipped out. They said they’d email me. **I don't get a email**\n\n**8/7 —** Subscription product is delivered\n\n**8/8 (PIC #8) —** I contact chat again. They think I’m trying to return the TBYB product. I clarify it’s the subscription I never signed up for, but they only say my subscription is canceled going forward. **They close the chat** and refuse to address returning the unwanted subscription package\n\n**8/8 (PIC #9) —** I update my BBB complaint as “not resolved.” They said I missed the TBYB window – fine, I’ll take that (technically they never responded to me the first time I reached out to initiate the return, which caused me to miss the window). But I’m not paying for the subscription, nor do I want the products that I never consented to. I again ask them to show where on throughout the checkout process it states the subscription will start upon checkout of TBYB order\n\n**8/8 —** I dispute the $49.47 charge with my credit card company\n\n**8/12 (PIC #10) —** Maelys responds through the BBB complaint and says they have emailed me a return label (I'm assuming this is because the dispute hit their end, otherwise they would probably just brush me off again)\n\n**8/21 —** I ship back the subscription package (never opened)\n\n**8/27 —** USPS tracking shows it delivered\n\n**8/29 —** I receive a refund of **$43.57** from Maelys – **$5.90 less** than what I paid for the subscription. **They essentially tried charging me for the shipping label** for a product I did not order, did not want, and only received because they didn't to cancel the shipment. Again, I dispute this amount with my credit card company and ask them to block all future attempted charges from Maelys\n\n[#1 - Maelys Charges](https://preview.redd.it/maux3rwsxp3g1.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f3f2a70c0e7ca7b38196afe9172e7ed1494934e)\n\n[#2 - Maelys Emails](https://preview.redd.it/zll1plypsp3g1.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=748492fa987b57cf23f29a222061b2d2260f07db)\n\n[#3 - 7\\/2 Maelys Checkout Process](https://preview.redd.it/3tu7b270tp3g1.jpg?width=3451&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=787b5890a00e8b9d9592c8d8c730e808aaacae4c)\n\n[#4 - 8\\/2 Convo with Maelys Customer Support](https://preview.redd.it/rrik7u89tp3g1.jpg?width=4590&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d721e8d95aeaa512c8b572868088bb329334ae02)\n\n[#5- 8\\/4 Filed BBB Complaint](https://preview.redd.it/gdi2sv49up3g1.jpg?width=2464&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e21b9274867452c1403f572f85593a781a7d4e0d)\n\n[#6 - 8\\/5 Maely's Initial Reponse to BBB Complaint](https://preview.redd.it/ze5zgi1hup3g1.jpg?width=2466&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2878f7915e8baeb7a1a240e1a5802ff721d36509)\n\n[#7 - 8\\/5 Convo with Maelys Customer Support](https://preview.redd.it/ecjzl8jnup3g1.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e2a9dec0dae2171eddedcfc047fbf8d00229245)\n\n[#8 - 8\\/8 Convo with Maelys Customer Support](https://preview.redd.it/u3sb4ec5vp3g1.jpg?width=4590&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98bcb7a9daacd04e068b3acf3b93cc30eb08ef8c)\n\n[#9 - 8\\/8 Updated BBB Complaint](https://preview.redd.it/lcthz4vcvp3g1.jpg?width=2462&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67d820717ce4aab98c6e7586acbb35047695c546)\n\n[#10 - 8\\/12 Maely's 2nd Reponse to BBB Complaint](https://preview.redd.it/5dxrmezgvp3g1.jpg?width=2468&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c47feb87e5028e6f82a1c7ea9894477d66a1c19)",

      "content": "Help! Hi guys! This is going to be a long post but I need some help. So about a few years ago, whenever I got out of the shower and let my hair air dry, my hair would always get wavy and poofy and frizzy instead of staying straight. But I ignored that for years and kept treating my hair like it was straight, even straightening it regularly because I liked the sleek look.\n\nAbout two years ago, I discovered curly hair and wavy hair routines, so I tried some products and they worked really well. But the routine felt like too much of a hassle, so I went back to straightening.I also got keratin done in 2022. My hair was so damaged before thankfully I have recovered from that.\n\nRecently, I decided I want to wear my hair natural again, so I've been experimenting with different products. I also have high porosity hair now because I bleached it a few months ago, but I still don't feel like l've found the right routine.\n\nRight now, my curl routine is I use the Ouai Detox Shampoo and then the purple Pureology shampoo. I don't use a regular conditioner just deep conditioning masks. I rotate between the Fino mask, the Gisou mask, and the Amika Intense Bond Repair mask. After the shower, I dry my hair with a microfiber towel. For styling, curl creams weigh my hair down, so I stick to a lightweight leave in (the Pureology one works well for me).\n\nThen I use a mousse (either Umberto Giannini Curl Foam or Curlsmith Invincible Mousse) and a strong hold gel (Aveda Curl Enhancer Gel gives me a good cast). Sometimes I also use Curlsmith In-Shower Style Fixer. I either plop with a T-shirt or scrunch out excess water and diffuse on low speed/ medium heat. Hover and then cup diffuse.\n\nAt first, I get a great cast with really pretty waves and some spirals, but once I scrunch out the crunch, I end up with straight pieces and lose a lot of definition. The next day is even worse, even though I pineapple and sleep with a bonnet. It's honestly getting really demotivating.\n\nI also feel like I get all the volume at the bottom and my roots are flat I wanna get rid of the triangle. What type of haircut should I get to get rid of the triangle? Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong or what I should change? I get actual ringlets underneath my hair, so l'm not sure where I fall on the curl spectrum. And is curl training even a real thing? If so, how do you actually do it? Any advice would really help. Also all these pictures are recent except the last one its from 2023 when I first tried a curly routine! :)",

Some super tight ringlets some less tight. I’m so tired of my hair in a bun and I want a minimalist routine. \n\nIdeally, I’d like to shower at night, let my hair dry with product, throw a satin sleep cap on and go to bed. Wake up spritz it down with water and reapply product and go. Or in the morning, hop in the shower, wash etc. then scrunch with curl cream and gel then let air dry and leave the house. \n\nAm I crazy? Or is this possible? Let me know your minimalist short hair routine! \n\nFirst pic is the best pic of my hair I could find and the second is what I’m thinking. ",
