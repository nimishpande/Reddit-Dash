      "content": "hey! I am 19 years old, I have had long hair my whole life. My hair is naturally straight, thin, and virgin I have done nothing to it. My hair is oily at the root and dry at the ends. I used to use the Maui shampoo and conditioner for the longest time but about a year ago I started using redken all soft shampoo and conditioner, then for about the last 5 ish months I switched to the redken extreme length shampoo. I think it damaged my hair I use no heat on it. It has white dots on the ends and it looks like split ends all around my hair. I am hoping to get a haircut this weekend. I just got the purology sheer shampoo and conditioner and the clarifying shampoo buttt I am not sure if that will fix my hair. Any help will be appreciated:) it is making me go crazy lol",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "I've recently made my peace with the fact I have coily hair on the back of my head and more wavy on the front and top and have been trying to navigate styling for these different textures.\n\nOne thing that annoys me is how the hair at my front is longer/thinner than in the back and was wondering if I should either cut it to match the length on the back, just trim it on the front, or if I'm just exaggerating and everything is fine as it is.\n\nI'm experimenting with several products now trying to see what works for me (only started curling my hair more or less about a year ago) but my routine usually consists of:\n\n1. Double shampoo (one with Head &amp; Shoulders and another with whatever sulfate-free thing I can find)\n\n2. Conditioner (Shea Moisture's Coconut &amp; Hibiscus conditioner)\n\n3. Dry excess water with microfiber towel\n\n4. Leave-in conditioner (Gingermilk's Be Yourself leave-in)\n\n5. Curl cream (Pattern Styling Cream)\n\n6. Gel (Eco Style Krystal gel)\n\n7. Used to let it air dry but recently started diffusing on low heat\n\n8. Use a satin bonnet for bed and either let the hair loose or do a small puff with a silk scrunchie (hair is not enough for a pineapple)\n\n9. I refresh 2-4 times before my next wash day usually by misting, using leave-in, some curl cream, and a bit of gel. I also sometimes use Cantu's Next Day Curl Revitalizer.",

      "title": "[Routine Help] Post Laser Damage?",
      "content": "I had fraxel laser conducted on January 8. I had two passes of 1550 and 2 passes of 1927. My face is still experiencing redness on my cheeks and some tiny bumps (they resemble closed comedies, but much smaller) as I approach the 2 weeks post laser mark. The best way I can describe my skin is similar to rosacea, which I have never experienced before; however, I historically get flushed easily with heat. I have had Moxi, halo, BBL, and clear and brilliant before with no issues 3ish years ago. During this time around, I experienced EXTREME redness my initial few days and I assumed that was due to the intensity of the laser.\n\nI’m including photos of my face currently and what my face looks like in the heat / what it is usually like when it’s normal (July 2024 pic). I also added a pic trying to reflect the bumps. I don’t think the photos are doing justice on how red my face looks.\n\nIs it normal to experience this time of redness almost 2 weeks post treatment?\n\nShould I follow up with a dermatologist? I had a family medicine doctor do the laser at a med spa (I thought they were in plastics until I did googling after the fact)\n\nWhat remedies can help? My current routine as of the last few days are: skinceuticals vitamin c, allies of skin growth factor serum, skinceuticals redness neutralizer moisturizer in the AM; in the evening, I’m using the redness neutralizer and the la rosche posay cicaplast. I’m using red light therapy (omnilux mask) daily. I have not touched active ingredients such as tertinoin or acids yet.\n\nAny guidance on how to alleviate this would be appreciated, I’m getting married in May so I’m feeling a bit nervous about my skin.",

Now the back/underneath layer dries into a tube shape, like it was wrapped around a curling iron, and the rest of my hair needs a little encouragement to be wavy and cute. I've been trying lots of different routines, and it's always wavy but not usually that cute :)\n\nThe last couple times I washed and styled, my hair turned out almost perfect, but I keep getting a weird tangly \"rat's nest\" where it's curliest in the back. Everything looks great while I style and diffuse upside down, but it's like that back part gets stuck and tangled up when I try to flip upright again. What am I doing wrong?\n\nMy hair has a very soft, slippery finish, and I've had the most success cutting out heavy and conditioning products and focusing on volume and hold.\n\nRoutine:\n\nAussie Miracle Curls shampoo and conditioner every few days. Suave clarifying shampoo weekly.\n\nI'm upside down from conditioner on. \n\nRinse and squish out extra water, apply NYM Curl Talk Mousse from roots to ends with praying hands, scrunch. Apply NYM Curl Talk Gel with praying hands, focusing more on mids and ends, scrunch.\n\nI hover diffuse my roots and mids, then cup the ends and mids until almost try. All upside down.\n\nIt looks awesome until I flip over and everything gets all caught up in the back. Then I usually start messing with it trying to untangle it, and obviously it gets frizzy and even worse. Sorry I can't include a pic because I don't use a smartphone. Please help!",
