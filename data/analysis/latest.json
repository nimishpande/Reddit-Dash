I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Sorry this is so long, also please no one start a debate with me over if my hair is wavy or curly. That is neither helpful nor the point. \n\n  \nI’m so confused by my hair. Most of the time, it ends up just looking like tight waves that curl at the end. But when I diffuse, the curls go up higher, and even where it’s not quite a curl I can see that there is a spiral, it’s just extremely stretched out. \n\nThere are also times when I don’t change my curl routine at all and I get full on ringlets and curls in some places. I know this isn’t just a case of me having an uneven curl pattern (though that’s probably true too) because it’s different pieces of hair. I honestly don’t know why this happens and how to replicate it because it’s so random. I think I’m probably styling it wrong, and I also think my hair might be too heavy since it looks like stretched out spirals, though I’ve had it short before in my freshman year of highschool. It looked a bit more defined but not by much (though I’m not sure I was really styling it much that could be part of it.) I’ve tried changing my routine in different ways and while it helps it doesn’t fix it. Can someone please give me advice 😭 \n\nI did bleach and dye my hair, which I know doesn’t help but my hair doesn’t really seem changed at all.\n\nRoutine-\n\nCurrently I exclusively use Not Your Mother’s curl talk products. (With the exception of the clarifying shampoo)\n\n\n\nI wash my hair maybe once a week, maybe more but never more than a couple times a wee. When I wash it I use their bond building shampoo and conditioner. \n\n\n\nI do the rest of this everyday regardless if I washed it or not but I always wet it in the shower- while my hair is still wet I spray in leave in conditioner and brush with a curly hair tangle tweezer (I brush it as little as possible but I have to brush it daily since it gets extremely tangled). Then I put their curl defining cream through my mids to ends and make sure it’s completely distributed by brushing it through a little. If it ever starts to dry during this process I spray it with water. Then I add their curl definition gel then scrunch, then I let it air dry.\n\n  \nOh and i also clarify occasionally if it feels like there’s a lot of build up with Maui Moisture Scalp Care Clarifying Shampoo but I don’t count that as part of my routine since I don’t do it often.\n\n  \nI probably have a lot of product build up but I’ve gone through phases where I only used detangler and my hair was a lot poofier,  frizzier, and undefined.\n\n  \ntldr: My hair usually looks mostly wavy but curly at the end, but sometimes it makes ringlets/tigher curls and it’s different pieces and randomly",

I use the bowl method as that seems to work better at bringing out the curls than not using it. \n\nI’ve tried plopping before diffusing - up to 5 times with a different towel each time for maximum absorption. Not mention I squeeze a ton out over the bowl beforehand. \n\nI’ve tried diffusing hoods. \n\nI’ve tried just regular diffusing attachments. \n\nNo matter what, I’ve never been able to dry my hair all the way because I usually give up after about three hours. Besides which, I don’t have three hours+ in the mornings to spare while getting ready for work. Also, I have to refresh my hair every day even if I sleep with a silk bonnet.  There’s just so much hair and again it’s so fine that I have to redo everything or else it starts falling. \n\nI’ve tried air drying and that’s always a horrible mess. My hair is very long (I’m 5’7” and it touch the very tippy top of my butt) and so it moves a lot or else I have to move it a lot out of the way. This gets in the way of a cast forming. I’ve tried clipping my hair up which usually results in the ends of my hair looking n okayish but then the bulk of my hair is still wet. \n\nI can include my current “routine” but it should be noted that as of right now I’ve given up on taking care of my curly hair because the drying part is too onerous. Right now I just wash with a clarifying shampoo every other wash (Suave something or other, it’s blue and cheap) and I condition with The Ordinary’s conditioner when I use that shampoo. The other shampoo I use is the Maui Moisture one with flaxseed. Then I’ll “condition” with Alikay Natural’s Knots Be Gone.\n\nHow does anyone get their hair to dry?! This is awful! I’m so sick of throwing money at this stupid hair all for it not to behave the way anyone else’s does. ",

Any advice would be appreciated!!\n\nGoals:\n\n\\- clear up acne/reduce flare ups\n\n\\- Even Skin tone\n\n\\- Fix forehead wrinkle??? Is that a thing?\n\n\\- glossier skin (not as important)\n\nEnvironment:\n\n\\- northern US, very cold winter. Hot, humid summer.  All the seasons.\n\nLifestyle:\n\n\\- I do not wear makeup every day, once a week, maybe two at most.\n\n\\- Outdoors, everyday. I bundle up but my face is exposed to the cold weather / wind.\n\n\\- Dusty environments, many home renovations requiring masks. Spending time in arenas, surrounded by dust/animal dander/hay.\n\n\\- very clean diet. Low/minimal sugar. Almost no processed foods. Some dairy.\n\n\\- I didn’t use to drink enough water but have significantly increased my water intake in the last couple months.\n\nIssues:\n\n\\- My skin feels very dry, no matter how much I moisturize.\n\n\\- lines on my forehead.\n\n\\- painful acne that takes a long time to heal.\n\nI am 24F, I feel like I should have better skin. The only time it’s clear is the couple days during my cycle. I get very deep, big “pimples” or surface level sores that nothing can be extracted from, but they take forever to go away. Lots of blackheads in my tzone. It seems strange that I have such a consistent wrinkle at this age, too. I have a bunch of little white texture spots around my mouth as well.\n\nI have all the products I use listed in a picture in the comments, the only thing not pictured is the sugar scrub I use to exfoliate. I was thinking of adding the Acwell Toner and the prequel exfoliator.\n\nThinking I need different moisturizer but not sure which one. Help appreciated☺️",

Wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience\n\nI have recently picked up my skincare routine again, I have tried a lot of different products and routines before, and never had a problem until about a year ago when I experienced some extreme dryness around my eyes that got so severe and stubborn I had to get a prescription steroid cream to treat it. This scared me away from skincare for a while and I recently picked it back up again.\n\nAround 3 days in to my current routine, I started noticing some dryness and flakes in my eye area (mainly above my eye, below my eyebrow) despite me being extra careful to avoid product going there after my previous ordeal.\n\nI planned on investing in an eye cream to help with moisture, but I heard that they're usually the same as regular moisturiser, but with an upcharge/smaller tube, but I'm very afraid to really use anything on my eye area I'm not 100% sure about so I'm looking for recommendations for the gentlest moisturisers or eye creams you know about\n\nI also heard about using vaseline to lock in moisture and create a barrier of sorts, if I try that would I apply the vaseline at the beginning of my routine to protect the area, or at the end after I moisturise my face and the eye area? I've heard it described as both a barrier and a way to lock in moisture/product, so I'm unsure\n\nAs this issue has come up twice, I'm not sure if it's product/routine specific (I am using an entirely new lineup of products), but I'm happy to share more details about what I'm using etc if it would help\n\nI haven't been using anything too harsh, I had one retinol serum that I applied only once, and I planned to use once a week / rarely while I build up a tolerance to it",

At first, Rogaine spray but this gave me a very itchy scalp. I progressed to the foam which I applied far more than directed every night before bed, to both my thinning crown and my receding hairline.\n\nThis made absolutely no difference whatsoever, and my hairline continued to worsen.\n\nIn November 2025 I switched from Rogaine Minoxidil foam to Sons combination spray, which is topical Minoxidil, Finasteride and Tretinoin. I considered taking Finasteride oral, however due to some unrelated medical conditions I have, my GP recommended against it.\n\nThe instructions say to use 4 sprays per day, however I shower twice a day, so I have to apply it twice, and also four sprays simply doesn't cover the areas well enough, so I end up using between 5 and 8 sprays. I then massage it in with my fingers.\n\nDespite applying twice a day AND using more than directed, I am still experiencing absolutely no hair changes at all. Nothing. No vellus hairs, no density increases in what's currently there, nothing.\n\nTo summarise, I've been on topical Minoxidil for 15 months, before switching to topical Min+Fin for 2 months. Zero changes at all.\n\nJust after any tips, advice, or if anyone has experienced anything similar? Should I keep on the Min+Fin for longer? Or is it time to give it up?\n\nThanks",

      "title": "My hair has been incredibly messy and unruly lately, I need some help!!",
      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m really hoping for some help because I’m completely at a loss with my curls right now. I’ve been obsessed with hair care for years and have had lots of ups and downs with it but lately it’s been looking so bad that I genuinely struggle to look in the mirror most days. These photos were taken right after drying.\n\nMy main issues:\n\nThere’s a strange separation between my bangs and the sides that makes it look like I have a receding hairline (seen especially from the side)\n\nThe sides of my hair stick out awkwardly\n\nMy crown/top is very flat\n\nThe back never looks right and feels undefined\n\nMy curls completely fall apart overnight, so I have to wash and style every morning\n\nSleeping in a bonnet actually makes my hair look worse, not better\n\nCurls form into these big coils that just look like worms, especially seen at the picture from the top.\n\nHalf my hair is defined, half is frizzy af\n\nI’ve tried many routines and products over the years and feel like nothing is working anymore.\n\nCurrent Routine!!\n\nShampoo &amp; Conditioner: Bali Curls moisturizing shampoo and Bali Curls conditioner\n\nI shampoo normally, then detangle my hair in the shower with the Bali Curls conditioner using my fingers. I rinse the conditioner out fully. Once a week I use a deep conditioning mask.\n\nStyling:\n\n1.\t⁠I lightly scrunch out excess water and briefly plop to remove dripping water \n\n2.I  apply a pea-sized amount of Bali Curls Curl Cream upside down, raking then scrunching it in, then style a bit with a Denman brush (not that much, i usually don’t have time, i just try to break up the big curls)\n\n3. I plop again\n\n4. I apply a small amount of Bali Curls Volumizing Mousse (also upside down), scrunching it in.\n\nDrying:\n\nI mostly diffuse upside down with a diffuser (a dyson knockoff) farther away from the scalp, then closer as the hair gets dryer.\n\nIf there’s a cast, i put a small amount of bali curls oil in and also scrunch.\n\nDespite all this, my hair ends up flat on top, puffy or awkward on the sides, and strangely separated in the front. I don’t know if this is a technique issue, a product issue, or something else entirely. Any advice especially for fixing crown volume, bang separation, and side shape would be incredibly appreciated. I feel like right now my hair looks so messy that it makes me look like a slob (sorry). Whenever i tell people i spend an hour on my hair everyday they’re like. Really? Nooo.. :(",

      "title": "My new stylist originally said she could make me blonde in a super long appointment and is now backtracking. Should I cancel?",
      "content": "I had an actual haircut and a color consultation with a new stylist in my new town two weekends ago. I showed her this inspo pic (https://imgur.com/a/A4Ap4Vu) and she said she could do it, but that she would want to leave more depth and use the teasylights method instead for lower maintenance at the roots like I wanted. She said it would take four hours and gave me a rate and I agreed and scheduled it for this upcoming Saturday. I recall asking if I would actually look blonde and she said, “Oh yes, it will be drastic.”\n\nOver the course of the past few weeks, I sent a few more inspiration pics and she confirmed she would give me neutral blonde. I said I was fine with more depth than my inspiration pics but I wanted to be blonde, not “bronde” or a brunette with highlights, and I wanted lightness around my face like this pic (https://imgur.com/a/7TSQIAY)\n\nYesterday, she texted me THIS pic (https://imgur.com/a/k6vruiI ) and said, “I hope you’re doing well. I was consulting with my boss regarding your upcoming color appointment, and we both felt that going from your current depth to the level of lightness you’re aiming for in one session could be a bit harsh on the integrity of your hair and unpredictable. I wanted to see if you would be open to considering something like this to start your blonde journey?”\n\nI was alarmed because that is NOT what we agreed on in person or via earlier texts. I responded, “Is that still considered a neutral blonde? Are those still teasylights?” She said, “I would still do the same technique because I love it and the results are amazing, but I would leave more of your natural color behind, see all the depth there. I think it would look great on you”\n\nI said, “What tone would you call that? That doesn’t look blonde to me.” She responded, “\nWe could still lift you lighter than that but I’m talking more about the placement of the blonde vs. being all one color blonde”\n\nI said, “I’m fine with the placement of the blonde but I wouldn’t call that image you sent “blonde” so I’m not sure what result to expect. I’m totally open to dimension and preserving depth, but I don’t want to leave feeling like a “caramel” or just a brunette with highlights…\n\nCan you let me know clearly whether I would read as blonde after this session, and what tone you’d classify it as? Do you have any other images that show how light you believe you can take me?”\n\nThen she sent me this photo (https://imgur.com/a/4GYh1kF) and told me, “This is what I meant but we can “lift you lighter”. It’s just the best way in our opinion to go blonde gradually it preserves the integrity of the hair better and it also gives us more control over the end result. I will call the receptionist and find out how much it will cost now. It should be much less.”\n\nI feel like I’ve been part of a bait and switch. I’m really dejected. Should I cancel my appointment? She originally said it could be done in a very long and expensive session and I was prepared for that. For context, years ago I went to a different salon in a different state, and sat in the chair for several hours and left with platinum blonde hair and my hair was not destroyed. Here’s my natural virgin hair color currently (I grew out all the dye and bleach in. 2024 and now have my natural color again): https://imgur.com/a/QY5Ulur\n\nI’m just not feeling confident in her abilities anymore and I feel like they are trying to stretch me out to two appointments for more revenue. I googled teasylights on brunette hair and would much rather have a result like this:  https://imgur.com/a/zE8JVmt\n",
