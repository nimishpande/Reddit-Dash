It has become a daily challenge to handle them but the compliments I get on them balance the  battle of the curls. \n\nIn highschool I hated my hair and didn’t want to spend the time or money doing it, but as I got older I find the therapeutic to put my time into doing it and getting beautiful results. \n \nRoutine: \nI always use Lavender &amp; Mint shampoo and conditioner tea tree from Paul Mitchell \n1st pic I used:\n-Ouai leave in conditioner\n-cake beauty cream \n-Olaplex No 10 Gel \n\n2nd pic I used\n-Ouai leave in conditioner\n-Not your mothers: all eyes on me cream (a GOOD cheap cream) \n-John Freida mousse \n-Olaplex No 10 gel \n\nI always finish off with ouai body and hair mist &amp; Olaplex oil. Both were diffused with the Shark Glan Diffuser!!\n\n",

      "content": "Hi r/skincareaddiction!\n\nHere's my last [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1codnfd/routine_helpba_recovering_alcoholic_4_month/)from 2 years ago. I immediately followed u/Unfair_Finger5531 and changed the CeraVe PM to Vanicream. Significant improvement after that.\n\nAM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* Cos De BAHA 10% Azelaic Acid\n* Japanese or Korean Sunscreen\n\nPM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer\n* Glenmark Adapalene Gel\n\n\\---I've tried a lot of Asian sunscreens. Biore I really like as a less expensive one. Anessa dried the quickest and most matte. Centella, BoJ, Round Lab all felt the same to me. Really nice light probiotic yogurt smell. Allie was my least favorite. Most of the acne starting to stabilize at this point.---\n\nAM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* The Ordinary Azelaic Acid\n* Japanese or Korean Sunscreen\n\nPM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* SKIN1004 Soothing Cream\n* AcneFree Adapalene Gel\n\n\\---I moved to Ordinary Azelaic Acid after Cos De BAHA and didn't really notice a huge difference with either. The Vanicream was my holy grail for like a year and I randomly picked up the SKIN1004 at Costco because it was on sale. I stocked up and use that a lot now. I also picked up Torriden Dive In Soothing Cream when Costco had it on sale. I like both of these over the Vanicream. I gave up on Azelaic Acid and trying Vitamin C now.---\n\nAM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* Timeless Vitamin C\n* Japanese or Korean Sunscreen\n\nPM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* Torriden Dive In Soothing Cream\n* AcneFree Adapalene Gel\n\n\\---My current sunscreens are Thank You Farmer Green one that I also got from Costco sale and really like for travel because small bottle, but my favorite would be Nivea and Skin Aqua. Both affordable and feels great, but big bottle hard to travel with. I recently switched the Timeless to Good Molecule Discoloration Serum to help get rid of my PIH/PIE.---\n\nI'm really happy with where my skin looks and feels, but always open to recommendations/critiques/feedback/etc. My goal is to get less PIH/PIE. I still get the occasional random white head. I also want everything to look more smooth? I guess part of my alcohol addiction transferred to skincare. Lol.\n\nExtra information:\n\n* I think I'm combination. Oily T zone throughout the day and dry-ish C zone\n* Never thought I had sensitive skin\n* Avoid sun\n* Live in Southern California (dry climate)\n* Change pillowcase every 2-3 days\n* Wash towels and face towels every 2-3 day\n* Plenty of exercise and healthy diet\n* No processed foods, minimal dairy, etc.",

I’ve also tried wrapping my hair in a scarf and that also falls off.\n\nPineappling also flattens my hair, I’ve tried with loose satin scrunchies too within a bonnet and it doesn’t stay. All the bonnets and hair wraps are either too loose or if they’re actually gonna stay on my head I have to tie them so tight that it hurts my head and I can’t sleep. I’m also a restless sleeper.\n\nI feel like my curls will disappear if I just breathe the wrong way, any advice to maintain my hair would be so much appreciated!!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

My skin is very sensitive so I don’t ever use scented soap or laundry detergent or I’ll get a rash.\n\nCurrently I’m washing my face twice a day with cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and the cetaphil gentle clear acne moisturizer which contains salicylic acid. I’ve found that its one of very few brands that don’t make my skin flare up and itch. I clean my sheets regularly and don’t touch my face.\n\nIs there anything else I could add to my routine or change to help? The acne’s better than it used to be but its not great and if anyone has ideas I’d love to hear it!",

      "content": "Hello, \n\n  \nI wonder if anyone else is facing my situation and could offer advice on how to maintain curl definition and hair volume. My hair looks pretty good despite a little bit of frizz after wash day and styling. But, literally the next day and the days after, my hair is more frizzy, curly patterns are less defined/turn wonky, and my roots become straight with less volume. When my hair becomes like this, I'm forced to wear braids, buns, and comb the hair for it look to ook presentable. I've had straight roots and a middle part for a pretty long time and want to fix this. Also, can anyone help me figure out what my curl pattern is?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4y72ohmjldg1.jpg?width=1576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dc6e48cb77dcfd235d9e9b3dcc3d458ca26c58f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mh82ohmjldg1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=516527da3ec3133cfdad6ca1eb4c7c902017a648\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhycpuhmjldg1.jpg?width=1576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ada3b6f2f0af744f6955dc6246025fee46ac3190\n\nFYI: I have silk pillowcases but don't use them often, don't own a bonnet, and am not open to cutting my hair atm. \n\n  \nHere's my current routine: \n\n\\- Wash hair once a week and refresh after 4 or 5 days. \n\n\\- shampoo: Cantu cream cleansing shampoo + Pantene daily moisture renewal (for double shampooing) \n\n\\-conditioner: shea moisture deep conditioner and shea moisture deep moisturizing masque (occasionally) \n\n\\-styling: Marc Anthony strictly curls lotion in prayer hands motion from hair at ears to ends, dippity doo curl-boosting mousse to roots, and the rest on hair with prayer hands application, and Ampro pro-style olive oil gel applying in praying hand motion and scrunching excess into roots. Diffuse hair until 90% dry and then air dry\n\n\\-oils: Garnier Fructis Moroccan sleek smoothing oil, coconut oils, and Mielle strengthening oil",

In recent years, they’ve appeared very lightly on my inner thighs but most importantly… on my buttocks 🫩🙃 (This area is the most affected IMO. It doesn’t hurt nor does it look THAT gross, but it got MUCH more visible out of nowhere). After some months of researching, I can be certain of it being Keratosis Pilaris.\n\nI have zero idea of what products I should use, especially because most forums are US/EU-based and some of the products they recommend are either unavailable in my country or much more expensive. I know it might ironic that I ask on here since (and IN ENGLISH) but I couldn’t find a Mexican forum for skincare only 😅\n\nSo if any of you are from MX/LatAm or know about any product for Keratosis Pilaris I can access to in here it would be of great help!\n\nBy the way— should I use the same products for every part of my body? Or does it depend on the area?",

It is so horribly uneven to my other side of my face it’s making me very insecure and depressed. I do get botox but not often bc of the price. She said if i was able to come back every 6 months we can get it slimmed down. I probably won’t be able to go back in another 6m. She said all the clenching is making the muscle grow bigger\n\nIs there anything besides reducing stress that’s causing my clenching naturally or at home i can do to reverse this ? :( I refuse to even have my photo taken because it is so bad. My dentist said it doesn’t look like i grind my teeth but still offered a night guard so im gonna try that too. But i’ve also heard night guards can cause an over bite..",
