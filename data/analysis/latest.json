      "content": "As the title suggests I need some help understanding starting a skin cycle. I tried looking it up but they speak about days of retinol and then other details that made it confusing for me. So far I've used Peach Slices snail care pack that includes their own: Purifying cleanser, blemish busting toner, intensive serum, intensive wash off jelly mask and all in one oil free moisturizer.\n\nAll of them says that they're usable daily besides the jelly mask one which should only be used 2 - 3x a week. but I'm a bit paranoid i've somehow accidentally done some type of damage to my skin barrier because im starting to notice dry flakes on my forehead (Also fyi i do have some mild acne on the middle of my forehead otherwise my skin is kinda clear with some red pigments on my cheeks like a flushed colour). So I decided to check around what I could do to try to take it easier on my skin to see if it really was damaged or i'm just using some things wrong hence where I got the skin cycle idea from. \n\nBut I wondered if it was possible to make a skin cycle with the products im already using or if y'all could recommend a better (hopefully equally as cheap) product?? Just some guidance on where to start could be nice and if i can still do a cycle with these products I already have would be even greater! I'm still kinda new to how skin care works and didn't really get serious until a few months ago, before that I just used some random exfoliator for men by nivea and then loreal moisturizer for sensitive skin XD (I dont know if i have sensitive skin but better safe than sorry).\n\nAlso if it is of any help the order i usually do the products is: Cleanser, Jelly mask (which i skip on the days i shouldnt do it), Blemish toner, Serum and lastly moisturizer.",

However when I put my head upside down it looks really nice! \n\nI had curly hair when I was a child but when growing up, I used to bleach my hair and cut them really short so there was absolutely no curl pattern. \nI’m in the process of growing my hair long and they always looked curly-ish while wet so I wanted to try this new routine.\n\nWhat do you think? \nShould I keep doing this routine or my hair pattern isn’t worth it? \nAlso why does it look fabulous upside down but terrible in a normal position? Should I get a better haircut with layers? Idk \n\nThanks for your advices!\n",

This has 0.8% BHA.\n\n\nI’ve settled into this routine through trial and error. It seems to be how I can best tolerate using retinal and chemical exfoliation. When I’ve tried to skip the 3rd night - the break - my skin has protested, feeling sensitive and uncomfortable.\n\n\nI would like to get the most efficacy from retinal, and I’m worried that only using it 2 x a week means I’m not getting that. I would ideally like to use it every other night. \n\n\nMy question is, do I listen to my skin, which seems to have settled into the rolling 3 night routine, or do I try and impose a retinal-every-other-night routine on my skin, and hope it becomes accustomed to it? When would be the best time to use the chemical exfoliant? I suppose I could use it a couple of mornings a week? \n\n\nI would be interested to hear your thoughts and experiences. ",

I’m currently about 5 weeks along.\n\nI just realized my husband has been using topical finasteride/minoxidil (HIMS) on his hair a few times a week. Knowing how dangerous finasteride is to fetal development, I’m now freaking out trying to remember if I’ve ever touched his hair directly after or touched something indirectly after he’s touched it? He says he sprayed it in mornings before heading to work and washes hands after (and we then don’t see each other until the end of the day) so that part makes me feel A LITTLE better but I can’t help but spiral, especially since this is a very hard road to get to this pregnancy. Anyone been in my shoes and everything turn out ok? He said he will stop using it from now on but I’m worried about anything from beforehand :( thanks in advance",

      "content": "I’m getting married in 11 days! we’re having something very low key - a register office marriage and a small celebration. Because it’s a smaller wedding, I haven’t given my hair that much thought, but as the day is coming up I was thinking I’d like my hair to look a bit shinier/smoother and less frizzy.\nI know I can’t get perfection in this time period, and I’m fine with that, but I was hoping to use some oils or serum on the day to flatten strays and frizz and generally make it oook a bit more polished. I would really appreciate some recommendations!\nAlso (this may be blasphemy on this subreddit) I am very likely to use heat tools to refine some of my curls on the day.\n\nI would class my hair more wavy than curly (so I hope it’s okay I’m in this sub) - it gets weighed down quite easily, and I think my “curls” lose their shape and become frizz within 24 hours of washing. I have also found that curl cream (cantu) can sometimes hinder my curls rather than help - but mousse (also cantu) is helpful. The first two pics are from this evening- I washed my hair this morning and put in no products afterwards but garnier’s ultimate blends papaya hair food, which I brushed out. My hair was air dried too. I feel that shows my natural texture quite well.\nThe last two pictures show how I plan on putting my hair up - part up, part down. There from the other day when I was trying out my dress and veil :) I had tried some heat styling the day before, which didn’t take too well - or at least didn’t last to the next day - so it’s not my natural or usual hair (but I guess not too different)\n\nRoutine:\nShampoo: I rotate between Noughty Detox Dynamo, Garnier’s curly shampoo, and olaplex (I used Detox Dynamo today)\nConditioner: I use olaplex occasionally, but mostly garnier ultimate blends papaya hair food\nOther products: when necessary I use tresemme’s heat protector spray, sometimes I use Cantu’s curl cream, and sometimes Cantu’s mousse\n",

I was not very happy with the cut because it is giving Christmas tree and I want something rounder (like in the last pic). Any tips on how to achieve the look or close to it? I will also post this in the hair cut subreddits but wanted to try here too. Please remove it not allowed here. My hair is a mix, but mostly 3b/3c.\n\nRoutine: \n- Shampoo - Texture id clarifying shampoo or Aluram curl shampoo\n- Sometimes use conditioner but lots of times just use Mielle Pomegranate line Leave In\n- Design essentials daily hair lotion\n- Lotta Body Mousse\n- xtreme gel\nOften put texture id eucalyptus oil on my scalp because without it my scalp starts to hurt and flake sooner than without the oil\n\nSleep with a bonnet from Sally's and have silk and satin pillowcases.\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "i have a mix of 2a-3b curls and ive been doing my routine on-and-off for years because i am a busy person and i just havent had time to do trial and error as much as id like to. also curly hair products can get pricey! im a college student 😭😭💔💔over time my curls have been more defined and healthy and ive found a routine that works for me for the time being. i dont use curly hair shampoos because when i have in the past its either dried my hair out or had no effect. (i have a lifelong goal to have like knee length hair so i usually go for anti breakage and hydrating shampoos since my hair gets dry easily, right now its at my butt. its also moderately thick but i have layers.) im willing to try a new one, but right now my shampoo/conditioner routine works for me. my hair is very soft and shiny. if these products are actually bad for curls though id like to know!\n\ni use the loreal dream lengths shampoo twice on my scalp every 2-4 days, rarely 3 times because i like to oil my hair 1-2x a week. i then use a hair mask then a little conditioner on my ends if i plan on using heat or not styling my hair in general. if i plan on doing my curl routine i usually dont use any conditioner or very little. \n\ni noticed that if i do my hair routine in the shower when my hair is still freshly soaked it comes out better. so ill flip my hair over, brush it, and then apply the not your mother’s curl talk gel and scrunch it in, then the miss jessies jelly soft curls and scrunch it in, and repeat this 2-3x. I KNOW THIS IS CRAZY but its literally the only thing that makes my curls not go flat in two seconds. \n\nit works for me but i definitely dont think this is ideal. i then plop in a towel for like 10-15 minutes, and i diffuse upside down. \nthis is where the issue comes. the top of my hair looks GREAT. my curls are defined, frizzless, theres a nice cast, the roots look great and theres no awkward perfectly straight part. the bottom looks okay, not as defined as it was when i used to brush style, but within 10 minutes it becomes dry and frizzy and TANGLES like no other. like i think ive had some light matting before\n\nnot to mention my curls just dont stay overnight, the pineapple ruins them. and the bonnet ends up on the other side of the room when i wear it. idk i know my routine sucks but the top looks so good so it feels worth it to me? i have a lot more curls on the bottom half though so im really sad that it doesnt look good. i can get dry frizz but its not as much an issue as before. please give advice 😭🥹\n\nin the past ive also used the shea moisture curl cream, it weighed my hair down like crazy but it made my curls look amazing! i used to brush style my hair (like the wrapping it around the handle technique) with like a knockoff denman brush and it made my curls look amazing and defined but extremely flat and the roots never stayed curled, when i do the upside down technique my roots curl. ive used other creams like the not your mothers curl talk curl cream and i didnt particularly like it, ive used maui moisture mousse i believe and it made my hair unbelievably sticky and stringy. \n\nthank you!!!!!!!!!!!",

      "content": "First collage: (before cg routine) this is my hair air dried without touching it or adding any products after completely rinsing out a clarifying wash (v05) and conditioner (also v05). No products. \n\nSecond collage: (after one month of beginner cg routine) this is my hair after the following routine- v05 cowash, v05 condition about 90% washed out, eco style olive oil gel scrunched in very wet hair, plopped for maybe 20 minutes with cotton shirt, SOTC after hair completely dry\n\nSo after one month of this I’m still unsure of my hair specifics! If I had to guess, I would say I have high porosity. My hair isn’t dyed and I haven’t used any heat on it but it still just has kind of a damaged, dry feel. My hair almost never gets greasy. It does get wet and dry moderately quickly. And I have a lot of frizz! \n\nI would guess most of my damage is mechanical because I wear my hair up so much. I just can’t get it to look right down no matter how much I try! I do have a LOT of fallout and maybe it’s genetic but my hair, especially in the front around my face, just doesn’t seem to grow past a certain point. I did recently cut a few inches off the ends so these pictures are after that. \n\nIt seems like I may fall more into the wavy camp but I’m hoping maybe someone here has suggestions of what to add or subtract to my routine that might help with frizz and random straighter bits? Also any insight into narrowing down my hair type would be much appreciated. Several years ago a hair stylist did tell me that I had course hair but there wasn’t a lot of it, so course low density maybe? The texture and density seem more medium to me when testing using suggestion in the wiki. ",

      "content": "I have wavy-curly hair thats very prone to frizz/ fine flyaways. Following washing, it usually looks okay but after sleeping or a few days, its bushy . I’m pretty sure its not dryness causing the ‘messy’ look.  I can refresh and products help, but I’m extremely low maintenance (lazy) and I tend to throw it in a messy bun. Before I was content just looking nice sometimes in public 😭 but after moving in withh my boyfriend, I want to look presentable constitently. I’ve always airdried my hair and combed it in the shower and ask for simple long hair cuts. Wondering if anyone with a similar problem would recommend:\n\nA. Cezanne/ cysteine smoothing hair treatment (~$300-350)\nB. Shark Flexstyle ($250)\nC. A babyliss or other hairdryer with a brush ?($100-$200?)\nD. Or any other “high maintenance to be low maintenance”. \n\nI have tried lots of different routines of products but it seems like diffusing is really important for results, but I dont really want high volume curls, I just want low effort smooth hair and to be comfortable wearing my hair down. Also, I definitely wont diffuse everyday, and dont trust myself to do it after every shower. But wondering whether keratin or smoothing treatment is worth the high price tag. Also would take haircut tips!\n\n(Hair picture isnt on one of my worst days, more to show hair type but the hair that was tied back is usually frizzier. Like the front easily gets poofy/bushy and triangular, which is why im scared to do faceframing layers) :/\n\n\n",
