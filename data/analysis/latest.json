      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Now, it’s gone completely, and I’m not sure if I can ever get back to normal skin without spots or acne.\n\nI’m hoping to find some advice or suggestions from people on this forum. I’ve been using Aziderm 20% cream for the last two or three weeks, but it’s made my skin a bit dry. I’ve also been using Acne Star face wash with Bioderma Moisturiser, but that hasn’t helped either.\n\n(Also, does eating fried foods (junk food, chips, Coke) affect this? If so, I’ll stop eating them right now.)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I'm 27, male. I don’t have active acne, but my skin definitely doesn’t look healthy and I want to give as much detail as possible about my face.\n\n* Noticeable redness around my cheeks and a few small marks that look like healed pimples.\n* Old acne scars  some small pits or uneven spots on both cheeks.\n* Overall uneven tone and skin texture, and visible pores, especially around the cheek and nose area.\n* A few brownish dark spots or slight discolorations from old breakouts.\n\nI’m not sure what kind of skincare routine. I currently don’t have any, so I’m open to starting from scratch. I’d say my skin is not very sensitive, but I’m not sure how strong it is either. I think I have an oily center face (nose, chin and inner cheeks) while the outer face is kind of dry (sides of cheeks and neck).\n\nI did a bit of basic research and made the list below, but as I said I don’t know much and I’m open to all suggestions. I would really appreciate specific product recommendations since I’m not familiar with the market.\n\nWhen Wake Up:\n\n* Cleanser\n* Niacinamide Serum or Hyaluronic Acid ?\n* Moisturiser\n* Sunscreen\n\nBefore Bed:\n\n* Cleanser\n* Azelaic Acid or BHA or Retinoid-based stuff ?\n\nAbout tret/retinoid products: I did basic research and found it might be better to start with non-prescription options first so I don’t harm my skin. I’m thinking of trying Avène Cleanance Comedomed Peeling Intensiv Anti-Pickel Akutpflege.\n\nI live in Germany and I can buy via online. Also I’m open to prescription medication, but I don’t want professional dermatologist procedures like laser treatments or needles. What would you recommend to me?\n\nThanks a lot in advance for your help!",

      "content": "The other day I had a horrible breakout that attacked my entire face. I often get cysts and in recent years I've suddenly been getting these really painful clusters of white heads, when I pick them more white heads immediately just keep popping back up.\n\nMy entire jaw line was full of these combinations of painful pimples. One area I ripped the skin and started to scab. I was using hydrogen peroxide to try to \"clean up\" the affected areas, not realizing how bad that was. Then, my dumb a** was googling trying to find solutions to heal, so I came across the medicated hydrocolloid bandages. Well, after slapping those all over my face and waiting a few hours. I noticed the bandages were so moist and full of puss I decided to take them off.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I tried removing the one on my jawline with the scab and it ended up taking pretty much a layer of my skin and the scab off leaving a hole in my face. The others also turned into bigger wounds.\n\nI went to the walk in and was prescribed clindamycin/tretinoin - Biacna Gel. Now here is where I need advice, this area has only slightly started to dry up and still has active puss/pimples in some areas. The spot in my chin is still raw and full of whiteheads. Am I safe to apply the gel to these areas or should I wait? Is there anything else I can do for pain relief and healing?  If anyone out there has more advice for me or suggestions on products I should use after to help repair my skin barrier would also be greatly appreciated.\n\nI've attached pictures of right after, from yesterday and another of how my skin looks today after only washing my face with hot water as I was told not to use anything else. \n",

I would love some advice on how to make it more consistently lean into the more wrapped/defined curls.\n\nI believe I have medium porosity hair, as water does bead up some when first getting it wet. Takes a good couple minutes to get it fully soaked. Here are the products / routine I am using currently.\n\nI am washing my hair every 3-4 days depending on what’s going on/ how it’s looking.\n\nStep 1- Get in the shower, soak my hair and use a light detangling spray. Currently using the Marc Anthony Grow Long spray. Brush out my hair completely with a denman type wet brush.\n\nStep 2- Shampoo and condition hair. I was using the Kristin Ess curly S &amp; C, but recently just switched to Rizos Curl Biotin S&amp;C\n\nStep 3- Still in the shower, apply Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Cury Envy Cream. Brush through my hair, and then while under the water scrunch my hair with a bit more cream in my hands.\n\nStep 4- Get out of the shower, get dressed, and scrunch some of the excess water out of my hair with a micro fiber towel.\n\nStep 5- Prayer hands apply Cantù Wave Whip Curling Mousse. Scrunch in if needed but usually try to avoid that.\n\nI do not do any diffusing / drying of my hair, which I know I’ll get some flack about. But I’m a working mom of 2 and never have the time to do it given how thick my hair is.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions on what I could do differently without adding a ton of extra time to my routine that would be amazing. Open to product recommendations or answering questions to help determine what I should do.",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I recently had my graduation, and since it was a special day, I decided to get my makeup done professionally… and honestly, it was awful. My brows were super square, the base didn’t look good, and I was already running late, so I just had to go as I was. The photos were such a disappointment, and instead of feeling confident, I felt uncomfortable the whole time.\n\nBecause of that experience, I’ve decided I want to learn to do my own makeup. I’ve always wanted to, but I never really learned. In my whole life, I’ve worn makeup maybe 5 times: 4 were done by my sister (she’s no longer with us, so it hurts that I never got to learn from her), and the 1 time I paid for it… which was this time, and it went terribly.\n\nI’m a very simple/natural person. I just want to learn how to enhance myself a little for special occasions—natural skin, decent brows, soft makeup, nothing heavy.\n\nSo I wanted to ask:\n\nWhere should a complete beginner start?\n\nWhat are the basic products I should buy?\n\nAny simple beginner-friendly techniques for natural makeup?\n\nDo you recommend any channels, tutorials, or creators for soft/natural looks?\n\nAnything you wish you had known when you first started?\n\n\nThank you so much for any advice. ❤️",

      "content": "Epiduo forte &amp; cystic Acne\n\nHi there! So I (22M) have had on and off issues with my skin. I started epiduo forte about 2 years ago and my skin really cleared up. Then my script expired and I broke out .. got another script (have a repeat now) and the purge was brutal but a few months later I was really happy with my skin.\n Then in about August (after a few months of good skin) I noticed slightly more breakouts but just attributed it to my more intense gym training schedule and diet (consumed more protein and whey) and also stress from a new job. Whatever.. skin wasn’t too bad but now since October it’s gotten a lot worse and I’ve noticed deeper cysts and don’t know the cause.  \nI have stopped whey protein and eat pretty clean and drink water. I’ve incorporated more sunblock (trader joes) because I am in the southern hemisphere and the weather and UV have gotten more harsh. \nMy skin gets quite oily in the T-zone and I wash with a gentle cleanser in the morning and night. I’m on a CeraVe moisturizer too that I apply after washing and I use epiduo forte every night before I moisturize. \nThe acne is mainly on my temple and side of forehead and then it’s also sparsely on my chin and cheeks. I try keep my hair out of my face but move around when I sleep so maybe my hair being in my face could contribute?\nI’m really desperate and don’t know what to do.. I would really like to avoid taking accutane because of some side affects but also I’ve persevered for so long that I’ll feel a bit defeated if I do.. \n\nAny suggestions/help would really be greatly appreciated.

I also clarify and deep condition every other week.\n\nAbout 1-2months ago the results I was getting from the Uncle Funkys Curl Magic started to change. Typically this product gives me a lot of slip and big juicy curl clumps in the shower. More recently, when I apply this product I experience what I think is flash drying— instead of big juicy curl clumps and lots of seaweed-y slip, it’s like a bunch of moisture is instantly sucked out and my curl clumps are very small and stringy. I added the leave in to see if that would help, but nope. I’m still able to get a decent result by layering Eco gel and brush styling, but it’s not ideal.\n\nIdk if it’s happening because of the weather change? (I’m in the mid Atlantic US), or just with prolonged use? It’s happened with other products before but I can’t remember if it coincided with seasons changing. Anyone experience this or have any insight?",
