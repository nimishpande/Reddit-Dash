      "content": "Hello! I have a few questions about my skin care. So for years I have used Cerave face wash and the last time I bought it I got the oil to normal skin instead of the normal to dry skin one and didn’t switch it out because it truly felt no different and that has probably stripped my face of any natural oils. So after my shower day or night my routine consist of adding my caffeine serum to my under eyes, lactic acid  hyaluronic acid and Cereva SPF 50 moisturizing cream and I do not wear any type of makeup except mascara.\n\nI just found out last week that lactic acid should only be used maybe twice a week and only at night as it harms skin in the sun and for 2 months I’ve been using it every day and going out in the sun so I’m guess that has messed me up BAD.\n\nLast week I was doing my skin routine and my skin started to sting so bad and now I know it’s because of the lactic acid. I have sense stopped everything except hyaluronic acid because of the moisture and SPF moisturizer in the morning. My friend recommend La Roche Posay in the oil cleanser (yellow) and extra hydration water cleanser (white) to double cleanse as it’s “hydrating”. After that she told me to put on my hyaluronic acid and SPF moisturizer (SPF in the morning if I shower at night). Turns out the “oil cleanser”’is still water based and after I tried them in a double cleanse my face burned so bad and left my skin burning, irritated, red and so beyond dry. I’m guessing it stripped my skin even more. About a hour ago I tried them separate on the 2 sides of my face and only the water base  (white) burned just a tad. My entire face is still irritated and beyond dry but not even close to what it was a few nights ago. I’m guessing my skin barrier is JACKED from using lactic acid every day for 2 months and going in the sun, using cleanser for normal to oily skin when I needed cleanser for dry skin and double cleansing everything I had left away. I have done so much research last few days on products and routines and l am truly overwhelmed with it all as it’s all different. I was given terrible advice with so many things that I should have done more research on and now I’m paying for it. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on ANYTHING when it comes to products, what’s happening to my skin or anything else I should know?\n\nI’m asking that you please be nice as I am already kicking myself for my lack of care and research, little to no understanding, and not asking questions sooner.\n\nThank you. ❤️",

      "content": "I don’t really know what I’m looking for here. I just need to vent and put this out there because I’ve been carrying it for a long time.\n\nI started losing my hair in my early 20s. Even back then my scalp would get insanely itchy, to the point where I couldn’t sleep. In 2022 I finally started finasteride, hoping it would at least slow things down. I stayed on it for about a year and didn’t see any regrowth or noticeable stabilization.\n\nAfter that I added topical minoxidil. I keep my head shaved all the time, so I can’t really track shedding the way most people do. I’m not counting hairs in the sink. But when your head is shaved, you can clearly tell when you’re losing baseline, and that’s exactly what was happening.\n\nAfter about six or seven months on topical min, I stopped because it felt like I was only losing ground and hoping maybe it was just a shed that would recover. It never did.\n\nThat’s when I added dutasteride and oral minoxidil. I didn’t quit fin right away. For a few months I took both fin and dut, then switched to daily dut once I ran out of fin. That’s when things really started getting worse. People kept telling me it was just a shed, but shaved head or not, I knew I was losing ground.\n\nWhile on dut, I started getting this burning or itching sensation on my scalp. Some people call it DHT itch. What really messed with my head was how consistent it felt. The itch would start in areas that still had hair, and two or three weeks later that exact area would basically become where my hairline ended. That pattern repeated itself and didn’t feel random.\n\nI stayed on dut for about six months and then switched back to fin because it felt like dut was destroying whatever I had left. I’m still on fin and oral min now. The itch isn’t as intense as it was on dut, but it never fully went away. Whenever it comes back, it feels like a warning sign that I’m still losing hair.\n\nWhat really gets to me is that I’ve never recovered from any shed. Not once. Hair just fell out and never came back. I’ve had blood work done and everything came back normal.\n\nAt this point I honestly don’t know what to believe anymore. Sometimes it genuinely feels like this whole fin and min thing is just one long pipeline. You’re told to get on the meds early, then when things don’t work or stop working, you’re told to add more meds, increase doses, switch drugs, wait longer, trust the process. And when people finally lose hope, the next answer always seems to be a hair transplant, with the reminder that you’ll still need to stay on meds forever anyway.\n\nI’m not saying these drugs are a lie or that they don’t help anyone. Clearly they help a lot of people. But when you’re someone who keeps losing ground no matter what you do, it’s hard not to question the whole system and wonder if some of us are just stuck chasing something that was never going to work for us.\n\nI guess I just want to know if anyone else has felt this way or gone through something similar, especially people who never recovered from sheds or who had scalp burning or itching that seemed to line up with their hair loss.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

The first few photos of the darker hair is my hair today/recent between trying to figure out how to style it niceley, and the brighter blonde is 1 year ago when i didnt do much to it.\n\nIm gonna likley overexplain everything i know.\n\nMy routine i used for the first few photos was brushing my hair in the shower then scrunching the conditioner with water, then added Not Your Mothers definition cream and gel, then i went in 3 sections and (very badly and unsure i did it right) finger curled my entire head, i didnt know how to add volume whatsoever so i just used a claw clip then let it air dry then difused to break the gel cast and used ogx nourishing coconut milk anti breaking oil and a tiny pea drop of gisou oil on my hair.\n\nMy routine in my brighter blonde photo, i dont remember my routine but i know i used a bunch of gisou, and i did my curly hair routine every day (before i knew how to preserve curls) i think i used truesemme bouncy curl mousse, garnier curl sculpting cream, ganier gel, and garnier leave in conditioner (...?)\n\nProducts i used for my daily routine right now are not your mothers  (NYM for short) leave in, NYM curl defining cream, NYM curl mousse, NYM gel, and ogx coconut milk anti breaking serum oil, and sometimes next of us curl reactivating mist\n\nI really dont know if i have 2b hair or. 3a hair, i think its around that range though? my hair is thin and is damaged a bit from hair coloring and heat damage. i dont even know what purosity means, i dont know if my hair needs moisture. im clueless. I am at this point begging for help, my hair has been my biggest insecurity latley and ive tried so many routines and im not finding any help and its stressing me out so so so much.   \n  \nI dont know what i want my hair to look like, kinda like how it was last year with its shine, but maybe more definition? I dont know. I dont know anything about curls still and i keep comparing my hair to other peoples and its been making me struggle and getting extremely frustrated with my hair.

      "content": "Hi everyone! Skincare noob here. I have a few questions related to my new skincare journey. \n\n1. Fellow glasses wearers how do you make sure you have all the product washed off your face when cleansing.\n\n2. How do you keep from getting the whole sink + yourself wet when rinsing cleansers.\n\nI put a towel down on the counter in front of the sink but I still get water running down my arms and neck. I am looking at those wrist bands but if there is something else I can be doing in the interim that would be great. I also feel like it ties into question one because I might be overdoing it with the water to make sure I really get off everything because I can’t see. \n\n3. Going to be traveling in a few weeks. First time traveling with a skincare routine. I also only travel carry on so everything has to be under 100mls. \n\nI use the Skin1004 Centella ampoule and the Round Lab birch cleanser which are both under the size limit but I also use the Haruharu Wonder black rice cleansing oil and the Round Lab Dokdo cleanser which are both over the limit. \n\nSo my questions are 1. What do I do with my cleansers. I’ve heard people talk about the cotton round hack so if people have tried it I’d love to know how it works. 2. How to safely travel with the Centella glass ampoule. Since it is glass and all. I have the 55ml one. \n\n4.Last question. Currently using the Neutragina ultra sheer dry touch sunscreen. I’ve been using it for years. I’m looking at getting into the Skin1004 Centella water sunscreen but \n\nI’m waiting for it to come back in stock on the website I use. So in the meantime is it ok to continue using the Neutragina one to use it up or is it going to totally screw up my new routine. \n\nI’m like six days into my first ever routine and leave on the 19th so I’ll still be pretty new with it and don’t want to ruin things right off the bat. \n\nThank you so much in advance for all the help and advice! I really appreciate it!",

I need advice because everything I read online seems to say different things.\n\nfor some context, i am a 22 year old girl and I have fairly moderate to dry skin with occasional breakouts on my forehead and chin. I also get these weird little flesh colored bumps sometimes on my forehead and sometimes on my upper cheeks…might be fungal acne? Not sure. Anyway, recently I’ve been having more breakouts because I quit curology (my skin had become resistant to it) and I need to find a cure.\n\nmy routine:\n\nright now I use a gentle CeraVe cleanser, Paula’s Choice 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel, and Clinique gel moisturizer. I was researching and apparently benzoyl peroxide is pretty good for breakouts. I’ve been on this exact routine for about 2 1/2 months and I’ve noticed slight improvements. I also sometimes incorporate an anti-dandruff shampoo into my routine for what I assume is fungal acne because I heard it can help. I use it as a face wash on affected areas. I do this routine once every evening.\n\nmy concerns:\n\nwhile my skin definitely has started to clear up, I still have red spots on my forehead and chin from where my acne was. Additionally, I’m just not happy with the overall look of my skin…it’s not smooth and even. I’m wondering if I should find an exfoliator to use in order to decrease the occurrence of redness and acne “scars”. I’m also worried I might get more breakouts as I just developed a pimple on my cheek and I never get pimples there!\n\nnote:\n\nalso I would like to keep this routine as minimal as possible. I’m not trying to be high maintenance with like a 10 step routine. I just don’t have the time of money. But simple steps to improve or overall advice would be great. I just feel too old to still be having skin problems and I want them gone.\n\nthank you for reading this! please help a girl out",

This is right after washing my hair, drying it, and straightening it. I have tried every trick to style curtain bangs I have found online, but if I apply a lot of heat to them, they literally just stand up and shoot straight out.

However, as soon as it fully dries, my hair gets all poofy and frizzy.\n\nI don’t particularly care about volume, if anything I want less of it haha. I just want my hair to fall almost straight down, and for the waves to be either defined or flattened. And also no hold! I don’t want it to be crunchy either. \n\nSo if there are any products that can make my hair act like it’s kinda wet the whole day, I’d appreciate recommendations :)\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR :\\*\\* Any products that will weigh my hair DOWN and define my waves (like when it’s half wet), but without crunchiness or “hold”?",
