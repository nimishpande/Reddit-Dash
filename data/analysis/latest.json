It's clear that everyone has great skin on the figure skating segment. I've seen the GRWM videos of other Olympic athletes and know they dabble in procedures just like everyone else like Simone Biles talking about doing botox and microneedling.\n\nBut Cha Jun-hwan's skin was better than anything I've ever seen by miles and I have no words how to explain it. It wasn't just great like everyone else's skin, it was like out of this world. I always thought pictures of famous Korean people were heavily filtered and that's why their skin looks better than great because that's what some people were saying on the internet. But seeing this guy unfiltered really broke that myth for me. It's real.\n\nIt can't be just the usual stuff like tret/sunscreen/accutane/lasers/microneedling/botox that everyone does, I do those already. Does anyone know what he could be doing that take skin from great to out of this world silken tofu glassy glow?",

Um yeah anyways, you can see that the ends wave and curl. This is no styling, just how my layers dry.  For some reason the 'curl' pattern (I use that term loosely lol) doesn't start till around my chin, everything above is fluffy at best, but lately has been getting heavy and flat since I need a trim. I like my choppy hair cuts, helps it stay light and fluffy.  I used to have straighter hair, that maybe got a tiny curl when it was humid out, but nothing consistent, but yknow you get older and hormones change and weird stuff.    \n  \nAny recommendations on small things to add to my routine? or easy to come by products? right now its just some scrunching while its damp and trying to give my ends extra conditioner.... sometimes I'll put some texturing spray if I remember. \n\nHonestly tho, I'm a relatively broke college student so I'm not dishing out too much money on hair products. But simple advice would be appreciated :\\] ",

I have since then prescribed it to friends and family when suitable and achieved amazing results. Friends of friends have found out about it and asked for treatment too. The drugs are quite cheap in my country. My consultation fee is at the average lowest. And the hair/dermatologic market space is saturated of expensive treatments that just milk money from patients with zero to minimal effect. Its just that people are not well informed on fin/min.\n\nI would like to reach more people and help them regain the hair they love.\n\nI am not sure how to proceed, since I currently have almost no advertising of this treatment. Also, the drugs can simply be prescribed by any other doctor too. How should I go about this when marketing? I am not sure how to proceed.\n\nHow did you find out about it?

I had been straightening it for about 7-8 years and only a few months ago decided that i want to go natural. I practically shaved my head off and now only have 2-3 inches of growth.\n\nI live in Japan so its a bit harder to get products for curly hair. I think i have a good routine but i still have no idea what im doing. Whenever i look up videos to help they are all of girls with long curls and i cant do the stuff that they do yet.\n\nBecause of this I often leave the house with a lot of frizz, at first i was just so happy to finally have my natural hair I thought my frizz was cute and natural but many of my friends or people say stuff like\n\n“define it!”\n\n“It looks goofy when its frizzy-“\n\n“you dont know how to take care of your hair do you?”\n\n“You should use gels.”\n\nAnd because im a beginner i dont wanna just ignore them but they all have straight hair with little to no experience with hair like mine and often times it just feels like criticism without actual advice. It makes me irrationably angry sometimes.\n\nIve seen many people talk about frizz and i know that its normal and i see posts with girls with long curly hair with comments like\n\n“Love the normalization of frizz!”\n\nBut my hair isnt long. Its really short. I dont know if im allowed to have frizz.\n\nThis isnt a post asking for advice to get rid of frizz i just wanna know if you guys deal with this too. Do people often comment about your hair? Try to subtly touch your hair? Try to tell you how to fix it when you didnt even ask? Am i going to have to get used to these things?\n\nOf course any tips on taking care of hair is MORE than welcome too tho!\n\nMy routine..(if you can even call it a routine) 3b-3c\n\n1. Wash twice (dove shampoo intense repair)\n2. Rake Leave in through curls. (African pride olive miracle from amazon)\n3. Rake coil sculpting custard and finger curls some parts of the head (Mielle pomegranate and honey custard)\n4. Put bonnet on and sleep\n5. Wake up and shake my head a bit to loosen curls.\n\nPLEASE help. Anything. Tips on haircare, how to deal with people touching, if frizz is unhealthy, funny stories with your curls, im just so lost right now.",

      "content": "My main concern are the enlarged pores and that weird bag that froms a wrinkle under my eye; it used to only be on that side, now i have another slight one at the same height on the other side of my face but this one is much more prominent and noticeable. They're like festoons but not that voluminous, mostly just looks like a deep wrinkle, and i don't understand why is it so noticeable in one side but not the other. Wondering whether microneedling could be of help with this or not??\n\nI'm also worried about my skin looking so droopy and having fine lines at 20, is that normal? or is it just dehydration? \nI confess I don't moisturize that often, because I've always had a very oily skin, that makes it prone to acne (specially the small whitehead pimple kind), clogged pores and blackheads. But since I use a SA cleanser for that (Cerave), I usually do apply some hydrating cream every morning. Even when I don't, my skin soon gets somewhat oily by itself. \nBesides from that, there's not much I do for skincare. I use glycolic acid occasionally for the blackheads and pores, i think it helped to reduce the size of the blackheads overtime but my pores are still very clogged and big.\n\nI'm fairly lost here so any guidance, advice or honest opinions are very much appreciated 🙏",

      "content": "Hello everyone, I’ve been trying to figure out what is happening to my face but decided that reddit is my best option. I’ll attach some unflattering pictures of myself in the name of solving my issues.\n\nI’ll start with some details about myself:\n\n\\- 26F\n\n\\- combination/dry very sensitive skin\n\n\\- don’t suffer from any known facial skin problems, I do have psoriasis but it’s only ever shown on my hands and elbows\n\n\\- on birth control (not sure this is relevant but why not)\n\n\\- never really suffered from acne, if i do get spots it will be one big mean one in the middle of my forehead or something\n\n\\- I live in the UK - in case anyone wants to recommend products\n\nA few months ago, lets say end Oct-Nov, I realised my skin is getting really dull and lifeless, I never really had a skin care routine apart from the occasional azelaic acid 10% when i had some redness, cicaplast baume B5 (cream or gel version) again when needed, moisturiser the ordinary natural factors+HA, and sunscreen (BOJ or Caudelie stick) when spring/summer starts since I live in Wales and the autumn/winter months i don’t actually see the sun since I leave for work in the early hours when it’s dark and leave work late afternoon also dark\n\nSo, I decided it was time to put a skincare routine together to brighten my face up a bit. Here is what I do:\n\nMorning\n\nNo face wash\n\nSKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n\nAveeno Calm + Restore gel moisturiser (I changed from the ordinary one because I started seeing some breakouts from it even tho I’ve been using it for years, and I felt I needed a heavier moisturiser as my skin felt much drier)\n\nEvening\n\nRound Lab 1025 Dokdo Cleanser\n\nPurito Wonder Releaf Centella Serum Unscented\n\nAveeno Calm + Restore gel moisturiser\n\nI am very aware it’s extremely simple but I don’t understand what could be causing this reaction on my skin. I have stopped using azelaic acid because I started thinking maybe my skin is too sensitive for it\n\nMy current issues that show up at least once a week for the past 2 months:\n\n\\- red and irritated on my forehead\n\n\\- itchy\n\n\\- bumps and spots that are not whiteheads, they are never to be popped (minus the one you see on my lip, those happen every so often, and I wax my upper lip)\n\n\\- mostly around my forehead and between my brows, and my chin a lot too\n\nI had an incident just before christmas where I had a hot bath and then as I came out of the bath and dried off, i thought it was a good idea to put moisturiser on straight after and I probably gave myself heat irritation because my skin looked horrendously inflamed so i stopped using any products for a few days and that was fine\n\nI tried using the LRP Cicaplast gel and the cream a couple weeks ago because my skin looked a bit irritated again and those made it worse so I stopped using those entirely, it became red and looked like in the pictures.\n\nI was considering to introduce a retinol in my routine  once a week, then progressively increase the frequency and wanted to start either with the CeraVe retinol serum or the The Inkey List Starter Retinol, but open to other suggestions for those too (more budget friendly if possible)\n\nPlease help me understand what is going on and if you can recommend some gentle products.\n\nHope this is enough information but happy to answer questions if needed!!\n\nThank you Reddit 🫶🏼",

I'm from the Philippines so some products may be limited in availability to me.\n\nCurrently, my products include the Mise en Scene Perfect Serum Styling Shampoo &amp; Treatment, Selsun Blue Extra Moisturizing Shampoo (I only use this once or twice a week), Mise en Scene Perfect Serum Super Rich and Curls by Zenutrients Leave-in Conditioner.\n\nI usually wet my hair first and wash my scalp with either Mise en Scene Styling Shampoo or Selsun Blue (depends if my hair has some flakes in it) then I rinse it off and use the Styling Conditioner on my ends. After rinsing the conditioner off, I use 1-2 pumps of the Super Rich serum and then use the Leave-in Conditioner on my ends and scrunch them. I then leave it to air-dry or either just clip it up.\n\nI usually protect my hair while sleeping by wearing a silk bonnet but other than that everything I've mentioned above is all I do to my hair currently.\n\nCan you guys help me with a routine, the right products and what method I can do to fully bring my curls out?

Not only did they send me a new moisturizer but they are having me send the back the off formula so they can look into what went wrong. Their customer service is truly amazing. Most of the time companies just tell you to return the product to the  retailer and leave it at that. \n\nI have swatched the formula of moisturizer I'm used to getting (have purchased several bottles from CVS and Walgreens), the newest bottle they sent me, and the formula from wallgreens that was off. I attached the batch codes as well if anyone wants to compare to their formulation that may be off. \n\nIf anyone is unfamiliar with the issue I had or just needs a refresher the formula of 7878B was much thicker than normal. I also found it was not sinking in to the skin like it should. I found it sat on top and while my skin remained tight, dry, and slightly itchy. \n\nI've only used the bottle they sent me once. I will say that I feel this formula is somewhere between the 7658B and 7878B. It does feel like it's sinking in okay! My skin is a bit dehydrated right now as I'm been neglecting my skincare a bit since this all happened as 7878B was breaking me out and I don't have any other moisturizer I can use. I will post more updates on if this newest bottle is breaking me and if the company says anything back to me. \n\nI hope this helps anyone having the same issue. If you are please contact the company as they are extremely helpful! ",

I’m still a beginner though and definitely open to advice.\n\nHair type: 3C, fine strands, high density, high porosity, on the drier side.\n\nSchedule:  \n1 wash day per week  \n1 refresh per week  \nSilk bonnet at night\n\nWash day:  \nClarifying shampoo: Curlsmith Curl Reset Detox Shampoo  \nShampoo: Curlsmith Core Strength Shampoo  \nConditioner: Curlsmith Multi-Tasking Conditioner  \nLeave-in: Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream  \nGel: Curlsmith In-Shower Style Fixer  \nSealing oil: Curlsmith Bonding Oil\n\nI clarify when I feel buildup. I leave the conditioner on for 15 to 30 minutes and detangle with it in. I apply the leave-in on very wet hair, then a good amount of gel, and diffuse. Once fully dry, I scrunch out the cast with the oil.\n\nRefresh:  \nWater spray  \nA bit of leave-in  \nSometimes a little gel if needed  \nDiffuse\n\nI’m happy with the volume and definition, but I feel like I can still improve curl clumping and dryness management. Any feedback or optimization tips are welcome.",

I'm here after having grown it out for an entire year, and I still have more growing out to do - the lower parts of my hair are still bleached from the permanent hair dye that washed off.\n\nWhat I want to do is use the fact that I have an ashy color to begin with (to be fair, that depends a lot on the light), and to do something to bend it more towards grey. Not silver, not light grey, just the medium-dark grey that would result from my natural hair if I cancelled out the yellow/orange in it.\n\nI'm thinking blue shampoo? Would this work? And if so, can you recommend me any products that would work well on natural hair? If not blue shampoo, then is there anything else you would recommend? The lady at the haircare store tried to sell me Milkshake Icy Blonde today, but looking online I'm understanding that this is a purple shampoo and that it won't work well? I've seen some TikToks with it and it didn't seem very impressive.\n\nI don't want to bleach it and I don't want to use anymore permanent hair dye on it. Even if it doesn't come out perfectly grey and just ends up a less saturated version of my haircolor, that's still ok...\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Long story short: I (22M) have low to moderate acne on my face+upper back. The derm prescribed benzoyl peroxide 4% wash and Aklief (and moisturiser). But he also said not to use BPO wash on the whole face, and just try it on the cheeks (because according to him my skin is dry; it is also very oily). But I also get some bigger pimples/pustules on my temples/forehead occasionally (especially since I started using Aklief). So I thought I‘d use some 5% Benzac BPO for these spots only, maybe every day or every second day. Right now I am only starting with Aklief and am using it every 4th day but after a few weeks I should ramp it up to every day.\n\nNow the question is: is it a good idea or not? Have you tried using Aklief with BPO? Did it irritate/damage your skin? Is it maybe better to leave BPO on there for a few minutes/hour and wash it off?\n\nIt’s my first real treatment so I‘d be glad if someone could help me get some answers or their own routine.\n\nThanks!",

After washing my face, I apply Benzac AC 2% only on the bigger pimples.\n\n\nIn the first week, I didn’t see any changes, which I expected.\n\n\nIn the second week, I started getting whiteheads in the morning. By nighttime, they would become almost twice the size and sometimes burst even if I touched them gently. I thought it might be purging, so I continued using the product.\n\n\n\nNow in the third week (and still ongoing), I’m getting at least two new whiteheads every morning, sometimes in unusual places like under my moustache or areas where I normally don’t get acne. I’m also getting painful, big, under-the-skin pimples that aren’t visible at first but hurt a lot.\n\n\nIs this normal purging, or is the product not working for me? Should I continue using it or change something in my routine?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated.",

Wait awhile (the longer the better) and diffuse. Once mostly dry, scrunch out cast. Style with hair spray if needed. On refresh days: spray with a little bit of water, diffuse, then style with hairspray (and shea butter on bad days) as needed. ",

Sharing my Jan &amp; Feb empties.\n\nSkin type: Acne-prone combination\n\nSeason: Winter (my skin becomes dry)\n\nDuring winter, I focused more on hydration and barrier repair while slowly targeting acne\n\n• COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Essence\n\nUsing this for the past 3 years and always keep it stocked. Great for hydration and calming acne without clogging pores. A solid staple for my winter routine.\n\n• L’Oréal Glycolic Bright Serum\n\nUsing regularly at night for pigmentation. It works gradually acne marks fade with consistent use. Needs patience.(WRP)\n\n• L’Oréal Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\nOkay-okay hydration. Lightweight, layers well, not sticky. Nothing extraordinary, but does the job. I personally prefer this over The Ordinary one. (WNRP)\n\n• L’Oréal Eye Serum\n\nBetter for puffiness. I mainly have dark circles (no puffiness), and it helped slightly but not dramatically.\n\n(WNRP)\n\n• The Derma Co AHA-BHA-PHA Peeling Solution\n\nFirst time trying it. Helped with texture and mild acne marks but caused some irritation. (WNRP)\n\n• Earth Rhythm Phytoceramide Moisturizer\n\nReally helpful for winter dryness. Texture is similar to CeraVe or Bioderma — creamy, barrier-supporting, and nourishing without clogging pores. Worked very well for my dry skin during winter. (WNRP)\n\n• Moody Sunscreen\n\nVery lightweight and great for humid weather. My tube was close to expiry, so I finished it during winter. Texture-wise, better suited for summer. (MRP)\n\n• Deconstruct Sunscreen\n\nGood for winter, slightly heavier. Budget-friendly, but I don’t think I can use it in summer. (WNRP)\n\n• Parachute Body Lotion\n\nBasic winter body lotion. Does the job for dryness.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",
