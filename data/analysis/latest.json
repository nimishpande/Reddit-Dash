      "content": "I have always been afraid of expressing myself as my mom and uncles used to tease me for how my hair curled and I became embarrased by it (it was just teasing but I took it to heart because I THOUGHT curls were \"feminine\" and I wanted to be a big strong man in a rural area. I know curls aren't a feminine thing btw) anyway my friend encouraged me to grow my hair out at the beginning of 2024 and I'm so grateful. People always compliment my hair, and I hate that it took me so long to embrace a part of me. The last photo is from May of this year when I had a different method so you can see the difference. Thank you to everyone who commented on my last curly hair post and gave me tips!! Have a great holiday season everyone 💖\n\nProducts listed at bottom.\nRoutine:\nI wash my hair two times a week. For one wash just shampoo and conditioner.\nOnce a week: wash with clarifying shampoo, then shampoo, then conditioner then conditioning treatment\nWith still dripping wet hair, apply curl creme then scrunch, then apply mousse and scrunch thoroughly, then gel and scrunch.\nDiffuse hair. Scrunch out crunch or use hair oil\n\n\nShampoo: not your mother's curl defining shampoo\nConditioner: not your mother's curl defining conditioner\nDeep conditioning treatment: Mielle Organics Babassu Oil and Mint Deep Conditioner (5-15 minutes) rinse out\nCurl creme: Briogeo Curl Charisma Rice Amino + Avocado Leave–In Defining Cream\nMousse:Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Activating Mousse\nCurl Gel: Briogeo Curl Charisma Rice Amino + Quinoa Frizz Control Gel\nOil: Oaui hair oil\n I wear a satin bonnet to bed every night, and use satin pillowcases and do not do a refresh routine.

I had never even heard about finasteride until the surgeon told me to get on it immediately, and ideally delay the surgery. I declined delaying it as I had travelled to Turkey. However, I got on it as soon as I got home. \n\nAfter going on fin for 3 to 4 months, I realised my hair was no longer brittle. My hair grew back nicely in the transplant area and all my hair felt less brittle. In 2023, I was happy and added oral minoxidil to the mix. I definitely felt some more thickness after the first shed, but not as much as I had hoped for.\n\nAbout 5 months ago, I added dutasteride to the mix three times a week, still taking the full dose of fin to try and avoid a shed. I am not quite sure why, but adding this has had an absolutely insane effect on my hair. I am in my 40s and have been thinning since I was 17. I would say my hair is now thicker than when I was 18. Loads of small hairs.\n\nAt the barbers today, I looked in the mirror and with my wet hair I could not see any scalp. I honestly cannot remember the last time I saw that. I have come home and shone my phone light on my scalp looking in the mirror and there are so many new short hairs with fresh regrowth. I was planning to ditch fin after six months, but I might just keep this stack now as it is working so well.\n\nI just wanted to give a perspective from someone who has taken fin and min for a long time, and the thing that worked the most in the mix several years later has been Dutasteride.\n",

      "content": "i need some help! i’m 26F, live in the UK, and have never struggled with acne in my life. i’ve always had clear skin, and even under a month ago i had no issues.\n\nabout 2/3 weeks ago my chest and back started to break out, and it’s only got worse. i haven’t changed anything in my shower routine, hair routine, or diet. i haven’t been ill recently, i don’t take the contraceptive pill, i always shower after working out, im careful with washing our hair conditioner, and i don’t put perfumes on my chest.\n\nit’s completely out of the blue - appears to be some form of adult acne from what i can gather. i don’t know if either the UK weather, hormones or stress has caused it, but it definitely bizarre for me.\n\ni’m basically wondering if anyone has any advice? i know i can go to the GP, but i thought id try doing stuff from the shops for now.\n\nthe routine i am now currently trying: boots salicylic acid cleanser for my body boots panthenol blemish cleanser boots benzoyl peroxide spray 6% vaseline aloe soothe body lotion\n\ni plan on doing this routine for a week (so far only done it for two nights), to see if it makes it worse/better. i’m panicking as its new year’s eve soon and really want this cleared up!\n\nany advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance x",

      "content": "Im going to try to summarize as best as I can....\n\nIve been struggling with acne for my entire adult life (10 years) pregnancy/post partum hormones shifted and this last year ive been back on a trying to figure out my skin because its terrible to have massive scarred acne as an adult game. Nutrition/supplement wise i take beef liver and methyfolate daily and avoid processed sugars, gluten and dairy. This seemingly helped some inflammation in the warmer months.\n\nThe other thing that was helpful for a time was... get this... I stopped washing it! Physical exfoliating scrub once every other day and then a natural organic plant based balm twice a day. That was it and it was working. Until winter hit and my skin is screaming profanities while simultaneously giving me the middle finger. This is my forehead currently. I can not in any combination figure out a moisturizer that actually moistures and routine that hydrates my skin. Ive tried LRP cicafalate, LRP lipikar and daily moisturizer, cerave night cream, round lab, snail mucin, oils, HA, avene mineral spray, more not mentioned. I recently added a humidifier. I just cant do this anymore, derms just want to put me on Accutane and im currently paused on my tret because my skin is, im learning, very reactive and dry. Also have had patches of eczema since pregnancy. So im sending this out in to the universe hoping, praying, some skin gurus will be able to help me.\n\nThe rest of my skin is scarred, cratered and covered in post inflammation hyperpigmentation marks. The cysts and hormonal acne along my jaw line has resolved since the diet changes and supplements but my barrier is f\\*d. My texture is horrible, fine lines, for a time putting anything on my skin would burn even things approved for literal chemo patients. Like wtf is wrong with me. How do actually cleanse and shrink pores, add hydration to my skin in the winter without making it react, even my tone and smooth texture?? I will take all the advice &lt;3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m967zwrin98g1.jpg?width=1017&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a61f16551f01af2e6ec21e3de153e4d769b78b15\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hcfrbzgis98g1.jpg?width=3216&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=512d478d2b6b8374d81f67a30dffd2b245dd46da\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6pa7lzgis98g1.jpg?width=1488&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e532fca2d97c0112c5fdf70eef4c78461b5fd83\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d8w5u5his98g1.jpg?width=1488&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df706977716788bc719dab8b21b42a59a3b0f3b6\n\nedit: medically ive r/o thyroid, cortisol, PCOS, and DM.

      "content": "Only recently started to try and take care of my natural hair, and I've been trying to do my research on how to do so. I stopped brushing it when it was dry, started to use a diffuser, tried to get some hair products for it, and wash it at the most once a week.\n\nI don't have much of a routine per say, after I wash it, I make sure to brush it whilst its wet to stop as much knotting as possible. I put in some leave in conditioner, then mousse, then some curl spray (though I've ran out recently), then I scrunch it.\n\nFrom things I've seen I think I may need to adjust how is scrunch my hair, as I think I do it too rough.\n\nWhat I'm asking is if my 'routine' needs to be updated/changed,  what other products I need, and of course, how to deal with frizz. I also do wear a bonnet to sleep, but sometimes I swear my curls get flattened out a bit (probably from when I sleep on my back).\n\nA side note, I'm 99% sure I have a few strands of hair that won't completely curl (used to be more noticable before I got my hair cut), and I'm not sure why, can't even fully curl with finger curling. And my mother has it too, but farrrr worse (a whole patch at the back of her head). If any one has any ideas or solutions on that, that'd be much appreciated! Thanks!!",

      "content": "Hi everyone, after trying so many things to help clear my face with no effect, I turn to the wisdom of the crowd. Thank you in advance!\n\nI'm 43, male, with a spotty history of acne: moderate acne as a teenager and young adult that didn't respond to OTC or most antibiotics anda year of accutane about 20 years ago helped me stay mostly clear until 2023. Derm. tried a few antibiotics in a row, including Cipro, with no improvement. A swab in 2024 indicated gram negative bacteria (serratia marcescens), so I went on accutane again — 80mg for the first 6mos then 100mg for 8mos. It helped a little, but didn't solve my skin, and being on it for so long at so high a dose seemed problematic so we stopped last May. About that time my cheeks and scalp (I'm bald) flared up like crazy and I had dozens of tiny CCs on my forehead. Swabs indicated staphylococcus aureus and lugdunensis. Short bursts of cephamlexin, clindamycin, cefadroxil, and ivermectin didn't do much. Nor did bleach baths 3x a week or washing with Hibiclens in the shower. Azithromycin seemed to help for 3–4 weeks but the lesions returned.\n\nA swab in early September found no bacteria or fungus, but by that time I was desperate so I started washing with Nizoral. It seemed to help a little and my scalp mostly returned to normal, so I was prescribed 2% ketoconazole. I also purchased the starter pack from Malezia. Conditions improved slightly, but not meaningfully. Seeing breakouts every 2–3 weeks, I thought it might be demodex I started washing with a sulfur bar in October along with an azelaic acid serum under the moisturizer and I had a month of the best skin in months until it backslid in late November.\n\nNow I'm back to 5–8 pustules popping up mostly on my cheeks each day. Nearly 100% are in a hair follicle, and numerous follicles that don't have visible pus are clearly inflamed. Derm. prescribed 20mg of doxy 2x day two weeks ago.\n\nMy cleaning routine was historically been pretty basic: cetaphil morning and night, with a hyluronic serum, retinol serum, and moisturizer, but I stripped all that away earlier this year to try and figure out what is triggering these breakouts. Right now I'm using what worked best in October: sulfur bar and Sebamed, with Paula's Choice azaleic serum in the morning and Malezia 2.5% benzoyl peroxide in the evening.\n\nLastly, my diet is primarily protein, veg, and fruit with some carbs. I change towels and sheets every two days, try to not touch my face, stay healthy, etc. — the same stuff they tell anyone experiencing acne symptoms.\n\nSorry for the Russian novel-length read, but I feel like I've tried everything, my confidence is crushed, and I don't know what to do next. The leave-on hibiclens regimen? More AHA/BHA? Less? Strip away all products and just moisturize like crazy? Move to a cave? The Derm's response is to wait 6 weeks to see if the doxy helps balance things out, but I don't know if I have that in me.",

Now im looking to upgrade and make life a little easier and less cluttered with a 5 in one. \n\nTypically I just do the front of my hair with a straightener so its more neat and tidy(wavy hair girl here) so im wondering if the 5 in one is worth it. I keep seeing mixed reviews about the shark flexfusion and need your advice! Is it worth it? Also saw a Babyliss 5 in one, but the reviews were low on that. Definitely dont want to break the bank with a dyson but could MAYBE be swayed since holiday deals are happening. So any input and recommendations you have im all ears!\n\nOh ya, I saw someone mentioned they wished they repurchased a Revlon blow dry brush instead of the shark, would love to hear more on that! \n\nLast tid bit, my blow dryer and curling wand are on their way out which is why I'm considering a 5 in one.\n\nThanks for the help!

I’m addressing the source now, and it should be improving eventually, but I’m having a really hard time not hating my hair. I miss my old hair. It defined easily with minimal product and effort and pretty much always looked good. Now I put in 3x the effort for 1/3 of the results, and they’re inconsistent too. I don’t know how to have anything but resentment towards my hair for reflecting health issues that could’ve been caught earlier if healthcare professionals bothered to check anything. It’s also been falling out since February and isn’t stopping. I rarely like how my hair looks now, and I don’t know what to do about it. It is not a length thing, as my hair was starting to loosen up when it was still shorter too. I’ll list my routine, so really anything helps. Maybe from people who have my current hair type? I haven’t felt compelled to give up on caring for my hair in a long time, but this has definitely taken me there. \n\nHair type now: wavy, coarse, medium density \nHair type before: curly, coarse, high density \n\nCurrent routine: Innersense clarity hair bath and hydrating cream conditioner. Styler is usually 1 lightweight foam and 1 gel,  ex. the tgin miracle foam + innersense I create curl memory. Usually brush styled with a denman or bounce curl definition brush, scrunched, diffused.

He is a blue collar worker, so his skin is dirty, oily, and deals with elements (heat in summers and extreme cold in winters) on a daily basis. He has enlarged pores and has acne where his hardhat sits and on his body. His skin seems to be combination, more oily in the T-zone and cheeks (also where he gets enlarged pores) and dryer around (but this is likely due to the harsh winter we are experiencing).\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for a routine to deal with pores, acne, and oily skin? What are some trust worthy products that can help him with both face and body? Also, any good recommendations for the winter months when it comes to moisturizer would be great.\n\nI’m planning to get him some of this stuff to help him on his journey towards healthy skin. I’ve tried before but the products have not worked well and I can’t recommend anything to him because I don’t deal with the same concerns as he.\n\nThank you in advance for any recommendations.",
