      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I’ve had these intense dark circles basically since birth, and the last photo of me at 2 or 3 years old shows the same thing—those same purple undereyes. I’ve tried so many eye creams over the years, from vitamin C to arnica to caffeine, and nothing seems to help. I know it’s genetic, but I’m also dealing with other factors like low iron and allergies. It's been pointed out to me my entire life, even by doctors. The weird thing is, I don’t feel like my undereyes are super hollow. There’s a bit of hollowness, but I’m not sure it’s enough to explain the discoloration. I’m really stumped and would love to hear if anyone has suggestions for what might help. I’m curious about options like PDGF, lasers, or anything that could potentially make a long-term difference. (And I know allergy and iron pills too, which do help some but not enough)",

I’ve tried so many eye creams over the years, from vitamin C to arnica to caffeine, and nothing seems to help. I know it’s genetic, but I’m also dealing with other factors like low iron and allergies. It's been pointed out to me my entire life, even by doctors. The weird thing is, I don’t feel like my undereyes are super hollow. There’s a bit of hollowness, but I’m not sure it’s enough to explain the discoloration. I’m really stumped and would love to hear if anyone has suggestions for what might help. I’m curious about options like PDGF, lasers, or anything that could potentially make a long-term difference.

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I start by detangling my hair a bit with my hands after wetting it, then I wash my hair with Aveeno apple cider vinegar shampoo clarifying shampoo, before I condition with redken all soft conditioner, and detangle fully with a wet brush, I brush my hair to the opposite side to which I wear it on, add my leave in conditioner (Marc Anthony Grow Long) and a small small amount of coconut and shea curl cream, I brush it through then I use my styling brush (I don’t bother sectioning because I only have hair on top anyway) I spray with heat protectant then diffuse most of the way, spray with a bit more morrocan oil and wear a bonnet for 15 minutes (seems to help me with frizz) then take it off and let it fully dry.",

I've been on it about two weeks, and over the last two weeks, my skin has gotten consistently worse and worse.  I'd love to maybe try a new product, but I'm a bit anxious to do so because I also happy to be *very* allergic to MOST products.\n\nMy skin: Dry/normal. I get cystic acne near my cycle, always around chin/jawline/forehead.  I do get back, shoulder, and upper arm breakouts but they're usually fairly small.  I drink brewed green tea all day, and am good about drinking water, but hey, we could all be more hydrated. I don't eat meat, but do work in salmon sometimes for omega fatty acids.   I take a multivitamin daily.  I do love a sweet treat. I am on adderall and an SNRI, which does make my skin VERY sun sensitive. I get a severe rash from too much sun time now, as of last year. Extremely bumpy, red, itchy as heck. But usually I would rank my skin as \"pretty good.\"  Not flawless, I get dark dark under eye circles, and usually have a bump/scar fading.  Also if beneficial, I am very pale.\n\nThis is the **most** important factor about my skin: about 7 years ago, almost overnight, I became allergic to \"all of my products.\" I'm sure there was one or two I wasn't, but working with my derm, axed everything and took me from  a 7-step $$$ sephora skin routine to basically a three-step tops. I use Vanicream gentle cleanser, and then Vanicream moisturizer. Like from a tub. It's not cute, but that + SPF is my routine, and I alternate in Kate Sommervile +Retinol Vitamin C Moisturizer. If I notice I'm starting to break out or if I'm coming from the gym I'll use ExfoliKate Cleanser in the shower and let it sit a minute. If I'm really looking rough/need a glow, I'll use ExfoliKate® Intensive Exfoliating Treatment (literally the BEST but burns so bad when applying!). So not very interesting, mostly breaks down to very gentle cleanser, thicker moisturizer, three drops Saint Jones CBD Oil when my skin feels extra fatigued.  I've also used The Ordinary's Glycolic Acid 7% on other parts of my body, and have not been allergic thus-far, but have had allergies to other Ordinary products (Niacinamide, and some other serums).  I'm also allergic to I believe all non-mineral sunscreens, sprays to apply them, and many body-waxes (if relevant lol. Beeswax is suspicious to me.)  Microplaning doesn't agree with my skin and always breaksme out.\n\nMy routine is pretty simple, as mentioned. But a quick easy-to-read version:\n\nMorning: If I'm not oily, I usually skip a morning wash to avoid drying my skin out (I get flakey in winter.)  If I'm oily/sweaty/whatever, I use Vanicream gentle facewash followed by vanicream moisturizer.\n\nIf I'm going outside, I'm likely wearing makeup. My foundation has spf 35, but if I'm not wearing makeup I usually apply at least spf 35. Aveeno mineral has worked okay enough.  I do a lot of work from home, so there are a lot of days I don't wear makeup/go outside.\n\nNightly: If I wore makeup, I usually use a fresh Makeup Eraser with Vanicream gentle facewash. On shower days or post-gym I like to do the ExfoliKate Cleanser, but sometimes I honestly go weeks without using it.  The Vanicream usually does pretty great for me.  ExfoliKate® Intensive Exfoliating Treatment if I have an event or am looking dull.  Rotate the Sommervile +Retinol Vitamin C Moisturizer with Vanicream moisturizer.  If I've been outside/it was a rough day, Saint Jones CBD Oil.\n\nI LOYALLY wash makeup off every time I wear it.\n\nI am allergic to many of the the things people consider \"super basic or gentle\" like Cetaphil :( La Roche-Posay as well. So I'm a little nervous to try many new things.  I've been getting super sweaty at night since starting as well, so the morning washes have been necessity. I use a silk pillowcase and wash frequently. I have bangs, but avoid most hair products other than an oil and finishing spray because allergies. I also wash them frequently (when it's not a full hairwash day, but they could use a little love. So bi-daily max.)\n\nThank you for reading if you've made it all the way to here!! Is there anything that y'all feel like has really helped you that could fit in with this or has worked for fellow ADHD people?   I have a very client facing job and feel so insecure about how it's looking, so any advice is appreciated! OR if anyone happened to get on a oral stim, broke out for two weeks, and then cleared up, that'd be great to hear too. lol.\n\nEdited for spelling.",

      "content": "I started taking topical minoxidil 6 years ago and had decent results at slowing down the hair loss but wanted to totally stop the hairloss and potentially regrow a little so 1.5 years ago I switched to hims topical minoxidil/finasteride spray. Since then my hair has continued to recede and thin out. looks worse than when I was only using minoxidil but i cant say fin actuallymade it worse. Could be more that fin just didnt do anything helpful and my hair loss naturally continued.   But either way I cant really  justify paying the money for something that isn't doing much of anything. \n\nMy own theory is that simply less minoxidil caused my  hair to get worse.  The min/fin spray is only once a day and using the recommend 4 spray pumps once a day lets me make the bottle last until the next one arrives, so no option to use it more often unless i want to pay even more than i am now. I think no longer using minoxidil both day and night was enough to make things worse. I could keep using the min/fin once a day and add only minoxidil back in the mornings but for cost reasons and considering i havent seen any benefits from adding fin, id rather juat not use it at all. would like to just go back to using minoxidil only.\n\nI get that min is the fertilizer and fin is the pesticide or whatever that farming analogy is that everyone loves to use, but wondering if switching back to only min causes increased hair loss and thinning based on anyone's experience.  To sum it up... am I stuck paying for and using fin forever to avoid any negative effects of stopping the topical fin",

Because of various contributing factors (hormones, meds, etc.), it’s been nearly impossible to isolate what’s actually causing it.\n\nI started using a new niacinamide serum from Aug 1–31 and my skin completely cleared up after those four weeks. So I bought a second bottle and used it from Sept 1–30, but my skin went completely nuts again. It still hasn’t cleared up as of today (Oct 12).\n\nHow do you know if you’re reactive to niacinamide?

Everything I’ve found only talks about extreme allergic reactions, but people keep saying that since niacinamide’s in basically everything now, you could have a low-level sensitivity and not even realise it.\n\nIf anyone has advice, real examples, or photos that show the difference between irritation and breakouts, I’d really appreciate it. 🥺",

      "content": "I’m 32 years old, my father is bald and my maternal grandfather was bald, so I knew from early age I would end up bald. At first I tried vitamins, ketoconazole shampoo when I was 22 to have more hair (I wasn’t balding then but my hair grew slowly) with no effect.\n\nWhen I became 31 I started balding fast. I couldn’t stand it (it made me look way older, and my chewing muscles are big so I look like the Alien from the Alien franchise when balding). I partially accepted it, kept my hair super short but having hair grow in your sidelines and not in the top of my head made me look terribly.\n\nI started dut/min october 2024, and I have kept it since then. I share some pictures of my progress. I use dutasteride 0,5 mg orally once daily, and minoxidil once daily (it should be twice daily, but I frequently forget to use it at night). I didn’t feel any difference in the first month and thought about quitting, but my friends said I had new baby hair and there was a mild noticeable change, so I kept going and that was the right choice.\n\nAs for side effects, my libido has decreased a little, the erections have remained the same, and my semen is more watery (and more abundant, at least something good). \n\nMy plan is to save money to have a hair transplant. I’m unsure if I should do it first in the back zone or the front zone, I’ll decide later. They’re expensive anyways so I’ll have time to decide.\n\nI decided to post this to help someone in the same position I was. I was really unsure of starting treatment or not, I searched for advice and other people’s experiences, so this might be a grain of salt for someone. ",

I’m thinking of getting it cut to that and had some questions.\n\nBefore I start, my hair is medium-thick I would say, and slightly wavy, and very voluminous. I have no experience with products.\n\nSo for my current hair which I’ve had for years, I just get it cut so the front, when pulled down, comes to the middle of my eye (it springs up), then a gradual blend to the back, and a taper on the back and sides.\n\nSo first of, what should I ask for when getting it cut? I would assume I’d want it to be more randomly cut with texture all throughout as opposed to the gradual change in length I have right now.\n\nAnd also, how would I style it? Cause I know it wouldn’t look like the picture if I just let it air dry like normal. Is this something I would need a pomade for? It’s obviously wet in the picture from out of the shower, and I don’t necessarily want it to look wet all the time, but I want it to have that textured, curly sort of look to it.\n\nIf there are any questions ask away!

(im new to reddit) for context  im a mixed girl with 4a/3c hair. i bleached it at home a little over a year ago. obviously my curls took some damage, but the routine i do weekly doesnt really work as my curls lose its form by around wednesday and my scalp gets super itchy. \n\nroutine:\nevery sunday i wash my hair and scalp in the shower wit shampoo, then afterwards i detangle it in the shower with conditioner. \n\nafter i get out the shower, i use the doux leave in conditioner spray very sparingly to just keep my curls detangled while i throw some other shit in there\n\ni part my hair into 4 sections, then take miss jessies leave in condish and run my fingers through my hair.\n\nthen, blue magic leave in conditioner, same thing i run it through my curls\n\nthen, i use aunt jackie’s don’t shrink gel and run THAT through my hair\n\nlastly, i use aunt jackie’s sealing butter. i repeat this routine for all of the hair sections and then leave my hair to air dry. \n\nday one my curls look cuuuteeee. the next day they still look fine. but my the third day it just looks frizzy and every thing itches. okay, now i’m not completely stupid. i know that using 3 different leave in conditioners in ONE routine isn’t the most efficient. i haven’t really gotten any advice on good hair products to use, so i just threw a bunch of bullshit in my cart when i was shopping for what to put in my hair. i would really… truly…. love some advice on how to fix my routine so my damaged hair can stay curly all week and my scalp doesn’t feel like i’m about to rip it off by day 3. thank yall!",
