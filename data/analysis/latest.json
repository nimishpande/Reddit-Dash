      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Recently I’ve been noticing that after cleansing, once rinsed, if I firmly rub my skin with my fingers I get the most effective exfoliation and my skin pills up, and feels soft and smooth afterwards. I’m glad I’ve come across this as for the first time in my life (35F, UK) I feel like I’m getting good exfoliation. However it’s leaving me to think that I’m going wrong in my skincare choices perhaps?\n\nI’ve recently started Skin&amp;Me with a tiny 0.12 % of Tret and 4% Azelaic acid, every night. This has increased cell turnover and I have more dry skin, but it doesn’t change the above. Since using (~3months) my skin has generally improved. \n\nI’ve been using garnier bha blackhead scrub (quite drying), Q&amp;A hyaluronic cleanser (extremely drying), and toner (does help skin feel better after cleansing). \nPrior to that I had a tube of boots clary sage hot cloth cleanser which was absolutely  amazing and left skin plump and hydrated, I checked and it has been discontinued a while ago. Then went on to Q&amp;A with an ai rec, no good. \nPrior to these I was using facetheory products for a while, which started out ok before I progressed to the pro version of their acid cleanser which was really harsh and I felt like it was irritating and damaging my skin, so I’ve stopped altogether. \nI have combi skin, used things like Paula’s choice in the past for enlarged pores particularly on nose, to no avail. Struggling to find products that will help with oil regulation and exfoliation without being super drying. \n\nOr… is simple manual fingertip exfoliation the way?",

My hair is also thin but very dense, so my curls can get super separated throughout the day if it’s windy, put in a certain hairstyle, etc. My hair routine currently is to wash with hydrating shampoo and conditioner and style with leave-in, curl defining cream, and a little gel. (Too much weighs it down) then I scrunch with a microfiber towel and air dry. \n\nWhen I sleep, I’ve tried so many methods that have all resulted in flattened curls, frizz, or random pieces sticking up. This means I have to re-wet and style my hair almost EVERY day, and I know it’s bad for it. I’ve tried a pineapple bun with a bonnet before realizing that only works on thick hair, I’ve tried just the bonnet, and I’ve even tried a loose low ponytail both with a bonnet and without. (Just silk pillowcase) \n\nI’d love to grow out my hair, but all the brushing from styling daily is giving me split ends.\n\nNo matter what I try, it’ll never be good enough just to wet it a little and head out. I’m tired of my morning routine being so long! What do I do?\n\n",

I started using medicated shampoo about 10 months ago regularly - 2-3x times a week and it's made a significant different on my forehead. The little bumps of what seemed to be acne are gone and it's pretty smooth and overall much less red. I was advised to switch to products that have eczema labels or similar. I switched the products I was using about the same time and noticed an improvement in clearing my skin bumps. Yet, I still have excessive oil on my nose, cheeks, and chin and I am constantly wiping my face throughout the day when I don't wear make-up. My nose and cheeks are also super red and feel irritated without make-up. When I wear make-up, it feels like relief for my skin and still have to dap oil but only like 2 or 3 times versus every hour without it.\n\nI know that I have reactions to certain foods and diligently avoid them. I'm curious if anyone has similar skin characteristics and have found some sort of success/improvement in reducing oil and redness? My current skin care routine is simple...\n\n* AM: facewash- panoxyl 2-3x per week whenever I use the medicated shampoo; switch between Tula Cult Classic Cleanser and La Roche-Posay; toner - Urban Skin Rx Witch Hazel Toner\n* PM: La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ Cleansing Oil\n* Lotion: switch between La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Matte Moisturizer and Vichy Mineral Moisture Matte Sorbet\n\nI can't use retinoid or similar products as it irritates my skin. I stopped using Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant because I couldn't tell if it was doing much of anything.\n\nI was also considering Red Light Therapy as I've been reading it's supposed to also help with oil control? Anyone have similar experiences or any recommendations for less oil? TIA!",
