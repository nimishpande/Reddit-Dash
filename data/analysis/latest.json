      "content": "Ms Chetali Chadha is back to her old tricks again\n\nRoasting products because they have fragrance in one reel and in a different reel, sneaking in a paid promotion for a product that has not just fragrance, but also color. \n\nYou may have all seen that series the influence with chetali . It has been running for two months now.\n\nI always had a feeling that Chetali was carefully and smartly, putting in her paid promotions inside the reels while making it seem like a genuine informed information and today I got the proof\n\nProof number one in one of her recent videos, she has spoken about the best moisturizer for oily skin, and the Foxtale suncreen has been shown as a clear winner, however, if you have been following her series, you will know that she is dead against fragrance, and any other additives Foxtale moisturizer has both. \n\nIn her latest reel for dry skin moisturizer, she has failed Himalaya and Nivea because they use a particular ingredient that has been banned in the European Union because they use fragrance, however logic did not matter in case of Foxtale. \n\nLastly, if you see her reels, clearly she has done paid promotion for requil, formula RX and Be body wise without making disclosures by just making a point that she is giving them a higher ranking\n\nIt is very easy to figure out which product has paid in which product has not paid. If you just go and put a timer on the reel and see how many seconds she dedicates talking about a product that is paid versus what is not paid.\n\n Incase you don’t have context she has done it before in 2024 and 2025 always roasting products that have fragrance and then promoting the L’Oreal glycolic serum which also has fragrance but at that time it did not seem to make a difference to her because she was paid for it. Her values keep changing based on who’s paying her and who is not.\n\nI cannot believe she has come down to this. I was really liking her content, and it was seeming genuine and educated but now knowing what I know, it is terrible it really breaks my heart. ",

The left side of my head curls perfectly and looks really good but the right side does not. It grows out and down rather than forming nice curls like the left side. We are unsure on how to handle this. I suggested maybe some sort of undercut so that the crown area can hang down over maybe those hairs will curl nicer? If anyone has any input it would be greatly appreciated. Anything from tips to make my bad side curl and lay/grow better or haircut recommendations such as what I mentioned earlier. I included some pics of each side. Good side(1) Bad side(2) Please let me know, thanks!\n\n\\*The pics shown are my hair after just washing and conditioning, no products\\*  \nThis is my typical routine:\n\nShampoo/conditioner: Not Your Mothers Curl Talk\n\nProducts: Camille rose moisture milk + not your mothers flash freeze gel\n\ndiffused\n\nsilk pillowcase",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

      "content": "27 years old. Been using the Medik8 0.6 retinal for about 5 months. Started off very slowly, twice a week as per the instructions and have gradually started applying every night.\n\nMy skin just does not look good. I didn’t have wrinkles before, but had veeeeerry slight fine lines on only one side of my forehead, which I thought retinal would help. I still get breakouts like before and also my forehead somehow looks worse than before I started? Like the fine lines are still relatively fine yet they look a little more pronounced(and there’s now more of them!!!), also I can kinda see small bumps - I dunno how to explain it but they’re not spots I don’t think. I’m wondering if my skin just doesn’t like it and if im actually doing more harm than good?\n\nFor some added context: I wear spf50 every single day, drink 2-3l water, cleanse my skin every night and don’t use any other active ingredients, just a moisturiser after - so I definitely don’t think it’s a case of a damaged skin barrier. I’ve never suffered with dry skin and it doesn’t feel particularly dry using retinal either, im just not sure where im going wrong and why im not seeing any benefits.",

Nizoral shampoo hasn’t helped, no dandruff shampoos or ordinary dry scalp shampoos have helped, oiling doesn’t help without an infeasible amount of consistency and frequency, all sorts of natural hair masks (including raw fucking eggs!) haven’t helped, and I strongly don’t believe it’s dandruff or seb derm as it feels very dry, flakes are very fine and white and powdery. Went to a dermatologist recently for another reason (MBP is a bitch) and got prescribed a course of bettamousse and coal tar shampoo (to be used 1x weekly). I’m yet to get on the bettamousse but I’ve applied short courses of weaker steroids on my scalp to no avail. Coal tar has definitely been good, post-use my hair looks denser and fuller and cleaner. No flakes visible even up close. But they are there and continue to build up over the days again. \n\nSide note: I haven’t tried jojoba oil before, I’m planning on doing so. ",

I used Garnier Fructis Curl Nourish shampoo and conditioner, It’s a 10 leave-in, Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream, Garnier Fructis Curl Scrunch Gel, and Garnier Fructis hairspray. \n\nPic 2 is day 2. I rinsed with Garnier Fructis Curl Nourish conditioner only and re-scrunched with gel and hairspray.\n\nPic 3 is the same day as pic 2, about 8 hours later. The top layers became flat and frizzy. I live in a very humid city in Texas.\n\nI think I may have mixed porosity hair (some high, some low), but I’m not sure. I did CGM a few years ago and had similar issues, though my curls had slightly more definition and looked healthier then. At that time I was very blonde.\n\nOver the past year I started using heat again, so I’m guessing there’s some damage. I got a cut a few months ago and have only used heat a handful of times since. I only wash with shampoo 2-3 times a week. I use a microfiber towel or T-shirt and plop. I sleep with it up at night and rewet in the morning. I do olaplex and clarify with bumble and bumble Sunday shampoo every 2 weeks.  hair feels soft and healthy at first, but once the humidity hits it doesn’t hold up through the day.\n\nLooking for advice on humidity control, how to tell and treat mixed porosity, why the top layers fall flat and frizz first, and whether this could be moisture overload vs needing protein.",

      "content": "**\\*Disclaimer: I'm speaking about my own unique experience and my results might not reflect the experience of others**\n\n\\- You really do have to trust the process. As hard as it is, you need to do your best to not let the obsessions of \"is it working? am I below baseline? etc\" takeover. You could take pics and stare in the mirror everyday and still be wrong about what you're seeing. Just let go, take the meds, and live your life. If I were to judge my progress based on my feelings throughout majority of treatment I would have said I was a non-responder. But in reality, it took me improving so well to a point that even my anxieties couldn't deny my progress.\n\n\\- Patience - You didn't lose all your hair in a year. It took years to get to where you are now, even if you're in the early stages of lose. Don't expect miracles in weeks/months.\n\n\\- Obsessing over shedding is (mostly) useless. Every shower I'd make note of how much hair I saw fall and think \"no hair fall = no more hair loss\". But every shower had my hands covered in so much hair which filled me with anxiety. Every time I run my hands through my hair at any point in the shower I'd see 10-20 new hairs fall and freak out as I'd be losing 100+ hairs at once. However, despite shedding that much, I was growing more hair than I lost.\n\n\\- Scalp health is important. Find products/shampoos/etc that take care of the skin as you would your face.\n\n\\- Dut + oral min is the god damn TRUTH\n\n\\- You really don't realize how long you've been going through hair loss. It takes a decent amount of hairline recession or significant scalp visibility for hair loss to really click in the minds of people. But by that point you're already a NW 3. It's genuinely fascinating what the mind will deny until it's too late. You'll look at old photos and try and pinpoint where you believe the fall off began and tell yourself \"signs started to show 2 or 3 years ago\". I have this one particular photo of myself in 2022 that I'd look at and think \"God, if I could ever get back to that point I'd be so happy\". No visible scalp showing and my hair looked great. I recently came back to that photo and was stunned. Comparing myself now to that photo, it's clear to me that I was already thinning. I had to go back 10 years until I saw a photo where I had hair similar to what I have now. It took 10 years for me to get to a diffuse NW3.5 when I originally thought it was 3.\n\n\\- Hair thickening is just as valuable, if not more, as regrowth. Thicker hair follicles can do wonders for coverage than obsessing over hair count. 100 thicker follicles can lead to better coverage than 150 thin hairs. A thick 2.5 can easily look like a NW1 - So don't get too heartbroken obsessing over your hairline not lowering.",

      "content": "Hello, 23f here with what is primarily a hair question!\n\nAs you can probably see ive been bouncing around a few shorter hairstyles over the past few years, but haven't really ever settled on one as im not sure what suits...\n\nHence my post here! Ive included several different styles ive had over the past 4 or so ears just to demonstrate how i look w different lengths, styles, parts, etc etc. currently my hair is the length of the first pic :/ but im willing to go much shorter or grow it out if it might work. In most of these pics ive had my partner cut my hair- he seems to do a decent job but is only an amateur at it so if the cut looks a bit rough thats why.\n\nOf course im considering going to a proper salon if i plan on a change. :)\n\nIm also considering doing something new with the colour- maybe highlights or something more drastic, though im completely at a loss here. I am worried about a very blonde colour washing me out or emphasising my red cheeks but otherwise, yeah, have very little idea :P\n\nI dont really have many preferences. I do actually sorta prefer the look and convenience of having it shorter (like pics 5, 8, 10, 15, 20) but am concerned that look doesnt work for me? Plus a few people have mentioned they think it looks best a bit longer :/ Pic 20 was from when i was a bit younger but its the shortest its been\n\nUltimately though im just looking for suggestions so anything (suggestions for things i have or havent tried, notes on do's or dont's, for styles, lengths, bangs, or things that work (or not) for my face, things to avoid, realy anything) is welcome!\n\nThankyou! :)",

      "content": "Routine: \n\nAM (infrequent): \n\n\\-Arencia mochi cleanser OR Round Labs birch juice cleanser OR water\n\n\\-Olay Super Serum (sometimes)\n\n\\-Cerave moisturizer with 5% hydrourea \n\n\\-beauty of joseoon sunscreen (always)\n\nPM\n\n\\-Arencia mochi cleanser OR Round Labs birch juice cleanser\n\n\\-Differin \n\n\\-hatomugi skin conditioner toner (sometimes)\n\n\\-Cerave moisturizer with 5% hydrourea\n\n\\-Cosrx overnight mask with honey / propolis (sometimes)\n\n\\-Vaseline \n\n\\-Glamfox collagen and ginseng wrapping mask (sometimes) \n\nMy PM routine probably seems like a lot, but it's very dry here and after starting differin two months or so ago it's about the only way I could keep my skin from feeling tight and dry. \n\nI recently decided to try azaleic acid (15%) because I have some redness around my nose. That was three days ago (skipped retinol that night) and my skin was a little pissed off the next day. \n\nTwo nights ago I tried COSRX's snail mucin. I think it broke me out or maybe irritated my skin, but it was hard to tell. \n\nLast night I was going to take a break from actives, but for some reason I just zoned out and put a few drops of azaleic acid on my face. A few minutes later the stinging and redness was so bad around my nose I washed it all off and just put on 1% hydrocortisone and cerave. The cerave did that awful burning thing it does when your barrier is damaged, and I panic applied a layer of LrP lipikar daily repair moisturizing lotion, which expired 06/25.\n\nThis morning the area around my nose and mouth and chin was a little red and irritated, plus a few spots on my cheeks. I washed my face, put on the hatomugi skin conditioner, the cerave and the LrP, and makeup and went to class. when I got back I thought maybe I should take off my makeup and take a nap. I did the same routine (hatomugi skin conditioner, the cerave and the LrP) and the cerave didn't burn at all this time, so I thought I was good. \n\nBut as I'm laying down on my bed about an hour later, it felt like my skin started burning off against the pillow. I have a sleeping mask and it felt like the heat from that was creeping down my cheeks and making it worse. I get up and go look in the mirror, and ???? My face is red as hell and definitely inflamed/swollen. Also, I don't know if you can see from the pictures, but there's a few smaller splotches of red on my left cheek like mini rashes. \n\nI do generally have sensitive skin, but I guess I've been lulled into a false sense of security because Korean products are usually very gentle. My skin hasn't felt irritated or sensitive from differin for several weeks now. \n\nI do not have the money to see a dermatologist unless this is super serious. And maybe it is because I'm really prone to hyperpigmentation. \n\nBut I was hoping someone could tell me what moisturizer would be okay to use, or if I should just use vaseline. Also, would it be stupid to wash my face again with water and then use Vaseline on top? I feel like that might irritate it more, but I also feel like maybe it's being irritated by the cerave and LrP right now. My forehead and (thankfully) eye areas are fine. \n\nThank yall. Don't be stupid like me and play around with actives.",
