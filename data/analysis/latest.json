      "content": "Hi guys. As the title suggests I really need some advice on my skin. As a teen/tween I had bad breakouts on my face and chest and terrible KP on my upper arms and chest area as well. Im now 18 and don’t really struggle with active breakouts but all the breaks out that I used to have, have left a myriad of dark spots, hyperpigmentation and scars all over my face, chest and upper arms. I’ve been struggling with those marks for years and they make me feel terrible, it’s gotten to a point where I don’t wear anything that shows my upper arms or chest and I never leave the house without full coverage makeup . Please help me out 😭I wanna feel comfortable and wear cute clothes again.\n\nExtra info to my skin: Chest - oily skin Upper arms - dry skin Face - combination (Nose, chin and middle of forehead oily. Cheeks and sides of forehead dry) - so basically  inner face oily and outer face dry if that makes sense.\n\nRoutine: I don’t really have a consistent routine I keep up with, but I do wash my arms and chest with a 5% urea body wash and I use the ordinary 7% toner on them with a cotton pad bidaily and lotion with a 15% urea body lotion. I also had a cream prescribed for my dermatologist for my KP. It’s called selgamis by galderma and it’s 50 Mikrogramm trifaroten /g creme \n\nAs for face I use an 5% salicylic acid face wash (eucerin)  and double cleanse with an oil cleanser (balea) to get all my makeup off. I’ve used vitamin C and niacinamide and retinol (the ordinary) but I wasn’t consistent and I don’t use them anymore (I ran out lol)\n\n \n\nI am also based in the EU which means some products may not be super easily available to me but please recommend whatever works best. I appreciate any and every advice. Thank you guys so much",

It's not that I particularly mind that it's different, it's just idk how to properly take care of them in the same way. It doesn't look good at all and idk what to do. I just started my curly journey a couple months ago. I had finally went to a curly salon and she gave a lot of great tips, but when it came to my roots she told me to do the same thing to them as the rest of my hair, but clearly it isn't working out. I've tried using a bounce curl brush, denman brush, and now I finger coil, but still no luck. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I thank you all in advance!\n\n✨️\n\nRoutine:\n•Wash my hair twice a week\n•Wash only top of my hair with Herbal Essence sulfate-free shampoo, condition only bottom of my hair with Herbal Essence sulfate-free conditioner\n•Use Ouidad Coil Infusion Deep Conditioner on whole head once a week\n•Clarify whole head with Olaplex Clarifying Shampoo once a month\n•Put Rizo's Curl Cream on soaking wet hair (whole head including roots)\n•Put Ouidad Advanced Climate Control gel on wet hair (whole head including roots)\n•Finger coil whole head, using fingertips to pull at roots to make them not so kinky (which isn't working)\n•Add a small amount of Kenra No.9 hairspray\n•Diffuse with Babyliss dryer\n•Use small amount of Kenra Luxe Shine Oil to break cast\n•Sleep in silk bonnet and silk pillowcases",

I asked an employee with visibly well maintained coily/thick hair for advice and she said Shea Moisture was way too heavy for me with my fine hair - that it contained glycerin and was too heavy for her hair type, so it was definitely the wrong choice for me. She recommended Nexxus Pure and Clean shampoo and conditioner and I'm trying it out now with nothing else changed in my routine, but my curls fall out of their curl pattern within the day. I spend the days between wash days with hair that looks like someone with wavy hair tried to straighten it.\n\nSo clearly this current shampoo and conditioner is not for me, but was she right that the other was too heavy for me and was weighing down my curls?\n\nWhat kind of products and routines do you use for your fine curly hair, and how long do your curls last?",

Some say it helps clean better, others say it can irritate the skin.\n\nSo I wanted to ask:\n\n* Do you actually follow the 60-second rule?\n* How long do you massage your cleanser in?\n* What water temperature do you prefer (warm, cold, or lukewarm)?\n* How many times a day do you wash your face?\n* Any safe tips to reduce redness after cleansing?\n\nNot asking for medical advice — just looking for real experiences or step-by-step routines that help with balanced cleansing for combination skin.\n\nThanks in advance! 🙏",

At the time I paired it with Davines Curl Building serum, but didn’t think it was creating nice curls. \n\nSwitched to Ouidad Curl Quencher sham/cond when I got my first curly cut, and paired that with the Ouidad Whipped Curls, but felt like that combo was too much moisture &amp; was weighing down my hair. \n\nA few weeks ago I purchased some Curlsmith Full Body Weightless sham + Milk Cond and then tried various combinations of the Hydro-style flex jelly, Weightless air dry cream, and Vital Curl, none of which seemed to do much for me. I get much better definition from the whipped curls than the vital curl gel. In fact, by day 2 on Vital Curl, my hair was totally listless and lost curl. \n\nToday’s routine:\n1. Washed &amp; conditioned with the CS Full Body\n2. Whipped curls (I literally used like a teaspoon or so &amp; mixed in some Vital Curl gel\n3. Combed thru w wide tooth comb (only to disperse product)\n 4. Sprayed some extra water and then plopped as usual with a microfiber cloth. But \n\nAnd my hair just looks greasy &amp; lifeless. \n\nI am at a loss. What is wrong with my hair and what should I change? I believe it’s low porosity (I tend to dryness, but get weighed down easily) but too much protein or something? I don’t know. My curls used to look so much better, but maybe this is just my hair on menopause + a year on GLP-1. \n\nFirst pic is this past July 20, the last 3 are today.

      "content": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nI’ve been struggling with finding the **right way to wash my face**. I have **combination skin**, and I often end up either **over-washing**, which causes redness, or **under-washing**, which leaves my face feeling greasy or not clean enough.\n\nRecently, I came across something called the **“60-second rule”** — where you massage your cleanser into your skin for a full minute before rinsing. Some people say it helps with deeper cleaning, but I’m not sure if it’s actually good or if it might irritate my skin.\n\nSo I wanted to ask you all:\n\n* Do you follow the 60-second rule?\n* How long do you usually massage your cleanser in?\n* What water temperature do you use — cold, warm, or lukewarm?\n* How many times a day do you wash your face?\n* Any tips to reduce redness or irritation after cleansing?\n\nI’m not asking for medical advice — just looking to understand what **routine or timing** works best for others with combination skin.  \nIf you can, please share your **step-by-step routine** (like how you wet your face, how much cleanser you use, how long you massage, and how you dry it off).\n\nThanks in advance for your help! 🙏  \nI really appreciate everyone here sharing their experience — it helps a lot.",

Yesterday I scrunched my hair and slept in a cotton tshirt bonnet, and it settled in this really loose wave. It's still straight on top of my head. \n\nSo, I'm thinking of getting some products that can help me define these waves. Is a gel or mousse a good idea? My scales gets oily after like three days, so I'm unsure if I should use oils or not. \n\nHope someone has advice for me! Thanks in advance :) ",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

I was on adapalene and isotretinoin in 2020 and it cleared my skin but I shifted to Delhi in 2024 and it took a toll on my skin!😣\n\nI came in June and skin started getting worse! Went to a dermatologist in October but he kept on prescribing very expensive hyaluronic acid, vitamin c and niacinamide serums even when I told him I’m allergic to niacinamide😒\n\nSo finally in November my neighbour aunty told me to give raw aleovera a chance and started using it everyday at night after my skincare routine and cleared my skin😭😭😭\n\nMy cousin who is around 18 has acne since he was 14, just how my skin looks. Even he started aleovera and he’s happy with the results! (I will post his before and after in few months)\n\nWith aleovera I followed a simple skincare routine: \n\n1. Facewash : Simple Facewash (using it since 3 years now)\n2. Moisturiser: Formula rx hydra veil moisturiser (love of my life💝)\n3. Sunscreen : I was using reequil matte during the summer season and currently using minimalist fluid sunscreen 🧴 \n4. Bioderma Micellar water or Deconstruct cleansing balm for makeup removal 🎀\n\nI use to 10-15 step routine before this and I have over consuming way too much! \n\nHow I use the aleovera:\n\n1. Cut a piece from plant\n2. Clean it with water\n3. Keep it in water for 20 mins (it ensures all the yellow part is removed)\n4. Apply it after 1 Hour after doing my skincare routine which is just applying my moisturiser \n\nTo anyone who is going through acne just give aleovera a try! Please please please😭😭\n\n*Some people are allergic to aleovera too so do a patch test! ",

However I started noticing in the past 2 years that my hair changed significantly in its texture. I used to have pretty smooth hair even if all I did was rough dry it without styling (attached before photos). Now my hair looks horrible if all I do is rough dry it (attached now photos).  It’s dry, rough and frizzy.\n\nI tried sulfate free and sulfate shampoo and didn’t noticed a difference. I always use hair conditioner, hair mask, leave in conditioner spray, oil, blow dry cream and heat protectant if heat styling.\n\nThe only changes I can really think of was I got a Dyson air wrap 2 years ago and I moved from Vancouver to California. I also dyed my hair into a brown before my wedding 3 years ago, but no bleaching. But my hair looked fine after, so don’t know if that’s related or not.\n\nI also lost a shit ton of hair and my scalp hurts like never before. I went to the dermatologist about it but they couldn’t find anything wrong.\n\nSo what can I do? Any hair treatments I can do at the salon? Things I can do myself at home?\n\nWhen I heatstyle my hair it looks decent (see attached photo), but I have carpal tunnel pain and can’t do it often.\n\nAny advice?",

Recently it has gotten even thinner and I am noticing a lot more breakage, split ends, and frizziness. I do not use any heat on my hair nor do I dye it. I get my hair trimmed once every 3-4 months. I most recently got my hair cut 1 month ago and my hair felt like straw at the time because of how damaged it was. It felt a bit healthier after I got it cut, but the split ends, thinness, and dryness/frizziness quickly returned. I feel like I can’t even wear my hair down anymore because it frizzes out so much, and I am unable to define my curls.\n\nI added a picture before my most recent hair cut that shows how thin and damaged the ends of my hair were. One month later it is starting to look like that again :(\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to rescue my hair?? Thank you!",

      "content": "I have been thinking about adding retinol to my routine for the anti-aging benefits (helping reduce fine lines and wrinkles and promote collagen production). I'm in my early 30s and have noticed more fine lines recently, especially on my forehead. \n\nI know you must wear sunscreen when using retinol and protect yourself well from the sun. My job is outdoors for about 6 months and I sweat a lot while working outside. I always put sunscreen on at the beginning of the day (and always wear a hat, long sleeves, and pants), but usually can't re-apply sunscreen throughout the day due to how sweaty I get. \n\nSo I am wondering if it would be worth using retinol 6 months on (when my job is indoors and I can reliably wear sunscreen all the time) and 6 months off (when my job is outdoors)? Or would the 6 months off of retinol reverse all the benefits/progress? \n\n\nThanks! ",
