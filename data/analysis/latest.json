      "content": "Been straightening almost all my life, because I never learned how to care for my curls/waves properly. The pictures are taken almost exactly one year apart.\nMy routine includes a clarifying and a moisturizing shampoo from a drugstore in my country (Rossmann - the brand is called Isana). \nAfterwards I use the Garnier “Method for Curls”-Mask as a conditioner.\nI brush in a gel (also by Isana - Curltastic Scrunch Gel), and afterwards a foam (mostly Wellaflex - Curls Definition Mousse). I do this on soaking wet hair because it tends to bring out the best results. I then scrunch my heart out (first with bare hands, then into an old tshirt) spray on some heat protection (Elvital - Defeat The Heat spray) and diffuse on medium heat, medium speed.\nLastly I scrunch out the remaining gel cast with the Pantene Pro-V Argan Infused Oil.\nI sleep with my hair up in a bun on a satin pillowcase. No refresh routine.\n\n",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Back when I was not doing a wavy routine, the hair came out of my scalp at lower angles, and it didn’t look sectiony or piecey at the roots. \n\nAny advice on how to remedy this? \n\nCurrent routine:\n- herbal essences volumizing shampoo (roots) and conditioner (mids and ends) in the shows, detangle with brush/comb as I rinse out the conditioner\n- section wet hair, rake through kinky curly curling custard, and style with curl defining brush (I’ve had similar results with multiple sectioning techniques. 1 is sectioning hair into front/middle/back and styling upside down. 2 is sectioning hair into top/left side/right side and styling right side up; with the top section I brush the hair upwards and let the clumps fall down towards the back of my head. Both create similar issues with the piecey and weird-angled roots)\n- apply aussie curl like mousse with praying hands and scrunch with cotton tshirt\n- diffuse leaning forward and tilting to the side; hover diffuse roots until sorta dry and then diffuse the rest of the hair until cast has formed and hair is sorta dry\n- let air dry the rest of the way and then SOTC ",

It made my hair wavy ish (pic 2 - wet hair) but it was stringy and pattern is all over the place when its dried after plopping + diffusing (pics 3-8).

Or am I just delulu &amp; forcing my hair to be something it isnt?\n\n Everyone I know has 3c-4c hair, I dont have anyone who has the same hair type as me so im not sure how to “fix” my curl pattern or even curl train(?) my hair.

My skin type leans more oily slightly normal these days. \n\nIn the past I loved bare minerals loose powder, but despite using either an oil or water based moisturizer in the morning and waiting 15-20 minutes after to apply, it just doesn’t sit on my skin like it used to. It settles into my pores, and makes the grossest most obvious smudges.

Used it last night, and it was so weird. It made my nose itch, and i didn’t feel clean. It felt like i had slime on my face. So, i put just a little bit of the cerave foaming cleanser on my face and my salicylic acid and then moisturizer and my faces feels really nice now. smooth, clean, soft. Should i start double cleansing with both? or just using less of the foaming cleansed. Im wondering if the issue is that I’m just using too much of my foaming cleanser. I took a few days break of using my cleanser, and my skin cleared up a lot. Am i using too much of it to the point it’s taking the good oils from my skin?",

      "content": "I recently got a sample of the Caudalie Premier Cru Cream from Sephora and now I’m screwed because I’m obsessed… but I absolutely cannot justify $120 😬\n\nFor context, I have combo skin—mostly oily, but I definitely notice dry patches when I wear makeup. I also have mild rosacea.\n\nThis cream made my skin so soft. I even rubbed the extra onto my hands and they stayed insanely smooth into the next day. It also seemed to calm my skin and help a bit with redness, which I was not expecting. Overall, my face just looked healthier.\n\nSo now I’m desperate 😭 Does anyone know of any good dupes or similar moisturizers with a similar feel/effect?\n\nMy current routine:\n\n**Night:**\n\nAnua Cleansing Oil\n\nAnua Heartleaf Cleanser\n\nAnua 77+ Rice Toner\n\nAnua Azelaic Acid\n\nRhode Glazing Milk\n\nSkin1004 Poremizing Ampoule\n\nPurito Oat-in Calming Gel Cream\n\n**Morning:**\n\nAnua 77+ Rice Toner\n\nAnua Azelaic Acid\n\nRhode Glazing Milk\n\nPurito Oat-in Calming Gel Cream\n\nEltaMD Sunscreen\n\nOpen to drugstore or mid-range options—just trying not to emotionally commit to a $120 moisturizer 😅",

Sometimes my hair looks okay, but other times the shedding becomes intense and everything feels like a mess again. When my hair is in a bad phase, it feels like my life goes on pause until things stabilize.\n\nI don’t know if this is the right place to vent, but I just want to talk to people who might understand how this feels.\n\nI’ve been talking to a woman for a few months and I really like her. When my hair loss gets worse, it affects me deeply. During these periods, I feel ashamed to send her pictures of myself. It’s not that I don’t take care of my appearance — I do — but when my hair is bad, my confidence drops completely.\n\nWhat scares me the most is the fear of losing all my hair and never being truly loved by a woman because of it. Recently, I switched from finasteride to dutasteride 0.5 mg daily, and I really hope it works.\n\nAll I want is to find a treatment that truly stabilizes my hair loss so I can live my life normally, without this constant insecurity that keeps hurting me.",
