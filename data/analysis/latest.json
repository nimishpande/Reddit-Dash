      "content": "Hey! So I have no idea what type of hair I even have. I’m thinking it’s 2b though it’s hard for me to tell. I rarely try to enhance my natural hair as seen here because it takes a lot of work and the frizz is very overstimulating. I usually just keep it up or twist/braid after washing to avoid having to deal with it. \n\nI’d describe it as fine (it’s deceivingly voluminous) but also wavy / curly ish?? It also is clearly very dry. \n\nIn this picture, today, I washed it and then put in leave in conditioner on the mids and ends + put lightweight anti frizz oil while doing some random finger coiling to try to maintain a consistent pattern. I also diffused it flipping as the roots get weighed down a lot I find. It helped but it still is frizzy and crazy and I wonder what I can do differently to help it be better. \n\nWhen it’s soaking wet it’s straight, when it’s damp it begins to wavy/spiral without me even touching it but it looks better when I enhance them with the finger coiling as my pattern is very sporadic and random if not! And ofc when it’s dry, it gets frizzy. \n\nI’m open to any routine ideas, product recommendations, styling techniques and if you can identify my type of hair etc etc. \n\nThank you!! ",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m 19 and looking for some serious direction with my skin.\n\nRight now, my \"routine\" is almost non-existent. I wash my face with warm-ish water every day and the only product I use is La Roche-Posay SPF 50.\n\nI actually used to have a full skincare routine in the past, but I eventually stopped because it didn't seem to help. Even then, my acne scars never went away—the redness was always visible and never seemed to fade. I've heard this might be PIE (Post-Inflammatory Erythema), which is why standard treatments might have failed me.\n\nI’m reaching a breaking point and have a couple of questions for the experts here:\n\n1. Is Accutane the right move? Given that I have persistent scarring and past routines didn't work, should I just ask a derm for Accutane to stop the cycle?\n\n2. Product Recommendations: Before I go the prescription route, are there specific products for redness/PIE that actually work? I’ve seen people mention:\n\n• Azelaic Acid (like The Ordinary or Paula’s Choice)\n\n• Niacinamide\n\n• A gentle cleanser (Since I use SPF 50, is water enough to get it off, or am I just clogging my pores more?)\n\n• Adapalene/Differin\n\nI'm tired of my skin always looking inflamed and red. I’d love to hear if anyone in a similar boat (19, stubborn red scars, failed past routines) finally found something that worked—whether it was a specific product or just going on Accutane. Thanks!",

      "content": "[PART 2] of comparing Indian version of skincare products with its foreign counterparts. \n\nToday I tried to compare Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra Indian variant with its USA counterpart. \n\nFrom the first screenshot we can conclude that the USA variant is silicone free and has \"more,\" exactly 5, ingredients which creates \"hydration\" for the skin and has 2 \"less\" ingredients which may cause \"oily skin\".\n\nNow from the second screenshot, the major differences are:\n\nThe Texture:\n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses Silicones (Cyclopentasiloxane and Cyclohexasiloxane). These give the cream a silky, smooth feel that disappears quickly into the skin. It feels more like a velvety finish. \n \nThe Right Side (USA): They swaps these silicones for Natural Plant Oils (Brassica Campestris Seed Oil and Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil). This makes it feel much richer and greasier. It doesn't evaporate quickly, it stays on the surface longer to physically nourish the skin. Which may make it bad for our Indian skin, due to humid climate. \n\nThe Seal: \n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses Stearic Acid and Palmitic Acid. These are fatty acids that create a thick, physical seal on top of your skin. It’s designed to waterproof your skin so moisture can't escape.\n\nThe Right Side (USA): Uses Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and Sodium Citrate. Instead of just sealing the surface, it focuses on soothing irritation and providing antioxidant protection.\n\nThe Emulsifiers:\n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses more traditional, synthetic emulsifiers (PEG-100 Stearate, Steareth-21). These are very stable and give the product a long shelf life and consistent texture.\n\nThe Right Side (USA): Uses Cetearyl Glucoside, It is generally considered more skin-friendly for people with extremely sensitive or eczema-prone skin because it mimics the skin's natural structure.\n\nThis concludes this comparison between two variants of Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra between two different regions. \n\nTo my research a few people claiming that we, here in India, get inferior products as compared to the foreign counterparts, I think it's not inferior at all, it's just made/formulate in such a way that it supports our skins that too in a very humid climate, just like we have here in India as compared to cold weather in any western country!!!\n\nLet me know what you guys think. \n\nP.S. I'm not a dermat, so I cannot fully differentiate between the ingredients list all by myself, so I used Google and Gemini to help me sort things out. If there's any mistake I'd love know in the comments section! ",

      "content": "So I’m pretty new to all this. I realized around a year ago that my hair has real potential to be curly and I’m looking for advice to really make them pop.\n\nToday’s routine was as follows:\n\n\\- shampoo - probably garnier or Pantene, not really sure which one. I’m out of conditioner, so didn’t have any of that in my routine today. \n\n\\- once out of the shower, I squeezed the water out and let the mane sit in a towel \n\n\\- I wet my hair with the spray bottle, then used Lush‘s Curl Power  curl cream all over, and then Not Your Mother‘s gel. Then I did some scrunching and some twisting. \n\n\\- then I diffused. First on medium, then on high. At some point I scrunched in some Wella mousse. I stopped once it was about 90% dry and then just let the air do the rest because my patience ran out by then and I started to feel deaf.\n\nI never feel like routines do much but like in the photos above, some of those curls begin to pop. I think pic 1 captures it the best, the ones in  pic 2 and 3 are actually a lot juicier than they seem here. As for the rest of the mane, well you can look at pic 3.  \n\nWould love some adviceeee ! Now here are some things you should know:\n\n\\- I think I need products that really don’t weight down my curls. \n\n\\- I don’t know if it’s my products or my hair in general, but when I get through the curl routine everything just feels extremely dry. Using shampoo, conditioner, and some serum before a quick blowdry with Dyson at least ends up looking so much better (and feels okay to the touch). \n\n\\- I also have the Miss Jessie’s Pillow Talk cream and Jelly Curl gel and I use it with the Wella mousse. My hair is def dry af after that. The Wella mousse, while drying, seem to be the only thing that gets curls in place while I wet style it. Everything else I use.. well it just feels like it’s all in there, not doing much. \n\n\\- I have the Giovani eco chic technology clarifying shampoo too. I use it sometimes but it  feels risky using it while my hair feel so dry after a routine like this.\n\n\\- I’m a bit skeptical about having too many products, so please dont suggest please 10 new products!\n\n\\- I think curl creams are a scam (there, I said it!). Not against using one but honestly it just feels like a conditioner with a slightly different consistency. Ideally I’d just like a reaaaallllyy good conditioner to moisturise my hair,  something I maybe wouldn’t fully rinse it out in the shower. ",

I try to regularly wash my pillowcases, and not touch this side of my face.\n\nProducts I'm currently using:\n\nLa Roche posay toleraine hydrating cleanser\n\nThayers rose toner\n\nPeach slices redness relief calming cream\n\n\\*Products I use a couple times a week\n\nPeach slices Azelic acid serum\n\nBubble gentle exfoliant serum\n\nIs this a hormonal imbalance problem from being postpartum? A skin barrier issue or something I should see a dermatologist about?? I'm really tired of my skin being this way and being so embarrassed to go out without makeup 😩🫣",

I’m losing my mind!\n\nadditional info: i have a silk pillowcase since a bonnet does not stay on, and i usually “pineapple” it up in a very loose thick scrunchie to sleep in. Rarely use heat, but i do tend to blow dry it when i style using the orchid bowl diffuser with low heat or cool setting and always use a heat protectant spray as the final step.\n\nDespite all of this, my hair is generally frizzy at the back side no matter how much or how little product is used, and the curls and waves are wildly different frizz and shape.

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

      "content": "Hiii senpais, I'm in my early 20s and have been into skincare for a year now. I wanna know if there's anything that I can improve with my skincare routine, as my current products are almost over and I wanna buy better ones.\n\nFor starters, I have oily skin and when i say oily, it means that you could probably deep fry any dish lol &gt;&lt; ( I'm kidding, but it's really oily).\n\nSo this is what my skincare routine looked like till now.\n\nAM:\n\n1. Neutrogena Deep Clean Foaming Cleanser\n\n2. Nivea soft face moisturizer (the white one)\n\n3. Minimalist Spf 50, used this for 3-4 months then switched to Minimalist Spf 50 Light fluid\n\nThe reason i switched is because I noticed that Spf 50 was kinda late to dry and due to me living in a humid region at that time, the sweat washed it away.\n\nBut I did not have this problem with Spf 50 light fluid since it dried relatively fast and also it was not as heavy on my skin as the Spf 50 was.\n\nPM:\n\n1. Neutrogena Deep Clean Foaming Cleanser (the reason i use it twice a day is because I play quite a bit and the dust settles all over my face)\n\n2. IPCA Scar-Kt Advanced gel Serum (this was what my derma suggested since I have small acne scars)\n\n3. Nivea soft face moisturizer (the white one)\n\nAlso a thing I noticed a bit late was that, the sunscreen and the moisturizer made my face look greasy, but the protection they gave was quite good.\n\nSo, this was my routine and I now want to upgrade it a bit.\n\nPlease recommend some products and if i should start using toners/serums.\n\nThank youu \\^\\^!!!",
