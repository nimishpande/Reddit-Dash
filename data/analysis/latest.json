I am going to see a dermatologist this year as I worry about all the other issues that come with Rosacea, but this is a great start. \n\nI bought Beauty Pie’s Happy Face 10% Azelaic Acid Gel and their Brightening Niacinamide Serum drops. I have been using the azelaic acid in the morning and the niacinamide at night.\n\nI can’t believe how much less rosey my face looks in less than a month! It has really helped the appearance of spider veins across my cheeks and patchiness. In terms of the hot pain on my cheeks, I have noticed a little reduction, but I continue to be strict with SPF. \n\nThanks Reddit for giving me some confidence back! ",

It is also sensitive, I have a lot of redness and really big pores everywhere, not just the T zone.\n\nI have tried La Roche Posay, Cera Ve, The Ordinary, Mixa and none of those helped. I tried niacinamide serums and pore minimizing serums and they didn't work. My routine is mostly just a cleansing gel and moisturizing cream in the morning and evening, when I was trying out serums, I layered them correctly. I wear makeup every day and not even primers work (mattifying or pore minimizing). I do not have acne but I get small white zits or some zits appear under skin (mostly cheeks and around the nose) almost every day. I have some blackheads but I don't have a lot and I can exctract them, they arent a problem. Please also note that I change my face towel regularly, always just dab my face, change my pillowcase regularly and so on. I really try with everything. I do my routine regularly, I am aware that consistency is key, but nothing has helped me so far. I hate it because I hate the feeling of oilyness on my face and it also affects my hair, it gets oily even faster bc of my face. I also cannot walk around with no foundation because I am insecure about the pores and redness, but also if I don't wear foundation, my face gets oilier even faster and even if I dab it or wash it with water, it gets oily again after an hour.\n\nAny suggestions on which products, routine would work for me? A friend suggested retinal, which I havent tried, what do you think?",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I do understand that other hormonal pigmentation is hard to reverse, but I at least want to try improving it.\n\n# Current routine:\n\n**AM:**\n\n* Face wash\n* Rose water toner\n* Saffron oil serum (Ranavat)\n* Moisturizer: Antioxidant (chebula) + hyaluronic acid (True Botanicals)\n* Sunscreen\n\n**PM:**\n\n* Face wash / rice exfoliant (2-3x a week)\n* Rose water toner\n* Saffron oil serum (Ranavat)\n* Moisturizer: Bakuchiol (retinol alternative from Ranavat)\n* Shani Darden Skin Care Intensive Eye Renewal Cream\n\nA dermatologist recently suggested **Eucerin Radiant Tone Serum (Thiamidol)** for hyperpigmentation, and I’m considering adding it at night.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n* What do you think my routine is missing for hyperpigmentation?\n* Should I incorporate **vitamin C**? If yes, how?\n* Do I need any **AHA exfoliation** like a lactic acid cleanser?\n* What else am I missing?\n\nWould really appreciate any insights, especially from people who focus on gentle routines.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I tried gels, cremes, mousses... they all made my hair crunchy and I had no idea what I was doing wrong. I did a bit more research and then came across a suggestion: curl foams. \n\nAnd wow, at the ripe age of 23, my hair has never looked better.\n\n(obligatory not sponsored by any of these products)\n\nMy routine:\n\n1. Shampoo and Conditioner (Kristen Ess The One Signature Shampoo, Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Conditioner)  \n2. Towel Dry until damp  \n3.

      "content": "MY HISTORY\n\nI’m a 21M. My hair fall started when I was 20, during the 3rd year of my degree. People around me started pointing it out, saying I was getting bald and that my scalp was visible.\n\nI went to a dermatologist who is quite well-known. He diagnosed me with androgenetic alopecia (Stage 3) and told me that with treatment, I’d get my hair back within 6 months. The treatment eventually continued for 11 months.\n\nDuring this period, I used:\nMinoxidil\nFinasteride\nTopinate solution\nHair supplements\nAround month 7, my hair fall stopped. My hair became thicker and I genuinely felt like I got my hair back. Treatment was completed (stopped) in sept 2025.\n\nPRESENT SITUATION:\nBut now, 4 months later, the hair fall has started again. I can see my scalp clearly in the mirror. I wash my hair 3 times a week, and every time I do, I see a bunch of hair clogging the drain — sometimes actual clumps.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\n\nAlmost everyone in my family is bald:\nMy father\nMy uncle\nMy older cousins (father’s side)\nThey all have androgenetic alopecia. One of my cousins faced this very early, tried everything — multiple dermatologists, minoxidil, finasteride — and still ended up bald after spending lakhs on a hair transplant.\n\nCONFUSION ABOUT GENETICS\n\nMy doctor said this condition usually comes from the mother’s side, but all my maternal uncles have excellent hair.\nSo why is this happening to me?\n\nMY QUESTIONS\n\nIf I did everything right — medication, consistency, doctor visits — why is the hair fall back again?\nIs there any real cure, or is everything just temporary?\nEverywhere on Reddit and online, people say minoxidil + finasteride stops hair loss.\nIt worked temporarily for me\nNow it’s happening again\nDo I really need to use these for my entire life just to keep my hair?\nI honestly don’t have the money for expensive lifelong treatments or transplants.\nTo be blunt, it feels like doctors just keep extending treatments and extracting money, without a permanent solution.\n\nCONCLUSION / WHAT I ACTUALLY WANT\n\nMy main goal is simple: I don’t want to go bald this early in life.\nI know people say “looks don’t matter” or “nobody cares,” but the truth is — it does affect social and professional life, especially at this age.\nI don’t care about impressing others.\nI just want to look good and feel confident.\n\nSo I’m asking honestly:\nIs there any realistic way to slow this down long-term?\nOr is early baldness inevitable no matter what I do?\nAny genuine experiences or advice would really help.",

Most routine advice focuses more on actives, treatments, or the second cleanse. There are a few oils in rotation right now, including one from Man:yo and Beplain, and all of them technically do the same job. The difference isn’t removal, it’s how skin behaves after. For people who double cleanse regularly, does the first step actually influence breakouts or sensitivity over time, or is it mostly about comfort?",

      "content": "So I haven't worn my hair naturally wavy/curly in years. My go-to has been to air dry fully, then do overnight curls using a robe tie type-thing. It's been so great for ease of styling, but I've been wishing I could style my hair more naturally, so I've decided I'm going to work towards embracing my natural curls this year. However, my first few attempts at styling have gone terribly, lol. I know I need a really good trim - I have one booked for early next week. There's damage there from highlights (I only get them done once, sometimes twice/year) and I had some shedding due to stress/health issues that seems to finally be resolving. I know it's going to take time but... Can anyone help with some ideas for why my hair is so gross and stringy?! It looks so much fuller than this when I do overnight curls (see last photo). My hair is super fine, I know that. This makes finding the right products challenging. I'm also trying to figure out what curl pattern I have. It looks so much curlier when soaking wet with product in, after being scrunched. But it just dries to this crispy, stringy mess. :( I swear it used to be quite wavy/curly when I used to wear it that way consistently. Like I'd have some actual curls in there. Here's my routine/what I've tried: \n\n1) Double was, then condition (Ouai fine hair shampoo &amp; conditioner), every 2-3 days. Once/week I'll use purple shampoo instead of one of the washes, and every couple weeks I'll use L-Oreal clarifying shampoo because I have hard water. \n\n2) Light spray with L'Oreal Total Repair 5 spray for leave-in/detangling\n\n3) Then for product so far I've tried...\n- Just using JVN air dry cream\n- Just using Design Me Bounce Curl Balm \n- Using L'Oreal dream lengths curl mousse in combination with JVN air dry\n- And then more recently, because I've read that styling creams can be too heavy for fine hair, I've tried Not Your Mother's curl talk mousse and gel (based on suggestions I've read on some posts) - mousse first, then gel.\n\nI apply products to soaking wet hair after detangling and spray with more water as-needed. Then brush style using a knockoff bounce curl brush. I've tried just air-drying and also plopping followed by diffusing, which is the result in pics 1-2. \nPic 3 is after air drying, overnight curls then just fixing the front pieces a little with a flat iron. \n\nI've barely given this two weeks but I feel ready to abandon it LOL. I realize it'll take more time. Can anyone give some guidance/encouragement to help me stick this out?",

Accutane obviously helped the most and I was perfectly clear for about one year, which is also when i switched from the birth control pills I’ve been on for years to an IUD (probably a mistake but I don’t really want to go back).\n\nI noticed my acne start to creep back a few months ago so I went to the derm and started using tazarotene 1% cream, and it unfortunately has only gotten worse. I know there is a purging period but it’s been 3 months of consistent use and my skin looks worse every day. It definitely looks worse IRL than in these pictures.\n\nI am trying to get back in to see the derm but I’m sure it could be months before I can get in, so I need some advice on what to use/try in the meantime and also what to suggest when I finally do get in to see my dermatologist. I am considering spironolactone because I am highly suspicious my acne is hormonal.\n\nAnyways, my current routine (i seriously simplified while on accutane and i’ve been too afraid/lazy to change it up):\n\nAM: cetaphil gentle cleanser, benzoyl peroxide spot treatment as needed, cerave daily moisturizing lotion (or LRP toleraine double repair)\n\nPM: garnier micellar water, cetaphil gentle cleanser, tazarotene, cerave daily moisturizing lotion or LRP toleraine double repair\n\nMy skin is super dry and peely, I’m guessing my moisture barrier is basically ruined because of the tazarotene and the cold dry winter weather but I don’t know what to do without causing more breakouts and inflammation.",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I’m looking for some advice regarding my routine\nI’ve noticed a big difference in my hair depending on whether I use conditioner or not. My current shampoo is Phytorelax Keratin (Revive Your Curls - Anti-frizz with Keratin &amp; Bamboo) and my styling product is Framesi 308 curl cream.\nScenario A (No conditioner): When I only use shampoo and then apply the cream, my curls are amazing. They are defined, thick, and form large, bouncy \"chunky\" clumps. This is exactly the look I’m going for, but they become frizz the next day. \nScenario B (With conditioner): When I add a rinse-out conditioner (Sunsilk Curls) before the styling cream, the curls are still shiny and defined, but they feel kinda heavy and less thick. There are \"more\" curls but they're smaller in both diameter and thickness, and my roots end up looking quite flat compared to when I skip the conditioner.\nMy questions:\nWhy does the conditioner make my curls lose their volume and \"clump\" size?\nIs it possible that the combination of Keratin in my shampoo and the conditioner is weighing my hair down too much?\nHow can I keep the hydration from a conditioner without sacrificing that big, thick curl structure and root volume?\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Should I look for a more lightweight, silicone-free conditioner, or is it okay to just stick to shampoo and cream if my hair likes it better?\nI use Sunsilk ricci da sogno balsamo (Sunsilk dream curls conditoner). My hair are medium length (I'm a guy) between 3A and 3B, I let them dry naturally without a diffuser most of the times, I do only a bit of scrunch with my microfiber towel to not let water drip all over me (this after I applied the curl cream). I use every product that I mentioned every time that I wash my hair, once every 2 days.",
