Even though I have press ons and have nail art experience, I get scared to do my nails or get lazy and always regret it when I leave the house. \n\nHowever there are women in my lives who are always hairless, new nails every 2 weeks, and shiny hair. If this sounds like you how do you do stay motivated? I unfortunately always compare myself to these women but do nothing about it. Whenever I have free time , the first thing I’m not thinking is to feel attractive(which I wish it was) I just watch TV and fall asleep. So in basic terms how do you guys make “beauty maintenance” the equivalent of binging a show ,if that makes sense?",

However when I put my head upside down it looks really nice! \n\nI had curly hair when I was a child but when growing up, I used to bleach my hair and cut them really short so there was absolutely no curl pattern. \nI’m in the process of growing my hair long and they always looked curly-ish while wet so I wanted to try this new routine.\n\nWhat do you think? \nShould I keep doing this routine or my hair pattern isn’t worth it? \nAlso why does it look fabulous upside down but terrible in a normal position? Should I get a better haircut with layers? Idk \n\nThanks for your advices!\n",

It’s gotten worse in my 30s. I have oily skin with little white pimples around my eyes and forehead, crater scars from old acne, black spots on my nose, random large pimples on my forehead, and red bumps around my beard line.\n\nMy current routine:\nAM: CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser → Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream → La Roche Posay Anthelios Ultra-Light Fluid Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50\nPM: CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser → Shave → Retin-A (Tretinoin) 0.05% → CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream\n\nI just bought Naturium BHA Liquid Exfoliant 2% and The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toner but I’m not sure how to fit them in with Retin-A or if they’re even right for me.\n\nI’ve learned a lot from this sub but I’m overwhelmed and embarrassed because I still can’t get my skin under control. Could someone help me figure out a clear routine and whether I should adjust any products? Thank you so much.",

      "content": "I have been celibate for 4.5 years, and am finally being intimate with someone I care about. Except the first time we did it, I was ashamed of my full bush. So I decided to have my first Brazilian wax at a highly rated place. I did it on 9/24… and am still having issues. The lady seemed to know what she was doing, was comforting, etc. so I believe it might be my skin, not her. \n\nI have a DARK Venus mound… I will admit I did not wash up as soon as I got home from the appt. I let it be, gently patted it with hypoallergenic wipes (I was exhausted) and showered in the morning. I don’t think this would be a huge deal, but I ultimately woke up with a few ingrowns. No big deal, those go away.\n\nThen I developed SEVERAL tiny white bumps ALL over… and noticed my skin are significantly darker. I have been cleaning it with unscented soap, applying hypochlorous acid spray, using alcohol-free witch hazel a couple times a week (it’s been 1.5 weeks), applying aloe Vera gel, and wearing loose clothing. Nothing is helping. And I’m afraid to try anything else. \n\nI already suffer from acne, some KP, and milia on my chest. I have sensitive skin but I didn’t think this was even a risk..\n\nThe lady told me after 2 days, sex should be fine. So, I had sex and unexpectedly slept over. I brought my hypochlorous acid spray to mitigate the heat in his apartment.\n\nI went home to it worse than the day before. Then it got better. And I’ve been babying it ever since. And I feel like it just wont get better anymore. I’m ashamed and told him I don’t want to have sex anymore until this heals.. I’m worried this will drive him away or make him distant. \n\nI’m devastated because it’s been so long for me. And now I want to hide again, for this reason alone. I never had this issue before with shaving or anything. Please help. I’m at a loss. ",

What am I doing wrong?\n\nMy current routine:\n- suave clarifying shampoo (every 3 week)\n- Umberto giannini curl jelly shampoo \n- Umberto giannini curl jelly conditioner \n- tsubaki hair mask (leave in for 40 minutes)(every 3 weeks, I do it when I clarify my hair but my hair still ends up\nsuper frizzy)\n- kinky curly knot today leave in (just switched to this from cake curl whip mousse because I was worried it was drying out my hair and wanted to go for more natural products)\n- style with bounce curl brush (very badly)\n- glaze curlsmith hydro style flexi jelly \n- dry with t shirt and air dry \n- refresh with just water \n\nI’m based in Australia so I would really appreciate product suggestions that are available here 😭😭😭\n\n\n",

      "content": "For the last year and a half or so, I’ve been diying a copper money piece and idk how I feel about it anymore! I included pictures of my pretty much freshly dyed, as well as pictures showing various phases of the fading process. The last picture is what it looks like currently, very faded and subtle as I haven’t redyed it or even touched up my roots in months bc I can’t figure out what I want to do with it. I used to love it freshly dyed but now I think I like it more after it’s faded a bit…should I use a more muted dye? I have a few boxes of the brighter coral dye I have been using for a while (it’s hi-lift so I haven’t used any bleach) so could I use those and just leave them on for a few minutes less than the box instructs you to?\nI also I’m also getting married in a year and I know that’s a long time away but I want to start thinking about how my hair is going to look at my wedding! Should I go fully copper? I really don’t like damaging my hair but I really wanted some kind of change from my regular brown, so I thought a money piece would be kind of a compromise. But for my wedding I think I would be willing to color my whole head lol. I would definitely want my hair dresser to do that though! She knows I have been box dyeing my money piece. This may be nitpicky and idk if I will be working it in the best way but I also don’t like how the money piece looks so wide and…chunky? At the top of my head but the section looks so thin at the bottom. I hope that made sense and hopefully the pictures I included show what I’m trying to describe lol. Is there a way to fix that or is that just how it looks on other people too and I’ve never noticed? I would love to just have my hair dresser do it but I know that will require so much upkeep and I’m in a financial crunch rn. I want a regular haircut/trim and that alone is $60 before tip. I don’t want to find a new hairdresser so please don’t suggest that lol. But in regards to my hair, help me decide what to do!",

      "content": "And is there any way to prevent it?\n\n36F, white (since relevant to hair texture). \n\nI've always thought of my hair as 'thin' but am told it's not thin, it's fine.  It has a wave to it depending on conditions. I live in a very dry climate and it's straight here, but as soon as I'm in humidity it gets wavy and it'll curl a bit in the rain etc.  \n\nMy hair is shoulder length, I've wanted it longer my whole life but never been able to get it there. Hair stylists' feedback is always that it's super dry and they give me moisture recommendations, and they say I need to get it trimmed often. But the thing is, a month after a trim my ends already feel gross and need another trim to the point of cutting off the new length plus more. I finally realized that's because it's not just the ends that are breaking, it's along the entire length of my hair all throughout my head even up high. There's no area, it's just weak and broken evenly throughout. \n\nAll the fancy moisturizing recommendations don't seem to make a difference. I switched to silk hair ties.  \nMy hair looks like that of someone who mistreats it or is unhealthy but WHYYY. I literally never use heat products or dye it or do anything to it, never have. I am vegetarian but I take B12, along with omega 3s and other vitamins. I eat healthfully, I drink water, I exercise daily, I'm healthy, up to date on lab work. \n\nI don't get it. How can I fix my hair so it's not something I am frustrated by every day 😫",

      "content": "I have been celibate for 4.5 years, and am finally being intimate with someone I care about. Except the first time we did it, I was ashamed of my full bush. \n\nSo, I decided to have my first Brazilian wax at a highly rated place. I did it on 9/24… and am still having issues. The lady seemed to know what she was doing, was comforting, etc. so I believe it might be my skin, not her. \n\nAs a result of the wax, I now have a DARK Venus mound… I will admit I did not wash up as soon as I got home from the appt. I let it be, gently patted it with hypoallergenic wipes (I was exhausted) and showered in the morning. I didn’t think this would be a huge deal, but I ultimately woke up with a few ingrowns. No big deal, those go away.\n\nThen I developed SEVERAL tiny white bumps ALL over… and noticed my skin is significantly darker. Like, BROWN (I’m light olive toned). I have been cleaning it with unscented soap, applying hypochlorous acid spray, using alcohol-free witch hazel a couple times a week (it’s been 1.5 weeks), applying aloe Vera gel, and wearing loose clothing. Nothing is helping. And I’m afraid to try anything else.\n\nI already suffer from acne, some KP, and milia on my chest. I have sensitive skin but I didn’t think this was even a risk..\n\nThe lady told me after 2 days, sex should be fine. So, I had sex with him a second time, hesitantly, and covering my mound.. and unexpectedly slept over. I brought my hypochlorous acid spray to mitigate the heat in his apartment.\n\nI went home to it worse than the day before. Then it got better. And I’ve been babying it ever since. And I feel like it just wont get better anymore. I’m ashamed and told him I don’t want to have sex anymore until this heals.. I’m worried this will drive him away or make him distant. \n\nI’m devastated because it’s been so long for me. And now I want to hide again, for this reason alone. I never had this issue before with shaving or anything. Please help.. I’m at a loss. ",
