I remember i was on a solo trip to goa and i would wake up with hundreds of hair strands near my dorm bed. \nIts been 4 months \nThis is all i did\n\nInitially i started using oil but then I remembered once a dermat told me that when your roots are weak … oiling is the worst thing you can do to your hair.\n\nSo i didn’t really stop oiling i just oiled once a month\nI also used minimalist hair actives for a month. I still have some of it left… its good i use it once in a while.\n\n What actually helped? \nInitially this hair active serum helped me\nThen i switched to DIY rosemary spray … nothing fancy just boil some rosemary (got it from blinkit under 30 rs) and some methi dana ( fenugreek seeds)… this literally lasted me for 3 months… i store it in a glass bottle in the fridge and keep transferring it to my small spray bottle\nI use it 3-4 times a day \nIt does not make your hair oily … infact it makes your scalp fresh and less itchy\nYou have to massage your hair a little everytime you apply it ( if your hair is too brittle, i suggest don’t massage with pressure… just use your fingertips)\n\nI switched my pillowcase to a satin pillowcase\nI travel quite often so i have this satin haircover that i use everynight.\nTie your hair before sleeping.\n\nP.S. give yourself atleast 2 months to see a noticeable difference \n\nP.S 2 - i know this is not a 180 degrees result but its way better than the second picture. \n1st picture was clicked on diwali ( i straightened my hair) \n2nd was taken in july 1st week",

It was my first time visiting this specific stylist, a famous curl specialist in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nMy hair was a few inches longer and without layers before. I only asked her to try to cut a couple inches and do some soft blended layers, to give some movement to the hair. I specifically told her I didn't want short layers on top, because thats the most dry and coarse part of my hair.\n\nIsn't it exactly what was done? I feel like the layers look so rough and unbalanced (this is my fay 3 hair, btw). I know this could maybe be a shaggy cut, but it wasn't what I wanted. A similar situation happened a couple years ago, another stylist gave me a shaggy/mullet looking cut when I asked for a short bob 🫠.\n\nThe cut looks more blended  when I use very little product on my styling routine and do a wash and go, but then I get a ton of frizz and my hair lose definition quick. \n\nHas this happened to you before? Let's chat ❣️\n\n",

I normally diffuse my hair. I make sure when putting product in my hair it’s doused with water and is like that when it’s time to diffuse.

      "content": "I recently bought a bonnet to protect my hair while sleeping, while it does keep my hair about equally voluminous; it doesn't do much to actually protect my curls themselves from getting crushed/straightened. My current routine is:\n- Gather all my hair and put it in a ponytail at the front of my head\n- Fold my hair on itself to make a bun\n- Put bonnet on\n- Put rubber band over bonnet to keep it in place. (This doesn't touch my hair)\n\nMy main idea for what could be going wrong would be the size of the bonnet. I think it's made for shorter hair than mine (about shoulder length) so the top of it presses against the bun that I have. It was also pretty cheap so it's also possible that the material is the issue, it's satin but probably isn't the highest quality. \n\nAnother thought would be the scrunchie I use, it's not silk or satin and is kind of tight. Although it mainly goes around the top of my hair, which is mainly straighter due to my hair pattern. Thoughts/suggestions?",

      "content": "Hi! As you can guess from the title, I really need a new routine. Some assorted info to start. I live by Lake Michigan, so humid but windy climate. I don't wear makeup. My acne fluctuates with my cycle, clearing up the most before my period and being the worst during and right after it.\n\nI have combination skin. Really oily on my forehead and nose, mildly oily on my chin, normal on my cheeks. One deviation is that the area around my nostrils is usually dry (red, itchy, and flaky when it's really bad). It's annoying to deal with since slathering moisturizer on it usually gets on my actual, already oily nose and makes me break out (as you can see in the pictures with this latest nose pimple).\n\nMy routine right now\n\nAM\n1. Cleanse with Method Simply Nourish Body Wash (done in the shower, sometimes I do it twice on my nose since the pores around there are very visible and get clogged really easily)\n2. Moisturize/sunscreen with CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Lotion with Sunscreen for Normal to Oily Skin.\n3. As needed, CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin around my nostrils or on my whole face if it's still tight\n\nPM\nNothing. I really want to add something here since it's probably why I wake up so oily and clogged and need to scrub so hard (I only use my hands) and use overly-drying \"cleansing,\" but I don't know what to do. I've heard good things about Ponds I guess??\n\nIn the past, I've used Dove Beauty Bars, CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, and CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser. The hydrating cleanser did nothing (and this is silly but I also hated the feeling of it). The beauty bars and foaming facial cleanser worked well enough on the normal parts of my face but didn't clear out my clogged pores very well even with scrubbing.\n\nI use the body wash since it clears out my pores on my nose fairly well, but I know it's super drying because my face gets really tight once I'm out of the shower and dried, and it stays that way until I put on my sunscreen. Even with the dryness, my T-zone gets noticeably oily within a few hours.\n\nI would prefer cheap recommendations, I'm a quintessential broke college student 🙃\n\nThank you!!",
