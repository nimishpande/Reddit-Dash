      "content": "Hi everyone. About six months ago I posted here in a pretty desperate mood and shared a picture of what I thought was my completely unrully hair. Even back then some people were sceptical, because my hair can look good sometimes, but the issue was always that it only lasted for a day. After that the curls disappeared and I had to redo everything every single morning, which was exhausting.\n\nFor context, I straightened my hair from around age 13 for almost ten years. I have only been properly embracing my natural curls for about a year and a half, so I am definitely still figuring things out.\n\nA few months ago I got the full Bali Curls line as a gift, and since then I have actually stuck to one routine. I now wash my hair with the Bali Curls Nourishing Shampoo and Bali Curls Nourishing Conditioner, brush it while it is wet, then comb through a small amount of Bali Curls Curl Cream. After that I apply a generous but not excessive amount of the Bali Curls Curl Defining Gel. I learned the hard way that too much gel just makes my hair feel heavy and lifeless (even though a lot of peole commented on my last post that theres no such a thing as too much gel, thats just not how it works for me)\n\nI scrunch with a cotton T shirt, plop for a few minutes, then diffuse. I start diffusing without touching my hair and only scrunch later. I never fully dry it because that would take forever. After about half an hour I scrunch in a bit of hair oil (honetsly I just use whatever brand is at my hands) and that is usually when things start looking good. I also use the Bali Curls Heat Protection Spray whenever I diffuse.\n\nOn non wash days I refresh with water from a spray bottle and usually diffuse a little in the morning if I am going out. I do not add extra product. The biggest change is that my hair now actually lasts. It still needs refreshing, but it does not completely fall apart anymore, and it finally looks like curls instead of a daily mystery.\n\nThanks again to everyone who commented on my original post. You were more right than I wanted to admit.",

So I've been pondering on whether or not I should be doing this as I'm currently in the process of planning to buy the Cetaphil moisturizing cream (and I'm being gifted some really good lotion/s, so that's that). I have pretty dry/dehydrated, sensitive skin so my derma suggested I use cetaphil. I also have a lot of dark spots due to hyperpigmentation and because I used to squeeze out my pimples and blackheads when I was younger. Thing is, I don't really know how to use these products properly especially since it's my first time doing skin care.\n\n Thank you so much in advance! I really appreciate it! ",

On no-washing days I apply some conditioner or hair mask because otherwise hair feels too frizzy and dry.\n\nNote that I train around 4/5 times a week and SWEAT a lot during my trainings, and I try to wash 3x per week.

The reason I bought this is because I want to address my redness and hyperpigmentation, and it indeed removed my hyperpigmentation but it really takes time. Lots of TikTok videos show that the hyperpigmentation would just be gone within a week, and I have to say, it’s not that magical. Aside from that, the texture likes a silky gel, which I like.\n",

But on top of that, every time they come back they're stuck under my skin for the longest time. I always see them coming and it looks like a black dot under my skin. It annoys me so much. \n\nI'm probably overthinking but I feel like people can see them and I also hate knowing they're there and I end up picking my skin a bit to get to them and try to pluck them. Sometimes it works, sometimes I can't get them... either way I'm left with a red sore from picking :( which is obviously worse than the initial dot but meh.\n\nIs there anything I can do to get these suckers out without picking? I try to exfoliate but I already have dry, sensitive skin and it doesn't help much.",

I love the results at first, but realistically I only get about 2 months before the treatment starts growing out and I end up cutting the blowout out.\n\nFor shampoo and conditioner, I currently use Native, and I typically don’t use any products in my hair at all. I used to use old spice putty but it never  worked. I’m not sure if that’s helping or hurting with frizz. The blowouts are also pretty expensive, so I’m trying to find a better long-term solution.\n\nDoes anyone have legit product recommendations for thick/frizzy men’s hair? Shampoos, conditioners, leave-ins, styling creams — anything that actually works. TikTok hasn’t been helpful since everyone is just promoting their own product.",

If I let it air dry after brushing it, using a leave in conditioner and curl cream — when it fully dries, it looks almost straight. \n\nIf I want it to look more curly/voluminous, I have to put a TON of product in, diffuse it for a long time and even then it just doesn’t look the way I was expecting. Plus, my hair then feels like I just have so much product in it. \n\nI was hoping for big curls/waves, but ones that actually bounce back if I brush through or something (I don’t want to not brush my hair ever?!). Instead, when I brush my hair it literally looks less curly/wavy than when I’d braid my hair the night before and let it out the next day. Also, there are parts of my hair that are totally straight and when I style it I have to put extra product and extra work into those parts to “force” them to have a wave/curl. \n\nI don’t think this is how a perm should be/look? Am I doing something wrong when styling? What did the hairdresser do wrong here? Is there anything I can do right now (get this corrected with another perm or something?). HELP! ",

      "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore anyone jumps in with “confidence is attractive” or “personality matters,” let me stop you right there. Yes, people like me. I make friends easily. I’m respected at work. People enjoy talking to me, hanging out with me, opening up to me. I’m treated well as a human being. But love? Desire? Romantic interest? That’s where the story changes. Being a man is never easy.\n\nBecause I don’t fit the Indian beauty standard for men.\n\nI don’t have that “clean,” “bright,” “presentable” look our society is obsessed with. No matter how well I dress or groom myself, how articulate I am, my skin tone quietly disqualifies me before my personality even gets a chance. It’s always subtle, never openly cruel but it’s there. You can feel it in the hesitation, the polite rejection, the “you are such a nice guy” energy.\n\nDating apps make this even worse. Swipe culture reduces you to a photo, and Indian swipe culture reduces you further to skin tone. You can literally feel that people appreciate you but don’t want you. They will talk, laugh and they will say that you are amazing, then choose someone lighter without a second thought.\n\nWhat hurts the most is that I actually like who I am. I have worked on myself. I’m confident without being arrogant. I’m emotionally aware. I’m stable. I know I’d be a good partner. I don’t hate myself. I just hate that society keeps telling me indirectly, that I’m lovable but not desirable.\n\nAnd no, this isn’t about wanting validation from everyone. I just wish someone would love me for who I am, without subconsciously wishing I looked different. I wish attraction wasn’t so tightly tied to colonial hangovers and fairness ads disguised as “preferences.”\n\nI’m tired of pretending this doesn’t affect me. It does. You can be strong and still feel unwanted. You can be confident and still wish, quietly, that someone chose you without compromise.\n\nI don’t want to be everyone’s favorite friend. I want to be someone’s first choice.\n\nThat’s it. That’s the rant. Thank you for reading. I wish I had someone in my life but it seems like a far fetched dream. I wish someone talks to me or love me at least",

Made a dumb decision by taking oral min 2.5 MG before starting fin, which I was already aware that u need a DHT blocker to actually target the root cause, but I was 18 and caught it early on, but all that fin fear mongering was getting to me so I was thinking I can push it a couple of years till I start taking it.\n\nBut Norwood reaper still wanted a piece of me, I started slowly losing density ( specially along side my part line ) and my hairline started pushing back. I turned 20 a month ago and ever since I've started oral fin.\n\nI'm now 20, and already on oral min+fin which if you ask me, is an overkill. I'm aware that stopping oral min abruptly will cause me to lose most my progress? But what about the overlap with fin? I would also rather just be on fin but I'm not sure if that's enough, I clearly responded well to min but who knows with fin.\n\nIs my safest bet is to stay on fin+min for maybe another year, then taper off min while using topical? Or I'll introduce topical a couple of months before I started tapering off min?",
