I only applied it over moisturizer and used even half of pea size amount.\n\nBut this time I used it on bare skin without the moisturizer.\n\nSince next morning my face started to become dark. I obviously didn't use anything else after that. Just Cetaphil moisturizer, Cetaphil cleanser and put simply sunscreen. I thought my skin would recover by itself. Since there was no damage just skin darkening and I had already stopped using retinol. But it's not getting better and right now I'm actively developing a hyperpigmentation spot. It's red now. But I feel like it will turn brown. I applied aloe vera gel over it.\n\nWhat else can I do?",

I’d really appreciate some guidance from people who’ve actually been through this.\n\nShort background:\nGrowing up, I didn’t really take care of my skin  lots of sun exposure, stress, and inconsistent habits. Over time, my face became darker and uneven compared to my hands/legs, which still look closer to my original skin tone.\nNow I’m fixing things slowly and properly.\n\n(I’m also posting a leg photo for reference so you can see the tone difference.)\n\nCurrent routine (doctor recommended):\n\nGentle face wash\n\nBrightening / depigmentation serum\n\nBarrier-repair moisturizer\n\nSunscreen (this is where I need help)\n\n\nMy skin type:\nNormal to sensitive. Not naturally oily, but some products make my skin look shiny.\n\nMain question (sunscreen):\nWhich would be better for my skin?\n\n1. La Shield Lite SPF 40+ PA+++\n\n\n2. La Shield Fisico Matte Gel\n\n\n\nI’ve read mixed reviews. I even saw one girl mention that she experienced white cast, which made me a bit confused. Since sunscreen is something I’ll use daily, I want to choose carefully.\n\nAlso asking for advice 🙏:\n\nHow can I gradually get back my original skin tone (face matching body)?\n\nAny habits, ingredients, or mistakes I should be careful about?\n\nAnything you personally did that actually worked long-term?\n\n\nGoal:\nHealthy, even-toned skin \nnothing extreme, just consistency and patience ✨\n\nThank you so much for reading. I’d really value your honest experiences 💛",

      "content": "Hello everyone, I‘m feeling really sad right now and could use some advice. English isn’t my first language so please excuse any mistakes.\n\nI used to have long hair down to my butt. I wanted some face-framing layers and soft curtain bangs, so I went to a hair salon that had a 4.9-star rating on Google. Before this, I only got trims once or twice a year in another country, where I knew my hairdresser.\n\nI showed the stylist a picture and mentioned that next time I might want to do a glossing treatment. The salon owner suggested doing a semi-permanent color (intensive color) a few shades darker, saying it would suit me perfectly, and offered to do it the same day. I agreed, since my hair was natural and I didn’t really understand the differences between hair coloring methods at the time. As I understand now, it wasn’t just a glossing treatment.\n\nWe agreed to cut 10 cm (about 4 inches), but they ended up cutting 20 cm (about 8 inches). I was really sad and heartbroken—but that wasn’t even the worst part. I don’t know if it happened because of the hooded hair dryer (the heating device they put over your head) or because the stylist blow-dried my hair too aggressively with too much heat. My hair structure has changed, and some parts are completely damaged. Some strands of hair look wavy or curly, but my hair is naturally straight. And if i slide my fingers over the weird looking hair it feels like there are many ,,bumps“ all over it (u can see in the pictures what i mean.)\n\nI know my hair wasn’t perfectly healthy before. it had split ends, etc. but this is really a mess.\n\nI don’t know what products to use. Protein shampoos (Kérastase nutritive) sometimes make my hair even frizzier, and I’m so afraid my hair will never be that long again. And that the damage get even worse. Do you have any tips? I’m so heartbroken I feel like crying every day.\n\nFeel free to give me your opinions or tips..",

      "content": "\nHi everyone 🌸\nI’m currently following a dermatologist-prescribed skincare routine and I’m genuinely committed to improving my skin in a healthy, long-term way. I’d really appreciate some guidance from people who’ve actually been through this.\n\nShort background:\nGrowing up, I didn’t really take care of my skin — lots of sun exposure, stress, and inconsistent habits. Over time, my face became darker and uneven compared to my hands/legs, which still look closer to my original skin tone.\nNow I’m fixing things slowly and properly.\n\n(I’m also posting a leg photo for reference so you can see the tone difference.)\n\nCurrent routine (doctor recommended):\n\nGentle face wash\n\nBrightening / depigmentation serum\n\nBarrier-repair moisturizer\n\nSunscreen (this is where I need help)\n\n\nMy skin type:\nNormal to sensitive. Not naturally oily, but some products make my skin look shiny.\n\nMain question (sunscreen):\nWhich would be better for my skin?\n\n1. La Shield Lite SPF 40+ PA+++\n\n\n2. La Shield Fisico Matte Gel\n\n\n\nI’ve read mixed reviews. I even saw one girl mention that she experienced white cast, which made me a bit confused. Since sunscreen is something I’ll use daily, I want to choose carefully.\n\nAlso asking for advice 🙏:\n\nHow can I gradually get back my original skin tone (face matching body)?\n\nAny habits, ingredients, or mistakes I should be careful about?\n\nAnything you personally did that actually worked long-term?\n\n\nGoal:\nHealthy, even-toned skin nothing extreme, just consistency and patience ✨\n\nThank you so much for reading. I’d really value your honest experiences 💛\n",

      "content": "Hi guys!\n\nI’m planning to **introduce retinol** into my skincare routine for the first time and would love some advice from people with similar skin types.\n\nFor reference I'm 28 y/o female and I have combination skin, somewhat acne-prone (mostly hormonal breakouts), and my main goals are:\n\n* preventing early fine lines\n* improving overall skin quality, texture and tone\n* helping with acne ( hopefully without triggering a strong purging phase)\n\nMy goal is to:\n\n* Prevent early fine lines / anti-aging\n* Improve overall skin quality, texture and tone\n* Reduce acne and breakouts *without triggering an intense purging phase*\n\nI’m currently considering one of these two serums:\n\n* **CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol**\n* **La Roche-Posay Retinol B3**\n* I’ve considered **Differin/adapalene**, but I’m worried it might be too aggressive for a beginner and for my current goals.\n\nFrom my understanding:\n\n* Avoid in the same routine: AHA/BHA acids, benzoyl peroxide, strong exfoliation\n* Safe to combine with: hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, ceramides, gentle moisturizers\n\nPlanned routine:\n\n* AM: cleanser → daily moisturizer with HA → SPF 30–50\n* PM (1–2x/week for the first part, then increase to 2-3x/week and then to max 5-6x/week): cleanse → night moisturizer → retinol (pea-size) → moisturizer again if needed\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts:\n\n* Which retinol did you start with?\n* Do you think these are good beginner choices, or would you suggest a different product?\n* Any tips to minimize breakouts or irritation?\n\nThanks so much! 🙏",

Looking for a moisturiser to use here, please suggest the best one.\n\nResults-\n\nCleanser: i’ve been using for about 6-7 months now and i dont know if it works but i have noticed that oil production has reduced in my T-zone. It has never broken my skin out or anything harsh like that so I’ll probably repurchase it and continue using it.\n\nSunscreen: Been using this since the start of summer this year so around March, and I quite like it. Again I honestly don’t know if it’s doing anything because I have fair skin with redness on my cheeks 😭. But I haven’t tanned so i guess it’s working? It’s light-weight, blends into my skin quick, no white-cast, and the texture is thin, not thick at all, hasn’t caused any breakouts so I have recently repurchased it and will continue using it.\n\nToner: Just bought it a week ago, no clue if it’s working or not, hasn’t caused a breakout, let’s see if it reduces pores as it claims. Will update in the comments if I notice improvements.\n\nSerum: Definitely noticed a difference from the first week itself, I used 5% for like 6 months and it hardly did anything so I started using 10%, I can see the redness reducing and other people have noticed it too so i’ll keep using this one.\n\nTLDR: Sharing my review of these 4 products &amp; Requesting y’all to drop some advice/comments about my routine, what other serums I can try to reduce redness and acne scars, and please suggest a good moisturiser for my skin type.",

I have a lot of baby hairs/flyaways, especially at the front and top, and my hair doesn’t lay smoothly even though it’s not very thick. Lately it also looks flatter than before.\n\nI don’t bleach or color my hair and I rarely use heat tools. I’m not looking for permanent straightening I just want:\n\tsmoother, softer appearance, less frizz and flyaways, healthy, natural shine (not flat or greasy)\n\nI’m attaching photos for reference.\nWould love advice on:\n\tproducts (serums, leave-ins, masks), routines for fine hair, whether salon smoothing treatments are worth it or not\n\nThanks in advance 🤍\n",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

Basically any tips, tricks, or advice from anyone here that has the same or similar hair type as me or anyone familiar with working with my hair type would be much appreciated.\n\nPhoto #1 was before I quit the constant bleaching and hair dye \n\nPhoto #2 is day one trying to bring out the curls \n\nPhotos #3 &amp; #4 are from today \n\nClearly something is happening cuz it’s curling’s heck of a lot more than when I started but I also am not feeling very confident with my natural hair texture so far and feel like I’m doing something wrong. \n\nMy routine currently is using the not your mothers curl talk line \n\nIn the shower:\n\n\\-I wash my hair/scalp every 3-4 days with NYM curl talk bond repair shampoo. About a half dollar amount\n\n\\- then I use the NYM curl talk 3 in 1 conditioner. About a quarter size amount \n\nAfter shower: \n\n\\- I apply NYM curl talk leave in conditioner (just a 2-3 spritz).\n\n\\- then I follow with about a golf ball amount of NYM curl talk mousse and scrunch it in once I work it thru my hair. \n\n\\- lastly I use a dime size of NYM curl talk sculpting gel and work it thru my hair and scrunch with a cotton t-shirt once dry I re-scrunch out the crunchy bits. \n\nRefresh days: a half dollar size of mousse on damp hair, re-scrunch, let dry then I scrunch out any crunchy bits. \n\nI try to diffuse on low heat when I have the energy but I get dizzy holding my arms up so long so I tend to air dry most days, and I do sleep with a silk pillow case (I don’t use bonnets because don’t like the sensory of something on my head while I sleep)  \n\nFor additional relevant detail/context, I have fine hair, medium density and high porosity.",
