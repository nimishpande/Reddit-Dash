      "title": "Before &amp; After Cutting Length and Dyeing My Hair",
      "content": "Hi! I’m sharing my current curly hair routine and would love any feedback.\n\nHair &amp; Background:\n\nI have medium-density curly hair. I recently cut my hair from mid-back length to a medium length (just above the trapezius/collarbone area) and also had it professionally dyed. I don’t chemically straighten my hair.\n\nWash Schedule:\n\nI wash my hair every 2–3 days. Between washes, I thoroughly rinse my hair with water only.\n\nCleanse:\n\nOn wash days, I start by rinsing my hair thoroughly with water. I then use VIONA 2% ketoconazole shampoo, applying it mainly to my scalp, letting it sit briefly, and rinsing thoroughly. About once a month, I use AG Care Balance &amp; Boost Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo instead.\n\nCondition &amp; Treatments:\n\nAfter shampooing, I condition with SheaMoisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Shine Conditioner, applying it to mid-lengths and ends and rinsing it out fully. Every 1–2 weeks, I use AG Care Nourish Snow Mushroom Moisture Mask in place of regular conditioner, leaving it on for a few minutes before rinsing. About once a month, I also use AG Care Balance &amp; Boost Apple Cider Vinegar Conditioner.\n\nLeave-In &amp; Styling:\n\nImmediately after turning off the shower, while my hair is still very damp, I apply my leave-in and styling products. First, I use AG Care Fast Food Leave-On Conditioner (about a half baby-carrot sized amount), scrunching it into my hair and up toward the roots. Then I apply AG Care Re:coil Curl Activator, using about 1–2 pea-sized amounts, and scrunch again.\n\nDrying:\n\nI diffuse my hair, spending time diffusing all the way down to the scalp to maximize curl definition and spring.\n\nSleep Routine:\n\nI sleep on a silk pillowcase. I used to sleep with a silk bonnet, but found it compressed my curls too much overnight. Since my hair is shorter now, the pillowcase alone has been working better for preserving curl shape.\n\nNotes:\n\nSince cutting my hair shorter, my curls feel noticeably bouncier, springier, and more alive. My hair is much easier to manage and control at this length, and my curl pattern really shows up better overall. I’m really happy with how light and healthy it feels now.\n\nOpen to any routine feedback or styling suggestions. Thanks!",

      "content": "Hi everyone, back with an update. For context, I originally found this sub while researching options for my boyfriend’s thinning hair and put together a treatment plan for him. Basically started on September 26 with Topical minoxidil 5% (AM + PM) and Oral finasteride 1 mg daily. Additionally there were 3 PRP sessions: October 3 , November 14 and December 19\n\nIt’s been just over 4 months total and about 6 weeks since PRP #3. I’m so pleasantly surprised ! Going forward the plan is to stay consistent with fin + min and start dermastamping next week. ",

      "content": "Man, I’m telling you just buy these from [Costco.com](http://Costco.com) (as a nonmember) or buy legit ones. I can’t believe somebody would make a fake of a $15 package. It’s ridiculous. I’m so pissed I’m seven months into pouring a mystery fluid on my scalp. And it’s strange because I initially had a shedding without really changing my oral medication.\n\n\\*edit\\* the bleach test apparently isn’t consistent because some people will just dilute the formula so that it will pass. As well as they put that other ingredient in instead of minoxidil. Wow. so much effort to counterfeit $2 bottles. \n\nSo I’ve noticed lately that my hair stopped improving after I got the initial shed. I just opened up my new package from the same seller and it’s the same outdated packaging. The outside is I believe the new packaging, but the bundles are the old packaging that Kirkland doesn’t use as of over a year ago in discontinued all sale of.\n\nFirst, the lid wouldn’t screw on and I’m like what what’s going on OK this is super fishy like Kirkland doesn’t know how to make a bottle that can screw on? When you look at the text on the bottles it’s very different. The colorations are different hues by a small percentage like the yellow text has like a haze around it and a dark quality color on one and the other one it’s like Jimmy counterfeit printed it off their computer printer.\n\nThe bottles are also different sizes. One has two threads and the other has three threads, which is why they won’t screw together. The new bottles are also different size.\n\nFinally, we have the bleach test absolutely nothing it just made it clearer  EBAY purchased with lots of positive reviews. You have to remember that people don’t know anything and they will leave positive reviews, especially in the hair medication world without even confirming if it works or not. Like you know on Amazon, for example where they say, I haven’t even used it yet or it’s been a week, but it’s great and they leave five star reviews. Or like dating apps for example how they don’t work at all but for some reason, people pay for them and leave overwhelmingly positive reviews for something that doesn’t work for what it was made for. Lol. Reviews aren’t the end all.\n\nSee pics included.",

It feels like I change products every year or so because “the new thing” comes out.\nWhat SHOULD I be doing for my skin to stay healthy at this age? I usually use a gentle cleanser in the morning and moisturizer. Then at night an acne cleanser and nighttime moisturizer. \nI have pretty combo skin. I can break out (not as much anymore thank god) and often get oily but at same time feel dried out, if that’s possible? The internet is a dark hole of skincare and it’s like fast fashion has taken over skincare with all of the new brands and products being marketed.\nSo- any advice on products for woman no longer in their 20s with flawless skin?? Brands are appreciated too. I always hear about retinol, double cleansing, etc. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I have quite sensitive skin so I’m cautious about putting too many things in my routine, niacinamide broke me out quite a bit when i used it so i gave up. Would it be worth starting a low % retinol?\n\nIf you have any recommendations for switching up my cleansers or moisturisers please let me know 🙏🏻 i feel like I should finally take the time to have an actual functional routine rather than the easiest things I can get my hands on…so i would really appreciate advice on what products are best!\n\nFor context im 21 F and only wear makeup if im going out + avoid putting concealer or foundation on as i dont want it to make me break out 😔",

      "content": "I’ve always had really good skin. I tend to run dry, never oily and I only ever got an occasional pimple that would go away easily with salicylic acid spot treatment.\n\nIn the fall I started using a low dose tretinoin and hydroquinone from Agency for anti aging and to help fade some hyperpigmentation and not long after that I started breaking out around my mouth and chin. They aren’t whiteheads or normal pimples its more like a ton of small textured bumps and congestion.\n\nBut now im getting actual whiteheads in the same area and also around my nose and between my eyebrows and forehead and it feels like im getting one or two new ones every day.\n\nI stopped all my other skincare and now im only using la roche posay purifying cleanser cerave moisturizing cream and de la cruz sulfur.\n\nI stopped tretinoin mid December and its now the end of January but my skin still isnt getting better which is why im so confused.\n\nI went to a derm and she wants to give me aklief said its targeted for acne but she didnt really explain whats going on with my skin. I asked if its ok to start that with this going on and she said yes but im scared it will make things worse.\n\nI dont know if this is still purging or if I damaged my skin barrier or if I somehow triggered acne I never had before.\n\nHas anyone been through something like this or had this happen after tretinoin for anti aging? did aklief help or make it worse? any advice would be appreciated because this has been really frustrating and confusing.",

I’ve been washing it every 3-4 days. \n\nCurrent Routine:\n\nDouble shampoo (Goldwell Hydrating shampoo)\n\nDetangle\n\nConditioner (Goldwell Hydrating Conditioner)\n\nBrush through with conditioner in\n\nRinse conditioner out\n\nApply Goldwell Defining Cream to soaking wet hair\n\nApply Leave In Conditioner to soaking wet hair\n\nBrush leave in through\n\nApply and scrunch in  Goldwell Bundling Gel\n\nDry with microfiber towel\n\nDiffuse upside down\n\nI’ve tried other products as well but this is what I’ve been using for about a month since I got my hair cut, these are what the stylist recommended, routine hasn’t changed though and even when I have used other products the results have been pretty much the same. I notice my hair tangles VERY easily and when I’m detangling it looks like I’m losing half my hair. Even when I’m in the shower I have wet frizz. I’ve read it could be a too much protein issue (this shampoo and conditioner have protein), under hydrating issue, or over hydrating issue. I also have a a clarifying shampoo that I use about every 3 washes or so because the water I have is very hard. Currently doing the pineapple method and bonnet for sleeping, and in the morning I damp and scrunch in a little gel (mostly because the front pieces lose any texture they had 😂) \n\nWould appreciate any advice or help, thank you!!",

After seeing so many curly hair videos and just other people with hair similar to mine at school, I’m starting to realize that maybe washing/styling it so often isn’t good for my hair, but I’m not sure how else to keep it looking good. I’m not sure if my wording on this made any sense, so I’ll give a timeline of how my hair looks throughout the week:\n\nSunday: wash day, routine: wash with OGX coconut curls shampoo and conditioner and fight a war trying to detangle, style with not your mothers leave in spray, bounce curl brush, and not your mothers gel\n\nMonday: looks pretty good, some ringlets but mostly pretty wavy and neat\n\nTuesday: getting kind of tangled and messy, but still a good amount of ringlets and not looking too bad\n\nWednesday: getting way more tangled and messy, less ringlets and waves are getting puffy\n\nThursday: looks gross and soooo tangled, i usually just put my hair in a messy bun. Wash day and I do the same as Sunday. \n\nFriday/saturday: same as Monday/tuesday\n\nBtw I sleep with a bonnet and use the pineapple method\n\nAny tips appreciated!!!",

I can really only do this in the bathroom right after my shower.\n\nThis has started to cause noticeable back pain while I’m doing it and occasionally throughout the day, and I’m concerned it’ll worsen over time if I keep diffusing this way.\n\nIs there a better or more ergonomic way to diffuse upside down? Should I be keeping a chair in my bathroom or something and leaning my head back over it while sitting down instead? How are you guys diffusing upside down without developing back or neck issues?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated!",
