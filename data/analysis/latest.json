      "content": "Hi, I am wondering why hair stylists who do dry curly cuts require you to come in with no product? My hair is completely different with and without product. Without product, it is a giant ball of frizz. There are no individual curls. With product, I have clearly defined curls. I have never gone outside of my house with no product on my hair and I'm scared to. I've had curly cuts before but I didn't know you weren't supposed to put in product. Now my stylist is telling me I have to come in without product and I would love to hear why, so that I feel reassured that it will come out well. I looked it up online and it said it's so they can see how each individual curls falls, but without product, I have no curls. Just frizz. I'm worried they will not cut my hair in the way I normally wear it.  Photo of how I usually style my hair. Thanks!\n\nRoutine:\n\nWash with Dove Intensive Shampoo\nCondition with John Frieda Ultra Volume\nIn shower, apply Not Your Mother's Curl Gel\nOutside shower, apply AG re:coil and scrunch\nChi Heat protecting spray \nDiffuse \nSleep with a silk bonnet, never towel dry, rather brush with a Denman\n\nAnd if anyone has further advice to get rid of the frizz, I'm all ears 😁 Thank you!",

I can no longer keep up with a normal hair routine,  Brushing my hair, applying product and diffusing all causes me too much pain now.  i had to find a better way that was easy, accessible, affordable,  and maximized the beauty i wanted.\n\ni decided to experiment and this is the routine  that created  the hair above, the hair i have wanted for literal years:\n\n dry brush and detangle (my dad helps me with this)\n\n Shampoo really well\n\n Conditioner in mid section and ends, not roots\n\n Squeeze out excess water and blot with the towel\n\n Take a curl brush with slightly damp, NOT REALLY WET, hair, brush upward against the grain of your hair from the underneath brushing up, this is done to create curl sections\n\nflip your head upside down, gently loosen your roots with your fingers so your roots are not stuck your  head, and then scrunch all the way to the root\n\nflip all your hair forward infront of your face. air dry like that, you basically have to look slightly down till its dry.\n\nonce fully dry flip upside down, fluff the roots, then spread your fingers wide, slip your fingers in the mid section of your hair, and shake. do not brush out  the curls with your hands, just shake.\n\nflip right side up, fiddle with it for i minute, fluff where you need to, and your done.\n\ni know this wont work for everyone, for some this will dry out your hair too much, but i did everything the beauty industry tells you not to do with curly hair and my hair has literally never looked better. i don't  care if this is somehow unhealthy for my hair, im simply too disabled to do more effort than this. maybe if it gets dry I'll do a night with coconut  oil to rehydrate, but this is my routine  forever  now.\n\n I wasted so many years thinking there was something wrong with me or my hair or that the way I wanted my hair wanted to look was not possible,and it was just lies. the thing that was making my hair look bad was product. my hair has always been hypersensitive  to product, even a half dollar size of mouse weighs down my hair. with nothing my hair is so soft, light, and fluffy. i have the volume i want, the definition, everything.  And I do not care if I was possibly using the wrong product and different product would help my hair more,  Like I've said I'm too disabled for a 5 step product routine these days. this routine  is what I've  needed. its perfect.\n\n Maybe you don't need 5 different $30 hair products, maybe  the issue isn't  the wrong product, its product at all. maybe with no product  but the right styling  method, you can have what you want ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯. maybe try going no product and air drying, then slowly incorporate each product to better understand your hair, idk. \n\ngood luck to all others on your curl journey. im very happy i finally  figured  this out. oh also please do not give me any advice, im content with what im doing! &lt;3 i just wanted to share this success in hopes it can help others.",

      "content": "\nWe’ve all heard the adage “Black don’t crack” and “Asian don’t raisin”. \n\nAt 39, I’m REALLY starting to notice it. I live in a predominantly white area and a lot of women in my age range accuse me of getting Botox and fillers and I’ve also been accused of having a facelift. I thought it was weird initially because I didn’t understand. I have never had a facelift (but I would have no problem with one in 20 years!) and I quit Botox a long time ago. Now I do. The difference in the way melanated and less melanated skin ages really starts to hit after 35 and it’s shocking.\n\nHere’s what you’re actually seeing…Melanin acts as a natural sunscreen. On top of that, I WEAR sunscreen (every day), don’t smoke, rarely drink, drink lots of water and maintain an active lifestyle.\n\nHere are products I really like:\n\n- Tretnoin (holy grail)\n- Tri-luma (unfortunately dark skin is prone to dark spots. I use this to keep mine in check)\n- Amlactin (15% lactic acid, I use it for smooth moisturized skin)\n- First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads (glycolic + lactic acids)\n- Sunscreen (minimum SPF 50): Supergoop, Beauty of Joseun, Haru Haru Black Rice Moisture Airyfit Daily Sunscreen \n\nI do hydrofacials and strongly believe in facial massage/buccal relief. \n\nMy diet is 80/20 healthy/processed. I STRENGTH TRAIN (a non-negotiable). No excessive cardio for me. I do yoga once a week. Pray/meditate regularly (I’m Muslim). Keep my social group active. Take vitamins. And try to walk as much as I can. \n\nTL:DR - Brown skin helps a lot but my lifestyle probably matters much more.\n\nAny other ladies with Brown or Black skin have any other good recs they keep in rotation? \n\nEdit:\nTo my Muslim girlies, I know drinking in any capacity is haram. Please do not use it as an excuse to do the same. I am on my own journey. \n",

I’m a natural level 7 or 8 blonde who let my friend give me highlights once while she was studying for cosmetology school and the highlights eventually grew out and looked weird so I decided to get a “touch up” done today for the first time. \n\nShe did a full highlight. Shampoo, blow dry, and style. A total of 4 hours 9am-1pm and my total cost was $268. I bought from products from the salon as well because I know its supports the salon which racked my total cost up to $337. I decided to tip $63 to make my total $400. \n\nMy question is, for 4 hours of work and a nice job is $63 enough? I know in the US tipping your waiter 20% is expected but is 20% too low for a hair stylist? She did a really good job and I want to come back but I always wanna make sure I didn’t give a lousy tip ",

Compared to a lil oily hair which I much prefer and can actuslly be styled and looks amazing imo. \n\nHow can I recreate this? When I use volume shampoo and conditioner (aussie) it doesn't really add volume, neither does some expensive conditioner I bought from my hairstylist. I have tried using sea salt spray after drying my hair and then blowdrying, but that really doesn't add anything. I would try the \"not your mothers\" one, but it's US only product. Also Sometimes my hairspray helps tho, which is weeeeird.\n\nI would appreciate all tips cuz I am very new at this with my fine hair and styling my hair/clothing is very important to me. If I missed some info, would be happy to help. I have some pics if also need to show what I mean",

I am currently dealing with a receding hairline at the temples and I use topical Minoxidil (5%) twice daily to treat it.\nMy main issues are:\nMy hair tends to be dry and frizzy, especially at the ends.\nI don't know how to style my hair to define the curls without making the thinning areas look obvious.\nMy current routine is: Kerabit's biotin and collagen shampoo(3 times a week), I currently don't use any conditioner because am confused whether it would cause more hairloss and whether or not it should be used while being on monoxidil.After the shampoo and even a normal bath i towel try my hair everyday and apply minoxidil,I use it morning and at night before sleeping, no idea about what sleep protection meant in the rules.\nI'm looking for advice on:\nA basic routine to add moisture back into my hair without weighing it down.\nHow to layer styling products (like gel or cream) with Minoxidil application. Do I apply Minoxidil before or after styling?\nAny styling techniques that help wavy hair look fuller on top\nI just wanna make sure they look clean , healthy and not this bad at least .\nPlease drop any suggestion you have as it would only help me know more about my hair and styling.",

      "title": "Post-Op Curls Split Town",
      "content": "So lots of people have posted and commiserated in the past but I find myself feeling sort of... lost and am just open to fresh ideas. I know this sounds dramatic, but I'm mourning part of my identity. \n\nI underwent surgery last week and my body is still healing. I could not shower for 4 days post-op and when I finally did, I used a clarifying shampoo (tresemee pro-pure) because eww hospital and bed sweat smell. \n\nI don't normally wash my hair very often, but I have *never* had something like this happen before! My waves and curls just packed up and left town. I went from all over waves on my lengthier hair and tight ringlets framing my face to just... totally straight hair with a little bit of frizz at the bottom and a tiny hint of kink at the tendrils. A bobbi pin fell out of my hair last night! It just slid right out. 💀 \n\nI understand hair patterns can change after major life events... but I wasn't expecting the 12+ inches of already grown and dead hair to simply change *overnight*. This can't be permanent. I am struggling to accept it on top of everything else.. \n\nMy daily routine for over a year has  been a soak in the bathtub with a nice deep scalp massage, then I gently rinse and apply a simple leave-in conditioner (dermasil brand). I wrap it in an old t-shirt and plop with a very light-weight hair gel for about 20 minutes while getting dressed. \n\nAfter dressing, I diffuse with no heat for about 5-10 minutes, and then shape it with large bamboo \"combetter\" hair pick when it needs shaping. This has been working for me, for like, ever. If my hair gets build-up or acts \"off\" for any reason, I wash it and start over... but honestly it generally needs very minimal washing and I almost never brush it. \n\nI can't submerge myself in the tub yet- I had surgery on my reproductive parts and maybe hormones are at play here too... but I did the whole scalp massage before washing it under lukewarm water and again during the wash with warm, but not hot water. I rinsed with cooler water and put the dermasil leave-in on it before wrapping. I felt so good after! I followed the rest of my routine with the same brand gel, and diffused on low with no heat using my beloved black onyx diffuser and... well I will include a picture. The first is from today, and the others are from a couple of weeks ago, when I was still feeling good. \n\nContext: I did not brush my hair before taking today's picture. There were no curl clumps forming while diffusing and it just feels really slippery and stringy in general. Not slippery in a bad way but it is kind of sleek and just... straight. I tried spraying it with water yesterday to get some texture and volume and it just.. does this again. Ugh. I don't know what to even do with it!\n\nMy cousin is a hairdresser and I'll get her to take off that dead frizz stuff at the bottom for me. Do you guys think that will help? Should I have her cut it more like straight hair now? He has been giving me curly cuts for years and I've never even seen anyone else... Anyone have their curls revive after a life event a few days/weeks later? Success stories would also be super helpful! ",
