And I think I like it so much better! I feel like I’ve gained some volume back, my hair feels soft to touch and it seems less weighed down. I don’t get as much hold but I’ve been loving and embracing the frizz lately, it makes me feel so free!!\n\nI will keep the gel on hand for extra humid days, but for now I’m happy with the shorter drying time lol. \n\nRoutine: Suave coconut shampoo + conditioner, Kinky Curly Knot Today leave in, Herbal Essences mousse, LA Looks gel.

      "content": "*long post*\n\nHi everyone. I'm a 28F and a total noob at skincare. I'm trying to look for recommendations on how I can improve my skin. I believe my skin type is \"Normal to Dry\" and overall I think my goals if we're looking to that are moisturizing, as I live in a very dry and often windy climate, as well as repair/scar healing because my job often results in my face being scratched, and I'm starting to get some wrinkles. I would also love if anything can be done for my dark under eyes however they seem to be hereditary which to my knowledge means not much can be done for that.\n\nThe acne I'm not *as* worried about as it appears to be hormonal based, which to my knowledge, skincare can't really help. But I am making efforts with my doctor to manage my PCOS and weight. \n\nI don't know if I've got the wrong goals, wrong products, or what but I'm trying to make efforts for improving my health overall which I am sure will benefit my skin but I'm also trying to form a routine that'll help me be my best. Any and all recommendations are welcome but do please know I'm trying to stick to more budget friendly options as much as possible. \n\nMy routine is going as of the following-\n\nMorning Routine: \n1.Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (Normal to Dry Skin)\n\n2.CeraVe skin renewing Vitamin C serum\n\n3.Neurtrogena Hydro Boost Water Cream\n\n4. Covergirl Blurring Skintint + 30SPF. \n\n\nMidday Routine, as part of my job involves being outside for approximately 30-40 minutes middle of the day:\n\n1. CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (Normal to Dry Skin) \n\n2. Vaseline/petroleum jelly applied to the lips. \n\n\nAnd lastly Nighttime Routine:\n\n1. CeraVe Hydrating Foam Oil Cleanser (Dry to Very Dry skin)\n\n2. Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Moisturizer (Night) \n\n\nSorry for the long post but just ugh yeah clearly my skin is not great looking and I would just really love to know where and how to improve it. Again I know getting PCOS and hormones under control will help a lot but I've still got a lot to do. Appreciate any and all advice on improvement. Thanks for taking the time to read and for your advice. 💙",

I’ve been using tat hair mask for a month now and still, little to no improvement. At this point, i’m convinced that my hair will never recover from whatever that lady did to my hair and i’m so so frustrated. both at myself for caving and allowing her to blow dry and straighten my hair, and at her for ruining my hair. Idk if any of you have had this happen to yall but i’ll take any advice at this point because im seriously desperate. My hair is straight in same areas and wavy in others.  it’s not dry, it’s quite soft so i don’t think it needs to be cut off. Also, i’m still using the exact same mousee, curl cream, shampoo, and conditioner that I used before i went to that salon. so yeah, do yall think there’s no going back? Oh and I would attach a picture of a before and after of my hair but i’m a hijabi so i can’t, thanks! ",

I have found two moisturizer that I do not react to which are\n\nSkinfix triple lipid barrier cream Naturium multi peptide moisturizer\n\nI am currently using the skin fix cream but I also don’t feel like it is helping my skin long term and making it more hydrated and less sensitive. Over top I sometimes put Clary balm by Clary which is an olive oil based balm. I have zero reaction to this product and it does not break me out.\n\nI do not have a cleanser but today I tried the Prequel gleanser and it has left my skin feeling tight and stinging, even after putting the skinfix on.\n\nA problem I typically have is that when I start using a new product, it feels amazing and super hydrating. After 4-5 days it will start making my face sting and also feel extremely congested on my cheeks/jawline. My face gets itchy and feels like there is heat trapped. An example of a product that has done that is the illiyoon ceramide moisturizer that is highly recommended. Maybe dimethicone bothers me?\n\nI am really looking for a routine that will leave me hydrated and with plump skin. My symptoms right now are dry/dehydrated, sensitive, itchy, red, prone to acne (from products), and tight skin. My skin also has texture and can feel congested, so I’d love to be able to exfoliate, but I realize it might not be a good time for that  due to the sensitivities I’m dealing with. Pleaseeee help me! I’m happy to post photos of my skin if needed.",

It’s been around 1.5 weeks since they appeared and they’re not settling down.\n\nI recently started using the Re’equil Oil-Free Moisturiser (Hyaluronic Acid + Betaine) about 2 weeks ago, and I’m wondering if it could be the cause. My skin type is oily.\n\nAnother factor is that my sleep cycle has been disturbed lately. I’ve been sleeping irregularly for the past few days, so I’m not sure if that’s contributing too.\n\nDo these look like closed comedones or fungal acne? And if it’s from the moisturizer, should I stop it completely or try using it differently? Any suggestions on how to calm this down or improve skin texture would really help 🙏\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

For reference my hair is board straight, like it air dries straighter than some people after a straightener. So I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing with my daughter’s curly hair. \n\nI’ve got good product I think, color wow spray. And I know to spray it wet before brushing (now…) but halfway through the day it’s always frizzy and the curls fall out and lately she’s getting BAD knots and some matting. The day starts good but I’m clearly doing something wrong. \n\nWe wash it 3 times a week, more or less is better? We use fairy tails curly Q shampoo conditioner, is that good? Does she need a silk pillowcase? Some kind of bonnet (if she’d even wear it)? Do I need an unbrush? Why is it so frizzy halfway through the day and how do I fix it?",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

Dr. Sheth’s Lactic Acid Body Lotion\n\n\n\nMy goal: even out tan lines / fade dullness on arms &amp; legs (not face).\n\nIf you’ve tried any of these — which gave you the best visible results for tan removal or smoother skin?\nOr if there’s a pharmacy or derm-approved option that works better, please suggest 🙏\n\nWould really appreciate honest feedback (not influencer hype).\n",

      "content": "I am looking for tips on styling/product recommendations for my hair. I've tried to start caring for my curls over the last year and I'm still struggling to figure out what I need to do.\n\nThe routine:\n\n1. I soak my hair in warm water and then detangle my hair with a Tangle Teezer Brush intermittently throughout the next steps.\n2. L'Oréal EverPure Sulfate Free Color Care System Clarify Shampoo (once a week)\n3. Cerave Anti-D@ndruff\\* Hydrating Shampoo (twice a week)\n4. Cerave Anti-D@ndruff\\* Hydrating Conditioner (twice a week)\n5. Not Your Mother's Naturals Daily Nutrition Butter Mask (twice a week, letting it sit for 7 minutes each time)\n6. I've tried both wringing out the majority of the water from my hair and leaving almost all of the water in my hair post-shower. Lately I've been doing the former. I follow with scrunching out any curls that are still dripping with a microfiber towel.\n7. I put a bit of Pantene Wave &amp; Curl Defining Hydrating Créme throughout my hair, following it with a small amount of Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Heat &amp; Humidity Gel.\n8. I style it with my D3 Denman brush. The best I can end up doing is huge sausage curls around my head with very little if any volume. \n9. 40 minutes under my hard hood dryer under low heat.\n10. Scrunch out the crunch with my microfiber towel.\n\nRefreshing: I mist my hair in the morning and try to curl it again with my Denman brush. Then I just let it air dry. This ends up with poofy/frizzy curls at best just hours later.\n\nSleeping: I don't do anything except sleep on a silk pillowcase. I've tried pineappling, and I've tried bonnets. I'm disappointed that the curls don't really maintain their shape overnight. I also seem to move too much during sleep to keep the scrunchies and/or bonnets on my head overnight, so I stopped using those.\n\nI tried doing the upside down, diffuse the hair tutorials from Manes by Mell and others. I flipped my hair back over (maybe too early) and ended up with a snake's nest of very wonky, crispy curls going every direction.\n\nProducts I have also tried:\n\n* Not Your Mother's Curl Cream\n* Not Your Mother's Beach Babe Sea Salt Spray (did not give any hold and made my top layer stringy)\n* Not Your Mother's 3 in 1 All Eyes on Me Styling Cream (no hold, seems made more for slicked back hairstyles?)\n* Multiple DevaCurl products (the one I liked most was the Plumping Primer, but I wasn't really impressed by their curl cream or gel)\n* Pantene Intensive Bond Repair Mask (this made my hair feel so soft after rinsing it out, but I read this brand isn't well liked?)\n* Pantene Miracle Rescue Regenerative Hair Oil (maybe I used too much, but it made my hands and hair feel like I almost had honey on/in it, which I didn't like)\n* Other products I have probably forgotten about\n\nI don't know what to do or use at this point, and I'd like tips/recommendations before spending more.\n\n(\\*@ so the post doesn't get auto removed)",
