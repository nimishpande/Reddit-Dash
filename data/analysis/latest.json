      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoeâ„¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Dear curly/wavy/kinky Redditors, I am so at a complete loss with regard to my hair that I was forced to revive an ancient Reddit account, so please excuse the absolutely hilarious name my 14yo self came up with. Anyways, I have fine, low porosity 3a/3b hair that I have been growing out from a buzz cut for about a year. My routine consists of washing about every 3-4 days with conditioner (Shea Moisture coconut &amp; hibiscus, it worked for me for ages) and once weekly with shampoo (random store brand), and styling just with a curl cream (John Frieda Frizz Ease) and letting it air dry. For a while, I was fairly happy with my curls; they were defined, lasted a couple of days and held in place, but I felt they were a little dry and too tangled, so I decided to opt for a leave-in, which was a mistake.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I got a Cantu repair leave-in with Shea butter (bad for fine hair, I figured it out too late) and I used it ONCE, just a bit on my finger and then finger-combed through hair, and since then my hair has been an absolute disaster.Â \n\nAfter my hair dried, I noticed that it had, in fact, made my hair very soft but also loosened up my curl pattern, reduced definition and created a lot of soft, straightish, and sort of floaty frizz. Additionally, in the shower instead of clumping in big, drenched, wet curls, my hair remains frizzy and just sort of damp (it feels oddly not wet enough for now, long it has been soaking). I also feel like I have been shedding more, but that might be just the looser curl not catching the shed hairs as well as before.\n\nSo, my question is, what is happening and what can I do? I stopped using all products for two weeks and only clarified but I see little to no improvement. I read about protein and moisture overloads, both of which are readily available in the Cantu product, but the information on the internet seems super contradictory, and I don't want to damage my hair further. I tried the stretch test, but I can't figure out how to prevent my hair from just slipping out of whatever I use to hold it, haha, it's just so fine and smooth.\n\nAny and all advice and experience is welcome. I attached a couple of pictures of my hair now, a day after clarifying. Day 1 frizz is not that bad but the straightish flyaways in the first picture could give a good idea what appears all over my head during days 2 and 3. Unfortunately, I have no before images. Thanks, everyone.",

      "content": "For context I am 23, very pale skin, oily, live in a humid place. My main concerns are mild redness, oily skin, enlarged/noticeable pores, and anti aging. My skin is not particularly sensitive, it doesnâ€™t get dry, and I donâ€™t get acne or blackheads. \n\nThis is my current routine:\n\nAm:\n- Wash with water  \n- Vitamin c\n- Niacinamide \n- Moisturizer\n- Sunscreen \n\nPm:\n- Oil cleanse when needed \n- Foam cleanser or sulfur foam cleanser \n- third step: Mon: retinol / Tues: azelaic acid / Wed: rest / Thurs: retinol / Fri: azelaic acid / Sat: azelaic acid / Sun: rest\n- moisturizer \n- jojoba oil (x2 week) \n\nX1 week - bentonite clay mask \n\nSome notes:\n- I got the sulfur cleanser in order to help with my pores. A dermatologist on YouTube recommended it for helping reduce the appearance of pores. Iâ€™ve been using it almost daily since January but have seen no improvement at all honestly. At this point Iâ€™m just finishing using up the tube and backed down from daily use to every other day or so \n- I tried using salicylic acid daily last year for at least 6 months if not longer and it did nothing to help  \n-  Iâ€™ve been using retinol on and off for a few years but not consistently. I think my product expired though so I need to order some new stuff \n- the bentonite clay mask works to help make my pores less noticeable but the result doesnâ€™t last more than like a day \n- I have used niacinamide on and off for the last few years but also found no help in reducing oiliness. I decided to try again though which is why Iâ€™m using it right now \n- I have been using glycolic acid a few times a week for the past few months but honestly idk why. I donâ€™t even remember why I got it. I stopped using it.\n- I just recently like a few weeks ago started using azelaic acid and vitamin c in my routine \n\nJust wondering if my routine is okay. I tried using ChatGPT to help formulate somewhat of a plan but it keeps going back and forth about either adding on a ton of acids and actives vs warning me about overdoing things and to be careful. I donâ€™t trust it to be giving me accurate info which is why I want to run my plan by on here. Also I know you canâ€™t reduce the size of pores. I know theyâ€™ll always be there. I just want them to look a bit nicer and not stand out so much.",
