      "content": "Hello! I have oily, combination, acne-prone skin. I notice that I've had constant problems with acne appearing around my hairline, specifically the sides of my forehead. I have barcode bangs and apply dry shampoo to my bangs almost everyday. Just to clarify, I have the type of hair that just greases up (especially around my bangs) in the morning even though I washed it the night before.\n\n  \nI've tried applying dry shampoo first and then washing my face and doing my morning skincare afterwards, but it hasn't been working since my bangs still end up touching my forehead throughout the day. The only kind of makeup I wear daily is Erborian CC Red Correct cream to cover redness around my nose and chin.\n\nOne thing that has been helping me manage the acne is applying a thick dot of diaper rash cream on the acne at night as a spot treatment of some kind. I'm not too sure how 40% zinc oxide helps alleviate acne, but it works for me!\n\nAny advise or product recommendation would be great. Below is my current routine:\n\nAM:\n\n1. Only water, no cleanser\n\n2. Mixing Beauty of Joseon Light On Serum: Centella + Vit C cream with CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 50\n\n3. COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence\n\n\n\nPM:\n\n1. Double cleanse with Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Cleansing Oil + CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser\n\n2. Clearasil Rapid Rescue Deep Treatment Pads\n\n3. Some kind of serum mixed with CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion. Sometimes it's Skintific Retinol Skin Renewal Serum, or The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + Hyaluronic Acid, or none.\n\n4. COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence\n\n5. Equate Diaper Rash Ointment with 40% Zinc Oxide as spot treatment on any active acne.\n\n  \nAnd yes, I always mix my moisturizer with serums or other creams on my hands before I apply them to my face. I don't know if that's an okay way to do it but my skin has been loving it.\n\n",

      "content": "\nWhat my hair has been through recently: \n\n- In July, I dyed it a medium-dark copper. I strongly disliked it (poor match with my cooler, pinker skin tone) and let it fade out over the next three months\n\n\n- On October 1st, I bleached it to about a level 9. My hair was not too compromised from this, but it was definitely porous\n\n- On the same day that I bleached it, I stupidly applied Ion 8N + 7N permanent hair color, wanting to tone my hair (smh... I know). My hair developed to about a level 6 light brown with some level 7 pieces, and I freaked out (expected a toning result and not a color depositing one?? Idk im dumb). Eventually came to love being more brunette and saw it as a blessing in disguise \n\n- The color has faded out a ton (see photos, taken today), likely because my strands were so porous and the dye couldn't hold. My hair is now a very reddish-gold color, and while it’s kindof cute, i feel it clashes with my cooler skin tone... I'd like to take it back down to a darker level and a cooler/more neutral one... 6N, 6A, 5N or a blend. I liked the contrast between my hair color and my lighter eyes/skin\n\nAny advice on products to use and what process to follow? I'm afraid of accidentally turning my hair swampy, so I'm also curious whether I need to factor in a filler step in the coloring process. I use K18 on my hair, so it’s in fairly healthy condition (the tangles in the photos are ever-present, virgin or chemically processed)\n\nCurrently, I’m considering Wella ColorCharm Permanent creme color in 6N and 5N, but I’m thinking maybe I need to incorporate an ash to counter the red ? Any insights or suggestions are welcome &lt;3 \n",

I put it on and thought it was great and then I went about doing my chores and then I go to shower and bam! My eyebrows are green... Sigh... I removed it and in the cotton ball it became pink? Idk how to explain this anymore.\n\nI did swear while doing chores, I knew it was gonna get ruined but I wasn't expecting it to turn green! \n\nAny advice?

I chose these specific photos because the image quality is really good, my skin texture is very visible in them, and my skin was particularly bad that day compared to what it usually is.\n\nAs you can see, my pores are quite large, and my skin is both oily and dry. I also have some hyperpigmentation around my mouth.\n\nI’ve seen several dermatologists and even had allergy tests done (all of them came back saying I’m not allergic to anything), but every product I use eventually causes a severe reaction, like intense allergic flare-ups that cause burning and bruising. (I’m not exaggerating when I say burning as I even had to go to the hospital once because of it).\n\nAfter a lot of trial and error, the only products I’m able to use safely are:\n\nBioderma Sensibio Moussant as a face wash\nBiore Skin Aqua sunscreen\nGlow Recipe Watermelon Serum (it’s really not very effective for hydration we all know)\n\nSometimes I use Origins Dr. Weil Mega Mushroom Barrier Rescue Serum, which I absolutely love, but I can’t use it often because it’s not available in my country so it’s hard to get.\n\nI really need some advice. I feel like I’m getting older and my skin is just developing more problems (like fine lines), but I can’t even handle what’s happening right now.\nDoes anyone else go through something similar?

      "content": "Today I got prescribed Tretinoin nightly and clindamycin 1% lotion day and night. Since June I’ve used 10% Benzol peroxide wash and a light moisturizer but haven’t seen much change in my skin.\n\nI’ve done some research and I’m unsure how to fit these in to a routine…I’ve heard you have to use clindamycin with benzoyl (or something similar) so you don’t gain an antibiotic resistance. However you’re not suppose to use Tretinoin with benzoyl because it’s too drying on skin?\n\nI want to start slow with the Tretinoin and only use it a few times a week at first so should I use Benzyl peroxide day and night with clindamycin but on days I use Tretinoin don’t use Benzyl peroxide/clindamycin at night? And replace with a gentle cleanser? Or still use the clindamycin at night but not the Benzyl peroxide? I was wondering if using Benzyl peroxide combined with clindamycin in the morning is enough to prevent gaining a resistance when using clindamycin without benzyl peroxide at night.\n\nI’m lost on this skin care stuff so I appreciate any help. Basically I’ve got oily skin and lots of scarring at this point. And I’d say 3-4 new pimples a week? It’s a bit insecurity so I’d like to clear it up. Thank you.",

I was on Dutasteride daily for about 6 months but switched to Finasteride every other day a month ago because of some semen related issues.\n\nEver since the switch, I’ve noticed a massive shed, honestly, I’ve never lost this much hair before.\n\nHas anyone else experienced a big shed after switching from Dut to Fin? If so, how long did it take to stabilize for you?\n\nStarting to feel a bit discouraged right now, but I’m hoping it’s just a temporary phase",
