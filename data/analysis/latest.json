So I picked up the can and looked into the tube and I thought I saw more.\n\nSo I sprayed a little into the sink...like 6 to 8 dead fucking flies came out, I shit you not. I don't ever see any flies in my house, I am a clean mfer. But I also, usually right after a shower, apply the foam directly from the can right into my hair. And I leave the cap off the bottle. So...I've probably been applying dead flies to my hair every day for years after showering.\n\nApparently they like the ethanol in the foam formulation. I've never felt so grossed out. I don't know where the fuck got in from, but...never again.\n\nSorry you had to read this.",

      "content": "A while ago, I read a comment from a Mexican woman living in Paris.\nShe said that since moving to France, her hair had never been this short, not because she wanted to cut it, but because French hairdressers always insist on trimming.\nShe realized how in France, every visit ends with “your ends are too dry, we have to cut”, and it made her lose the motivation to even go anymore.\n\nShe explained that in Mexico and latin America in general, women place huge importance on their hair, which seems to be traditionally seen as a symbol of femininity and sensuality. \nThat resonated with me because I’d love to proactively care for my hair, instead of constantly cutting it like burned grass, also, curly cuts cost 3x the price of a regular haircut in France and I’m never happy with them. My curls are fine for me, I just would love them to grow longer, and it feels stupid trying to achieve it with what hairdressers recommend in Paris, hence, cutting a good 5-10cm of length to make it “grow longer and healthy”.\n\nSo, I wanted to ask Latin American curlies for their insights on this.\n\nWhat are your real, local secrets for healthy, long, shiny hair?\nNot the viral stuff like Skala while the whole world knows but the real insider things like traditionnal ingredients or rituals, local brands or products that actually work but aren’t famous abrod, habits or techniques that make the biggest difference for growth and softness, and also, how you deal with dryness and frizz in humid climates\n\nFor context: my hair is 2C+/3A, it hates hard water (calcium buildup) and breaks easily if I use too much protein.\nI’m trying to focus on health and length retention, no cuts for now \n\nMy routine is not locked, I change it from time to time according to the weather and period of the year and I’m willing to try different methods.\nLast wash day I used a clarifying shampoo + Nuxe Rêve de Miel rince conditioner + Flaxseed Gel on soaking hair + warm and then cold diffuser at 80% dryness + Davines Oi Oil to finish breaking the gel cast \n\nThank you so much if you take the time to share!",

I really liked it, but I realized my ends probably needed a trim because they were getting pretty frayed and it was bugging me. Well... I went a little overboard and cut more than I intended to and now I'm like \"shit how do I style this now?\"\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to style this mop while it grows out?\n\nEDIT: In terms of a hair routine, when it's cut this short I usually wet it every morning to kind of \"reset\" it from being smooshed overnight. I typically use Not Your Mother's line of curl products; as pictured, it just has some of the gel in it, but not a lot. Sometimes I'll use the curl cream, but I didn't for this picture because I'm out. I applied the gel, fingers through my hair and scrunching, while it was still wet and let the curls air dry.",

      "title": "Creating Custom Topicals: A Guide (2025 Edition)",
      "content": "A few years ago I posted a guide about creating your own topical hair loss topicals. I still get direct message questions to this very day, so I thought it would be a good idea to make an updated version with 3 years of additional experience included.\n\n**Intro**\n\nI've frequently seen posts where people are interested in using some kind of topical (RU58841, CB-03-01, pyrilutamide, dutasteride, PP405), but they aren't exactly sure how to turn the powder into a topical treatment. Often people will suggest the use of minoxidil or stemoxydine solutions, and while this can work, it doesn't give you as much control over your formulation as a custom solution. Custom hair loss topicals can be made more cheaply and can be formulated to be less irritating. You can also increase the applied volume while maintaining the same dose.\n\nIn this guide I'll give a few different recipes for creating carrier solutions for topical hair loss products. Generally these can be used with anything you'd apply topically that you have in powdered form. At the end of the guide, I'll give additional instruction on creating topical finasteride.\n\n**Basic Ingredients**\n\nThe three basic ingredients in a carrier solution are alcohol, water, and a humectant. Alcohol dissolves the active ingredients into solution, and the humectant makes the solution thicker and prevents moisture loss on the scalp. Water helps to soften and swell the stratum corneum (outer layer of the skin) which aids penetration, but some ingredients shouldn't be exposed to water.\n\n**Alcohol:**\n\nThe base of almost all topicals is alcohol, this is what allows the topical to penetrate, deliver, and dry. I recommend ethanol (ethyl alcohol). This is the type of alcohol that is in alcoholic beverages, and is generally the best tolerated. In most countries ethanol must be \"denatured\" prior to being sold without an alcoholic beverage tax. This sometimes involves adding methanol to the ethanol, which is highly toxic and should be absolutely avoided in anything you are going to put on your body.\n\nYou basically have two choices for ethanol, then. The first is to simply buy alcohol intended for drinking, such as 190 proof Everclear. Obviously this option will be devoid of methanol or any other denaturing agents. However, you will probably have to pay a liquor tax. Some places have also banned the sale of high proof spirits.\n\nThe other option is to buy ethanol that has been denatured using bittering agents. These bittering agents are present in extremely small concentrations and are considered safe for skin application. You can look for \"medical grade ethanol\" online. I would make sure the product clearly indicates that it contains no methanol.\n\n**Humectant:**\n\nThe most common choice for a humectant is propylene glycol. This liquid is used in everything from soda to vape juice, and is generally considered well tolerated. It should be extremely easy and cheap to acquire. I recommend getting food grade propylene glycol.\n\nSome people may have negative reactions to propylene glycol, and it has been suggested that it can cause inflammation. Another option for a humectant is glycerin, which could be better tolerated in some sensitive populations. Glycerin is my personal favorite humectant.\n\n**Water:**\n\nWater can be very helpful in some topical formulations. It allows the skin barrier to be penetrated more easily, allowing diffusion of the active molecule into the scalp. Adding water will also reduce the  alcohol concentration, which can make the solution much less irritating to the scalp. The presence of water can also prevent crystallization that can happen with some compounds.\n\nHowever, some active ingredients (such as RU58841) can undergo hydrolysis in the presence of water. This means that the molecule will break apart if water is around. For this reason, you should avoid adding water to topicals containing these water sensitive molecules unless you use them immediately. This isn't known to be a major issue with minoxidil or finasteride.\n\nIf your active ingredient is water stable, I recommend 10-20% water.\n\n**Recipes**\n\n**Recipe 1 - High Penetration RU58841 Vehicle**\n\n85% ethanol\n\n15% propylene glycol\n\nWhen making RU58841 solutions, it's vital that the topical doesn't include water. There's evidence that using less propylene glycol can improve absorption, but it can also result in irritation. I think this is a good, balanced recipe, and can be used for almost any topical.\n\n**Recipe 2 - Non-Irritating Finasteride / Dutasteride Vehicle**\n\n55% ethanol\n\n20% glycerin\n\n25% water\n\nThis is designed to be less irritating than almost any commercial topical. Finasteride and dutasteride are both resistant to hydrolysis, and including water will save money on ethanol, reduce crystallization, and reduce scalp irritation. This recipe is also fine to use with minoxidil.\n\n**Making the carrier solution**\n\nMaking the carrier solution just involves mixing the alcohol, humectant, and water (if using water) in the correct ratios. Use a graduated cylinder to measure out the correct volumes, and stir to combine. I recommend making no less than \\~100 mL of carrier solution at any one time, since small volumes are hard to work with. For those who aren't familiar with how to convert percentages to volumes, here's an example for Recipe 2:\n\nDesired volume: 120 mL (good because it fills four 1oz (30 mL) dropper bottles)\n\nEthanol: 0.55 \\* 120 = 66 mL\n\nGlycerin: 0.2 \\* 120 = 30 mL\n\nWater: 0.25 \\* 120 = 24 mL\n\n**Adding your active ingredients**\n\nMost of the active ingredients people use are very soluble in ethanol. You can simply add the active ingredient in powder form to the carrier solution and mix. If you have trouble getting it to dissolve, you can try adding the powder to the ethanol alone and then mixing in the humectant after the powder dissolves.\n\nI should also note that you should wear gloves while handing anti-androgen compounds, as you don't want to absorb them through the skin any more than you have to. You also don't want to have residue on your hands and then accidentally orally ingest an anti-androgen.\n\nYou will need a milligram-accurate scale to measure out your powder. Your kitchen scale probably isn't going to work. Also make sure to store these solutions away from sunlight and heat to avoid degrading the active ingredients. You can DM me if you have questions about active ingredients.\n\n**Creating Topical Finasteride**\n\nSince most of us do not have pure finasteride powder, the process for creating high quality topical finasteride is a bit more complicated. Here are the basic steps:\n\n1. Powder the desired amount of finasteride tablets. I use a mortar and pestle. If possible, use 5mg tablets to reduce the amount of fillers you will have to filter out. \n2. Combine the powder with the amount of ethanol you want in the final product. Mix thoroughly, not everything will dissolve, but finasteride is freely soluble in ethanol so it will come into solution. \n3. When it seems like no more of the powder is dissolving, filter the solution. Start with a metal mesh which I place over a mason jar. Once that first filtration completes, use a coffee filter. After the second filtration ceases, you will be left with some ethanol and a bunch of powder in the filter. You can add a few extra mL of ethanol to wash the filter and compensate for the volume lost in the wet powder left behind. \n4. At this point you can add your humectant to the solution and mix thoroughly. I store the product in amber glass bottles which block UV. \n\nThis procedure might seem a bit involved, but it creates a clean product without a bunch of sediment that would end up in your hair. It's also very easy to tune the concentration to your specific application. With this process you can create something like a 0.05 mg / mL (0.005%) finasteride topical so that you have 5 mL of liquid to get good scalp coverage with a 0.25 mg dose. You can easily create a year's worth of topical finasteride in an hour.\n\n**Dose and percentages**\n\nYou're probably familiar with seeing percentages on hair loss topicals, such as \"5% minoxidil\" or \"1% finasteride\". The meaning of the percentage is g / 100 mL, so a 5% minoxidil solution has 50 mg of minoxidil in 1 mL. An easy rule is to multiply the percentage by 10 to get the mg / mL number, which you can readily use to formulate your own topicals. I'll put a worked example below:\n\nLet's say I want to make 120 mL of a 4% RU58841 solution for twice daily use. This means that I want 40 mg / mL solution. To my 120 mL carrier, I will need 40 mg / mL \\* 120 mL = 4.8 g of RU58841.\n\n**Closing**\n\nMaking your own topical treatments can save a great deal of money in comparison to buying premixed products. It also allows greater flexibility in the concentration of your topical, which is useful for both changing your dosage and changing the amount of liquid you apply to the scalp per application. Frankly, I think a lot of people are getting subpar results because they are only using 1 mL of carrier per application and aren't getting good scalp coverage.\n\nIf you have any questions, please send me a DM or comment.",

      "content": "\nHey everyone!\n\nI’ve started getting lots of tiny bumps all over my forehead. It’s been around 1.5 weeks since they appeared and they’re not settling down.\n\nI recently started using the Re’equil Oil-Free Moisturiser (Hyaluronic Acid + Betaine) about 2 weeks ago, and I’m wondering if it could be the cause. My skin type is oily.\n\nAnother factor is that my sleep cycle has been disturbed lately. I’ve been sleeping irregularly for the past few days, so I’m not sure if that’s contributing too.\n\nDo these look like closed comedones or fungal acne? And if it’s from the moisturizer, should I stop it completely or try using it differently? Any suggestions on how to calm this down or improve skin texture would really help 🙏\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

Dr. Sheth’s Lactic Acid Body Lotion\n\n\n\nMy goal: even out tan lines / fade dullness on arms &amp; legs (not face).\n\nIf you’ve tried any of these — which gave you the best visible results for tan removal or smoother skin?\nOr if there’s a pharmacy or derm-approved option that works better, please suggest 🙏\n\nWould really appreciate honest feedback (not influencer hype).\n",

I am still really struggling with styling it in the mornings (I usually shower and hair plop at night) because when I wake up it looks insane (sidenote: by the time I got to bed it's dry, but it looks psychotic either way). \n\nIn the morning, the hair closest to my head does a weird wave - kind of like the flapper's finger waves, but the bottom is a completely different (poofy) texture. If I brush it out it just gets even more poofy on the bottom and frizzy close to my head. **I'm looking for recs for quickly styling it without showering all over again in the morning.**\n\nI recently tried putting mousse in my dry hair and then pulling it up into a large clip and and bobby pinning the side pieces back from my face. I also tried putting a small rubber band in to make a top pony. I really don't like having it up in a hair tie because it hurts my head over the course of the day so other options are preferable. I'd love your recommendations!\n\n[I let my hair dry naturally without scrunching or plopping](https://preview.redd.it/06hiv0z88azf1.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6e419a1ee597632d2fb71608604d51a85a1b21e)\n\n[Let hair dry naturally without scrunching or plopping](https://preview.redd.it/6of2p0z88azf1.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68a0dc1144aef870efc031079bb6c6e61db88774)\n\n[ Added Amika plus size mousse to dry hair and put in a small band at the top](https://preview.redd.it/thcyc0z88azf1.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1682dbf2a590db53b0aa34265e80684c8d38be80)\n\n[ Added Amika plus size mousse to dry hair](https://preview.redd.it/ffipg0z88azf1.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fda29df946beb35972ce75e0ded4c34f11ea6e4e)",

So..\n\nI am a 33 year old Mom who does not struggle with acne *unless* a product causes breakouts. My current routine is very simple, but I really want to add in an extra step to help my skin, which has been looking dull and dry. Just no life to it at all!! Unfortunately, every serum I've tried recently has caused breakouts. (Most recently it was the Merit Great Skin serum.) All the serums I have been trying have both Hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide, because a facialist recommended that would help, but it's only made things worse. For context, my very simple current routine is: \n\n1. Cleanse with Khiels Daily Cleanser \n2. Paula's Choice BHA Exfoliator \n3. First Aid Beauty Moisturizer with SPF \n\nWhat would you recommend adding into this routine or changing to help get hydrated and glowy?! Thanks so much!! ",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Then lightly massage Simple Light moisturiser (has niacin in it) into damp skin. Then I add sweet almond oil mixed with a ceramide and amino acid moisturiser.\n\nThen I use an SPF50 garnier suncream. This isn’t designed for face but it’s the only thing in my routine that seems to reverse my fine lines! Anyone have a recommendation for a similar thick moisturiser that’s good but not too heavy?\n\n  \nEvening:\n\nWash with almond oil. Every couple days I’ll use a retinoid on dry skin, otherwise follow the same moisturisers on damp skin as daytime. Finally, use an antiwrinkle nightcream, and overlay with vaseline\n\nI used Hyaluronic acid for many many years and it didn’t really stop the dehydration\n\n  \nI’ve been drinking 2 - 3litres waters per day, taking occasional omega 3 supplement, for the past 3 months. Also been working on sleep hygiene, trying my best\n\n\n\nMy skin is better but does anyone have any advice? The lines look so terrible by the end of the day…",

My routine includes washing 2x a week w/ miss jessie's conditioner + herbal esscence argan oil shampoo 2x. I also oil my hair with castor oil + rosemary (i understand castor oil is pretty heavy so i try and not use it constantly), i also use a muelle deep conditioning mask. I let that sit from 30mins-1hr. I then condition my hair and shampoo 2x: miss jessie's conditioner + herbal esscence argan oil shampoo. I then use a hair mask from amika: the kure, i then either use hair cream or a leave in, not your mother mousse and fenty hair gel. I constantly re wet my hair throughout this process, I then style my hair w/a denman brush, i then use a microfiber towel for a bit, and then finally diffuse. I also sleep with a silk pillow &amp; silk bonnet. Please help☹️",

I tried the SKIN 1004 Centella oil cleanser and tested on my right cheek and rinsed with water and I woke up to redness and two big red bumps on that cheek. I thought this oil cleanser could work because I use the SKIN 1004 Centella sunscreen and after months of looking for a sunscreen that didn’t break me out, this sunscreen worked. So I thought it wouldn’t hurt to try its other products.\n\nI was still trying to experiment with different makeup waterproof removers so I bought the waterproof sephora micellar water remover and used that, along with the non-waterproof sephora micellar water. I woke up today and I have redness on both of my cheeks, under my mouth, and around my forehead/eye area. I don’t know what’s happening.

I called around and was able to stock up, but I ran out a couple months ago and I haven't found a good replacement. Any recommendations?\n\nI don't really do much to my skin and I don't want to change that. Other than the serum, I just use the Andelou 'Clear Skin Citrus Kombucha Cleansing Gel' whenever I shower (about every other day) and the Weleda 'Skin Food Light Nourishing Cream' in the winter when it's dry. I don't wear makeup, either.\n\nMy skin is pretty normal and I don't have many skin problems except some uneven texture and the occasional acne when I'm on my period (lol). However, without the serum my skin is getting more uneven, tough, and itchy, and nothing I've tried has helped.\n\nHere's the ingredients of the serum if it helps: Aloe Barbadensis Juice*, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel)*, Cyamopsis Tetragonolobus (Guar) Gum*, Fruit Stem Cell and BioActive 8 Berry Complex*, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Oil*, Lecithin, Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Extract, Salicylic Acid, Salix Alba (Willow Bark) and Spiraea Ulmaria (Meadowsweet) Extracts*, Olive Squalane, Zinc Gluconate, Camellia Sinensis (White Tea) Extract*†, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Phenethyl Alcohol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cinnamomum Camphora (Camphor) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) and Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Oils*.\n\nI appreciate any recommendations you can give me, I'm really out of my depth here.",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
