I think I need to take care of it differently\n\nthe current routine:\n\n\\- vichy dercos sensitive shampoo\n\n\\- the ordinary behentrionium chloride 2% conditioner\n\n\\- harologi rebuild spray, every third wash for 5 min\n\n\\- hask curl defining cream, scrunched in\n\n\\- air dry or dry with diffuser\n\nthe pictures have been taken on wash day after diffuser drying and brushing once completely dry\n\nI suspect that this routine is drying out my hair a bit too much and I think the curl cream is too heavy. I‘m not sure whether the uneven curl pattern is due to my products not being ideal (the top layer is quite dry) or if that‘s just naturally what my hair does now\n\nI‘d like to try new products and techniques but am having a hard time navigating the sea of options. Any advice I can start researching from is appreciated :) I kind of don‘t know where to begin, that curl cream belonged to my ex and I just stuck with it lol\n\nalso… please be very honest, I feel like the back of my hair looks tragic ;-; do you think I should cut it shorter? I love the way it curls in the front at this lenght but whenever I see a picture of me at a slight angle or from the back I feel pain\n\nthank you!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m hoping to hear from others who have dealt with something similar or have any suggestions. Any advice would is appreciated!\n\n**Background**\n\n• I have a small, circular, raised hypertrophic scar on the back of my upper thigh near my hip.\n\n• I see my dermatologist regularly, about four times a year, mainly for Tretinoin management\n\n• About two months ago, I had this spot evaluated in person, and had a follow up appointment last week.\n\n• I regularly exfoliate and moisturize the area, but never shave (completed a full course of of Laser Hair Removal sessions on my legs about a year ago).\n\n**What We’ve Tried so Far**\n\nMy dermatologist initially recommended a corticosteroid injection to reduce redness and flatten the scar.\n\nI previously had two steroid injections for a small hypertrophic scar on my chin last year, spaced six weeks apart, and that treatment worked extremely well. This time, the injection did not improve the scar on my upper thigh at all. There has been no flattening or reduction in redness.\n\nBecause of this, I was prescribed a 0.05% corticosteroid cream to use one to two times daily for a couple weeks.\n\n**My Current Concerns**\n\n1. The area still looks red and raised, and I am worried it could be slowly getting larger.\n2. My dermatologist mentioned that if there is no improvement with the topical steroid, a biopsy should be the next step, (I understand biopsies can be routine, but I’ve never needed one before, and I don’t know enough about them).\n\nHas anyone had a hypertrophic scar that did not respond to steroid injections or topical steroids? If so, what ended up helping, or what was the next step in your treatment process?\n\n**TLDR:** Hypertrophic scar on upper thigh did not respond to steroid injection and now using 0.05% steroid cream. Biopsy was mentioned as a next step and I am wondering if others have had similar experiences.",

Both create similar issues with the piecey and weird-angled roots)\n- apply aussie curl like mousse with praying hands and scrunch with cotton tshirt\n- diffuse leaning forward and tilting to the side; hover diffuse roots until sorta dry and then diffuse the rest of the hair until cast has formed and hair is sorta dry\n- let air dry the rest of the way and then SOTC ",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I’m hoping to get some advice because I’m struggling to recreate the result my curl stylist achieved.\n\nI recently went to a curl specialist who cut a lot of layers and styled my hair beautifully. My hair had volume, defined waves, and held its shape really well. But at home I can’t seem to get the same result, even though I’m using the same routine and products.\n\n**My hair background**\n\n* I always thought I had straight hair, but it turns into a frizzy mess after a day\n* Oily roots but dry ends\n* Fine hair\n* Long, color-treated hair with highlights\n\n**Routine I’m using at home (same as salon)**  \nThese are the products recommended and sold to me by the stylist, which I’m now using at home:\n\n* Pretty Curly Girl gentle cleansing shampoo\n* Pretty Curly Girl intense moisture conditioner\n* Brush through Pretty Curly Girl extra loving leave-in conditioner\n* Brush styling with Bounce Curl volume brush\n* Scrunch in Pretty Curly Girl flaxseed gel on very wet hair\n* Microfiber towel to scrunch out excess water\n* Diffuse until \\~80% dry\n* Scrunch in flaxseed styling serum\n* Finish diffusing\n\nFor diffusing I use a Laifen Swift Premium on medium heat and medium airflow.\n\n**My problem**\n\n* Waves look alright when soaking wet but they start falling flat while I’m diffusing\n* Roots and back of my head go flat quickly\n* Waves start lower and lose definition\n* Everything drops within a few hours\n* Day 2 hair is impossible, day 1 doesn't even hold up\n\nI’ve tried using more or less product, but it doesn’t seem to change much.\n\n**Pictures attached:**\n\n1. Result from the salon after my cut and styling\n2. Result when I style my hair myself at home\n\nWhat am I doing wrong that makes my waves fall flat during diffusing, even though I’m following the same routine and using the same products as the salon? I'm starting to get frustrated with the process and really need some advice on what to do. I'm also wondering if I should be using different products but really don't want to keep throwing money at this without getting results.",

      "content": "I'm 34 years old and have had oily skin all my life, and I still deal with acne (so freaking annoying). I live in Texas with a very dry climate and I work in an office with dry air. I have invested in a humidifier though and it does help.\n\nMy skin is very prone to dehydration and now that I'm in the aging phase of life, I'm looking to make sure I'm properly taking care of my skin.\n\nEverywhere I go, people on Reddit, YouTube, etc. are always recommending to fix dehydrated skin with skincare ingredients like ceramides, fatty acids, cholesterol, and oil content. The biggest recommended products being Illiyoon (their cream mostly) and the skin 1004 pro bio cica ampoule and the ample n ceramide ampoule.\n\nHere's the issue, all of those products caused me to break out.\n\nThe Illiyoon cream has canola oil in the ingredients list which is a trigger, the skin 1004 has niacinamide and so does the ample n. My skin HATES niacinamide.\n\nThere was a point I got so desperate, I went to my local store and got the Cerave in the tub. Worst mistake ever because not only was that heavy on my skin, but it made my skin texture worse (and caused breakouts, go figure).\n\n**My biggest concern:** I have a decent skincare routine, but there's no ceramide or lipids in my routine so I'm worried my skin might be lacking some barrier repair.\n\n**So my main question is:** have any of you successfully repaired your skin barrier without ceramides, fatty acids, or lipids? And if so, how long did it take?\n\nFor reference on what I use, here is my current skincare routine:\n\nAM:\n\n* Wash face with only water\n* Wipe face gently with naturie hatomugi on a toner pad\n* Apply RL dokdo toner with hands\n* Skin 1004 poremizing ampoule\n* Aloe gel\n* Angel aqua moisture cream\n* SPF\n\nPM:\n\n* Double cleanse with cleansing oil and BOJ green plum cleanser\n* Apply aloe gel in a thick layer on skin after shower to help retain moisture\n* (Dry my hair, do body care, etc.)\n* Wash excess aloe off and then mist face with thermal spring water\n* Apply RL dokdo toner with hands\n* Purito deep sea water serum\n* Skin 1004 poremizing ampoule\n* Aloe gel\n* Angel aqua moisture cream (but in a thicker layer than I would in the morning)\n\n**Other skincare that I don't do daily;** on the weekends I'll apply a sheet mask for extra hydration and what I typically do is the \"wet dressing\" method. I do my skincare routine like normal in the evening but I apply the aloe in a THICK layer and then place the sheet mask on top. This prevents the hydration from escaping and then I top it off with the angel aqua cream.",

      "content": "Hello all, its my first time posting so im sorry if i dont meet certain requirements (ToT)\n\nI recently started getting into skin care and have been starting to adjust to retinol within my routine. For my routine so far:\n\nAm : Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser, Tonymoly Mochi Toner, CeraVe moisturizing lotion, Canmake SPF\n\nPm: Hydrating Cleanser, Toner, CeraVe moisturizer, and retinol (Chemist Confessions Double Play retinol) (alternating with a blackhead treatment)\n\nI have been having some neck darkness that isnt extreme and is resemblance to that of a slight tan. I understand most tans arent \"fixable\" through having glycolic acid, but since I have looked at it I wondered if I can easily apply retinol under my eyes and use the glycolic acid treatments on my neck? It wouldnt be the same location, and likely on alternating days. Im still new to applying retinol, so it would be a future-ward thing to apply the other but would that lead to damage for my skin? If it is advised against id like to know why if so. If you think that maybe its better off to just scrub and use something lighter or nothing at all lmk too. I do apply sunscreen there ever since starting more care, only now these past few weeks,,,\n\nTldr; can i apply retinol under my eyes and use a glycolic acid for my neck on alternating days? Are they safe for that use?",

I have been using that one really popular skala but honestly I don't think it is working out well for me. I am also looking for a strong hold gel to keep my curls/waves for more than a day. \n\nMy routine: \n\n1. garnier shampoo and conditioner (I like the shampoo but might change the conditioner if needed instead of a leave in, my hairstylist did mention that).\n\n2. skala as a leave in\n\n3. aussie miracle curls or nym gel (level 3).\n\n4. Diffuse a little but then I let it air dry\n\nand I do this all in the evening\n\nAny help and product recommendations would appreciated! ",
