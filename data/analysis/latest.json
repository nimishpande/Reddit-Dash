      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I looked at the ingredients list, if you can call it that and it’s just a mix of oils and a few mystery additives. No brand name, no proper label. When I told her that might not be safe, she said I was being dramatic and that “we used this kind of stuff long before these Western brands existed.”\n\nI tried using it once just to make her happy, but it made my skin sting and left me with small bumps for days. I told her I’d rather stick to my regular moisturizer and she got upset, saying I’m “too influenced by the internet.”I don’t want to disrespect her but I also don’t want to ruin my skin.",

I've been recommended wide-tooth combs a lot, but I can't even pass fingers through my hair. It gets tangled and matted so fast! \n\nMy living conditions are also far from ideal. I work in wildland fire in the summer, and chainsaw work in the winter. So I wear hardhats all the time, in very hot and very cold conditions, I always end up with twigs and branches struck through my hair, which end up damaging my hair when I try to pull it out. \n\nI also live in a dry cabin with a woodstove, so its very dry inside in the winter, and I don't have a regular access to a shower. (I setup a camping shower in the greenhouse this summer and it's been awesome, but it's now winter and I'm not showering outside at -30 😅)\n\nSo far, my routine has been to shampoo, condition and use a detangle brush every time I shower, then air dry. It varies from everyday up to a week between a proper overhead shower. I'm not brand-loyal when it comes to toiletries, but I try to avoid the cheaper brands.\n\nI always wear hats, but I'm hoping for a way to get better coils/waves instead of a giant poof in the back of my head.

      "content": "I’m a brown [31F] and I was looking for a simple moisturizing oil online, something to help with the dry patches that have been terrorizing my face since last winter. But somewhere between the checkout button and my half-asleep scrolling spree, I must have clicked on the wrong product. Fast-forward two weeks, and a package labeled “Skin Lightening Oil Premium Glow Formula” shows up at my doorstep.\n\nI laughed at first, the kind of laugh that hides mild panic. I mean, what does lightening even mean anymore? I wasn’t trying to alter my skin tone; I just wanted hydration, not a personality shift. Still, I unwrapped the package. I tested a tiny drop on my arm, and while I didn’t turn into a fairytale ghost, the scent alone could resurrect the dead, sharp, citrusy, and oddly confident.\n\nNow the bottle sits on my dresser like a cautionary tale of late-night online shopping. A friend suggested I check Alibaba because apparently, they have every version of this stuff ever made. Honestly, I came to ask for advice from this subreddit before I make any other decision. Please which moisturizing oil can I buy without losing my melanin? I don’t have any skin allergies so I’m open to exploring.",

I have never been to a hair stylist, I’m not even sure what I’d ask for.\n\nAs of now I wash once a week, condition daily then use leave in conditioner and curl gel. Sleep in braids, and then comb out and wear natural the next day. I’ll take any suggestions, routines, products, professional treatments, anything, you can’t hurt my feelings.\n\nI’ve tried wearing protective styles like box braids, but I swear it just made my hair break off really badly, so I gave that up. I just want to feel and look good! :)",

      "content": "Hi all! For context, these pads from SkinMedica have been a holy grail product for me for the past year because I’ve been using tretinoin for years but struggled with the constant peeling and buildup of dead skin on my face. These pads completely fixed that problem for me and really took me to that next, ‘glass skin’ level where my skin is always new and smooth with no buildup sitting on top, my other products don’t pill, and makeup sits so much better now that there is no dead skin or flakiness for it to cling to. I also feel like it has helped fade my PIH, helps clear up any active pimples so quickly, and it helps me ensure my skin is extra clean (after double cleansing the pads will sometimes still pick up some makeup residue!).\n\nNow the catch is each jar is $60, so $1 per pad. I don’t use them every day but still often enough to where I’ve repurchased them several times already. I always wonder if there’s a cheaper alternative but I’m scared to try something new and break out when these work for me so well. I’m hoping someone here knows of any dupes, or could take a look at the ingredients I screenshotted from the SM website and let me know if I truly need all of these key ingredients together to get the benefits I listed above or if there’s just one of them that’s doing most of the work that I could buy from The Ordinary or something and get the same results? Thank you all so much in advance! &lt;33 (sorry for the literal essay I could talk about skincare for HOURS lol)",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",
