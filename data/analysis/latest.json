These results are with the volume brush!! \n\nI’m also super happy, because I’ve been working to get my curls back. In 2021 I dyed my hair dark for a couple months. Decided I wanted to try going back to my natural hair color. I went to a salon. They ended up messing my hair up so bad. I walked out with bright orange hair. I ended up box dyeing it a couple months after, because there was such a drastic difference between my regrowth and the dye. It was definitely a better transition, but it set me back to day one. My curls were in this in between stage where I couldn’t just leave them alone, but I couldn’t get them to look presentable. So I started using heat tools to make it look semi presentable. Last three photos have been taken in the last 4 years since then. \n\nI have spent the last 2 years trying to grow all the dye out, I only straighten it occasionally, and I’ve learned more about my hair and what works for it. \n\nRoutine: \n\n- I double shampoo with the Pantene Volume shampoo. Once a week I switch it out with the Ouai Detox Shampoo (this is what I used today with the first 4 pictures). \n\n- L’Oréal Elvive Hyaluron+plump Shampoo and Conditioner\n\n- Redken Mega Soft Curls Leave in Conditioner\n\n- Moroccan Oil Curl Cream\n\n- Bounce Curl Volume Brush\n\n- Moroccan Oil Volume Mousse\n\n- Kerastase hair oil\n",

I don't have an income so I get what I can. I only air dry, I don't have a diffuser. just a dryer with no attachments. if I gel I will put it up in a cheap bonnet for 10-15 so I'm not dripping water everywhere.

I also seem to completely miss the back of my hair when I make extra sure I get gel back there... I wonder if I'm doing it wrong or if my bonnet is absorbing it? \n\nI also have autism and the feel of gel in my hair makes my skin crawl. so I don't usually gel. \n\nis there anything I can try doing different? my budget is insanely tight so I can't spend more than $15-$20 on products. \n\nthanks in advance.",

I use Cerave shampoo/conditioner that ive found and its really helped with my psoriasis! i shower almost if not every day and was shampooing every time. my hair started to become greasy the next day and i was told it was because i wash my hair so often. so i started to wash every two days, as well as using a silk bonnet that my friend had recommended i try overnight and sometimes during the day. thats been going on for about three weeks now but my hair is still greasy sometimes the same night but always the next day. im starting to get frustrated ive never had this issue so bad and i dont want people thinking im unhygienic, could it be the shampoo? should i be using another product?",

I originally had bleached blonde strips on my virgin hair as shown in the pics attached, and then I had to color it brown (at a salon) for work a few months later. I'm pretty sure the hairstylist used some black dye shades to cover a skunk strip I had to make sure it wouldn't show up.\n\nA few months later, I boxed dyed it permanent red hair dye, but it didn't even show up, so my hair looks the same as the last picture attached. I would prefer not to go to a salon, as that would definitely be too expensive for me. So, should I use a color remover first before bleaching? Or just go for it with 20 vol bleach? Or wait for it to grow out a few years before trying? I'm also fine with having stripey tones of different pink throughout the hair if it's not possible to avoid. Honestly any advice or thoughts are appreciated, thank you!",

After that I use curl gel called “not your mothers sculpting gel” so I rake it in alll over, after coating all the layers through, I shake my head a little, I lift my my hair up a few times and then I start to scrunch, now for drying I plopped my hair by tying it a t-shirt, and then waited for 20 minutes, after that I micro plop for 15 or so minutes but I’m thinking of doing it for less time and after micro plopping I just diffused it in a specific\n\n\nNow as for the routine I did a few nights ago I only changed up my diffusing a tad, didn’t plop or microplop and just diffused. Also I will admit I do not have heat protectant spray but I don’t diffuse all that often tbh. I also finger coiled my hair in sections that night but idk how well it works with wavy hair (or possibly even loose curly hair? Idk)  my hair is thick with fine strands.\n\n\nDoes my hair even have a possibility of getting curlier? Any and all constructive criticism is allowed and encouraged Im still a beginner to this all ",

The front half of the scalp grows straight.\n\nWe tried brushing daily (dry), only brushing while conditioning (once a week). It starts matting quickly, too, which is my main concern. Of course, I can't expect proper cooperation so the routine needs to be simple to maintain. \n\nI'd be really glad if I could get some tips on how to treat them right!
