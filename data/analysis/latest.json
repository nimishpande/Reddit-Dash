      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi guys, I need help with my hair.\n\n\nI've struggled with my hair all my life but I really like curly hair and don't want to give up on it.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what kind of hair/texture/curl I have but it has been looking like this for most of my life now. When I was a kid I had really REALLY defined curls, but they just kind of got messy with time.\n\nThere was a point where I didn't care much about my hair and I pretty much neglected it, but for a couple of years now I have tried to take care of it and have used some advice I hear a lot.\n\n\n\nI don't know if the problem is my hair, my routine or products, my haircut or the way I style my hair (which honestly I have no idea how to do it)\n\nI'll put some pictures of my hair, products that I use and images of what I'm kinda going for.\n\n\n\nI generally don't dislike that much the way it looks from the front, but when I look at pictures or videos of me from the side I really hate it, it looks so puffy, big and round.\n\nI feel that the problem is how is cut or maybe how I style it, but when I go to the barber and say that I want less volume on the back and sides I end up with very short hair or looking exactly the same.\n\nI also should probably let it grow more, for it to look more similar to how I want it, but instead of growing down it grows to the sides lol.\n\n\n\nAbout my routine, I usually only wash my hair with shampoo twice a week, sometimes three times a week, and I use conditioner every day.\n\nThe only thing I use on my hair besides shampoo and conditioner is some gel, which is not too harsh on my hair but just prevents it from getting too frizzy and big.\n\nI don't brush or comb my hair (I mean, it's likely too short for that) I only use my fingers when I wash it and then I dry it with an old t-shirt, a cotton one I think, and I avoid rubbing, I kind of just press the shirt against my hair. Then I'll use some gel to sort of style it and let it finish drying with the air, naturally (?\n\nNormally it doesn't look too puffy when it's a little wet, but then it dries and it just ends up looking like a ball lol. Sometimes if I'm at home or at a restroom, I put some water on it, from time to time during the day.\n\nI don't use any special pillowcase when sleeping but funnily my hair doesn't look that bad when waking up, I also normally shower in the morning so I don't really pay too much attention at night.\n\n\n\nThat was a lot of text haha, sorry if there are any mistakes, English isn't my first language.\n\nBut anyway, I could really use some advice",

      "content": "This will probably be a chaotic read. I really don't know how to phrase all of this in the best way, or even what info is needed here so I'll just throw everything in here in the hopes that something will be useful. \n\nI have very dry skin and eyes and I really need to find something for the eye area to moisturize the hell out of it without leaving me with a ton of milia and breakouts. And idk if it's in any way even related but I have what I think are some skin tags on my lower eye lids and I'd like to not promote the growth of more of those if possible.\n\n  \nI am currently using a Swedish brand of eye cream (ACO) because I don't know where to start and it felt like it could be simple but effective. It is sold at my pharmacy so I think it's very basic. It does help a tiiiny bit but not nearly enough for me to call it effective. \n\nHere is the ingredient list of the ACO eye cream I'm using: Aqua, Glycerin, Canola Oil, AlphaGlucan Oligosaccharide, Diethylhexyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Xylitylglucoside, Cetearyl Olivate, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter Extract, Stearyl Dimethicone, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Anhydroxylitol, Sorbitan Olivate, Polymnia Sonchifolia Root Juice, Tocopheryl Acetate, Allantoin, Sucrose Stearate, Xylitol, Maltodextrin, Glucose, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Lactobacillus, Acetyl Tetrapeptide5, Palmitoyl Tripeptide1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide7, NHydroxysuccinimide, Chrysin, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Acrylates/C1030 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum, Steareth20, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate\n\n  \nSorry that was super long but I felt it might help. I hope it's somewhat readable. \n\n  \nI also have a condition that makes my skin hurt, so idk if it's because of that but just adding eye cream to the area hurts, not like stinging but like my finger prints are sand paper, and that has made me think that maybe there is some type of thick lotion or cream I can put on there for my PM routine (or AM too)? I have used aquaphor a few times but if I understand correctly that doesn't really add moisture, just lock the moisture in that's already there? The aquaphor does not give me the \"sand paper fingers\" feeling, so I was thinking that based off of that, some type of really thick cream could be a good thing. \n\n  \nI am using the LRP Cicaplast baume on my face at night right now for PM, but it does seem to break me out a little (but still worth it for the effect atm) so I'm unsure if that is the best choice for my under eyes or if there is something better that hopefully won't cause milia or breakouts. \n\n  \nI have a habit of skin picking and right now it is really really bad so I'm doing an extremely basic skin care routine for now. I used to have a lot of actives and stuff but I never really paid attention to what actually worked, I just listened to influencers which was a bad move. I am planning on incorporating actives again in the future, I just want the base to be good first.\n\nRoutine right now: \n\nAM: water or nivea soothing micellar water, ACO eye cream, BoJ Relief sun rice &amp; probiotics. \n\nPM: Nivea soothing micellar water or CeraVe hydrating cleanser, the same eye cream and then the cicaplast baume. \n\nI do have a few mornings and nights per week where I forget the skin care entirely though. Working on it! \n\n  \nUnfortunately my budget is very low as I'm on disability, so that probably limits the options a lot. \n\n  \nIf you have read this far, thank you, and please, let me know if you have any suggestions.\n\n  \n",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "I have done research on reddit and elsewhere and I still cannot figure out what my hair needs to look and feel better. \n\nI have a mix of 2c, 3a and 3b curls (it is usually more around 3a-3b but bleaching has caused damage to my curls and their patterns), and I think (based on the quiz and information on this sub) I have medium porosity, medium density, medium texture (apologies if I am using the wrong terminology, I am trying to keep it all straight, no pun intended!). \n\nBUT, I think I am probably wrong on some of the above and I can't figure out how best to categorize my hair so I can get the products to make it feel and look better. \n\n5-6 weeks ago, I had a stylist trash my hair. Terrible haircut, terribly highlights -- it looks and feels awful. I have used olaplex no 3, k18, deep conditioning masks, etc. etc., and it still feels dry as a bone and I can barely get a wide tooth comb through it even when it's sopping wet and full of conditioner. \n\nThe weird thing it is doing now that it has never done before, and I have gotten highlights for so many years and it never did this until now is -- it is almost not absorbing water. I can be in the shower for 10 minutes and get out and it almost looks partially dry directly out of the shower (I don't towel dry it or use heat styling ever)?? Nothing I am using makes it feel at all conditioned and it is frizzy and rough and poofy and dry as the desert. \n\nFrom everything online, I am getting more and more confused on what my hair needs to look and feel better. I understand the only true fix is to cut it off and start over, but I have done that so many times and I want to keep growing it so hopefully there is something I can do to make it look and feel at least a little better.\n\nDoes anyone out there have any recommendations or understand what is going on with my hair? It also takes hours upon hours to air dry (I only ever air dry it), but that is not new, only the it doesn't feel like it gets properly saturated is new this awful go round at the salon.\n\nAny and all help is much appreciated! \n\nMy routine is: \n\n1. Cowash in shower, and very sporadically use a chelating shampoo (we have awful city water). Then I use curlsmith or similar conditioner in the shower and comb it through and let it sit until the shower is done and then rinse it out. \n\n2. Leave in conditioner - both cream and spray (it's a 10 and whatever else I am experimenting with). \n\n3. Every couple of days since being bleached, I alternate olaplex and k18 or a deep conditioning treatment. \n\n3. Then I put in curl cream/gel/and or mousse (not your mother's line) when my hair is sopping wet, and plop with a tshirt and let air dry. \n\n4. Once it is fully dry, I fluff it out with some oil at the ends and that's that! ",

I wash with shampoo and conditioner once a week and rinse daily and apply leave in. My problem is my hair tends to kind of clump up and begins to lose texture and definition. I get sort of a “helmet” appearance after a while and it gets pretty poofy.\n\nI’m very new to hair care stuff since I’m a guy and was basically taught “just shampoo and condition once in a while” but I want to have healthier and better looking hair. I see others with my hair type and for them it looks very defined and almost has a messy/effortless look to it that I want. Usually when my hair is about 70% dry it has that beachy look to it, and I love it but struggle to keep it.\n\nFirst two pics are what my hair looks like now and third pic is the kind of look i’d like to go for with it. As you can see, it’s not as “loose” or textured as the reference image. Any advice is appreciated, I’ve started using leave in recently which helps a lot with moisture and I’m considering using a sea salt spray as well to help with texture. I’ve also received advice to wash more often, like 2-3x a week. I’d love to hear what everyone has to say.\n\nSorry for such a long winded post, if anyone needs extra detail I’m happy to provide.

My hair is long enough that I’m able to put it up now, but I don’t want to stretch out my curls any more than necessary. Is there anything I can do styling-wise to make it look better put together?

      "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI’m kind of a newbie to skincare. I have a minimal routine, which I’ll share, but it took me a long time to settle on a product line that doesn’t irritate my skin. I have rosacea and dry, very sensitive skin. \n\nProducts: La Roche Posay gentle foaming moisturizing wash, LRP double repair moisturizer, LRP triple repair cream (if I’m feeling extra dry) , Good Molecules hyaluronic acid serum, Elta MD UV Skin Recovery SPF 50\n\nMorning: cleanse, moisturize, sunscreen \n\nNight: cleanse, serum, moisturizer \n\nOnce a month or so I dermaplane, followed by a hydrating mask, serum, and moisturizer. \n\nOk, now on to the purpose of this post. On a whim this week I booked for a professional hydrafacial and dermaplaning appointment. \n\nShe dermaplaned first, and I immediately noticed that my skin felt much better than when I do it at home. Probably because she had some lightweight oil and better tools, but I did like it. \n\nThe hydrafacial felt…gimmicky? It was kind of just a slathering of products that left my face feeling sticky for hours and I washed off in the evening. My face was really burning during the facial too, but she said to expect that since she just dermaplaned. The next day (today) my skin does feel bouncy and smooth though. \n\nSo my question is- what’s the consensus on paying for these professional services? My gut is leaning towards dermaplaning only, because I do really feel like that was a better and safer process than when I do it at home. It’s leaning away from regular hydrafacials, but maybe 1-2x a year just because I did enjoy the process. If hydrafacials aren’t worth it, do y’all have something else you recommend for my skin type?",

A minimal routine can make sense when the skin prefers fewer changes. The key is choosing products that support specific concerns instead of grabbing something only because it looked good online or worked well for someone else.\n\nBoth approaches can be valid.

My skin no longer looks dull and dehydrated and my fine lines have disappeared, but my problem is now I get these super deep, almost cystic pimples on my forehead. I never had forehead acne before and I havent changed any other part of my skincare routine other than adding this retinal. This is my routine: \n\nMorning: splash of cold water, skin aqua sunscreen\n\nNight: oil cleanse with jojoba oil, wash that off with arencia rosehip cleanser, Dickenson's witch hazel toner (with hylauronic acid) let dry, apply the BOJ eye cream, let it sink in for a minute before moisturizing with straight jojoba oil (if I'm really dry I will add some castor oil too just to thicken it up) \n\nI'm aware of the possibility that this is a hair issue rather than a skincare issue because I do have blunt bangs but I have a few reasons that disprove that theory somewhat. \n\nI use mane and tail shampoo and olaplex rosemary and mint conditioner but my hair still feels horrible and dry after a shower so I put a little jojoba oil in it as well. I genuinely cannot see how this would cause sudden acne, I have had these bangs for more than 7 years now and only recently started getting forehead breakouts. I use jojoba in my hair because I know it doesnt break my skin out.\n\nDid anyone else get acne in a very specific area after starting retinal? I have been using it since october 20th so more than the recommended 6 weeks trial period. I figured if this was \"purging\" it would be finished by now. I appreciate any and all advice!",
