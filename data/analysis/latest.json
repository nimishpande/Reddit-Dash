I’m trying to achieve even 10% of what she has.\n\nI am currently on day 3 after washing. My current routine for this week was: I shampoo with moisturizing curl talk shampoo, then I do Mielle rosemary mint strengthening hair mask. Then I do 3-in-1 Curl Talk conditioner and don’t fully wash it out and squish in a bit to my ends before exiting the shower.\n\nThen I praying hands Pattern styling custard and drag it through a bit on top.  I then use them bounce curl clips while diffusing on warm setting for heat and low intensity with minimal movement to set the curls. I fluff out the roots after dry with the bounce curl volume comb. I scrunch in Ouai hair oil once dry.\n\nToday I sectioned my hair out while using tresemme keratin smooth weightless anti-frizz finishing spray at the roots and using the bounce curl volume comb diffusing where I sprayed after using the comb on low cold setting to set the spray.\n\nI’m pretty happy with the results, but looking for more tips if anyone has any? \n\nI may just need a hair cut. I just can’t seem the back to achieve the same volume at the back that I get around my face. At the side part it seems flat as well.  Amy other hair spray, how to cut the hair (I just cut my own hair how I feel like, so I’m not scared to try), or technique tips?\n\nI also want to understand how they do her lazy messy updo (see photo)??? I’m totally lost on how that is achieved.\n\n\n",

I got it cut to around shoulder-length (with shrinkage: a little bit past my chin). \n\n**Important context though** On Day 1 of wash day I have less volume and more definition (as seen in pics 1 &amp; 2) but around Day 3-4 I have a LOT of volume (as seen in pics 3 &amp; 5). I also learned it can turn into an afro the first month after my haircut because it was short enough and cut into a round shape (pic 7)\n\nI'm getting another haircut soon and would love to get a pixie this time (reference pics 8-12), but I'd like to get some advice from my fellow redditers. I know all about the pros and cons but I'm just a bit nervous, **with my features will I look more or less feminine? Do I have the features to pull it off? I won't lie, these things are important to me.** Lmk what you think I included pics with and w/o makeup &lt;3\n\nWash-n-go routine:\nWash with Native Coconut shampoo\nConditioner: Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Conditioner, detangle in 6 sections with Crave Naturals brush\nRinse thoroughly\nAdd Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Leave-in Cream to each section, prayer hand method\nBrush style with Crave Naturals brush for volume\nRake in Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic Gel to each section, finger coiling any curls that need some extra love\nAir dry, then scrunch out the crunch with Carol's Daughter 7 Oil Blend Hair &amp; Scalp Oil\nI use a bonnet every night, no refresh\n",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nSo normally I don’t post much, but wanted to drop this as a warning for anyone buying products purely on hype and regretting later.\n\nBack in September I got into fitness, and by December started protein supplements. My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily.\n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nSo normally I don’t post much, but wanted to drop this as a warning for anyone buying products purely on hype and regretting later.\n\nBack in September I got into fitness, and by December started protein supplements. My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily. \n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

I’ve been using 1 mg finasteride for 3 months, and I just started using the (cheap) Kirkland 5% minoxidil solution once a day.\n\nI started on the recommendation of a trichologist, and she did a baseline evaluation with a trichoscope.\n\nAll the vellus hairs you can see in the images are brand new—similar length, very tiny, but pigmented.\n\nThe images cover a 4 mm × 7.5 mm area (about 0.3 cm²). The white patches are residue from the cheap minoxidil/vehicle.\n\nI know these vellus hairs most likely won’t become terminal, but I’m impressed by how quickly minoxidil can push hairs into a growth phase and make them sprout so fast, seemingly all at the same time. It gives me hope it will positively impact my terminal hairs too (I’m currently around \\~30 follicular units per cm² on an NW7 pattern, with a lot of thin single-hair follicular units), so I can eventually go for a transplant.\n\nI’ll keep updating this.\n\nCheers.\n\n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I just always struggle to find time for it in a very busy schedule.\n\nWhen I was young this wasn’t a problem at all. None of my family are very concerned about thier looks, and we lived in a small outdoorsy town, where most people didn’t care about it.\n\nSince moving out of my parent’s house and to the city, I’ve become increasingly self-aware of how I look, especially after my long-term boyfriend and I broke up. I’ve been noticing it for three years now, but it just keeps getting worse and worse, where for the past six months or so I hate how I look almost every time I look in the mirror, I want to delete photographs (even if it’s a memory I want to remember) because I can’t stand too look at myself in the picture, I go to thrift stores and don’t buy any clothes because when I try them on I just feel disappointed at how bad I look, etc.\n\nIt hasn’t actually affected my life that much, I don’t have a hard time making friends and none of my friends really put a lot of effort into their appearance, either. People don’t treat me any differently than they used to. I just hate feeling this way, and I feel like most people go through this in high school, but I managed to save it somehow, ugh!\n\nSo, long story short I’m just asking for advice on what to do. It’s not exactly a unique experience, so what do you do to deal with feelings like this? I’ve been trying to “love myself” and do words of affirmation and what not, but it’s hard asf and not working🧍I’ve been considering makeup but.. it just seems time consuming to learn, and like it probably wouldn’t actually solve my problems.\n\nAny advice appreciated!\n\nEdit: to clarify, I am fairly skinny and actually slightly toned. My main problem is with my face—my skin but also literally the structure of it.",

      "content": "To make a super long story (kind of) short, I finally decided to lock in and finally do the proper steps in an attempt to improve my skincare routine. My regular skincare routine usually just consists of two things which is cleanser and moisturizer. For a while, it was going okay, however as time passed on, I kept noticing that sometimes I just wake up to more pimples than usual. My major concern is that while sebaceous filaments are normal, my pores in particular keeps to seem gettin enlarged even though I don’t even regularly touch my face much. I rarely pop pimples either and just put a pimple patch, but they do keep coming back which is possibly due to the extremely humid climate as I come from the SEA region. \n\nAfter doing some research, I do know that it’s best to start with a cleanser, then toners, and ending with moisturizers. With this in mind, I have tried incorporating toners at some point to my skincare journey, but they really just don’t work as well as some brands market them to be at least fron my experience. I’ve done the research as well as consulted a dermatologist who did confirm that my speculations of my skin type was correct so here I am, trying to budget my skincare routine as I can’t really afford seeing a regular dermatologist either. \n\nPlease do help and give me advice if the products I have recently purchased in hopes of reducing my acne are of any use!! I made sure to read the ingredient list and did my best to find products that have little to no fragrance! \n\nFor Cleanser: \\[Arencia\\] Green Tea + LHA Deep Pore Rice Cake Cleanser 150ml\n\nFor Moisturizer: RoundLab Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream 80ml\n\nFor Sunscreen: Biore UV Sunscreen \n\nThe AM/PM routine that I do have in mind right now is the following!! &lt;3\n\n**AM Routine:**\n\n1. Wash hands before touching face -&gt; Wash face with lukewarm water. \n\n2. Apply moisturizer in the morning and let it dry for a good amount of time.\n\n3. Afterwards, apply sunscreen in the morning before going out to start my day.\n\n**PM Routine:** \n\n1. Repeat previous first step. \n\n2. Apply a small amount of Arencia cleanser and leave on for about 2 minutes before rinsing off. Pat dry as needed. \n\n3. Afterwards, apply moisturizer and let it sit for a bit.\n\n4. Once it’s dried, apply lip balm repair. \n\n5. Finish! \n\nPlease do let me know if you guys can recommend me another way to execute my initial routine! I plan on starting it by tomorrow &lt;3\n\n**TLDR: Looking for skincare routine advice and tips to reduce acne breakouts**",

Honestly, it's made me really insecure. I get scared seeing my face on camera or in photos now 😔\n\nI'm really hoping a good tone-up sunscreen can help me look a bit better on camera and feel more confident. I'm on the hunt for one that can help brighten my dull complexion and even out some redness/PIH, but my absolute top priority is finding one that won't cause breakouts or clog pores. My skin is super acne-prone and oily, so I'd love something lightweight, non-comedogenic, and ideally fragrance-free! 🙏\n\nI've seen some love for the d'alba tone up sunscreen, abib glutathione cc sunscreen, and the Skin Aqua Tone Up UV Essence (pink or mint). Has anyone with skin like mine tried these? How did they work for you?\n\nMy Skin Profile:\n\n1. Type: Acne-prone, oily, with post-acne marks and dullness.\n2. Looking For:\n  · A gentle brightening/tone-up effect (no ghostly white cast, please! 👻)\n  · Safe for acne-prone &amp; oily skin (oil-free/non-comedogenic is a huge plus)\n  · Fragrance-free (my skin can be sensitive to scents)\n  · natural tone up (I have light-medium skin tone) \n  · Good protection like SPF 50+ PA++++\n\nI would be so, so grateful for any recommendations: your holy grails, what to avoid, or any tips!

      "content": "Hey team!\n\nI'm a 27 year old male and I thought to ask the community and get some advice from others who might be in a similar position as myself, and what you did to assist.\n\nSince I was 15 in highschool, acne has been a tame issue in my life, ranging from just my lower mouth/ chin area to my back as well. It got really bad on my back a few years ago, in which I was prescribed accutane for a few months to help rid this, which it did! It hasn't been nearly as bad evert since.\n\nHowever, my chin/lower mouth hasn't had the best of luck. For the better part of a decade now I've consistently gotten pimples, and whiteheads. and those nasty red bumps which you just know will eventually come to surface after a couple days. I've been good with my diet and exercise as it's something I maintain to a very healthy degree, and my skincare routine is nice and simplified, but effective I'd like to think. I cleanse, moisturize, apply sunscreen, and also use azelaic acid in the morning, then differin in the evening. This has been a routine for at least 6 months now, and my skin type is combination.\n\nI have visited a Dermatollogis twice before who sadly just pointed me to sell their expensive line of skincare and didn't once have any intention of helping, so that really turned me sour about going back. My father and older brother both have had spots in the past, so I'm very much aware genetics also play a big part in this. I just want to see what other suggestions you all have, I'm happy to discuss :) Happy new year!!",

I noticed that the only real “dry” place on my face is right below my eyebrows, so I started putting a little bit of the Holy Hydration moisturizer by ELF I use on my face under my eyebrows and on my lids. Well, I noticed a tiny bump on my lid after a while and kind of ignored it. Some time later, another one has popped up ONLY on my left eyelid and under my left eyebrow, the rest of my face is fine. After I looked it up, I believe they may be milia. I’ve read that some moisturizers may be “too rich” and can cause them? Like great 🤦🏻‍♀️ I’m picky af with moisturizer (can’t stand heavy ones or ones I can feel sitting on my face) I find one I really like and it works well for my face but it causes problems with the one area I have dryness. \n\nMy question is, does anyone have a recommendation for a **lightweight and cruelty free** moisturizer I can put under my eyebrows to help the dry patches that won’t cause milia? Or could I use the moisturizer and just use something like Vaseline under my eyebrows?\n\nIncluded pic. Circled in blue is the dry patch (sometimes it gets a little bit more than it is in pic) and circled in pink is what I believe are the milia. ",

Some people have naturally thin hair.\n\nIt's vital to take identical photos every few months. Remember that [consistent lighting is extremely important](/r/tressless/comments/fxb0xn).\n\nAge and family history are worth mentioning.\n\n## Just starting out?\n\n1. Read the [beginner's guide](https://tressless.com/learn/beginners-guide)\n2. Read the [\"learn\" section](https://tressless.com/learn) section with different treatments\n3. [use search](https://tressless.com/search) *before* asking any questions.\n4. [Chat with the TresslessGPT bot](https://tressless.com/chat) to ask any questions about treatment or their hairline, it's free for everyone now.\n\n## Ready to start treating?\n\n1.

Now I’m actually having troubles with how much density I have. No matter what I do with minoxidil it seems to just keep on giving me dandruff even with nizoral and I have had a bunch of hair loss. So I decided to stop using it at all and so far my scalp feels better, no itching, less flakes, and less hair loss until about a week and a half into quitting where it’s been ramping up. \n\n\nIs this the right thing to do for my hair loss?

Over the past few years, though, it’s started appearing on my neck and face especially around my lips.\n\nThe rest of my face is generally okay, sometimes a little dry around the eyes but manageable. The area around my lips is the real issue. My skin feels compromised: it flakes, becomes sore, and often ends up with open wounds because I struggle not to pick at it. I feel really stuck and unsure what to do next.\n\nI’ve tried countless creams with little success. I also want to mention that I’ve used topical steroids for a long time in the past in this area , and I’m concerned this may have thinned and weakened the skin around this area (no longer do this it’s been about 5years since) \n\nVaseline, Zinc and sometimes ointment’s help a little to keep the skin soft but it just dries up after a few hours anyway and I just have to keep applying. \n\n\nAt this point, I’m feeling quite lost and would really appreciate any guidance or suggestions\nThanks x ",
