Both Photos are with wet hair. IMO, wet hair is when you really see how thin it's getting. \n\nInitially i was on Rogaine and off brand (Kirkland) for many years, noticed in my late 30s.  Finally got on Fin last year. I opted for topical due to fear of side effects. Topical has worked remarkably well for me and I've had 0 side effects. \n\nJust wanted to post to show the progress i've made in 12 months. First picture was at the begining of a shed. It did get a little worse than what's shown here however i only took pics on the 15th of the month and only after i saw the shed getting better. In hindsight i should have taken photos of the shed because it was very heartbreaking.  However, by Nov it was getting better. Taking photos every month really helped me keep the faith.   \n\nI've also noticed my hair is much more healthy looking. Prior to this it always seemed dried out, almost wiry and tired. Now it seems much healthier, almost bouncier... if that's a thing.  \n\nA lot of people have been blaming creatine for thinning and maybe that is the case for me as well. I've also been using Creatine for over 10+ years, just on gym days - 2-3 times a week. I'm still using it. So take that for what it's worth. \n\nGoodluck!",

They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "The short answer is: it doesn't exist. Mineral sunscreens use physical blockers like Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide that sit on top of your skin. Their job is to physically scatter and reflect harmful UV light away from you. Unfortunately, those same ingredients also reflect visible light, creating the white cast we all know. You can't have the UV protection from these minerals without the physical properties that cause the cast.\n\nSo, instead of searching for a unicorn, best bet is to look for sunscreens that are tinted, as the pigment neutralizes the white hue. Alternatively, look for formulas described as sheer or low-cast, which often use smaller mineral particles to drastically reduce how noticeable the cast is. Let's help each other out—what are your favorite low-cast or tinted mineral sunscreens?",

For obvious reasons, I wouldn't like to go back to her. And for a lack of founds and too much social anxiety, I would like to avoid going anywhere else too. \n\nWhat should I do?

I had this style before and loved it, but this time something went wrong maybe a miscommunication and I ended up with a bowl-shaped bob instead. I hated it, but it was already too short to fix, so I decided to wait a bit for it to grow.\n\nAfter about 3 months, I went to another salon to even it out and shape it better, but somehow it looks even more awkward now. My hair is thin and straight, and I can’t really style it nothing holds, and I don’t use products or heat because it’s sensitive and prone to falling. I’ve been really unhappy with it for months.\n\nI just want to get it trimmed in a way that makes it easier to grow into a proper bob or at least something more wearable. What should I tell the hairdresser exactly? Or should I just wait it out and let it grow more before cutting again ? What would you recommend ? \n\nreference pictures: current situation and the hair once i had (so you can understand my texture and how it is naturally styled better)\n",

But now, after a big cut, the curls always end up looking super defined but kind of like ribbons — almost fake-looking. Do you think a volume brush would give me a more natural look, or would ! lose too much definition? Or even a denman idk i've never used one before!\nAlso, I have a middle part with curtain bangs and I really don't want to give it up - | just can't see myself without a middle part!\nWhat do you guys think would look the best?",

      "content": "# Intro\n\nHere we are, 2 years later. I stop checking this sub long ago, but I wanted to do this post because I think I owe it to you, the same way at a certain time every \"success post\" was really important to keep hope and try the treatment.\n\n# Beginning\n\nPics 1-5 are the initial state. At that time I had been using minox for 3 years, because I noticed balding but I didn't want to jump on finas yet. But then it worsened, and I thought that I was willing to take the risk. So I started minox 5% finas 0.2% combination topical. My normal routine was 2 ml at night. I was pretty constant, but I skip some days also without much problem.\n\n# Progress\n\nStarted noticing some results around 4/5 months mark, but also I had really bad shedding at some stages of the process. I remember around month 8/9 I had my hair in really bad condition, and I was on the verge of panicking and switching my treatment. I didn't, I just took a deep breath, decided to just stop looking, comparing, checking this sub and obsessing about my hair, telling to myself that the treatment needs 2 years, so that's the time when I can check for results\"\n\n# Final results\n\nPics 6-10 show the state of my hair now, at 2 year mark. Due to the change of the mindset, I don't remember exactly at what point my hair started looking better, but I guess it improved around the year mark. It wasn't a straight line, and I notice that at certain months (like now, precisely) I shed more hair than others. But in general I'm pretty happy with the results, I didn't expect more. I don't have sides either (at least, not something that I can really notice or affects my life).\n\n# My (not requested) piece of advice\n\nBe constant and patient, let the treatment work, don't get obsessed, don't expect crazy results (I know my hair is not my 16s hair, and that's fine because I'm not 16 anymore) and be optimistic, statistics are playing in your favor and they are more powerful than anecdotal evidence. I would like also to know your opinion, out of curiosity, about my progress. Good luck to all and thanks to this sub for teaching and helping me to save my hair!",

My fringe always ends up to short compared to the rest of my hair every time I grow my hair out, causing it to always either form in the middle of my forehead, leaving gaps at my temples or not staying down like in the photos, although in this case my fringe really is too short for that. This has always been a pain to me since I always just end up throwing a cap on because of it. Could I fix this by just carrying on growing it out? I get I am just in the awkward phase but I would love to know if it's worth the wait since it has always felt like no matter what I couldn't get a cut that doesn't leave my fringe like this.\n\nMy current routine is to washing it with a pantene smooth and sleek shampoo every 3 to 4 days and using the conditioner version of that every couple of days. I have found that doing this has massively improved the texture of my hair since it was always bristely like iron wool, which would make it turn into a sort of afro😭",

It lifts my hair pretty good and when I use it I mix in 050 wella cooling so it’s almost the perfect color when it’s freshly dyed.\n\nWhen I bleached it, it was obviously less orange because I got it to a yellow color, but it was way too damaging for my hair so I stopped. With the box dye it fades to a really orange color and the only way I can kind of fix it is to put a super ash blonde dye on it, but it only works for 2-3 washes then it’s orange again.\n\nI do not want to bleach my hair anymore and would like to stick with the L’Oréal high lift, but I want to combat the orange without having to dye my hair every couple weeks. \n\nWould I be able to mix a demi blue dye in with a conditioner and stain my hair blue? That way when it fades it should be a blueish hue? I remember once when I dyed my hair blue from brown it faded out to a dark ash brown, would it work with a lighter brown like mine? Please let me know, I am mainly worried about my hair health and having to maintain it would damage it. I am okay with lightening my roots every month or so, but not having to do that on top of dyeing it. ",

Its texture is a bit rougher than the rest of my skin, and without the flash on, it is still visibly darker (not by much, though).
