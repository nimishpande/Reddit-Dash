After styling the whole head, i scrunch in different angles using mousse (Herbal essences, the red one.) and i use a tiny bit of gel as a finisher, glazing it and scrunching. (Etniker coco y linaza, the denser version.) I plop using a microfiber towel and diffuse with my head upside down, then i break the cast and separate curls using oil. (Oleo extraordinario, elvive.)",

However, I can’t find any other source confirming these claims.\n\nCan anyone confirm the accuracy of this article or comment on the reliability of this journal in general?\n\nThe english article was translated through AI.

      "content": "Heyy everyone,\nso I have curly-ish hair with some tighter curls in the front and waves near the nape of my neck. I also have fine hair, that's prone to breakage and being weighted down by products. \nIm starting to feel like its not worth the effort to do my hair routine since the curls usually end up looking terrible and it's easier just to brush and let it air dry where it usually ends up being half straight half wavy.\nI'm also afraid that I'm forcing my curls and I've deluded myself into thinking I have curly hair since everyone else in my family has curls.\n\nI use Pantene Curly shampoo and conditioner, and suave clarifying shampoo once a week. I section my hair into three sections (bottom to top) and use 1 pump of Umberto Giannini Curl Whip per section. Then I go in with Umberto Giannini Curl Jelly. First I scrunch with my hands, and then scrunch with a cotton T-shirt. \nTo dry my hair I hover dry with the diffuser and then when it's about 80% dry, I diffuse each side of my head while at a 90° angle. \n\nI've tried curl balms and creams but in my experience they just weighed my hair down and made it greasy. \n\nI just really don't know what to do anymore. It always looks stringy and frizzy and I usually end up brushing it out and putting it in a bun.\n\nI would be so thankful for any advice or suggestions!!\n",

Had a rough year…got a divorce, was in a bad car accident where someone t-boned my car in an intersection. Trying to improve myself one step at a time in my new world :) \n\nPhotos:\nIn each collage, the top photo is before treatment (May 2025), and the bottoms are end of August → end of September → Oct 24 (current).\n\nThe difference up front is wild, my hairline and temples are slowly filling in, with baby hairs turning terminal and the shape slowly starting to look more natural now. \n\n⸻\n\n⚙️ Current Routine \n\t•\tOral Minoxidil 5 mg daily (2.5 mg AM + 2.5 mg PM)\n\t•\tOral Dutasteride 0.5 mg daily\n\t•\tTopical Minoxidil 5 % twice daily\n\t•\tMicroneedling: 0.5 mm derma roller (2×/-3xweek) + 1.5 mm derma stamp (weekly)\n\t•\tNizoral 2 % shampoo 3–4×/week\n\t•\tHead &amp; Shoulders on off days\n\n⸻\n\n🧴 Adjunct / Supplemental Stuff\n\t•\tVitamins: A, B-complex, C, D, E\n\t•\tCollagen (10 g/day), Silica, MSM, Iron, Saw Palmetto, Zinc, Biotin, Omega-3\n\t•\tHair support: keratin + panthenol products + weekly hair mask\n\t•\tOccasional topicals: caffeine, melatonin, and hair peptide serums (because… why not😅)\n\t•\tSilk pillowcases for less friction\n\n⸻\n\n⚡ Results &amp; Side Effects\n\t•\tHairline thickening and blending together\n\t•\tTemples slowly closing in\n\t•\tOverall density, texture, and color look healthier\n\t•\tSide effects: a few forehead pimples, nothing major. Everything else is good including the good old 🍆 \n\n⸻\n\nStill only about 5 months in, but I’m thrilled with the progress so far.\n\nHappy to answer questions — and good luck to everyone in the trenches. 💪",

I tried washing it only 3 times a week but it doesn't help.\n\nI'm currently growing it out for a wolf cut or a ponytail, but not if it keeps going like that...\n\nSo i'd like to seek your advice and guidance to stop looking like a homeless.

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I’ve had probably 3 haircuts in the past year— one to cut layers on the top (slight shag), and two maintenance trims to grow length but keep the shape.\n\nI don’t know if this is a normal amount of hair growth, if the cuts are affecting the entire length of my hair, if the color stunted my growth, if I need to be taking care of it better, etc.\n\nI’ve been dealing with medical issues and every couple months I’ll find myself having gone 4 weeks without any water added to my hair because I literally only do wash and go. The rest of the time I wet it (including washing, conditioning, stying, and 99% of the time air drying) once a week, seldom twice.\n\nMy normal routine:\n-Wash\n-Apply conditioner\n-Detangle\n-Rinse most of the conditioner out but not all\n-Cream and gel or mousse + scrunch\n-Air dry\n\nI don’t remember what products I used a year ago. Yesterday I used (this second pic is day 2 hair) :\n-Shea Moisture Curl and Shine shampoo\n-The Doux Honey Deep Conditioner, detangle with wide tooth comb, then rinse (immediately this time because it took like 30 mins just to detangle)\n-Scrunch out excess water but I have high porosity so it leaves a lot still\n-Apply The Doux C.R.E.A.M. (praying hands)\n-Apply The Doux Mousse (praying hands)\n-rake and scrunch\n-Air dry\n\nOther info:\n-I’m very overdue for a maintenance cut, I know\n-Hair is very dry by day 7\n-I am looking into a curly brush for the shower because I feel like it would clump the curls better and allow for even better distribution of product\n\nTL;DR: is this normal hair growth? Is there anything you’d recommend for my hair? TIA! 😊",

      "content": "So my hair finally grew enough for me to chop off the chemically straightened ends but since the last time I had curly hair was about 15 years ago I have a lot of questions and would appreciate any help:\n\nMy hair is something in between a 3a and a 3b and my current routine is: I wash my hair maybe once or twice a week depending on how much intense exercise I get. I currently use Redken mega curls (shampoo and conditioner) just because Redken used to work well for me when I had straight but I’m not super sure now.\n\nI after the wash I normally use a leave in conditioner (some australian brand my curl specialist salon had) on the ends and a Ouidad gel that I scrunch in and diffuse.\n\nThe results really do vary wildly sometimes it’s fine but if I get the timing wrong it can get a bit frizzy. I seem to have better results when I’m generous with the gel and get the inital scrunch and water content just right before diffusing.\n\nIn between washes I use a spray bottle with some water and just do a little spritz and scrunch and that mostly works but it’s definitely more frizzy then. Oh and the climate here is super damp pretty much all year round.\n\nNow for the questions: Is frizzy hair damaged or dry hair? As I mentioned I’m not quite sure about the shampoo and conditioner because I think maybe my hair is a bit dry but I find it hard to tell cause I’m not used to the texture. How do you guys know when your hair is dry? Any suggestions on shampoo and conditioner are welcome. I’ve seen a lot of mentions of clarifying shampoo, is that something that works for everyone? How often do you recommend? Last but not least are replenishing treatments like olaplex ok for curly hair? Are there other brands that work better for curly hair? I used to do this once a month for straight hair, is that ok for curly hair too?",

Homemade hair mask of an egg, natural yogurt and coconut or olive oil roughly every two weeks.\n2. Dove intense repair shampoo and conditioner, once a week I let the conditioner sit for 10 minutes before rinsing. \n3. Air dry as I don’t have a diffuser and want to avoid heat.\n\n\n I think a part of the problem is my hair is quite long (mid-butt length) so it’s weighed down too. Any advice is appreciated.:) TIA!",

They range from 2a all the way to 3a depending on the day (photos attached, ranging from bad -&gt; good day). I literally don't do anything differently on these different days.\n\nI have found that if I don’t wet my hair for about a week, the curls improve, but my hair starts to look very dry. The best my hair has ever looked was during a 3 month long hiking trip.\n\nMy routine has generally involved doing nothing but washing in water. Recently I have tried the following but it hasn’t helped with consistency:\n\n1. Not your mother’s curl defining conditioner (gardenia and mango butter), scrunched into hair\n2. Curl talk sculpting gel applied when wet, also scrunched\n3. Curl talk curl cream also applied when wet (stopped this as it totally separates the strands of my hair, reducing curls)\n\nOnce every week or so: not your mothers curl defining shampoo (gardenia and mango butter).\n\nHair is air dried. I have started using a silk pillowcase but it didn’t change anything.\n\nI feel like I'm missing some product or something. Does anyone have any suggestions? I have cut my hair shorter and it helps a little, but the really nice curls only appear when I have it longer.\n\nThanks!",

      "content": "My 2 year old has beautiful semi curly hair and I have always wanted to let it grow long, like shoulder length/pony tail length. The first photo is his hair right now, the second is his hair 3 weeks ago before I cut it bc my family pressured me by saying it looked a mess. I’ve decided to tune them out this time and finally let it grow. His hair grows extremely fast so I think it would be shoulders length in no time, but in the mean time what can we do with it to avoid the awkward stage? Is there a starting point cut that would help it look less wild when it gets to the second picture length and beyond? He won’t wear a headband, or a hat. I’ve jokingly put it in a ponytail and as long as he doesn’t realize it tied up he’s good.. but what do I do when all of it won’t fit in a pony tail? Any advice appreciated ",
