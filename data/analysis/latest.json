      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi guys!! Posting here because I’m really at a loss for what’s going on with my hair lately. To start, I want to add context to the pictures I added. First picture was taken a few weeks ago, second picture back in August, and third picture 3 years ago today. \nI’ve noticed recently that the following things hace been changing with my hair: \n- the area of my hair that used to have the tightest curls, my crown and my bangs, are noticeably looser and don’t hold as long, if at all. I have to finger coil my crown area to get anything. \n- my wash-and-go’s, which used to last over a month if i allowed it, hardly last two weeks without needing to be refreshed. \n- more breakage when i detangle \n- i have to fight my hair to hold volume when before i used to have to fight my hair to NOT be huge. \n- the products i used to love and adore are mediocre now. \n\nI also want to include that I RARELY straighten my hair (last time was over a year ago), and usually use low heat to diffuse, so heat damage can’t be the issue. I dont do tight hairstyles, hardly do ponytails ever. I sleep on a satin pillowcase, the same kind I’ve been using for years (even when the 3 year old pic was taken). I’ve been on hormonal birth control for over two years (and have not noticed any real change in anything that hormones might affect. My skin is still the same as always, and my cycle has always been regular anyways). I don’t frequently cut my hair, I actually used to cut it more back when the 3 year old pic was taken, so I’m ruling out curl shock as a factor too. \nI wash my hair every 1-2 weeks usually with a cleansing conditioner. I shampoo only 1/2 times a month and use a clarifying shampoo shampoo for one of those days. I use hair masks frequently, either for protein or hydration, for maybe 20 minutes after I shampoo (maybe protein overload? Over hydration?). The only thing I can think of that is messing with my hair is the brand I use…Shea moisture. Mind you, I’ve been using this brand for 7 years and it worked super well even after the CEO and formula changes. But not now. \n\nMy routine has always remained the same: shampoo twice (if I do shampoo), detangle with conditioner using a tangle teezer, use a mask of some sort, wash out with ice cold water. Use a leave in conditioner and section my hair to get maximum definition. Diffuse or air dry after scrunchie with a microfiber towel. \n\nI guess I’m asking if you guys have had similar experience with this brand, and if it makes sense for me to point these changes to me using products that are actually hurting my hair rather than helping it. I would also appreciate if you guys can recommend black owned hair products/brands that I can look into as well. \nThank you for reading my novel!! I appreciate everyone who took the time to read :) \n",

      "title": "[Routine Help] tweaking my routine: the order to do stuff in and wait time",
      "content": "So a couple things: \n\n1: Started shaving regularly several months ago and have noticed I probably need more moisturization on the mornings that I shave but I don't really want to mess with my morning routine too much, I already use a hyaluronic acid and a moisturizer, and I feel like using an aftershave balm would probably mess with the absorption of the rest of my AM routine, unless I can figure out a way to like shift things around, or maybe if using an aftershave balm would do like anything at all if applied after my actives. I definitely should pick up a richer moisturizer for those mornings and also evenings in general as I've noticed it hasn't really been enough as my skin ages so if anyone has any recs for a good rich or semi-rich moisturizer for somewhat sensitive skin that tends to clog kinda easily I'd appreciate it. Currently use the air-repair complexion boosting moisturizer which idk if it's a real thing or not but I've been using it for years and it had been fine, doesn't break me out but it's just too light for me rn. \n\n2: currently adding azelaic acid to my routine, was going to add it in the morning because I already use a glycolic acid toner and retinol at night so I wanted to avoid adding anything else that might be too aggressive, but my morning products are kinda stacking up at this point. I read that it's fine to use after vit c, which I use in the morning, as long as you let the vit c soak in first. But I also read that some people say vit c is good before retinol if you wait, it can help with the absorption? I don't know at this point lol\nEDIT 1: tried adding the azelaic acid suspension just now, as well as waiting after the vit c. I don't normally wait and adding the rest of my products to dry skin felt unpleasant to say the least and there is a tingling I don't particularly like, but I assume that's just from using the azelaic acid for the first time. Should I alternate days for the first week or something? Or switch the vit c to the evening after my glycolic acid toner, since I wait an hour before applying the retinol anyway?\n\nEDIT 2: forgot the third thing\n3: how to work my routine around going to the gym. \nI've wanted to get back to going to the gym, I would be going in the morning and it seems like a waste to do my whole routine, go to the gym and sweat it off, and then go home and shower and reapply. Should I just cleanse and use moisturizer and sunscreen in the morning, and then use like my Garnier micellar water or possibly cleanse again and follow with the rest of the routine? \n\n\nCurrent routine: \n\nAM\n\nWash with African black soap\n\n(Shave here when shaving, with prosaro shaving cream, rinse and then use alum block, let sit and then rinse off again)\n\nThayers rose toner \n\nTO asorbycol glycoside (vit c)\n\n=wait like 10 minutes=\n\n(Would add TO azelaic acid 10% suspension here)\n\nTO hyaluronic acid\n\nAir repair moisturizer\n\nBeauty of Joseon sunscreen with niacinamide \n\n\nPM\n\nWipe with Garnier micellar cleansing water\n\n(Usually would do a first cleanse here with shisedo perfect oil cleanser but I ran out a while ago and it's expensive so I never got around to replacing it but it will come back eventually lol)\n\nCleanse with Avene cleanance acne salycilic acid 2% cleanser\n\nTO glycolic acid toner \n\n=wait 1 hr=\n\nPrescription .1% adaptaline rétinol\n\nKhiels avocado eye treatment \n\nAir repair moisturizer\n\nLaneige lip mask \n\nAny advice appreciated! Even if it's not something I specifically asked about.  \nEspecially hoping to hear from folks who shave as there doesn't seem to be a lot of folks with elaborate skincare routines in the wetshaving subreddit lol",

And yes, I've tried every possible solution – sprays, ointments, oils, everything available online – but it's literally useless. I visited the doctor, but he wasn't interested at all; he just gave me the same solutions I found online. So this is my last resort, which is to ask for advice from you guys.

It would be clear for months then bam - problems again! I always felt so defeated. Through countless derm visits &amp; trying different meds &amp; products, I’m now able to maintain my current skin. \n\nThe 1st doc I saw prescribed 0.1% tret, which messed up my skin so bad (1st pic). This was for someone who never used tret before! Luckily, I stopped &amp; saw an actual derm years later. From 19-25, I took spiro. It helped manage my hormonal acne &amp; I think made my oily skin drier. I picked up tret again along the way, &amp; that combo really helped with texture &amp; acne as well. I’ve since stopped both &amp; is only using tazarotene in my late 20s.\n\nThis past year, I invested in microneedling. It was SO worth it! My texture became smoother with less acne scar &amp; it improved my skin tone.\n\nDespite massive progress over the years, I still fear acne whenever it comes up. I still struggle with large pores (my biggest battle rn), acne here &amp; there, &amp; uneven skin tone. After constant years of having acne &amp; still does sometimes, it leaves a little scar on you. 🥲 My skin isn’t perfect. It will never be. Nevertheless, I am very happy with my skin right now. \n\nI don’t want to make this post longer than what it is so can put my routine in the comments! \n\n",

      "content": "Hi guys! This is going to be a long post but I need some help. So about a few years ago, whenever I got out of the shower and let my hair air dry, my hair would always get wavy and poofy and frizzy instead of staying straight. But I ignored that for years and kept treating my hair like it was straight, even straightening it regularly because I liked the sleek look.\n\nAbout two years ago, I discovered curly hair and wavy hair routines, so I tried some products and they worked really well. But the routine felt like too much of a hassle, so I went back to straightening.\n\nRecently, I decided I want to wear my hair natural again, so I’ve been experimenting with different products. I also have high porosity hair now because I bleached it a few months ago, and I still don’t feel like I’ve found the right routine.\n\nRight now, I use the Ouai Detox Shampoo and then the purple Pureology shampoo. I don’t use a regular conditioner just deep conditioning masks. I rotate between the Fino mask, the Gisou mask, and the Amika Intense Bond Repair mask. After the shower, I dry my hair with a microfiber towel.\n\nFor styling, curl creams weigh my hair down, so I stick to a lightweight leave in (the Pureology one works well for me). Then I use a mousse (either Umberto Giannini Curl Foam or Curlsmith Invincible Mousse) and a strong hold gel (Aveda Curl Enhancer Gel gives me a good cast). Sometimes I also use Curlsmith In-Shower Style Fixer. I either plop with a T-shirt or scrunch out excess water and diffuse on low speed/medium heat.\n\nAt first, I get a great cast with really pretty waves and some spirals, but once I scrunch out the crunch, I end up with straight pieces and lose a lot of definition. The next day is even worse, even though I pineapple and sleep with a bonnet. It’s honestly getting really demotivating.\n\nDoes anyone know what I might be doing wrong or what I should change? Also, what hair type do you think I might have, and how can I enhance my curl pattern? I get actual ringlets underneath my hair, so I’m not sure where I fall on the curl spectrum. And is curl training even a real thing? If so, how do you actually do it? Any advice would really help!\n",

Now it's Nov and my usual one spot of acne before my period has been there all month, more have shown up.\n\nMy face is oily I can feel it. I have been looking into proper face wash to help but I don't know the first thing about it. I know I am doing it wrong with just water but I want to change that. \n\nI did some research and read that oil based face wash is good for oily skin? Seems like a scam but I don't know anything.

I've recently started to finally attempt to get my acne under control, and my dermatologist has put me on a plethora of things, but my current moisturizer is currently a little too out of my price range for the amount that I currently go through 😭\n\nI'm currently prescribed spironolactone, 50mg, along with adapalene cream in the evenings and sulfacetamide sodium 10% lotion in the mornings- using these after washing with neutrogena ultra gentle cleansing foam. It's working decently well, as I also include Farmacy Brighten up 3% TXA dark spot toner with azeliac acid, followed with Neutrogena hydroboost hydro serum and Farmacy Honey Halo. \n\nThe issues lies with the Farmacy Honey Halo moisturizer. \nIt's one of the very few moisturizers I can use without my face getting obnoxiously red and sensitive, but I personally cannot justify 1.7oz for almost 50 bucks. On sale or not, I just can't maintain that. \n\nI've tried a bunch of other moisturizers- vanicream (made my skin burn no matter what I did.)\nCetaphil (super red and burning)\nNeutrogena ( not as hydrating for me as I need)\n\nSo I'm looking for recommendations! Preferably needing a creamy, thicker formula. Not water or gel based. Cica encouraged but not really fully necessary, honey is a HUGE bonus as it's one of the ingredients that actually helps my face not turn into a tomato every time I wash my face! \n\nPlease help! I've spent way too much money trying things out just to have it be the totally wrong thing for me.\n\n",

The extent to which I will style is using products like sprays, mouse, or leave in products, or using a sock to do sock curls. I like having layered hair and like having some pieces that frame my face. I didn't mind the bangs but I don't think I would like a bang like I did before, as it did get a bit annoying after a week to deal with as I kept having to trim them myself to keep up the maintenance on them, until I eventually grew them out.\n\nMy coworkers say I should try out a wolf cut or some kind of shag cut but I don't know as they seem like you'd need to do your hair to maintain that look.

      "content": "A lot of people hate Nizoral because it dries their hair out like the Sahara, so I thought I’d share what I’ve been doing. I use Nizoral 2% twice a week (Monday + Thursday), and this routine has basically stopped all that dryness while still letting me get the anti-DHT benefits.\n\nHere’s my routine:\n\t\n•\tNizoral 2% – massage it in, leave it for a few mins, rinse.\n\t\n•\tEgo QV Nourishing Shampoo straight after – super gentle, helps bring the moisture back.\n\t\n•\tEgo QV Nourishing Conditioner – this stuff is underrated. I let it sit for a bit then rinse.\n\nAfter I get out of the shower:\n\t\n•\tTowel-dry lightly so it’s still damp, not dripping.\n\t\n•\tUse 2–3 pumps of Schwarzkopf Extra Care Hair Treatment Oil (the one with argan oil). I run it through the mid-lengths to ends, not the roots.\n\t•\tDry/style as usual.\n\nThe result:\nMy hair doesn’t go dry or brittle at all. It actually looks like “day-after-wash” hair — soft, not fluffy, a bit of healthy texture, and it smells good. Basically, Nizoral without the punishment.\n\nHopefully this helps someone who’s struggling with the dryness. Niz 2% doesn’t have to feel like you’re scrubbing with dish soap.",
