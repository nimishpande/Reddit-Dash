      "content": "I was asked in another sub to post my hair routine, so here it is! It‚Äôs a little wacky, so I‚Äôll try to make it make sense. Also there is probably a better way to achieve what I‚Äôm doing, so if you have any tips please share! \n\n1) Cleanse with either Maria Nila Coils &amp; Curls Co-Wash or DevaCurl No-Poo Original. \n2) Gently towel-press dry with DevaCurl towel\n3) Spray some kind of sea salt spray‚Ä¶Maria Nila Ocean Spray is probably my favorite, but I‚Äôve tried lots that work similarly. Sometimes I use a gel instead during this step, but usually it‚Äôs the spray. \n4) Usually on my wash days (I typically do it in the evening), that‚Äôs it for my routine. I let it air dry, and then go to bed, and when I wake up in the morning it usually looks crazy/terrible üòÜ. I‚Äôve tried a silk bonnet, but so far I haven‚Äôt found one that is comfortable! \n5) In the morning, if it‚Äôs just been freshly washed the night before, I‚Äôll sprinkle Sexy Hair Powder Play around and then spray all around with hairspray. (Yes, I put the products on dry, crazy morning hair, before the next step). If not freshly washed, skip this step. \n6) With my curly hair towel handy, I tip my head into my bathroom sink, turn on the water, and soak all of my hair by cupping water in my hand and pressing it to my head, if that makes sense‚Ä¶this helps re-form the curls. \n7) Gently towel-press hair dry. \n8) I let it air dry while making breakfast for the kids and getting them ready for the day. \n9) Diffuse on hot low (my diffuser is from DevaCurl and I love it) until it‚Äôs dry. \n10) Sprinkle Powder Play, spray again with hairspray. Sometimes I‚Äôll diffuse again after hairspray. \n11) Gently rub a flat palm on the crunchy areas to break up the cast. Extra Powder Play and/or hairspray in areas if needed, to give extra hold/height/interest for that ‚Äúmessy‚Äù look. \n\nI hope that all makes sense! My hair probably looks best on days 3-5 post-wash. It gets easier to style as a bit more product builds up from previous days. \n\nIt‚Äôs been a fun year with my curls‚Ä¶I wore my hair long, bleach blonde, and straight for decades, and last November I shaved it all off. I‚Äôll include photos of now and before. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíõ",

I've been using the cosrx snail mucin for quite some time, probably finished 4 or 5 bottles but honestly, I didn‚Äôt see much improvement. I just kept using it without any real reason.Recently, I read about using glycerin on the skin and decided to give it a try and my skin loved it!\n\nBought the atomiser from Blinkit and got glycerin and distilled water from a local pharmacy. Glycerin needs to be diluted, otherwise it can make your skin feel even drier. I diluted it in about 1:8 ratio (glycerin : distilled water)\n\nThe glycerin bottle cost me around 50, and the distilled water packets were rs.3 each. I spray it on my face when it‚Äôs slightly damp after cleansing, then follow up with a moisturizer. I‚Äôve been loving it lately, it‚Äôs super hydrating and very budget friendly!",

I feel like I haven‚Äôt found anyone to achieve this no matter how much I explain or how many inspo photos I bring. Attached are inspo photos.   \n\nThe way I have explained my desired result to stylists is: I want to utilize my *natural* color as much as possible, but want to enhance it with some brightness. I don‚Äôt want highlights all the way to the root. I am looking to achieve a more seamless grow out and lived-in look, that can go longer in between appointments. I would like for the face framing pieces to be brought up a little higher than the rest. I prefer a neutral-bright blonde that doesn‚Äôt lean super warm or super ashy.\n\nThe first stylist did a full head of teasylights all the way to the root. I felt like once she left to go mix up the color, she completely blanked on what I asked for. I ended up way too blonde and with a harsh grow out line. The second stylist I saw told me my inspo can only be achieved with a shadow root. I don‚Äôt care for a shadow root because I find it fades warm and rather than a seamless grow out, I end up with a band of my natural hair, a band of the shadow root, and then blonde.   \n\nAm I just completely wrong in how I‚Äôm explaining what I want?\n\nTLDR; what should I tell my stylist to achieve a look similar to the inspo photos on natural level 7 hair ",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n¬†\n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n¬†\n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n¬†\n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n¬†\n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n¬†\n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you‚Äôve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you¬†\n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

(Since I'm to the point I can afford better now). I got a glycolipid cream cleanser, Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%, salicylic acid 2% anhydrous solution (still not sure what it means?) and a moisturizer that just says \"natural moisturizing factors + HA\". I did their little skin test and just went with the products it recommended to give them a try. I was just wondering if there were any ways to flesh it out and make sure I don't do more harm than good. For example, I read that you need to wear sunscreen with salicylic acid because it makes your skin more sensitive? Here for advice any is appreciated!! I find my skin always super oily until it isn't and it randomly dries out.. I have no idea what I'm doing and I really would like to manage my pores as well without those stupid pore strips. ",

My mom cared of my hair of my childhood, and she did an amazing job! no iron, no dryer, always with low ponytails‚Ä¶ fr, the best job.\n\nWhen I was 12, i did a big chop, and I hated it. I growed my hair without going to the stylist til my 17‚Äôs (1rst photo). That was my best curly era, long, healthy‚Ä¶ i loved it and i felt so proud of my hair.\n\nThen, I went to uni and I did a mini-balayage, still having amazing hair! but felt it a bit shorter (?) idk why! then I started to use dryers, maximum heat and air (yeah, i know, curly terrorism.) (2nd photo)\n\nThen, i realised that all that heat was not good for my hair, and i decided to be more responsable of it and take care. AND NOW I‚ÄôVE THE WORST HAIR EVER! dry, feels so dead, always puffy when i go out‚Ä¶ HORRIBLE. I don‚Äôt feel secure with it, and i start to feel so ugly and insecure.\n\nMy routine has been always the same:\n\n- Shampoo and conditioner = (i‚Äôve been using fructis all my life, now i‚Äôm with pantene curly.)\n\n-Gel and mousse (I‚Äôm using the mercadona‚Äôs ones, my mom and I have used them since i can remember.)\n\n- Dry it with dyson (I bought it bc it‚Äôs supposed to be less harmful), medium heat medium air\n\nI remember that I always used to air dry my hair, but it took hours... I don't use oil after my routine because my hair gets really frizzy as soon as I step outside.\n\nI feel completely hopeless. I've tried sleeping with olive oil, making flaxseed gel and letting it sit, increasing the amount of water I drink...  Please, if someone knows how to help me, i‚Äôll be so grateful!!!\n\nPd.

Yes I take a ton of treatment it‚Äôs just I have allergies so severe.\n\nWhat happens when I go into a salon though and am exposed to all that hair, is like 100 times worse. I immediately start to feel itchy, then my eyes water, my nose starts to run, and then I begin to hitch until I start literally uncontrollably rapid sneezing, which makes it hard for the hairdresser who‚Äôs working on my hair, and I‚Äôve even been requested to figure out an alternative next time I get a cut somewhere. \n\nThe issue is a problem because I am in desperate need I feel of a trim and to get my hair done professionally. I have very very thick super curly hair and it‚Äôs past my butt when wet. I wanna feel comfortable in the chair even when I need to let the sneezes out or blow my nose but I don‚Äôt know what to request or how to handle it with a stylist. What would you do if you were in my position, or I was your client? \n\nMy routine consists of washing weekly, with garnier fructis shampoo and conditioner, detangling with conditioner in my hair while brushing with a wet brush, then after awhile rinsing the conditioner somewhat, and then once out of the shower I scrunch in Garnier fructis gel, then I let it air dry and then scrunch the crunch out. \n\n\nThanks so much!

      "content": "Hi, I'm 31F and overwhelmed. I'm trying to take my skincare more seriously. I‚Äôve been using the Some by Mi ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù AHA BHA PHA set (toner, moisturizer, and serum) for a while, and they‚Äôre okay but I‚Äôd like something a little more tailored to my needs. My skin tends to be dull, oily with dry spots, I struggle with large pores especially around my nose, hyperpigmentation under my eyes, dark circles, acne scars, and uneven tone and texture. I also have redness but it‚Äôs from lupus, not rosacea or anything like that so I‚Äôm not sure if that can be helped.\n\nI‚Äôve been looking into The Ordinary because I love their glycolic acid for my body, and have narrowed down to these products:\n- Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner (I‚Äôve just never used it on my face)\n- Vitamin C Ascorbyl Glucoside 12% (OR Vitamin C Suspension 23% + Hyaluronic Acid Spheres 2%, Serum with Pure L-Ascorbic Acid ?? What‚Äôs the difference?)\n- Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5\n- Retinol 1% in Squalane\n- Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer\n- Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG\n- Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%\n- AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\n\nI honestly have no idea what to use, in what order, at what time of day, how many times weekly, or what products can‚Äôt be used together (if any). I read through the wiki, but there seems to be a lot of variables and I‚Äôm just overwhelmed. \n\nAlso struggling to find sunscreen. I avoid sunlight as much as possible because of lupus, but I do live in Florida.\n\nThank you in advance. ",
