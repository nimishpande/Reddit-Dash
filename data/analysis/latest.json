Apply GENEROUS amounts of curling cream after every wash when still wet. Style by sectioning into small strands and detangle each separately by pulling between fingers until it runs smooth. Takes about 20 minutes. Air dry and never diffuse. Scrunch once dry.  \n\n\nMaintenance: Sleep with a bonnet. Loosely tie with a silk or fuzzy crunchy under the bonnet. Retie or style in the morning as needed with wetted hands. Trim ends every four months to keep curls healthy, hair doesn’t curl as nicely with damaged ends.  \n\n\nProducts: OGX argan oil of morocco shampoo and conditioner. Marc Anthony coconut and shea curling cream.  \n\n\nPictures taken at end of each day",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I have been having a big issue with frizz for quite a while and I was wondering if anyone would be able to tell me why/give me some tips on how to fix it. My curls are usually shiny and decently defined in the front and then the back is almost always not defined and frizzy. The back of my hair seems to be more coarse as well. My routine is as follows:\n\n1. Shampoo with Tresemme Shampoo (it’s not always the same type but lately I’ve been liking the Keratin Smooth one in the red bottle). I use a silicone scalp brush to make sure I get rid of as much residue as possible from my scalp\n\n2. Condition with Tresemme conditioner as well (usually either the Rich Moisture one or the Bouncy Curls one). I comb through the conditioner with a wide tooth comb and then i usually do a loose braid and let the conditioner sit for a couple minutes\n\n3. For styling, I usually like to use LUS brands step 3 All-in-One leave in but I am currently out of that so for a while now I have been using Cantù Coconut Curling Cream. I use a brush to saturate it all in my hair. I use a microfibre towel to scrunch out excess water and then I use praying hands to apply medium hold gel (most of the time it’s Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel but recently I have been trying the Olaplex number 10 gel). \n\n4. I scrunch my hair again with the microfibre towel and air dry until almost fully dry and then I diffuse until it’s completely dry. After it’s dry, I add the Argon Oil of Morocco penetrating oil, scrunching in and loosening the cast of the gel. \n\nEven after all this, I almost always end up with frizzy hair in the back. I even try to take smaller strands in the back and spray them with more water and make sure they’re totally saturated with product but nothing seems to help. I can never get even definition around my head. Any help is welcome 💔",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Any tips or suggestions are appreciated!",

      "content": "Looking for advice on my skincare routine and what to add. Here's my face above as a reference for what my issues appear as on me. \n\nI have ezcema that makes very dry and it never gets oily. I already use lotion for it that works pretty well. I use the goldbond ezcema relief lotion that has 7 moisturizers and 3 vitamins in it, it is specifically hand cream but it also works really well on my face. Outside of that there are other things. I have slight facial redness, idk if it's potential rosacea or smth but parts of my face appeaars pink. It looks like I have a natural blush on my face. And I have dark circles under my eyes. Its sadly genetic and I was born with them, there's baby photos of me with them. Aside from these there's nothing else. My freckles are natural and not from sun damage. I have very tiny pores that are barely visible and they don't really get clogged or at least not enough to cause whiteheads and blackheads. I use a charcoal face masks every few weeks to a month and barely anything comes off. And I don't really deal with acne nor have any scars from it (aside from that one red dot next to my nose that I believe is a ruptured blood vessel from a pimple I popped in my teens) and tbh I haven't had a single pimple since I was 16 (I am now 24).\n\nIdk what other products I should use aside from the lotion I already have and the occasional charcoal face masks. I'm not super self conscious about these things. My chronic facial dryness bugs the hell out of me though. Any routine advice on what products to use and recommendations would be very helpful. Something I should note though, I can't use anything with retinol. Idk if it's an allergy or just my skin sensitivity caused by my eczema but retinol makes my face burn and break out. The breakouts aren't severe but it's painful and leaves my face inflamed for Days. So products with retinol is a must avoid for me. Aside from that any help and recommendations is appreciated 🩷!",

My skin has always been oily and porous with 1-6 pimples at all times.\n\nI have taken quizzes and tried multiple products and nothing has slowed my oil down whatsoever and I’m needing to blot 3-4 hours after I wake up everyday. My routine is as follows\n\nMorning\n\ncerave foaming facial cleanser\n•\t⁠thayers with hazel toner\n•\t⁠cetaphil SPF moisturizer\n\nNight\n\nbiossance: Amino Aloe Gentle Pore Minimizing Cleanser + Squalane\n•\t⁠cetaphil extra gentle daily scrub\n•\t⁠cerave moisturizing lotion\n\nIdeally I would love to stop dealing with acne at 27, I also would like to minimize my oil (can’t wear foundation for longer than 2 hours as it will literally collect on my skin in a pile) and minimize the pores I best can.\n\nAny advice?

I use dove dragon fruit body wash and strawberry milk body lotion from a Japanese brand I believe. Unfortunately, my skin has been really dry and itchy after and I get eczema flare ups. I've only been doing this for 4ish days so far. On day 4 I got really itchy and started just showering in the evenings and I'm still itchy / dry and flaky.\n\nIs there anything I can do to continue this routine or do I have to change it? I love how it makes me feel and smell which is why I'm hesitant to go back to my original routine which was olay body wash and no lotion once a day or two. I really love the dragon fruit smell from dove. If I must go back to the way things were than I will, but I wanted to try here first to see if anyone had any advice.\n\nThank you!!",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Hey, so for about a month now I’ve been living in this constant fear that I’m somehow stretching or damaging my skin. Every time I accidentally touch or rub it, I go into a full anxiety spiral.\n\nThe worst part is that when I get anxious, I end up doing the same thing over and over again, touching and checking the skin to “see” how much I might’ve stretched it. It just makes everything worse, but I can’t seem to stop.\n\nI’m honestly exhausted. I feel paranoid almost every day and I hate living like this. I know I probably need mental health help, but that’s just not possible for me right now.\n\nAnyway, yesterday I felt a bit of pain on the inside of my mouth while eating, and since then I’ve been obsessively pushing my tongue against my cheek, pressing food or water against it, and just constantly checking it. Now I’m terrified I might have stretched my skin and its going to sag now.\n\nplease be honest, have i done any significant damage by doing that yesterday? and does anyone else struggle with something similar to this?",

Here is my current routine:\n\nI shampoo (matrix shampoo) my hair 2 to 3 times a week, followed by a conditioner (matrix conditioner), and then parachute hair cream. I oil my hair one night before shampoo. I cannot use oil all day as it makes my hair very heavy and difficult to manage. I use coconut oil btw.\n\nOn non shampoo day i just use water and then the parachute hair cream. Recently I have started oiling my hair on non shampoo days and just wash it with water. This helped a little bit.\n\nOn shampoo day my hair feels shiny and hydrated for 7-8 hours and on non shampoo days they get dry and dull in just 2 hours.\n\nAny tips would be highly recommended. 🙏",

      "content": "Tbh, I struggled with this with longer hair too. My issue is that I'll be done with washing and have soaking wet hair (I don't use any leave in product as my hair is thin and fine) and I'm just at a loss with how to \"set it\" to make it look natural. After rinsing my conditioner out it's all plastered to my skull/face. I'll try using a wide tooth comb to maintain curl clumps and get it to stop sticking to my head/give it some lift at the roots, but it always ends up being obvious which directions I combed it in, and the roots will be a little straightened out. If I try scrunching it bunches my hair into different obvious \"zones\" and exposes my scalp more. I've also tried shaking out my curls but it always looks weird and frizzy that way too. The shaking out bit might work better with gel but I struggle to get it to disperse when I scrunch because there's so little length and I end up with the \"zones\" again...\n\nI'm at a loss, any tips are super appreciated! Thank you!\n\nWash routine:\n1. Clarifying shampoo (occasionally subbed for maui shampoo)\n2. Leave in maui moisture volumizing conditioner for 5min\n3. Wash out conditioner with a little bit of maui moisture volumizing shampoo\n4. Air dry (heat is too damaging)",
