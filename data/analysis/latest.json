The Phase IIa trial that read out in June 2025 showed that 31% of male patients with a higher degree of hair loss had a greater than 20% increase in hair density at week eight—which was four weeks after the completion of treatment. No patients in the placebo arm hit this exploratory endpoint.\n\n“Pelage is not alone in the burgeoning alopecia market. Veradermics is developing an oral extended-release version of minoxidil for pattern hair loss, which is in Phase III trials. Gil and Weng believe there could be combination opportunities in the future.\"",

Once my hair is dry enough that it isn't soaking, I let it air dry.\n\nPLEASE let me know what else I should introduce into my regiment!! I'm definitely looking for advice.

I love the soft but grainy texture. I do have to use it twice to get makeup off though. 8/10\n\nVt Reedle shot PDRN 300- the pdrn leaves my skin looking more supple than any other hyaluronic acid I’ve tried. I’m looking at you Torredin. 7/10\n\nD-alba aromatic spray serum- the best mist I’ve tried to rehydrate my skin. I don’t like that you have to shake it before applying because I forget to sometimes….The mist is so fine. 7/10\n\nSkinceuticals phloretin CF- I tried the normal CE version of this serum but it was too greasy and would make my skin looking oily, not glowing from within. This is a staple in my routine now. Best vitamin c I’ve tried. 9/10\n\nI’m from honey mask- nothing gets my skin right back on track quite like this mask. When my brother was going through it with acne, he would beg me for more of this mask. It’s just so good and hydrating. I don’t like how you have to pick it out with your finger though, it doesn’t feel very sterile. 9/10\n\nTatcha the dewy skin cream- no words needed. It’s just the best. 100/10\n\nGlow recipe plum plum cream- I love this formulation for under makeup. It doesn’t leave a film of grease but it’s not a gel either. It’s the perfect in between. I wouldn’t use it with my night time routine thought as it just wouldn’t be enough. 7/10\n\nHaruharu wonder rice essence- I thought this essence was all hype but no bite but I still bought it and omg I’m never using another essence again. This stuff makes my skin actually glow for dayyyys. 1000/10\n\nAnua azalaic acid serum- this is a new incorporation in my routine. I was worried about using 10% on my skin but it has been quite gentle and has been working really well with the vitamin c. 7/10\n\nIlso sebum softener- also a new edition to my routine but it’s going no where. Holy moly this stuff makes my nose look poreless. I’m sure you can get the same effect with any toner and scraping tool though. I just love the procedural feel of this product lol 8.5/10.  \n\n ",

I started doing research and here’s my routine:\n\nWet\n\nNot Your Mothers Defining Curl Talk Cream\n\nBrush\n\nSection off\n\nUse edge brush to wrap curls\n\nThis is reflected in the first picture. The top of her head is straight so I had to do a little baby sprout pony tail after that fell pretty quickly. \n\nThe other photos are her hair just wet, brushed, and kinda “shook out” with my fingers. This was easier but I’m not sure if it’s best for her curls. \n\nShe uses Aussie moisturizing shampoo. We do not condition because her hair is so short. Should I be doing that?\n\nIs my routine right? It seems so long and tedious. What do I do about post nap bedhead? She will not do a bonnet and I’d have to get all silk bedding because she breakdances in her sleep. Is it ok to wet it down and brush it three times a day (morning, post nap, bed time)? \n\nI’m so lost. Mine and my eldest’s hair is pin straight. My friends are recommending a lot of products and to use a cotton shirt or special hair towel. Any other advice is welcome!! \n\nAlso is it normal the top of her head is straight? ",

I’ve dyed it blonde a few times before and it always came out looking great. But this time, for some reason it just…didn’t. \n\nI gave it time. I used purple shampoo per many people’s advice, and that did actually help a little. \n\nBut it’s been several months and yeah, nah, I can’t be in denial anymore: I hate it. I don’t know what happened this time but it washes me out like crazy. \n\nWearing a certain wardrobe and doing makeup helps, but I miss the days when I didn’t have to worry about what I wore so much to prevent looking washed out. \n\nWhat do you guys think? I dyed it in June, and the roots have grown to about my cheekbones. Should I:\n\n1. Say fuck it and spend $$$ to get it dyed back to my natural color;\n\n2. Make the most of my current blonde era until it grows out; \n\n3. A third option that I don’t know exists yet? \n\nThanks in advance! ",

      "content": "I’ve been dealing with severe inflammatory acne (grade 3) for around 9 years now. I’ve seen multiple dermatologists over the years and have been on isotretinoin (Accutane) on and off for about a year in total. While it helped temporarily, my acne keeps coming back.\n\nI was also diagnosed with insulin resistance and prescribed medication for that, since my doctors suspected it might be contributing to my acne.\n\nAfter years of active acne, I now have significant scarring and texture issues, especially on my cheeks and forehead. I’ve tried multiple in-clinic treatments including:\n\n\t•\tMicroneedling RF (MNRF)\n\n\t•\tLaser treatments\n\n\t•\tChemical peels\n\nNone of these have given me meaningful or lasting improvement, and it’s honestly exhausting to keep spending money and hope on things that don’t seem to work.\n\nAt this point, I’m just looking for real experiences.\n\nHas anyone here dealt with long-term inflammatory acne + scarring like this and actually found something that helped, whether medically, hormonally, lifestyle-wise, or through specific procedures?\n\nI’m not expecting a miracle, just some direction from people who’ve been in a similar place and eventually saw improvement.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to reply.",

It was a special birthday treat but I feel a little underwhelmed and sad I might have wasted so much money with results not what I asked for. Paid £250 but I do have very long thick hair. \n\nI gave her a few photos of blondes but we agreed this photo (on the left lol) was more achievable with least damage. \n\nThe colour ended up great don’t get me wrong, it’s really well done, but I don’t think it’s anything like the photo. I feel like it’s quite a bit darker than I wanted. It’s so much money and I can’t afford to get it redone, but I really wanted to have lighter blonde hair. Granted the photos of my hair aren’t with natural light, but I don’t really think it’s the blonde in the photo. We discussed a root tap and I said I wanted a slight blend as high as possible so I get away with not dying it for a while. But it feels like the brown is still in quite a bit of my hair?\n\nAm I being delusional? Should I say something? Or just try go elsewhere next year maybe. Is this sadness just post hair blues because the result isn’t an airbrushed Pinterest photo? ",
