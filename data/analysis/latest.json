      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

It take lots of time/effort, i was spending way too much on styling products and it every time it would end up looking different\n\nMy girly girl friend thinks heat styled hair looks better on me, either straightened or a blowout but  I'm scared of damaging my hair. Even with regular trimming the split ends are there. The last time i think i used too much heat protection and my hair ended up looking dirty again. I don't know how much heat protection to use and i saw a hairstylist on insta reels says that a leave in conditioner will mess up your styling...but if i don't use it my hair is super frizzy and looks dry\n\nPlease help",

It’s lightweight, absorbs quickly, and never feels greasy, which makes it great for daily use or under makeup. It’s gentle and affordable, so it’s one of those products you don’t feel bad slathering on. The downside is that it’s not super rich, so in colder weather it might not be enough on its own, and it definitely doesn’t help with oil control if you’re on the oilier side. But here’s what surprised me the most: whenever my skin suddenly gets red or irritated, I put two or three pumps on at night as a thick layer and seal it with Vaseline. Every time I do this, I wake up with the redness noticeably reduced. So overall, it’s a reliable, no-drama moisturizer that works well for everyday hydration, even if you might need something heavier for extreme dryness.",

I moved to another country and my usual stylist is able to get my hair to a nice ashy brown, about two shades lighter than my natural color. After going to a salon here, they completely ruined my hair and turned it into a medium reddish-brown, the complete opposite of what I asked for. My hair is naturally a dark ash brown, almost grayish.\n\nThe first two photos are of what my hair currently looks like, the third photo is close to what my natural color is, and the last two are what I would like ideally for it to look like, and the color I usually would dye my hair before.\n\nI know it’s impossible to have completely ashy hair, it needs some level of warmth to have depth. But this is just too warm and orangey-red. You can see the difference in coolness in my roots compared to the ends. These warm tones look absolutely awful against my cooler skin tone and make me look like a cheap clown. ):\nI feel like the stylist didn’t even listen to me and just did what they wanted!!\n\nMy hair is permed so lightening it isn’t an option, but I’ve heard demi-permanent dyes and blue shampoo could help. I’ve tried blue shampoo and it didn’t really do much, and used a demi-permanent ash brown in a level 6A (I think the dyed parts of my hair are about a level 6/7?) but it also didn’t do much…Any suggestions? I’m ok with it being darker as long as it isn’t darker than my natural hair color.",

      "title": "What the Breezula Phase III results mean &amp; realistic timeline",
      "content": "First of all, I want to mention that I talked back and forward with AI, and this is also written with AI. I gave it all the studies, links and other important matter, so I believe all information is as factual as possible, and it's not some 'AI-slop', but actually the result of me talking and feeding the AI for hours.\n\nWe all saw the Cosmo Pharmaceuticals press release today claiming \"up to 539% relative improvement.\" While this sounds incredible, we need to look past the marketing fluff.\nI’ve done a deep dive into the numbers, comparing today’s press release with the hard data from Phase 2 (Hebert et al.), to figure out what this actually means for us.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the results, the timeline, and where this fits in a stack.\n\n1. The \"539% Improvement\" Explained (Don't let the math fool you)\n\nThe press release uses the term \"relative improvement vs. placebo.\" This is a classic statistical way to make numbers look bigger than they are. It does not mean you will grow 539% more hair.\n\nTo get a percentage this high, the placebo group must have lost ground. Here is the likely math behind the scenes:\n\n * Scenario: If the Drug group gained +13 hairs and the Placebo group lost -2.5 hairs.\n\n * The Math: The net difference is 15.5 hairs. If you divide that difference by the absolute loss of the placebo (15.5 / 2.5), you get roughly a ~600% relative difference.\n\nThe Reality: The actual hair count increase is likely modest and consistent with previous studies, not a miracle cure that gives you five times your density back.\n\n2. Anchoring with Phase 2 Data (What to actually expect)\nSince the Phase 3 topline numbers are vague, we have to look at the Phase 2 data (Hebert et al., 2020) to set realistic expectations. The Phase 3 results are likely very similar to the 5% BID (twice daily) results from Phase 2.\n\n * Phase 2 Result (5% BID): +14.3 hairs/cm² (Target Area Hair Count).\n\n * Comparison: This is roughly equivalent to Finasteride 1mg (+10-15 hairs) but lower than Minoxidil 5% (+15-20 hairs).\n\nCrucial Phase 2 Note: In Phase 2, the higher dose (7.5%) actually saw efficacy drop after month 6. The 5% dose remained stable.\n\n * Takeaway: This suggests receptor saturation is real. \"More is not better\" with this drug. The 5% concentration seems to be the sweet spot for long-term maintenance.\n\n3. The New Timeline (Good News)\nPreviously, we assumed we had to wait for the \"Long Term Safety\" data in Spring 2026 before they would even start the paperwork.\n\nHowever, the press release explicitly states: \"US and EU submissions are underway.\"\nThis accelerates the timeline significantly:\n * Old Prediction: 2028.\n * New Realistic Prediction: Late 2026 / Early 2027.\n\nBy starting the submission process now (likely a rolling submission), the FDA review clock is already ticking.\n\n4. The \"Triple Stack\" Synergy\nThe real value of Breezula isn't using it solo—it's the synergy. It is the missing link for a \"perfect\" protocol without nuking your hormones systemically.\n\n * Finasteride/Dutasteride: Lowers the army of enemies (Reduces Serum DHT).\n\n * Breezula: Locks the gate (Competes for the androgen receptor locally).\n\n * (Oral) Minoxidil: Steps on the gas (Growth agonist).\n\nThe Theory:\nCurrently, if you use (Oral) Minoxidil + Finasteride, you have growth + reduced suppression. The remaining 30% of DHT (and local scalp DHT) still fights against your Minoxidil gains.\n\nAdding Breezula in 2027 closes that last gap. It allows Minoxidil to work on follicles that were previously \"stalled\" by residual local DHT. This is, of course, just theory at this point.\n\nTL;DR\n * The 539% is statistical marketing. Expect roughly +14 hairs/cm² (similar to Finasteride efficacy).\n\n * It works. The Phase 3 data validates Phase 2: it is a functional topical anti-androgen.\n\n * Timeline accelerated. Submissions have started. Expect it on shelves (or via import) around Late 2026.\n\n * Best use case: It’s a shield, not a sword. Use it to protect your follicles from local DHT so your Minoxidil can work at 100% capacity.\n ",

      "title": "[Review] Tried Cardi B’s full K-beauty lineup (Fully &gt; Anua &gt; Mixsoon &gt; Missha) and here are my thoughts",
      "content": "I'm obsessed with Cardi B so whenever she posts about her skincare favs, I am sat! She recently posted about Fully, so I thought l'd try out her whole line up and share my honest reviews.\n\nFrom what l've gathered, her routine goes like this:\n1. Fully Green Tomato Clay Mask Cleanser\n2. Anua Niacinamide 10 TXA 4 Serum for Brightening and Dark Spots\n3. Mixsoon Bean Essence\n4. Missha Perfect Cover Serum BB Cream\n\nQuick about me:\nI'm 33 (just like our queen), with combination skin, oily nose, dry cheeks and forehead, and I use retinoids a few nights a week. I try to keep my routine short and sweet, so I only reach for products that are doing the most.\n\nMy experience:\nFully Green Tomato Clay Mask Cleanser: Starting off strong, this was my first time trying Fully and I was pleasantly surprised. Normally I hear clay mask, and run for the hills with my dry skin, but not this time. I loveddd the texture, it's super lightweight, and dries down so fast. I was nervous about it stripping my natural skin barrier, but it didn't at all. It can be used as both a mask and a cleanser, and I can really see myself reaching for this product as a cleanser. After one use, my pores felt clean and less congested, my blackheads cleared out, and my skin looked brighter, without sacrificing hydration. While it's no miracle product, it left my skin feeling clear and smooth, and I'd say it's definitely barrier friendly. Makes me excited to try out more products from Fully!\n\nAnua Niacinamide 10 TXA 4 Serum for Brightening and Dark Spots: Full transparency, I've actually used this one before. I went through a phase where l'd get acne on the sides of my face every time my period showed up so I would use this afterwards to clear up those acne marks. While I do like it, and I agree that it does exactly what it says it does, it takes time, so be prepared to be consistent with it for a while before you see results. I stopped using it, bc I've found other products I prefer for my skin type, so I switched it out for the Numbuzin No.5+ Glutathione Vitamin Concentrated Serum, but thennnn I started on tretinoin and now don't have acne flare ups, so I don't prioritize dark spot correctors. That said, I did try it again for the sake of trying Cardi's full routine, and my skin is nice and bright afterwards. I think it would be great for someone with dark spots that needs brightening, but I also think Numbuzin and CosRx have products that are just as good if not better. So, no complaints, but not going out of my way for it. It is a good price point though!\n\nMixsoon Bean Essence: I've been using this product for a while now and it's my daily go to, so this will be biased. I usually switch off between this Mixsoon Bean Essence and the Aestura Hydro Essence. I really love how moisturizing it is, my skin always feels so hydrated and glowy afterwards. And my tone is more even. The texture was a little off putting at first, as it is a bit tackier than other essences l've tried, but once I got past that and saw the results, I was sold!\n\nMissha Perfect Cover Serum BB Cream: This was my first time using this product, and I got the shade Warm Beige No. 25. I don't normally wear a full face of makeup, so a BB cream is right up my alley. First impressions, it's super lightweight and feels great to wear all day, and has decent coverage for a BB cream, and blends out so easily. It feels very nourishing on, like mixing a serum with a lightweight foundation. It delivers exactly what it says! And I can really see myself reaching for this on days I want to wear a little more makeup. It's perfect for the no-makeup makeup look.\n\nTLDR: Cardi B is spittin FACTS! All her \"most loved\" products really stand up to the hype imo, and are worth trying out. Of course, all skin is different, so there are some I liked more than others, but I'm excited to keep using the Fully Green Tomato Mask and the Missha BB Cream!\n\nIf anyone knows of other products she loves, leave them in the comments, I'd love to try them!",

So far, the only hand cream I've enjoyed using is Soap and Glory's \"hand food\" that I received as part of a gift bundle some time ago. I'd love to buy some more but it's pretty expensive ): \n\nI've tried using neutrogena but it always took forever to fully rub in, and left a white cast on my skin. I also tried using aveeno but no matter how long I spend rubbing it in, it feels like it never \"sinks in\" properly and just sits on top of my skin. I tried picking up a pen to write something down a few minutes after applying some and it just slipped right out of my hand 😭",

Cystic acne, especially on my forehead and also whiteheads and blackheads everywhere.  Cystic acne on my nose, my chin, my jawline, my temples, you name it.  It seems to come and go, which to me might imply that it’s hormonal.  I don’t have perimenopause as far as I know, my hormone tests came out normal.  It could also be the moisturizer or foundation im using, or maybe it’s my diet or the awful water quality here or the dry environment.  Really no idea!  I started using the Fresh Rose hyadraulic acid moisturizer around the same time my acne exploded, could that cause it?  \nI also have an IUD but it’s not hormonal. \n\nI just don’t know what to do and the Dermatologist hasn’t been helpful here. I’ve been on Accutane and I’ve done antibiotics. I’ve done all the medicated creams. Nothing has stuck or worked other than the Accutane for a few years and then it just went back to frequent  breakouts. I’m so frustrated. Does anyone have any thoughts on how to determine what is causing it? Any thoughts on what could be causing it? Any help would be welcome thanks.",

I’ve tried a few SPF moisturizers, but the one i’m currently using is the only one that doesn’t pill under makeup.\n\nwhat do i need to change about my routine when i want to wear makeup? do i need to eliminate some of the skincare on those days? add in extra skin prep? stop using powder products? any advice is much appreciated!

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nFirst time posting ever so if I am doing this wrong then please let me know 😊 In November I had electrocautery treatment on my face to tackle sebaceous hyperplasia and broken capillaries. Man that carried out the treatment had good reviews. Unfortunately, it would appear he has scarred me and caused more broken capillaries.\n\nAdvised me that I could continue to use Finacea (15% azelaic acid) before and after treatment (basically do my usual skincare routine.) The scabs would drop off after about 7-10 days, pink skin for two weeks and then ta-dah! It would be perfect. He reassured me throughout no scarring. It has been a month and he is now backtracking and saying it will take a few months to heal or could be permanent.\n\nHe also caused damage on and around a mole (which I didn’t want treating anyways!) Pigmentation, broken capillaries and bumpy texture around the mole and lots of PIE and PIH on cheeks.\n\nI am continuing to use my azelaic acid to help fade pigmentation and reached out to a dermatologist too to get an appointment.\n\nI’ve enquired about IPL and Pico laser - neither can help me. The new capillaries and hyperpigmentation are too close together and fixing one will worsen the other. Both laser clinics were horrified when I said he told me I could use azelaic acid before and after treatment with no break.\n\nAnyone else had this happen to them? Did it ever return to normal? Are you scarred? Any advice in general would be much appreciated, even if you haven’t directly experienced this.",

Even trying curlers, my hair just flattens in a couple hours. I've looked online for something, but when I search \"fine hair\" I inevitably get results for \"thin hair\" products.

Like Holy cow. I have gone through 2 tubs already and just bought a 60oz version. I love it!! \n\nBut that’s not what I want to address. \nAnyways I am kinda disappointed because I have been using the wizard detaingler and heat protectant by amika.  \n\nMy boyfriend started noticing everything in our apartment was turning yellow. Sheets, towels, bathroom carpet, toothbrush handled etc. like a bright highlighter yellow stains on all these things. The stain is small but very noticeable. I did a toilet paper test and sprayed the heat protectant on a piece of toilet paper and left it there overnight. It had the same exact yellow highlighter stains as the carpet, towels, etc.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else experienced this with this product or any other?  I’ve also found it on the door handles, light switches. I think I’ve found the culprit. Or if anyone could recommend another good heat protectant I would really appreciate it. I used to use the herbal essence one, but they stopped making it.\n",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

My hair has been through ALOT- i had a lot of experimental phases but it’s mostly layers of different dark brown permanent hair dye that has faded into a reddish colour. The middle lighter colour is where i used hair dye stripper but it didn’t work on the ends. The top is my natural colour. This is in very bright lighting which makes it look more extreme however either way I am unhappy with it. Weirdly, I have gotten a lot of compliments on my hair since it’s looked like this 😭 but i can’t stand it - it’s also very dead. I do regular chops but i would rather not cut it too short as short hair really doesn’t suit me. Thanks in advance for any advice! ",
