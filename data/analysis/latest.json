Do I need to go to urgent care to get this checked out if it hasn’t healed by now? \n\nTo clarify the situation: I was at home when I popped it (I know bad idea but it hurt and the spot treatment I was using wasn’t working). (It is not a cold sore, I have never had cold sores and have tested negative for the virus causing cold sores in the past.)\n\nThe day after it was really sore and dry. It has progressively (I think) gotten worse. I have neosporin on it currently. Every day it’s been dry and cracking like crazy making it hurt worse. I’m hoping neosporin will help however I’ve had painful blister-like conditions on my skin before (I know this isn’t a blister) and neosporin usually starts to kick in after a few hours. I’m a little worried about potential infection. I’ve also developed a really bad fixation on it. I have a weird mouth tic now bc it’s so uncomfortable and I try not to touch it but it’s so hard not to. ",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

As per my estheticians suggestion, I started using Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel + Dermalogica Active Moist. The cleanser feels great on my skin and doesn't dry me up but is too expensive! I also really started flaring up after using it but it might be the moisturizer, it doesn't offer the kind of moisture my skin needs I think.\n\nSo I started using La Roche Posay Toleriane cleanser and moisturizer which my derm recommended but the cleanser is giving my skin a burning sensation which I've heard some people on here talk about. The moisturizer is like meh, worried it's also contributing to that sensation..\n\nI'm at a loss right now and need help and cheap recommendations because I can't keep buying and returning products!\n\n",

If I scratch myself it produces histamine and awful red lines that look scary but don’t hurt.\n\nSunscreen is hot or miss for me. I mostly use Neutrogena 70 spf or a 50 spf Bullfrog with insect repellent. I also wear spf shirts, a fishing hat with ear and neck covers, and shorts. It doesn’t matter how much I reapply, even every 30 minutes and waiting for it to dry, my face burns. I have gotten fluid filled blister burns as well. The fishing hat and sunshirt really help, but my cheeks/nose get pretty burned every time I spend 20+ minutes outside.\n\nNormally aloe vera promotes healing, limits scarring, and cools off sunburns. It does not do that for me. An aloe vera gel burns like fire on a sunburn until it is washed off, and it still hurts a bit afterwards. A straight aloe leaf cut in half and applied to a sunburn tingles, burns a little, and gives me slight hives.\n\nIs there anything that can help with sun damage that isn’t aloe vera?

I think I probably sit around a 2B-2C hair type. My roots are grown out but on the bottom I have a balayage.

After conditioner has been in hair for a few minutes, I brush out the knots in the shower with conditioner still in.\n\nRinse out conditioner and keep hair pretty wet. Flip hair upside down and Spray hair with leave in and brush again. \n\nPrayer hands in some mousse and then scrunch with hands. Prayer hands in some gel (like a big glob of gel) and then scrunch with microfibre towel to try to get a lot of the water out.\n\nHover diffuse focusing on the roots till they’re pretty dry (which probably takes the longest but it’s worth it because it gives you that root volume) and then move on to pixie diffusing sections for 1-2 mins on med-low heat and  speed. \n\nFlip the hair back up and finish pixie diffusing until hair is like crunchy I move my head and hair side to side here too. \n\nScrunch hair with hair oil and voila! \n\nI also sleep with a pineapple hairdo in a silk bonnet at night and with diffusing I was actually able to have decent curls for 3 days!
