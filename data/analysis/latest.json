I use it after showering and I’m good for the entire day. \n\nEasily a 10/10 WRP!!\n\nNivea Pearl &amp; Beauty Roll On:\n\nVery average. It was the first one i used (canon event). formula feels slightly sticky for the first few minutes. No sweat control, it just mixes the smell with the deo’s. And no visible brightening. \n\n6/10 WNRP because there are better options now.\n\nRexona Shower Fresh Roll On:\n\ndecent for odour control but way too strong for sensitive skin gave me a slight burning sensation especially on freshly shaved days. works if you need something heavy, but it’s definitely not gentle. \n\n7.5/10 WNRP for me personally cause i have too sensitive skin.",

Then total burning sensation. I realized that i pumped three full shots of Minox into my throat. Oh boy. What a terrible, terrible taste. And you can imagine that it really didn't help with the coughing... Immediate thoughts of how dangerous this could be, but i drank a lot of water out of the sink to get rid of the taste and to thin the Minox in my stomach... Almost threw up... What an evening. Now my head feels warm and i have a terrible taste in my mouth. But i am also richer in experience.\n\nDon't make the same mistake as me.

      "content": "Hello! First-time poster here. I would really appreciate some help with my skin. \n\nI’ve been dealing with stubborn acne along my jawline for years. I had normal acne as a teen, but as a 35-year-old woman, it rarely occurs above my cheekbones. As you can see from the photos, there are some clogged pores which I periodically get extracted with a good professional facial. The acne ranges from flat blemishes to raised pimples, only about 25% of which ever come to a head. I am pretty good about not picking or popping them. \n\nI try to take good care of my skin. Details on product and routines below. My lifestyle is pretty average - I mostly eat balanced meals but have a little bit of a sweet tooth. I’ve tried going dairy-free for about six weeks to no avail. I don’t exercise as much as I should, but I get plenty of walks and vitamin D with my dog. I try not to touch my face during the day and I also don’t frequently have a phone or something else touching my skin. \n\nAM Routine:\nWash with CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser\nApply CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Lotion (SPF 30) \nApply Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen\nI wear makeup most weekdays. Most days I just use Milk makeup primer, NARS concealer, Laura Mercier powder, Milk blush and bronzer. If I’m feeling fancy I’ll use Ilia cream or NARS liquid foundation. I use either clean fingers, clean brush or clean sponge to apply. \n\nPM Routine:\nRemove makeup with Neutrogena Hydroboost Hydrating gel Cleanser (w/ hyaluronic acid) \nDouble cleanse with CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser\nEight Saints Up the Anti night cream\nSmall amount of Clindanycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide (1.2%/5%)\n2-3x/week: Tretinoin gel microsphere (0.1%)\n\nI use Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant to exfoliate ~1x/week. About half of the time that I wash off my makeup, I use a soft washcloth to gently exfoliate. I was also recently gifted a set of products from Glow Recipe: toner, hyaluronic plump cream, recovery serum, eye cream, etc. I’ve been using those here and there since Christmas but I’m hesitant to throw even more into the mix here. \n\nI love my face, despite what we’ve been through. But I’d also really like to improve my skin. Any clues as to what I can do to clear it up? Thanks in advance for your help!",

I’d also like my acne concealed better (I know makeup can’t hide texture, but the redness is still coming through the foundation near my chin). I plan to tell the artist to change these things for the day-of, but I’m looking for other opinions as well.\n\nI’m just looking for feedback on the makeup, since I can’t look at it objectively and am not used to wearing much makeup.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I think this is the best my hair has ever looked, really wish I had more pictures with it. Switched bc my hair started feeling really greasy and product heavy to the point I was washing nearly every day.\n\nPic 2: Cantu leave-in conditioning repair cream, Cantu coconut curling cream, and Aunt Jackie's flaxseed elongating curling gel.\n\nThought these products would stretch my curls more but somehow the opposite happened. Heavy, greasy feeling was even worse than previous routine. Look wasn't bad, tighter curls are just not what I'm going for personally so certainly not worth washing every day for.\n\nPic 3 (Current routine): Carol's Daughter devine strength leave-in cream, Not Your Mother's Curl Talk defining cream, and LA Looks extreme sport gel.\n\nGreasy feeling is gone and I'm back to only washing my hair once or twice a week. My hair is stringy and frizzy however. Any hold I get is lost within a few hours and my hair is left a frizzy mess because my gel won't leave a cast at all with these products under it.\n\nSo either my hair feels bad and I have to wash constantly but it looks the best it's ever looked, or my hair looks bad but feels okay. Do I just suck it up and accept the greasy hair? Any other product recommendations or styling tips?",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I’m incredibly self conscious about every single part of my body, but i do think if i lost my double chin i would be more confident. I already have guasha stuff, and do my best to remember to use it. I do need to drink more water, i know that’s something that would help.

I got another chemical cut, i had to cut my long blonde hair short. eventually i dyed it dark blonde light brown again but then i discovered the highlift color dye. i dyed it in nye of 2024 to 2025 and my hair was doing great. i dye the roots every month, but lately my hair has been feeling reaalllllly weird. like to a point that i feel guilty of even thinking about dying it more cause i seriously feel my hair falling off. my big problem is, i HATE seeing myself with any color but blonde. my natural hair is very similar to the color of sydney sweeney's roots, and what i have right now is whats in the first picture. i ve been feelin my hair getting thinner, having even more frizz, it feels dry but hydrated at some parts(?) idk i feel like im going crazy. my hair gets more sensitive in the winter but what should i do? any hairdresser can give me an honest advice? i have more pictures if needed for a more deep analysis but i kinda wanna hear opinions, what colour should i do? i was thinking in the last picture because she has \"dark\" roots but with the rest of the hair in that darker blonde, she still passes the blonde vibe(?) idk im so confusing and tired, i reallly wanna have nice, healthy and really big hair.

Where I live it is freezing cold and dry all winter and our summers are a dry heat.\n\nI travelled to a humid location a few years back and was completely at a loss for how to manage my curls and mitigate frizz. Also in the humidity my curl pattern intensified to a maybe a 3b.\n\nI am travelling to Mexico for a vacation in a week and this time I am looking for advice. What products should I buy and bring to make my curls thrive in the humidity? How do I manage the halo of frizz that instantly appears the minute I step off the plane? And if you’re feeling generous, tips for styling my hair sans heat because there’s really no point in trying to fight the curl in that kind of humidity 😅\n\nThank you in advance for all replies!\n\nMy usual routine on a wash day is shampoo and condition with television. Lightly towel dry. While still completely wet spray with IGK good behaviour 4 in 1 and brush through. Scrunch. Either diffuse gently or air dry. I don’t protect my hair while sleeping. I find the satin pillow cases too slippery 😩 but I will Mae the sacrifice if you all tell me this is what my hair needs. You will notice I don’t use any curl specific products, I have found them all too heavy and diminish my curls. But I also genuinely have no idea what I’m doing. ",
