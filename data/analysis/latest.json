Earlier in the week i got layers put back into my hair so my waves can ‘breathe’ and the hair stylist used this spray in my hair that she rubbed into her hands and scrunched my hair with before diffusing. After drying my waves had more definition than usual,  no cast and decent volume.\n\nThe spray has this tacky/sticky texture when she applied it to my damp hair which I’ve not come across before and I’m wondering what kind of product it was as it clearly gave hold and good definition. I think it had heat protectant in it too. Would anyone know what this is?\n\n  \nMy usual routine is the joico volumising shampoo and conditioner, Umberto gianni curl jelly shine, bed head smalltalk volumisier, lightly watered down eco gel and a heat protectant before diffusing.  (all styling product as applied sparingly by raking and I shape my waves with my fingers as I have the occasional ringlet) (I’m aware that I’m probably also weighing my hair down with most of these products but ill change to light weight ones after they run out!)\n\nthe photos are my my end of the day hair with the mystery product (ignore the fringe i was trying something new) vs my usual end of day hair ",

She also has sensory problems and won’t let me blow her hair dry and getting a brush through her hair twice a day is about the max she’ll allow. Cutting her hair has caused panic attacks, so we’ve resigned to keeping it long for now. \n\nCurrently, she typically showers at night, and (by her request) she’s using Function of Beauty wavy hair shampoo and conditioner. We’ve tried others, but this one seems to be the best of the ones we’ve tried. She loves her waves. We’ve tried a few different products like curl cream and mouse but they make her hair greasier even faster. She sleeps with it wet. We’ve tried bonnets, they’re hit or miss. Often they fall off overnight. \n\nI know it’s not good to wash hair every day, and she’s not yet at the point of daily showers anyway, but it seems to need to be washed every day! \n\nI’ve tried dry shampoo (so many kinds) and she hates it and I don’t notice much of a difference. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? I just want her to feel confident and good about herself - and she’s okay for now, but I worry about the future and middle school is looming…\n\nThank you in advance! ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I’ve been using the same basic skincare routine for years and (before this) it’s worked great. To help with the oily skin I decided to switch from the Cerave hydrating cleanser to the foaming cleanser. I’m weary of changing my routine too much as I’ve had bad reactions to new products in the past. I’ve only used the cleanser once but I feel like I got a much better clean. But now I want to be sure that I can still keep my regular routine but just switch out the cleansers.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. I’ve never really experienced breakouts before so I’m feeling very ill equipped. Thanks!\n\nMorning:\n\n\\- Cerave cleanser (hydrating, now foaming)\n\n\\- Cerave moisturizer\n\n\\- Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n\\- Cerave cleanser (hydrating, now foaming)\n\n\\- The Ordinary hyaluronic acid\n\n\\- The Ordinary retinol 1%\n\n\\- Youth to the People superberry hydrate and glow dream mask",

      "content": "So, you're probably wondering why I'm so late to the party on this one.. well after over a decade of struggling and straightening and fighting my curls I have finally (with the help of youtube) come back around to wearing my hair curly. It's going pretty well now and I think I have a routine down... or so I thought...\n\nI am trying to reduce my \"goo collection\" and dug out this gem (Citre shine making waves curl booster, see pic) from back in the day. I've sort of known for a while that these products were discontinued, but I had long moved on and so it didn't really bother me. But this week I decided to use this in my routine just so I could use it up and get it out of my closet and lo and behold I LOVE THE RESULTS!!! My curls are very tight on top/front compared to the bottom half of my head and the softness/loosness of this hold somehow makes everything look even and the finish feels sooo clean like i don't even feel like i have product in my hair except it looks great and not frizzy like it would if i really had no product in.\n\nNow I'm panicking because I stumbled upon a product that I actually love and it's been discontinued for over a decade.\n\nAdditional note: It is truly remarkable that the product has maintained it's original chemistry. Other ancient products I've tried to use up recently have come out of the tube completely separated or discolored and have clearly gone bad. But this citre shine product is preserved perfectly, as if I bought it yesterday. Their chemists deserve recognition for that time defying feat.\n\nETA ingredients list:  \nWater, polymethacrylic acid/acrylamidomethyl propane sulfonic acid, citrus aurantifolia (tahiti lime) fruit extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) fruit extract, citrus nobilis (tangelo) fruit extract, panthenol, ascorbic acid, tocopherol, wheat amino acids, carbomer, aminomethyl propanol, oleth-20, sodium benzotriazolyl butylphenol sulfonate, buteth-3, tributyl citrate, disodium edta, dmdm hydantoin, fragrance, mica, titanium dioxide, iron oxides, orange 4, yellow 5.\n\nETA chat gpt results:  \nSo I c/p the ingredients list into chatgpt and told it to find me a dupe, unfortunately it had a hard time getting past the name of the product/claims of the product \"curl booster\" even when I told it to focus on ingredients. (I would not say this product is especially good at \"curl boosting\" infact it allows my super curly top half to better blend with my wavy bottom half so curl boosting? no.   \n  \nAnyway, here's the top result for a dupe from chatgpt : **Briogeo Curl Charisma Rice Amino + Avocado Leave-In Defining Crème.**   \n  \nI'm kind of doubtful becuase it is a cream and my hair is very fine and soft so creams can be too heavy. Also the citre shine is a crystal clear gel.  \nI'm still going to continue using up my goo collection (jenna marbles anyone?) before I start buying more but i guess i'll keep this in my back pocket for later.
