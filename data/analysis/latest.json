I'm also trying to work a sunscreen into my routine, but my face seems weirdly sensitive to sunscreen and gets red and itchy when I apply it, so until I find a suitable one I've just been wearing a hat 😅\n\nI'm still very new to anything skincare and honestly don't know what I'm doing (information overload sometimes!!) but am looking forward to learning more.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Was it really this simple?!” But now unfortunately it feels like a mild sunburn on my skin.\n\nI mentioned this in my last post that I had only been using adapalene twice a week and benzoyl peroxide for spot treatment, and then using other actives the other nights, and I was told “adapalene and benzoyl peroxide are well researched at being effective for skin turnover and ridding bacteria if you use it daily” and that it wouldn’t be effective the way I was using it. But my concern was that my skin is very sensitive, so I kind of feared this very thing.\n\nWill my skin just adapt to using adapalene every day if I just keep using it? I do use sunscreen when I go out so that shouldn’t be a problem. Or do I need to switch to every other day and use another active between?",

Maybe I was expecting too much. \n\nOn the other hand I do notice that my hair looks healthier and thicker, so happy with that. \n\nI’ve had zero side effects, I had friends that took and became depressed but I’m noticing no such things, It’s like I’m not taking anything honestly.

      "title": "[Product Question] Troubleshooting BHA/AHA in my routine?",
      "content": "Hi. To preface, I'm almost 17 with combo skin (as far as I'm aware). My skin concerns: clogged/enlarged pores (blackheads) in the T-zone, uneven texture, dryness in the U-zone, redness, and dullness. \n\nI'm finding my current skincare routine ineffective so I want to essentially start from scratch with my products. So far, Salicylic acid is the ONLY thing that I've seen make a difference in my blackheads/texture—besides using physical exfoliants, which only get rid of them for a day or two at most. For this reason, I'm really wanting to incorporate more BHA &amp; AHA into my routine, but I get sooo many conflicting results on Google.\n\n1) is BHA/AHA too harsh for daily/2x daily use? \n\nI've been eyeing many products which contain hydroxy acids &amp; claim they're gentle enough for daily use, but I'm wondering if this effect sort of 'stacks'. Like, if I use too many 'gentle' hydroxy acid products, could it end up being not so gentle? Specifically, I'm wanting to use Glow recipe's watermelon glow Pore Refining Toner and LANEIGE's new water bank glass skin facial serum, both of which contain BHA. I would preferably want to use these together and in both morning and nightly routines due to their dual purpose nature (both are texture/pore refining and hydrating at the same time, my 2 biggest skin gripes)\n\n2) Is it REALLY bad to pair BHA/AHA with Vitamin C or E? \n\nI've seen oodles of sources say you should NEVER pair them, some that advise caution, some that say they cancel eachother out, and some that say they increase eachothers benefits. So which is it really (generally, I know all skin is different)? The main reason I ask this is I know that Hydroxy acids increase sun sensitivity and Vitamin C/E can protect the skin from that, so it seems like they'd be beneficial in use together. Specifically, I'm eyeing Bubble skincare Day Dream tone &amp; texture serum, which contains Vitamin C—so I worry how that might interact with my incorporation of BHA/AHA.\n\nAnd honestly.. is my skin even 'mature' enough for active ingredients like these? I don't want to wreck my face, and I know exfoliators and acids aren't appropriate for youngsters but I'm not sure about older teens.\n\nAny and all help is appreciated. \n\nP.S: sorry if I tagged the post wrong 💔 wasn't sure if it fell under routine help or product question",
