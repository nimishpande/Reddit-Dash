I personally struggled my entire life with growing my hair to my mermaid dreams, and its finally happening. I have NEVER been someone who says \"My hair grows really fast,\" but now I can see actual progress, when before, my hair would literally never grow beyond my shoulders (when curly). My hair journey is as follows\n\nMiddle school: Str\\*\\*tened my hair several times per week :(\n\nHigh School: Realized how damaged my hair was and dove headfirst into the Curly Girl method. This was not the way FOR ME, personally. I did this throughout college. My scalp was SCREAMING. I also had bad brushing habits and my hair was constantly dry. BUT, it was cute, and my curl pattern came back. I was doing crazy shit you guys. I was putting eggs and avocado on my head. I was dry detangling my hair for an hour with my fingers. I was using all natural shampoos that had the washing power of candle wax. These were not the days.\n\nPost College: Gave up on my dreams. I started using Head and Shoulders, all of the sulfates and silicones (go figure) and kept it basically all drugstore.\n\nEarly 2025: Discovered the Abbey Yung method... and I gotta say... it makes sense.\n\nI just want to say I know that hair is different for everyone, but leaving the CGM did wonders for my hair growth and health. I thought that Head and Shoulders would dry my hair out, but I have quickly discovered that with the right level of conditioning and oils, all of my hair is happier than ever.\n\nCurrent Routine:\n\nUsually a pre oil treatment or Olaplex 3 (K18 after a tax return though, you feel me??)\n\nHead and shoulders (never 2-in-1, though wondering if I should try it for extra conditioning) rinse and repeat. Usually leave on for a few minutes to let the medication settle in.\n\nConditioner: Matrix Food for Soft OR Dove 10-in-1 serum Bond Strength Mask\n\nLeave in: Usually Miss Jessie's Leave-In Condish (the best!) Currently trying Redken ABC. Had high hopes, but it's not thick enough for my hair and doesn't give me the best detangling experience.\n\nCurl Cream: Trying Curls Don't Lie by Isima. Its not a 10/10 but its pretty good!\n\nAir dry: always, because I find it easier.\n\nOil: my lengths with MoroccanOil or OGx Coconut Miracle Oil every other day-ish, depending on literally nothing except what's easier to reach for in my cabinet.\n\nI don't refresh other than oil, I just let it go and look a bit frizzy. Less is more for me\n\n  \nIf you've read this far, what product surprised you or helped you tremendously in reaching your hair goals?? xoxo ",

      "content": "I’ve gotten a few questions here about my skincare lately, so I thought I’d share my experience in case it helps someone.\n\nI’ve been pretty genetically blessed with good skin most of my life. Nothing perfect, but generally clear and low-maintenance. Then about two years ago, I suddenly started getting flare-ups with acne and what I believe was perioral dermatitis. It just wouldn’t go away and was really bothering me. I went to an aesthetician/skin clinic, and they recommended Green Peel. We started with the mildest version, Green Peel Fresh Up.\n\nThe photos I’m sharing are after one Fresh Up treatment, and honestly… I was blown away by the results.\n\nAt the same time, I was also using Elixir SOS Paste, plus generally trying to be more consistent with good skincare, so I can’t say it was 100% only the peel. But the difference was very noticeable. Since then, I’ve done the Fresh Up two more times and plan to do one more in about a month before moving up to the next level. Every time, my skin just looks clearer, calmer, and more glowy. For me, it hasn’t been too uncomfortable. There’s some tingling and mild peeling, but nothing extreme. And the glow afterwards is unreal.\n\nThe “after” photos are about 1.5 years old now, but I’ve also added a more recent photo so you can see that the results have lasted. I’m a bit more tan there because I just got back from vacation (used SPF 50, of course), but overall my skin quality is still really good.\n\nFor reference: I am 35 and have light, Nordic, sensitive skin. They also did one of those skin scans/analyses at the clinic, and my overall skin quality has improved a lot since starting Green Peel + better skincare.\n\nSo is it only the Green Peel? Probably not. It’s likely a combination of treatments + products + consistency. But I do think Green Peel played a big role for me. Not sponsored, not an ad — just sharing my experience. Take from it what you want. Happy to answer questions if anyone has them.",

      "content": " \nI was using minimalist and plum sunscreens last year and they just felt very sticky, greasy or just uncomfortable out in the sun. But this sunscoop actually feels like a proper body lotion that just happens to have SPF 50+ PA++++ in it. Like i just get out of the shower, pump it out like a normal body lotion which acts as a sunscreen too 😭\n\n**Texture and feel**\nVery smooth lotion texture. Not runny, not thick and spreads easily and absorbs pretty fast. After it settles, it doesn’t feel heavy or oily. My skin just feels normal and soft. I can get dressed in a few minutes without that sticky sunscreen feeling.\n\nIt’s SPF 50+ PA++++ with broad spectrum UVA and UVB protection. I’ve worn it out in proper sun and didn’t notice tanning or redness. \n\n**Ingredients I liked**\nWhat makes it better than basic sunscreens is the added skincare.\n5 percent Niacinamide to help with pigmentation and even skin tone.\nIt has 5 Essential Ceramides too.\n\n**Full ingredient list on the bottle:**\nPurified Water, Octocrylene, Niacinamide, Octyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Trehalose, Methylene Bis Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Avena Sativa Oat Kernel Extract, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Aloe Vera Extract, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Propanediol, 1,2 Hexanediol, Hexyldecanol, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Ceramide AS, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide NG, Sodium Acrylate Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, C15 19 Alkane, Fragrance, Sodium Polyacrylate, PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer 6, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium EDTA, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum.\n\nIt’s also free from Benzophenone, Formaldehyde &amp; Oxybenzone, atleast that's what the bottle says.\n\n**Hydration**\nIt actually feels moisturizing. I’ve skipped my regular body lotion a few times and this alone was enough. No dryness, no tightness.\n\nI do not write such long reviews but i am fr in love with this Sunscoop sunscreen body lotion and is honestly the most comfortable body sunscreen I’ve used. High protection, good ingredients, lightweight feel and no greasy mess. For daily use, it’s a solid 10 for me. \n\nDefinitely repurchasing!!!",

How early do you wake up compared to when you need to leave? I’m not a morning person, but I do get up 2 hours before I leave, I usually shower and then sit and drink my coffee, eat breakfast about 40 minutes before I leave, and then I get dressed and go. But because of this routine my hair is always looking a mess (I’m growing a perm out currently which is also making my hair worse), my face is bare (which is okay, but it’s not feeling like me anymore). I have a simple makeup routine id like to do, and I frankly just need to make myself do it. \n\nWhat does your morning routine look like? What are your reasons for doing hair/makeup every day?

Now I’m frustrated because my hair is dry and dead due to bleach, but I’d like to refresh it to allow these curls to be trained. I was thinking of getting a haircut like Clairo’s because I’ve heard that layers help tremendously. Any advice or thoughts? Thanks! \n\nRoutine:\n\n1. Hair was wet in shower, I used my fingers to comb it while wet. \n\n2. Out of shower I used a microfibre cloth to gather it gently.\n\n3. I ran a bunch of Cantu shea butter hold styling gel throughout with my fingers, evenly covering my hair until it was straight\n\n4. I gently pressed the bottom part of my hair upwards to bring out the curls\n\n5. I used a diffuser for \\~25 minutes doing the same \n\n(First 2 images are the result of bf doing these steps while 3+4 are me attempting to style my own… 🙃)",

We air dry, the blow dryer is not an option. It would be like blow drying a large, angry cat. If it gets really frizzy we use some ouidad climate control spray. \n\nMy 15 year old daughter has very curly hair.  She also is diagnosed with autism, adhd, and bipolar 1. She has a lot of sensory issues. Getting through her hair routine is a nightmare in itself. \n\nIn between washes, her curls in back get flattened, which makes it look kind of matted. I know this is probably an impossibility, but does anyone have any advice to help that?  She can't handle having her hair pulled back, or wearing a bonnet- I've tried both. Does anyone have any ideas to keep her hair from looking like a family of possums has been living in it? Or maybe really cute short cuts that would just eliminate the problem? Here's what it looks like from the front,  then the back on wash day, then between washes.\n\nI know I'm probably asking for a solution that doesn't exist, but please be kind.  I'm just a mom that doesn't know what else to try,  but is tired of having her child's hair referred to as \"unkempt\"; and is equally tired of dealing with the meltdowns and angry outbursts when I try to put her hair up or use a bonnet for sleep.

its $60 + tip yall im broke\n\nd) my hair falls out easily it feels like (you’ll see why im not sure if u keep reading to the next section). i feel like ive been trying to grow it back from the scalp for years and its just getting worse or staying the same idek anymore. i do see a lot of baby hairs growing at the scalp but not nearly as many as i feel i should be after all this time :/\n\ne) even when i do put heat in my hair it just looks frizzy or doesn’t hold well. i know some of the frizz is because my hair is diff lengths all over because of all the breakage and regrowth.\n\nf) a lot of my ends feel blunt idk if that means anything. there’s also a lot of ends that are flimsy soft. also a lot of random coarse \\~\\~\\~\\~\\~ type hairs u know???\n\ng) the top layer of hair (from the crown and top of my scalp), is super thin and short and mostly straight but the middle is very curly and less fine. the underneath at the back just only curls at the end. \n\nh) hair gets greasy easily if i use too much product \n\ni) scalp can be very dry and flakey but the flakes but stick to my scalp unless i hit my head upside down. i use nizoral shampoo in replacement of ouai when this happens!\n\nOKAY IM SORRY IM LONG WINDED BUT PLS I NEED ADVICE 😭\n\nhere’s also things that are barriers and have affected my hair health (i struggle a lot with mental health but pls im still funny and cool and awesome i just have a LOT of sparkle yk)\n\na) i struggled with trichotillomania for yeaaars like pulling probably hundreds of pieces of hair out individually (not in chunks) every day. and i still engage in the behavior slightly… but only like a couple hairs here and there. im working really hard to overcome it so pls dont advise me to stop because i know and im doing so!! trying my hardest!\n\nb) i am in recovery for anorexia but i struggled with it for just as long as i did the trich. getting in protein is really hard for me because i also have arfid (im telling u guys god rly nerfed me lol). so i assume that effects my hair health as well at least in some regard.\n\nc) i definitely have a good amount of heat damage because i used to rely on heat to feel good about my hair. i would always use heat protectant and serum.. but still not great. i have made it a point to stop using heat and embrace the curl. i’m doing okay, i have only used heat 3 times so far this year which i know is lowkey a lot but im interviewing for grad school so i can’t have my hair be frizzy LOL\n\nd) i have POTS so blood tends to pool in my feet and not go to my extremities or my head?? not too sure how brain flow to POTS patients compares to that of regular people lol. but im sure there is correlation.\n\ne) one thing i know ISNT wrong is my thyroid because i get my blood work tested all the time cause i have chronic illnesses. lmk if anyone wants to know my results idk if its helpful. is that weird to offer 😭\n\nf) i have this compulsive need to play with my hair like twirl it/run strands between my fingers. i’ve done it my entire life like there are pictures of me at 2 years old doing it. i just take strands of here and run them between my pointer and middle finger lol. not sure if that affects my hair health but prob \n\nOKAY LAST PART. pls if ur still reading im almost done JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE IM DESPERATE LOL \n\nhere is my current routine / things ive tried:\n\ni wash my hair every 4ish days, almost always double cleanse, and i cycle these 3 routines:\n\nWASH A:\n\n\\- ouai detox shampoo &amp; davines energizing shampoo\n\n\\- k18 (after shower)\n\nWASH B:\n\n\\- redken extreme length &amp; loreal elvive hyaluronic plump shampoo \n\n\\- davines nounou conditioner (leave in for 5ish min)\n\nWASH C:\n\n\\- davines energizing shampoo &amp; loreal elvive hylauronic plump shampoo\n\n\\- davines nounou conditioner\n\nPOST SHOWER:\n\n\\- not your mothers curl talk leave in conditioner\n\n\\- devacurl wavytalk curl cream\n\n\\- goldwell just smooth serum\n\n\\*\\* sometimes i also use itsa10 gloss leave in spray\n\nDAILY:\n\n\\- i typically spray my hair wet every morning with water w/ a couple drops of peppermint essential oil in the spray bottle, use my bounce curl brush, and use devacurl wavy talk to restore my curl. \n\n\\- i use goldwell just smooth everyday\n\n\\- on wash day, i will wear my hair in a loose slick back using softee castor oil conditioner \n\n\\- once a week i use amika dream routine overnight hydration mask &amp; ouai scalp serum\n\n\\- i tie my hair back or wear it in braids at night \n\nTHINGS IVE TRIED:\n\n\\- minoxidil serum &amp; foam: is this fr my only/best option??? i have pets who sleep at the top of my pillow. i also find it makes my hair greasy faster and sticky/separated at the roots. i am difficult ab minoxidil bc i also wont take the pill for personal reasons lol. \n\n\\- hair oiling: did it for years and feel like it didnt rly do anything and it lowkey made it worse (i used a rosemary blend on the scalp and jojoba through the shaft/ends)\n\n\\- big chop: cut my hair to a bob already and it took forever to grow back and it didnt really fix the problem. (i could’ve done more for my hair health but i dont want to go thru that process of regrowth again)\n\n\\- ouai scalp serum: idk if i used it long enough to notice a true difference but the consistency was tough after awhile lol \n\nOK I THINK THATS EVERYTHING IM SORRY it was so long u guys but im 23 and have been struggling with my hair since i was a teenager. i just want to get it to where i want it so i can feel more confident and feminine!\n\nany tips are appreciated :,) pls ik the internet can be so brutal so be kind to me lol but also dont lie to me plsss i can handle it haha ik my hair isn’t great. only thing i wont do is shave my head!!\n\ni just want to:\n\n\\- revive my curl and reduce frizz\n\n\\- stimulate new growth and retain length\n\n\\- strengthen &amp; hydrate ends\n\n\\- improve overall hair health and appearance \n\n\\- i need silk pillow case and bonnet recs!!\n\ni posted this in a couple hair communities sorry if ur seeing this twice!\n\nhopefully at least one person reads this mf novel 😭",

I started using differin after getting an unusual amount of acne in my early 20s. I started in November, initially only using it once a week. Nothing really happened, so I started using it twice, and still nothing. This month, however, I started using it everyday since I figured my skin is “used to it” by now. I’m not using any other actives, just toner and the 147 barrier cream by Dr Althea. I’m starting to experience some irritation, redness, and small, textured bumps on my face. I’ve heard of retinization, but what’s on my face is unlike straightforward “acne”. I’m not sure if it’s supposed to be this way, or if I should stick to it.

      "content": "Hi! I just cut my hair and I’m in the process of basically resetting it. I’m trying to get rid of all of my layers, though it’s mainly the super short face framing pieces that are bothering me. To cut it and even it out I put it in 2 low pigtails when wet and cut. After styling I went in to further even things out by pulling both sides under my chin and tying. I basically shaped it into a ball to get the stragglers. Then I put it in a low pony at the back and smoothed between 2 fingers to get any extra stragglers. Repeated that until it was straight and how I liked it. I’ll be cutting layers again once my hair is all one length (minus the bangs ofc), hopefully in about 6 months. This is the video I follow for cutting layers: https://youtu.be/rLsVd2AWW0A?si=jl6yAnLB2\\_NzClyD, which I won’t do again until my hair is fully reset. I think I’ll just completely leave out the face framing pieces, unless I cut it and decide I do want them. I honestly liked the method I did today so much I’ll probably continue doing it when I cut layers again just to keep things nice and even. My goal is to have my hair to my butt when styled in a few years. I’ve been growing out my hair since 2023. 2023-2024 was basically just cutting out all the damage I had done. Before that, it wouldn’t grow past my shoulders because I dyed it and didn’t detangle it like I should’ve. My hair is the longest it’s ever been (but every time I say that my mom tells me it was long when I was little, but I don’t remember that lol). I think I could survive with my hair a few centimeters shorter, but I want to keep it long while I’m evening it out still, so the length it is now is probably what it will be until around August, or when it’s one length. I’ll trim it probably once a month on the new moon to promote new growth until then. Around my birthday in February, once it’s quite long but still one length, I’ll cut the layers again. I’ll do it around my birthday just because I usually only cut my hair once a year. Doing it around my birthday just makes sense because that also comes once a year lol. \n\nRoutine: \n\nShampoo: Shea Moisture raw shea butter shampoo\n\nDeep conditioner: Shea Moisture raw shea butter deep moisturizing masque \n\nConditioner: She Moisture raw shea butter conditioner\n\nLeave in: Shea Moisture raw shea butter deep moisturizing leave in conditioner\n\nStyling: Damp hair, a little product, brush\n\nDrying: I use a t shirt for a few minutes to get extra water, put product in, then use a hair dryer on medium/low heat and low blow, flipping my hair upside down for majority of the drying time, and switching between one side and the other. I don’t dry my hair with my head completely straight get as much volume as possible.",

There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine?

With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

Is there anything specifically you might recommend for this mane of mine?\n\nAs far as routine, I wash and condition daily with dove shampoo and conditioner. I rinse in cool water, upside down, and then apply leave in conditioner. Brand depends on availability at TJ Maxx since I'm trying different things, but right now it's Curl Smith. From there, I apply a bit of Lotta Body foaming mousse and pop everything in a silk bonnet for sleep and my hair is dry and looks like this in the morning. \n\nI'd been treating my hair this way for about 2 months after noticing some waves starting halfway down my back, but I feel a little lost. Currently having a tiny identity crisis because I went from the 2a to curls pipeline REAL fast. I'm not confident enough to say which hair type I have now, because it seems like its evolving a bit.\n\nThe closeup photo is from this morning, and the longer shot is from Saturday when my hair was cut. It can cut dry, and then a bit of Lotta Body wash applied in the salon, so lots of touching ans manipulation on that day.

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I feel like I've tried everything, mousse, leave in conditioner, double conditioning, hair cuts, dyes, oils, sprays but nothing helps. I want to have my hair out, but it gets so frizzy and out of control. I live in a humid climate and I have quite a sweaty face and scalp so that doesn't help the bad feelings. But on night's like tonight, where my hair is freshly cleaned, not long since my last haircut, and has oil through the ends AND IT GETS ITCHY ON MY SHOULDERS. ah! I want to cut it all off. It's the longest it's ever been and I want to love it but I'm really struggling. Any advice on how to make it feel and look softer, more in control perhaps? I'd rather not have a long in depth hair routine, something simple that I can stick to once or twice a week if possible. \nI'm currently using a purple shampoo and conditioner because I have highlights.\nI use a garnier sleek and shine oil, the schwarzkopf bonacure performance repair leave in, and sometimes the hask curly spray. \nI dry it in a microfiber towel until just damp, then air dry the rest.\nI can't stand bonnets or silk pillow cases. \nThank you for your help!!!!!",

The bridge of my glasses rubs against it which makes the situation worse. I’ve given it a lot of thought, and I think that I would rather risk having a scar than a mole that randomly becomes this irritated. \n\nIf you have any recommendations on mole removal procedures and/or whether I should see a dermatologist or plastic surgeon I would greatly appreciate it!
