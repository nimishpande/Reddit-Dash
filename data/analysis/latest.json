I wash with a gentle shampoo (Ouai or Pattern) and follow up with a hydrating conditioner. I detangle with my fingers in the shower and rinse with cool water.\n\nAfter that, I squeeze out excess water with a microfiber towel and scrunch in a leave-in (Pattern or LolaVie), then a curl cream like Curlsmith or Rizos Curls for softness. I finish with a light gel or mousse (Joico or Briogeo), scrunching it in from mid-lengths to ends. Once it’s mostly dry, I pull it into a high pony for lift and smooth the roots with a tiny bit more gel if needed.\n\nI’ll usually diffuse on low while scrunching for volume, but sometimes I just air dry if I can’t be bothered. If I want extra bounce, I’ll plop for a bit first.\n\nAt night I pineapple it with a satin scrunchie and sleep in a bonnet (or at least on a silk pillowcase). In the morning, I just mist with water + a bit of leave-in, scrunch, and go.",

And, yes, you may have a Werther's from my cardigan pocket. But, that's not why I rang...\n\n**I have a question for the Gen-Z ladies... especially the younger Zoomers. Are sugary-sweet food-like fragrances (whether in perfumes, body sprays, deodorants, body washes or skincare) \"in\" right now?**\n\nIn my noble battle against time, gravity and genetics, I've become a certified gym bunny... in there 5 days a wk, rain or shine, geriatric aches or not. But, my schedule shifted recently and I've started going in at times I didn't before... times that seem to be especially popular with younger crowds. And, I kid you not, I legit thought that the management had started to install air fresheners that had sugary sweet food-like scents all over the gym. I was smelling sugar cookies, strawberry shortcake, cookies &amp; cream etc. Which... let me tell you... not the most helpful thing when you're on your fitness journey. But, then, I started to realize that these were actually fragrances on the younger women working out around me.\n\nI don't think it's just a regional thing. I live in Florida, but was just in California for six weeks and visited multiple gyms across SoCal and picked up on the same thing there.\n\nThis isn't a value judgement. The scent profile is definitely not for me... but many things these days aren't for me, that's fine. I don't recall this being a thing 20 years ago when I was closer to these ladies ages. So.. is this... a thing?\n\n***Edited to add: There have been so many interesting responses from young women on this thread that it got me thinking about a second question... if you have young gen z men in your lives,*** [here's a follow up question](https://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/1r65mfe/comment/o5omav9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)***.***",

EVERY TIME my hair gets thin past my shoulders. Doesn't matter if I do a big reset chop (20cm+), it gets stringy in the ends immediately afterwards. The last time my hair looked fine was when I was 18 (2021), second photo. \n\nThe \"long\" hair isn't damaged either; I can brush it smoothly and can't detect split ends. It just feels like I have \"underwool\" that doesn't want to get longer and just becomes more coily while my top hair is rather wavy.\n\nFor my routine, I am a simple gal: Use drugstore (Balea professional Traumlocken) conditioner on my ends during shower, then wash with Schauma shampoo. Rinse, scrunch in some conditioner again and squeeze out water. Depending on what I have going on, I might use mousse (Balea Schaumfestiger Locken) and sometimes Gel (Balea Locken Scrunchgel). At night I put my hair up in a protective bun. 95% of the time I air dry. Wash every second day.\n\nThere's been no change in routine between those pictures I have to add, other than that I went from school to uni and in the second picture I had an ED, so it makes even less sense that my hair was looking alright lol",

Since then, I’ve sort of just rocked messy curly hair with minimal styling and upkeep but I’ve also lately been finger coiling my hair for track meets.

I was thinking of getting a front taper and using a headband to push my curls back, but what do yall think?\n\nRoutine:\n\n\\- Detangle, Shampoo and Condition with Being Shampoo and Conditioner once a week (I will not get hair wet if I have finger coils in for about 5 days; I’ll only use curl activator)\n\n\\- Condition about every 3 days\n\n\\- If I’m about to do finger coils, I’ll use Being Leave in, She’s Moisturizing Curl Smoothie and Eco gel after doing my wash routine\n\n\\- Bonnet when I sleep",

      "content": "Hello! Transfem lurker here who has been on a slow-but-steady skincare journey alongside my larger gender journey over the past few years. I was hoping that by kicking testosterone out of my system my skin would clear up but it seems like we've got to do it the hard way! I feel like I'm on the right track, but my wedding is coming up in two months and I'd love to enter bride-hood as clear from redness and acne as I possible! That, and having a solid routine will let me focus on all the fun that comes with planning instead.\n\nI have combination skin with an oily t-zone and a dry chin, along with what I'm pretty sure is fungal acne on my cheeks. I have been on 0.05% tretinoin for a few months and noticed increased softness but without much improvement in redness or acne. Last month I was put on a gel with combo 1.2% Clindamycin Phosphate and 5% Benzoyl Peroxide that has definitely helped minimize inflammation from the fungal acne, but not fully eliminated the fungal and other acne.\n\nROUTINE\n\nAM:\n\n\\-Shaving every other day using unscented and moisturizing Kiss My Face shaving cream. Laser has been great but still many stubborn light-toned hairs remain! One of my big questions is how frequent shaving should change my routine\n\n\\-La Roche Posay Hydrating Gentle Cleanser (tried just cleansing with water in the morning and felt acne get worse)\n\n\\-The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% Zinc 1%\n\n\\-The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 (both these serums came from a lovely Christmas present but hoping to find serums more suited to my specific needs)\n\n\\-LRP Double Repair face moisturizer\n\n\\-LRP Mineral Anthelios sunscreen (can you tell my derm-enthusiastic PCP recommended LRP?)\n\nMy moisturizer and sunscreen have both been pilling recently and I don't know whether to attribute it to cold dry northeast US air or something in my routine. I have tried skipping the Hyaluronic acid some days as I guessed the tacky texture it left on my skin could be the culprit and noticed some improvement but still some pilling remained. Hoping to get the Beauty of Joseon sunscreen and see how it changes things!\n\nPM:\n\n\\-LRP Hydrating Gentle Cleanser\n\n\\-1.2% Clindamycin Phosphate &amp; 5% Benzoyl Peroxide gel (prescribed for fungal acne)\n\n\\-CeraVe intensive moisturizing lotion with 5% Hydro-Urea\n\n\\-0.05% Tretinoin (every other day, try to not apply night before a shaving morning. PCP told me that application over moisturizer doesn't affect absorption)\n\nI'm looking for simplicity so unscented joyless products are always welcome! My biggest questions are as such:\n\n\\-How should shaving influence my routine? I want to incorporate chemical exfoliants but am worried that the physical exfoliation on top of chemical would be too much\n\n\\-What are your favorite products for calming redness and smoothing out these remaining bumps/fading the remnant spots?\n\n  \nThank you!",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",
