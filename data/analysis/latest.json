I’m wondering whether it’s a curly cut or if anyone knows which way she cuts her hair? Also I know that her hair isn’t freshly styled and probably multiple days in\n\nMy routine consists of herbal essence shampoo and conditioner and I detangle in the shower. I don’t usually style my hair (I braid it in a protective hairstyle) but when I do I just go in with the Marc Anthony curl cream + the mousse, umberto giannani gel and diffuse my hair upside down and occasionally I’ll put a claw clip while I diffuse at the top for more volume. I wear a silk bonnet to sleep. Also, my hair wet reaches my upper thigh so it’s pretty long",

Is it curly or wavy? All my life I’ve just brushed my hair and worn it in a ponytail because it would always end up really frizzy because I don’t really know how to style it. Even when I used products for frizzy hair it still does  nothing for me.\n\nExample: John Frida FrIzz Ease, L’Oréal frizz serum, OXG Argan Oil, and many more.\n\n \n\nMy routine now is:\n\nShampoo: Shea Moisture Hydrate &amp; Repair Shampoo and Conditioner and \n\nTRESemme keratin smooth shampoo and conditioner ( I’ll rotate between these two brands)\n\nLeave in conditioner: Shea moisture leave in conditioner or Garnier banana hair food 3-in-1. I’ll use a bit of this on the ends of my hair.\n\nI’ve been trying the curly hair method and these are the products I use:\n\nCantu curl cream \n\nJohn frieda dream curl mousse\n\nEco olive oil gel \n\nWhen doing a curly routine I wash my hair and apply conditioner then leave in conditioner.\n\nThen I apply the curl cream and mousse in sections and follow up with the gel and scrunch. I squeeze the water out of my hair with a T-shirt then I use a diffuser to dry my hair. At the end I’ll use that argan oil to break the get cast\n\nI’ve only tried the curly hair method a few times but my hair is always so frizzy still and idk how to fix it. \n\nDo I need more hydrating products or protein products?\n\nAlso should I use hair oil and which hair oil would you recommended?\n\nI heard brushing your hair when it’s dry with a brush causes frizz, so should I wet my hair every day and brush? Wouldn’t that cause breakage?\n\nI have way too many questions lol\n\nI appreciate anyone who can give me some answers :)",

      "content": "Hey!\n\nI’ve (24, AFAB) posted here before which started my journey to take my skin texture and redness seriously. I always had some redness and skin texture, but as long as I didn’t have an active breakout I was happy with my skin. I posted on here that I had a very slightly red patch on my cheek that someone mentioned looked just like a dry patch, and someone else gave me great advice on looking into barrier repair and papular rosacea. I a currently on the waitlist for a dermatologist, but while I wait I just need some advice on how I can treat my skin, as it looks like the products I bought to fix this are seeming to cause more sensitivity. \n\nCurrently my routine is as follows:\n\nAM:\n\n\\- Rinse my face with lukewarm-cool water\n\n\\- Purito Wonder Relief Centella Cream Unscented\n\n\\- Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum (This stings when I put it on, but I’m using it up until I figure out what my next sunscreen should be. Ideal would be niacinamide free and mineral based.)\n\nPM:\n\n\\- Garnier Micellar water pink cap (with clean microfibre face cloth, maybe I should switch to cotton pads?)\n\n\\- Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser\n\n\\- I shave my face every 2nd day with Nivea Men Sensitive Skin Shave Gel\n\n\\- Purito Wonder Relief Centella Cream Unscented\n\nI was using the Purito Centella Serum Unscented for a few weeks with this routine but believe it or not it made my skin look worse. I have Zeroid soothing cream in the mail to swap out with the Purito moisturizer, as I read that it is a very simple barrier supporting cream that is a lot of peoples HG. I am also looking for any suggestions on a sunscreen replacement option, right now I’m considering BePlain Sunnuse Mineral Sunscreen as I heard it was a lot of other people’s holy grails. But I haven’t ordered it yet.\n\nIf anyone has any advice for how to deal with this while I wait to see a derm, or what could be causing it/making it worse, any and all input is greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!!!",

I've recently started using beauty of joseon glow deep serum past two days. I'm considering to buy the cosrx bha blackhead power liquid but I'm concerned if it will be too much on my skin. Is there any way I can use these products for my dark eye circles too? Would Reay appreciate any advice or recommendations on my routine, thank you.",

      "content": "I have \\*very\\* dry, sensitive skin most of the time, so usually the main focus in my routine(s) is staying hydrated. I’ve tried LOTS of different creams/lotions, serums and oils but so far these fellas have been the most effective. everything mentioned is fragrance free and should be safe for sensitive skin (potentially minus the last if you’re really sensitive to niacinamide!)\n\n1. I know hyaluronic acids are a bit overrated now but if you’re still gonna incorporate one into your skincare I recommend this one. it’s got not just HA but also panthenol AND glycerin so lots more extra moisture than just HA on its own.\n\n2. I really like Goldbond products, but normally only use their creams (especially the eczema relief one). this lotion though is like a beautiful hybrid baby of lotion \\*and\\* cream. she is THICK but not greasy which is a rarity in my experience. it lasts all day for me even in the winter.\n\n3. this is probably the second most expensive skincare product I’ve ever bought ($27-29 I think? not expensive in the grand scheme of skincare but expensive for me lol) but boy oh boy, is it worth it. it is 30% glycerin. yeah, THIRTY. I apply a pump or 2 of this on damp skin at night after GM’s hyularonic acid and it is SO hydrating. definitely gives you a bit of a glass skin look as cliche as that sounds at this point lol. only negative I can think of is that it’s a lil bit sticky/tacky.\n\n4. I have heard NO ONE talk about this product yet on here and I don’t know why. it is an AMAZING lightweight cream that’s literally formulated by an actual dermatologist. it’s super moisturizing and helps to repair your skin barrier w/ ceramides, squalene and glycerin. it even has a cool lil push down lid that dispenses the exact amount you need everytime :) the only “bad” thing is is that it does contain a little niacinamide IIRC, so if you’re sensitive I’d probably avoid!",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I used it consistently, so I can say it worked significantly for my acne marks and gives a very nice glow immediately after washing off.\n\nNot for beginners.\n\nNot using it in winter as I am using tretinoin since December 2022, and in winter because of dryness I didn’t dare to irritate my skin more with acids.\n\nBut as summer is approaching, I will definitely repurchase this.10/10\n\n\n2) Salicylic acid serum: \n\nThe only salicylic acid serum I tried.\nUsed 2 bottles of this. Takes time but definitely works.\n\nSinks in seconds, water-like texture.\n\nAs I have minimised my whole skincare routine, I will not repurchase.7.5/10\n\n\n3) Niacinamide serum: \n\nUsed two bottles but I don’t think niacinamide works that great for acne and acne marks.\n\nI was using this with tretinoin, so I don’t know what to rate this and I don’t think this alone can help.\n\nHas a runny, not so slimy texture.\nSinks well on damp to wet skin.\nFoams up a little bit, I think that’s pretty normal.\n\nWill not repurchase, not this and not from any other brand because using tretinoin alone is doing enough work for me.6/10 \n\n\n4) HA oil free moisturizer: \n\nNot enough moisturizing for my tret dry skin.\nGel cream texture.\nToo sticky if I don’t use it on damp skin.\nThankful that at least it didn’t give me any CCs. 6.5/10\n\n\n5) Derma Co Nia Ceramide moisturizer (dry &amp; sensitive skin version): \n\nWorked well for winter dryness with tretinoin, but I used this whole bottle without realising that this was actually the product giving me CCs all over my cheeks like crazy (yeah, maybe I was dumb).0/10\n\n\n6) Derma Co Nia Ceramide daily hydrating moisturizer: \n\nMe, my mother and my sister tried it.\nDidn’t suit 3 of us at all, it itches and gives rashes.\nBut I gave it to my friend and she actually liked it.\nFor context, she has normal skin type, so do my sister and mother.\nShe does not have acne issues like me, only gets 1 to 2 pimples occasionally, but it suited her well and she said she will repurchase.\n\nAt this point I think this moisturizer has a beef with our genes.\n\nBut I will still rate it 0/10.\n\n\n7) Derma Co sunscreens (pore minimizer, aqua gel, and vitamin C + niacinamide version): \n\nUsed 6 to 7 bottles of this.\nIt was the beginning of my skincare journey, so it’s a canon event, ifykyk 😮‍💨 \n\nOverall, The Derma Co has been very hit or miss for me. I’ll only repurchase their peeling solution. My current skincare is working fine for me, so I’m not experimenting further.\n",

What treatment or maintenance procedure can I do every week or two weeks to successfully “remove” my sebaceous filaments and trichostasis spinulosa every time they re-appear (I know these never go away, they are a part of my personal pore anatomy, I just want to aesthetically manage them thoroughly). I was wondering whether the shark hydrafacial at home suction device is good, but Dr dray said it won’t take anything out :(\n\nDoes anyone have any service recommendations (that are cheaper than $50, I legit can’t afford a really hydrafacial every month), or devices I can invest in to remove these darn things from my nose?",

      "title": "[ROUTINE HELP] Dehydrated, yet oily acne prone skin? No improvement despite multiple products.",
      "content": "I've been struggling with pretty bad acne that hasn't gone away despite trying different products throughout my teenage and early adulthood years and it's been frustrating.\n\nI don't believe it's hormonal acne since I've been on spironolactone before with no change. Every cleanser I have tried left my skin feeling tight and dry immediately after. This is the case even with more moisterizing cleansers like CeraVe's hydrating cleanser. Is there something I'm doing wrong with my routine?? I cleanse twice a day with CeraVe's moisturizing cleanser.\n\nWhen I moisterize, that tight feeling usually goes away for the most part, but leaves my face feeling like its oily. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like there is a layer of oil sitting on top of my face almost like the moisturizer doesn't fully get absorbed. I've tried moisterizures containing hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and ceramides and still has this effect. This includes moisterizures that are lightweight, though I think it does help the oily feeling slightly. I moisterize twice a day with a lightweight moisterizure that has all three of these ingredients. I have used moisterizure without niacinamide before without any change.\n\nI apply adapaline gel at night to try and control my acne which was very drying at first but I feel that my skin has started to adapt and the extra dryness more or less goes away when I apply moisterizure. I think this may have helped slightly and I've been on it for the past few months.\n\nI come from a family that doesn't really care about skincare as much as they should so I've been trying to learn on my own. 😭 I have been trying to drink more water and sometimes I forget to cleanse when I'm in a hurry, but I have been FAR more consistent at skincare than I ever did in the past.\n\nCan anyone relate? What products worked for you all and what could I do differently? Do I even have dehydrated skin based on what I described?",

      "content": "\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI have oily, acne-prone skin and I’m currently using adapalene 3 times a week at night. On the other nights (and in the morning), I use azelaic acid 15% daily.\n\nI’m thinking of using Sebamed Clear Face Care Gel as my moisturizer, but I’m not sure if it’s suitable to use along with adapalene. Has anyone used this combination? Did it cause any irritation, breakouts, or dryness?\n\nMy concern is mainly whether it’s hydrating enough while using actives like adapalene and azelaic acid.\n\nWould really appreciate your experiences and suggestions. Thank you!",
