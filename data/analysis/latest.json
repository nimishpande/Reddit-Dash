      "content": "Just to get it out of the way, **yes I'm aware the photos have slightly different lighting and hair length**! I have a haircut next week at least so I'll chuck another photo up then, but hopefully the progress is still clear here.\n\nI'm a 43 male, I first noticed thinning on my crown right in the vertex about 12 years ago. The thinning progressed over all those years to what you see in the July 3rd photo here when I started treatment. I'm delighted with how it's gone so far, the new growth, density and thickness has been much more than I had expected being of my age. So I hope this post gives some optimism to other middle-agers looking into starting treatment.\n\nI went for a pretty light treatment protocol with the intention to evaluate after 3 months:\n\n* Topical Minoxidil (5%) + Finasteride (0.025%) in TrichoSol (product is called FINASOL-M from Hair Repair Clinic in the UK) - 1ml every day (apart from dermastamp days). I use a cheap roll-on applicator from Amazon, and only target the affected area of my scalp.\n* 0.75mm microneedling (dermastamp) once every 2 weeks. I started with 1mm but that drew a small amount of blood, so moved to 0.75mm which has been perfect. No topical application on stamping days.\n\n**Sides**: I have had absolutely no perceivable sides whatsoever. I imagine this is due to a) using topical and b) a low strength Fin at 0.025%. I am also fairly fit, regular exercise and have a pretty healthy diet, including a basic supplement stack (normal dosages) for a man of my vintage - magnesium, zinc, vitamin B complex inc biotin, vitamin D3 + k2, lecithin. I don't know if any of those helped negate sides but I thought I'd put them in here, if anything just to remind older guys that that supplementing is important as we age.\n\n**Next steps**: I have another 3 months supply of the same formula, I don't see any reason to change what I'm doing. After those 3 months, if progress is just as good, I might even look at reducing Fin down to 0.0125% - studies have shown that to be very effective still with 0% reduction in serum DHT. I'll see where we I am in the New Year!",

      "content": "I haven't cut my curly hair in 4 years - partly because I never felt great after a haircut, and because I met a hairstylist who I really wanted to cut my hair but never found the time to travel to her.\n\nThe past few months I have really been loving my hair, like I'd never loved me hair this much. Because it was so long, when I added volumed didn't look strange. It felt so \"me\" and really suited my style. \n\nI found a different hairdresser through instagram and DMed her for what I thought would just be a consultation (maybe I'm dumb here), but I was nervous for even that. When I got in the chair I thought, what's the worst that can happen, she can trim my ends and I'll go to that other stylist for a style next year . I told her during our very brief consultation (don't think it was even 5 minutes) that I really love my hair and wanted to keep/grow it long (she even said \"everyone wants long hair\"... I had long hair??). She ended up cutting about 6 inches (I'm guessing) of my hair off, way more than she showed me. And it is the shortest I have ever seen it. I still have split ends btw (I don't think I ever won't, don't know how my hair ever grows but it does lol)\n\nI was genuinely in shock when I saw and have been crying every day since. I'm finding it hard to think about that I have to wait another 4 years to love my hair, by that time I'll be 30, and I guess these are supposed to be some important years of my life. I am so devastated as have been going through a hard time this year already and this has really sent me. I am telling myself it will all come back within 6 months, which I doubt. I really hate how I look now. \n\nWill it actually \"grow back quicker\" 😩 what can I do??",

My current routine is:\n\nPM: Cetaphil cleanser for combination skin, epiduo, cetaphil daily moisturizer\n\nAM: Wash face with water only, jorgobe niacinamide gel, cetaphil daily moisturizer\n\nI do believe there some spf in the moisturizer. I’m thinking about starting to use Azelaic acid in the morning alongside niacinamide to reduce redness and acne. My questions are if I should do any changes to my routine? If starting azelaic acid is a good idea? Or if you have any other product recommendations. Thanks in advance☺️",

However when I put my head upside down it looks really nice! \n\nI had curly hair when I was a child but when growing up, I used to bleach my hair and cut them really short so there was absolutely no curl pattern. \nI’m in the process of growing my hair long and they always looked curly-ish while wet so I wanted to try this new routine.\n\nWhat do you think? \nShould I keep doing this routine or my hair pattern isn’t worth it? \nAlso why does it look fabulous upside down but terrible in a normal position?

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I didnt know washing my hair every day was bad, or that i should be wearing a bonnet to bed. She has helped me some but im wondering now if im leaving my coconut oil in to long.\n\nRoutine\nOkay so now before I go to bed I put jojoba oil on my scalp and massage it in. Then I put coconut oil in my hair and I put my hair up in a bonnet then go to sleep.\n\nI do this every night and now wash then wait 2 days before washing again. So the oil is building up every day. Is this bad? Should I not do this as often?\n\nMy fear is if I dont do it though my hair will not look good in the morning or I will have to wash it out, and im trying to avoid washing my hair everyday. \n\n",

I don’t have particularly sensitive skin, but I do break out easily if something is too heavy or pore-clogging.\n\nI’ve tried a lot of actives over time and feel like I might be overcomplicating things or using redundant products. I’d love if someone could help me structure a clear AM/PM routine that makes sense — what to keep, what to drop, and what order to use things in.\n\nPs I have been to a derm several times and all they recommend is Azealic acid. I used that for a year and felt like it did nothing.\n\nCurrent products I have:\n\nCleansers:\n- Dr. Idriss Soft Wash\n- Cetaphil bar soap (I know… probably not    great)\n\nTreatments / Actives:\n-Dapsone(Aczone)- using am for 6 months now helped a little \n\n-Differin (Adapalene 0.1%) - have on had but haven’t started it \n\n-Benzoyl Peroxide + Clindamycin cream (use pm) \n\n-Dr. Dennis Gross Universal Daily Peel Pad - have on hand but haven’t really used \n\n-Azelaic Acid (haven’t used in a while but still have it)\n\nToners / Serums:\n- Paula’s Choice BHA (don’t really use)\n- Ole Henriksen Dark Spot Toner (use few times a week)\n- CeraVe Hydrating Toner (use few times a week)\n- Timeless Vitamin C serum (use every morning)\n\t\n\nMoisturizers\n- Purito oat in (just started) \n- MediCube PDRN Pink Collagen Capsule Cream (just started for nights I feel dry) \n- innisfreeGreen Tea Hyaluronic Acid Cream (used nightly)\n\nSunscreen\n- la neige spf 50 \n⸻\n\nMy goals:\n- Smooth out the texture / closed comedones\n- Reduce hormonal breakouts\n- Ideally go to bed looking glossy and hydrated but not greasy or clogged\n\n⸻\n\nIf anyone here is good at building or simplifying routines, I’d love your advice on:\n\t1.\tWhich products should stay or go (or be alternated)\n\t2.\tThe right order / timing (AM vs PM)\n\t\n\nThank you in advance — I’ve read a ton of posts here but could really use some more guidance 🙏\n",

Im honestly so tired of this it’s product after product, constant research, and being careful not to overdo anything. Funny thing is im an aspiring dermatologist/esthetician or anything in the skin science field and its so embarrassing telling someone this while having skin this bad. \n\nNow to my routine: In the morning, i use the cerave hydrating foaming cleanser then the haruharu black rice sunscreen. Thats it. (I know some advice against cleansing in the morning and trust ive tried but where i live is hot and humid and i break out if i skip my morning cleanser..\n\nAt night, I again use the same cleanser on most nights but sometimes use the SA cleanser if i feel like my skin needs some exfoliating. Im SUPER careful with actives now, i used to use this cleanser twice a day every day and i feel like it severely damaged my barrier, and this is not even accounting all the times i used The Ordinary AHA BHA serum (the red one) back in 2020 when it was popular and overdid it countless of times. After cleansing i just go with the cerave pm moisturizer dupe (this is my first bottle since i couldnt find the actual cerave one at the store) Sometimes after using the SA cleanser i like to go with some diaper rash cream or if i see some redness and i wash it out in the morning. I dont think its the cause for my recent breakouts, ive found the sweet spot of using it which is washing it off immediately after waking up and not using it more than twice a week and I even stopped using it for around 2 weeks and my breakouts persisted. Now recently ive been incorporating a retinol which i use every other day (this may seem like too often but it doesnt irritate my skin since i used to use adapalene and my skin is used to it), however i havent been using it long enough to see any results for better or worse. If i get a pimple i sometimes put vaseline on it at the end of my routine and it seems to help SOMETIMES, what i mean is that when i use it my pimple goes away the next day, but may cause another pimple to form which is why i rarely use it and still have mixed feelings about it.\n\nSome product help will be greatly appreciated as im slowly trying to stop using cerave since thats all ive used and figured its the reason for my persistent acne (currently experimenting with their other products so as u can see its all i really know)\n",
