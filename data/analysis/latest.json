Like I’m realizing I have hardly ANY photos of my longer hair dow because it was always pissing me off lol. The short hair is more effortless for me and it’s kinda nice not having the option to worry about different styles. I also love being able to see my earrings. Just of it is, I need unbiased opinions. I can’t decide if I actually want long hair or if I’m just bored and always want to change things up, or if I’m just feeling insecure because who doesn’t these days. And I’m aware that it will be a pain in the ass to grow out and all that jazz.

It went from very easily defined and highly dense curls to the suggestion of a curl ish wave and shedding more than it ever had in my life. I had lost a substantial amount of weight but in a very healthy way and had overall objectively increased healthy behaviors as well, and the only times my hair had straightened out or shed was when I was very sick with a restrictive eating disorder so I was very confused. Well, found out recently that my birth control was actually totally screwing with my estrogen levels and had caused two large lesions on my liver, essentially taking up half the thing. And when the bloodwork marker that led us to this began to creep up higher and higher? That’s when my hair started changing. I’ve always known my hair was very sensitive to my health, but for some reason this didn’t occur to me this time. So this is your friendly reminder that if your hair suddenly and drastically changes in any way, talk to a doctor!

      "content": "Just wanted to share what I’ve learned after testing a few LED masks recently, especially about the difference between red and blue light therapies for skin.\n\nI picked up a Glotech mask from LED Esthetics since it covers both red and blue wavelengths. At first, I wasn’t sure if I really needed both, but after a month of daily sessions, I noticed some interesting changes:\n\n- Red light: Helped soften fine lines and made my skin look a bit firmer over time. I started seeing a noticeable glow and better overall texture, especially on drier patches.\n\n- Blue light: Was more of a game changer for breakouts and random patches of redness. Used this on days when my skin felt oily or inflamed much fewer breakouts, and the old marks faded faster.\n\nTbh I think using both gave me the best of both worlds. Red light is awesome for anti-aging and texture, while blue is great if you deal with acne or frequent spots. If you’re only picking one, think about your main skin concern, but for me, a mask offering both was worth the investment and made the whole routine pretty easy.",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Hi all. \n\nFor context, I moved a month ago and started experiencing this, but only moved within my city and a few blocks over from my old home. \n\nI have also not started using any new products, I only use head and shoulders shampoo (no conditioner because it makes my hair too greasy). I also use rogaine every day (recommended by derm for some hair loss problems, has been about three years of that). I wash my hair everyday to remove rogaine, when I get home from work and because I workout in a heated space. \n\nThe back upper part of my hair, my crown I guess, is always sort of clumpy and gross even immediately after a shower. And I find it is leaving a gummy gross residue on my hair brushes. \n\nI was worried maybe this new house has hard water, but the city I live in has some of the softest water (and I have lived within the city limits for 5-6 years and never had an issue with this). \n\nFor a few weeks, our hot water heater was broken and I was experiencing this, I thought it was maybe because I was not getting as good of a rinse in the cold water. \n\nIs it possible this is only from not shampooing and rinsing out the product enough? I am thinking maybe because when I was my hair I just sort of pull it all back, this area is not getting washed and rinsed enough in this new shower’s water pressure. I’m considering getting a shower head that has a handheld attachment to allow me to better target these areas of my head. \n\nThe hair that frames my face gets very clean, it just gets this clumpy weird texture (almost like it’s still wet) at the back of my head. And then when I brush it (using a wet brush) there’s a gummy build up on the bristles that gets on my other hair and makes it look greasy. \n\nLooking for any suggestions. I am thinking it is either subpar rinsing, or maybe this house has harder water than places I previously lived, considering we also are getting a white residue in our reusable, metal water bottles.
