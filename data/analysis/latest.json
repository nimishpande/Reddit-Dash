      "content": "I have always been afraid of expressing myself as my mom and uncles used to tease me for how my hair curled and I became embarrased by it (it was just teasing but I took it to heart because I THOUGHT curls were \"feminine\" and I wanted to be a big strong man in a rural area. I know curls aren't a feminine thing btw) anyway my friend encouraged me to grow my hair out at the beginning of 2024 and I'm so grateful. People always compliment my hair, and I hate that it took me so long to embrace a part of me. The last photo is from May of this year when I had a different method so you can see the difference. Thank you to everyone who commented on my last curly hair post and gave me tips!! Have a great holiday season everyone 💖\n\nProducts listed at bottom.\nRoutine:\nI wash my hair two times a week. For one wash just shampoo and conditioner.\nOnce a week: wash with clarifying shampoo, then shampoo, then conditioner then conditioning treatment\nWith still dripping wet hair, apply curl creme then scrunch, then apply mousse and scrunch thoroughly, then gel and scrunch.\nDiffuse hair. Scrunch out crunch or use hair oil\n\n\nShampoo: not your mother's curl defining shampoo\nConditioner: not your mother's curl defining conditioner\nDeep conditioning treatment: Mielle Organics Babassu Oil and Mint Deep Conditioner (5-15 minutes) rinse out\nCurl creme: Briogeo Curl Charisma Rice Amino + Avocado Leave–In Defining Cream\nMousse:Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Activating Mousse\nCurl Gel: Briogeo Curl Charisma Rice Amino + Quinoa Frizz Control Gel\nOil: Oaui hair oil\n I wear a satin bonnet to bed every night, and use satin pillowcases and do not do a refresh routine.

Hi I’m an 18 year old male and I just started shaving my body this year.\n\nInitially it was great, however I’d say around my 3rd time shaving? I started getting ingrown hairs and these bumps, Idk what they are but I want them to fuck offfff, I’ve even scarred cause of one of the ingrown hairs (bright red spot on my stomach). Even after months of not shaving my leg hair, the spots are still there. \n\nI guess I’m looking for recommendations on how to get rid of the spots and how to prevent them moving forward.\n\nIf it helps I use the Philips Series 7000 Showerproof Body Groomer and Trimmer. Weirdly it’s fine in some areas but it’s super sensitive around my thighs and ass mostly, which is annoying.",

I’m addressing the source now, and it should be improving eventually, but I’m having a really hard time not hating my hair. I miss my old hair. It defined easily with minimal product and effort and pretty much always looked good. Now I put in 3x the effort for 1/3 of the results, and they’re inconsistent too. I don’t know how to have anything but resentment towards my hair for reflecting health issues that could’ve been caught earlier if healthcare professionals bothered to check anything. It’s also been falling out since February and isn’t stopping. I rarely like how my hair looks now, and I don’t know what to do about it. It is not a length thing, as my hair was starting to loosen up when it was still shorter too. I’ll list my routine, so really anything helps. Maybe from people who have my current hair type? I haven’t felt compelled to give up on caring for my hair in a long time, but this has definitely taken me there. \n\nHair type now: wavy, coarse, medium density \nHair type before: curly, coarse, high density \n\nCurrent routine: Innersense clarity hair bath and hydrating cream conditioner. Styler is usually 1 lightweight foam and 1 gel,  ex. the tgin miracle foam + innersense I create curl memory. Usually brush styled with a denman or bounce curl definition brush, scrunched, diffused.

I used CeraVe (not amazing ik but all I could afford), and my general routine was cleanser, toner, serum, moisturizer, eye cream, and then sunscreen in the morning and at night retinol 2-3 times a week.\n\nNow that l'm 20, even though I fell off my skincare routine, these past 2 to 3 years I have had clear skin without much effort. I have dry skin so l really only use aloe vera gel on my face.\n\nrecently, a few of my friends who are really into skincare gifted me a bunch of skincare products and I'm not too sure how to go about them but also I'm afraid I might break out?? but l'll only know until i try it.\n\n——\n\nI suppose I just wanted some input on the products ive been gifted and want advice on how to incorporate them in since l dont have a routine.\n\nI would really like to use these products since I know they were quite expensive to be gifted.\n\n\nThis is the list of products I was given if it is helpful:\n1. biore facial foam\n2. naked and thriving face oil and face serum along with their night set which is also a face oil and serum\n3. origins gel cream\n4. drmrlgy tinted moisturizer\n5. bioderma pore refiner\n6. greteam purifying exfoliating gel\n\nI'd appreciate any pointers because I'm very lost haha thank you!!!",

Any recommendations?\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone with similar skin type 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

He is a blue collar worker, so his skin is dirty, oily, and deals with elements (heat in summers and extreme cold in winters) on a daily basis. He has enlarged pores and has acne where his hardhat sits and on his body. His skin seems to be combination, more oily in the T-zone and cheeks (also where he gets enlarged pores) and dryer around (but this is likely due to the harsh winter we are experiencing).\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for a routine to deal with pores, acne, and oily skin? What are some trust worthy products that can help him with both face and body? Also, any good recommendations for the winter months when it comes to moisturizer would be great.\n\nI’m planning to get him some of this stuff to help him on his journey towards healthy skin. I’ve tried before but the products have not worked well and I can’t recommend anything to him because I don’t deal with the same concerns as he.\n\nThank you in advance for any recommendations.",

      "content": "Hi everyone, after trying so many things to help clear my face with no effect, I turn to the wisdom of the crowd. Thank you in advance!\n\nI'm 43, male, with a spotty history of acne: moderate acne as a teenager and young adult that didn't respond to OTC or most antibiotics anda year of accutane about 20 years ago helped me stay mostly clear until 2023. Derm. tried a few antibiotics in a row, including Cipro, with no improvement. A swab in 2024 indicated gram negative bacteria (serratia marcescens), so I went on accutane again — 80mg for the first 6mos then 100mg for 8mos. It helped a little, but didn't solve my skin, and being on it for so long at so high a dose seemed problematic so we stopped last May. About that time my cheeks and scalp (I'm bald) flared up like crazy and I had dozens of tiny CCs on my forehead. Swabs indicated staphylococcus aureus and lugdunensis. Short bursts of cephamlexin, clindamycin, cefadroxil, and ivermectin didn't do much. Nor did bleach baths 3x a week or washing with Hibiclens in the shower. Azithromycin seemed to help for 3–4 weeks but the lesions returned.\n\nA swab in early September found no bacteria or fungus, but by that time I was desperate so I started washing with Nizoral. It seemed to help a little and my scalp mostly returned to normal, so I was prescribed 2% ketoconazole. I also purchased the starter pack from Malezia. Conditions improved slightly, but not meaningfully. Seeing breakouts every 2–3 weeks, I thought it might be demodex I started washing with a sulfur bar in October along with an azelaic acid serum under the moisturizer and I had a month of the best skin in months until it backslid in late November.\n\nNow I'm back to 5–8 pustules popping up mostly on my cheeks each day. Nearly 100% are in a hair follicle, and numerous follicles that don't have visible pus are clearly inflamed. Derm. prescribed 20mg of doxy 2x day two weeks ago.\n\nMy cleaning routine was historically been pretty basic: cetaphil morning and night, with a hyluronic serum, retinol serum, and moisturizer, but I stripped all that away earlier this year to try and figure out what is triggering these breakouts. Right now I'm using what worked best in October: sulfur bar and Sebamed, with Paula's Choice azaleic serum in the morning and Malezia BP in the evening.\n\nLastly, my diet is primarily protein, veg, and fruit with some carbs. I change towels and sheets every two days, try to not touch my face, stay healthy, etc. — the same stuff they tell anyone experiencing acne symptoms.\n\nSorry for the Russian novel-length read, but I feel like I've tried everything, my confidence is crushed, and I don't know what to do next. The leave-on hibiclens regimen? More AHA/BHA? Less? Strip away all products and just moisturize like crazy? Move to a cave? The Derm's response is to wait 6 weeks to see if the doxy helps balance things out, but I don't know if I have that in me.",

      "content": "I decided to come here because I've been growing my hair out for about 2 years now with 2 or 3 cuts in the interim and finally got it to a length I'm liking. But my hair is so coarse, dry, and here it looks floofy because I left it in a ponytail overnight. If I don't do that, it's incredibly flat and dull. This is especially challenging because before I started medically transitioning almost 2 years ago, my hair was incredibly oily and had to be washed daily, so this is new to me.\n\nMy routine lately has been this: wash with Monday moisture shampoo once a week followed by deep condition with a Shea Moisture masque sample pack I got (Jamaican black castor oil strengthen &amp; restore), then condition with Monday conditioner every day following. I often use ion leave-in conditioner and a few spritzes of an ogx biotin &amp; collagen oil mist but it just makes my hair shiny. Sometimes when I'm getting dressed up for a night out I'll use Not Your Mother's curl mousse.\n\nAnd lastly, I stopped blow drying it because it destroys what curls I do have and flattens my hair out so I just let it air dry. I find better results when I put my hair in a ponytail while it's still wet, usually turns out looking decent after that. But after a few hours it just looks lifeless again. I also wish there were a way to help my curves thrive on the top of my head but I think the weight just pulls the hair down?\n\nI've been broke for a while but now have a good job so planning to try to find a salon next month but anything I can do between now and then would be a lifesaver. Thank y'all 🙏",
