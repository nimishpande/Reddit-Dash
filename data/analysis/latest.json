      "content": "Just wanted to share what I’ve learned after testing a few LED masks recently, especially about the difference between red and blue light therapies for skin.\n\nI picked up a Glotech mask from LED Esthetics since it covers both red and blue wavelengths. At first, I wasn’t sure if I really needed both, but after a month of daily sessions, I noticed some interesting changes:\n\n- Red light: Helped soften fine lines and made my skin look a bit firmer over time. I started seeing a noticeable glow and better overall texture, especially on drier patches.\n\n- Blue light: Was more of a game changer for breakouts and random patches of redness. Used this on days when my skin felt oily or inflamed much fewer breakouts, and the old marks faded faster.\n\nTbh I think using both gave me the best of both worlds. Red light is awesome for anti-aging and texture, while blue is great if you deal with acne or frequent spots. If you’re only picking one, think about your main skin concern, but for me, a mask offering both was worth the investment and made the whole routine pretty easy.",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

My phone is too old to take high quality pictures, but the picture shows a smaller version of what I'm dealing with (https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/cystic-acne-on-face-southeast-260nw-2218418063.jpg). It's almost half an inch wide, massive white spot, covered in swelling, it's literally protruding out of my face so makeup isn't going to hide it.\n\nI have spent all day on the phone to my doctor, and as you'd expect, they couldn't be assed to help, so anything that actually works is off the table.\n\nI have the most important job interview of my life in 16 hours, for a public-facing job where my appearance is highly important. I need this job so badly, I cannot put it into words. I cannot reschedule.\n\nI look like a diseased monster.\n\nI don't know what to do. I own no makeup, no creams, nothing. My skin was fine until yesterday. Every shop is closed now until the morning. Does anyone have any advice to get rid of this, or at least cover it up?",

I've attached pictures of my right and left cheeks to show how different their conditions are and was hoping to get some tips on how to clear up my right side. My right cheek has some unevenness and craters in my skin and I don't know how to get rid of that. I don't have active pimples there at the moment but it still doesn't look clear at all. I know it's not a crazy issue but l have a good skincare routine so I don't think that's the iss Maybe I'm missing something? I typically use an oil cleanser, a regular cleanser, hydrating toner, and then facial moisturizer (don't want to do too much). Also my skin looks redder in the pictures because I had just waxed my face. Anyway, l'a appreciate any help you could provide :) Thanks!",

It all started in October last year when I noticed a significant thinning on my crown; the bald spot was especially noticeable when my hair was wet. So after a month, I started taking Finasteride 1 mg a day, which continued until the end of July when I decided to increase the treatment because Finasteride alone wasn't giving me results. Towards the end of July, I started taking two Dutasteride pills (Avodart 0.5 mg) a week and Oral Minoxidil 1.25 mg a day. I don't know if I'm a good responder to Minoxidil or it’s smt else, but as of today, I can confidently say I no longer have any baldness problems. \nThe first pic is before starting treatment, second is like a month after starting Min and the third is today\n\nP.S. Before noticing the thinning I had severe hair loss in the shower that I had never had before, even today I don't know if mine was baldness or an effluvium, the trichologist told me that I had a slight miniaturization on the crown area but nothing to worry about, but to be safe I will continue the treatment, I have already suffered enough ✌🏻",

      "content": "I am trying to understand the relationship to DHT levels and hair loss. I recently noticed a shed for 3-4 weeks so I started to dive deeper into what could have caused it. \n\nI started TRT and tirzepatide around the same time in June and my testosterone went from 300 to about 800 on 140mg a week. I lost about 20-25 pounds during that time frame and somewhat unrelated but relevant, I normally do blood donations and my most recent donation the center only had double RBC equipment. Shortly after when I ran my labs my ferritin levels went down to 6. \n\nI have since been trying to recover iron and am currently sitting around 13 one week after supplementation. My DHT levels came back at 65 which seems to be within limits,  but that means I was likely in the 20-30s prior to TRT. \n\nReading around old posts, it seems that the absolute DHT levels on their own aren’t a culprit to accelerated hair loss, it’s more of the sensitivity to the DHT if I am quoting correctly. In my case, I am trying to understand would taking a DHT blocker help stop the shedding, assuming it’s DHT related and not due to low iron? I have also dropped my testosterone dosages fwiw, it seems I am having less shedding now about 4 weeks later. I haven’t noticed any significant hairline recession and the hair overall still seems healthy. ",

      "content": "Hi all! For maybe a little over a year, I’ve been dealing with extremely dry lips that feel coarse and sometimes looks dehydrated. I’ve tried the big three: aquaphor, burts bees, and Vaseline, and they all just made it worse. I went to see a dermatologist around nov/dec of last year and she gave me a big handful of some lip balm in these little packets and a sample size of Opzelura and sent me on my way. To be honest the lip balm especially and the opzelura did help me out. While they didn’t permanently fix my lips back to normal, they made it feel less dry whenever I used it. Unfortunately, the dermatologist never gave me a clear answer as to what was wrong, so it might be an allergic reaction to an ingredient in some lip products (which I’ve ever had any allergies aside from the usual seasons changing) or possibly eczema (which my family has no history of). Additionally, I definitely drink enough water so that’s not a problem, and I’ve been using the same brand of toothpaste for years so I doubt that’s the problem either. I have recently ran out of those lip balm packets from the derm, and my lips are going back to the extremely dry phase again (and I completely forgot to take a picture of the lip balm so I couldn’t tell you what it was). I included some pictures of what my lips look like when very dry and sometimes when my lips become irritated and start to hurt. I just want to be able to go about my day without feeling like my lips are the Sahara desert. Has anyone experienced anything similar?",

Are they safe to use or should I skip it? (kind of regretting the impulse purchase now 😭)\n\nAlso, while I'm here, can someone suggest good eye creams for dark circles?

(last pic is when i use the straightener)\n\nif anyone could leave styling, product, or even new cut suggestions, that would be so helpful. thank uuu 🫶🫶🫶",

I remember that he definitely started using rogaine when his hair was going but it obviously didn't help much.\n\nAm I likely to have such little response or was his hair loss caused by not using Fin? I'm not even sure how widely available Fin would have been in the late 90s but I don't believe he ever used it.\n\nJust wondering if I should manage my expectations on my results if my brother had no joy with min/fin.",
