      "content": "An update from my previous post a few months ago:\n\nI’m currently on 0.5mg of dutasteride and 5mg of minoxidil, still no side effects at all.\n\nJanuary 2024 - Although I could notice my temples getting bigger since 2019, this is where I started to notice my hair was getting very thin and it would only grow a few inches compared to the hair on the back or sides of my head.\n\nJune 2024 - In those 6 months it got really bad and I started to thin very rapidly, I was formally diagnosed with AGA and started only with 2.5mg minoxidil as I was very scared of side effects from 5ARls. (In hindsight I should’ve been more scared of the sides from oral minoxidil but I was ignorant). \n\nSeptember 2024 - Decided to bite the bullet and started with 0.5mg dutasteride every other day (skipped finasteride since I wanted the absolute highest chance of regrowth).\n\nDecember 2024 - Jumped to 0.5mg dutasteride daily (this is were I started to see drastic improvement)\n\nApril 2025 - Jumped to 5mg minoxidil daily, didn’t notice much improvement vs 2.5mg.\n\nJanuary 2026 - Still running the same stack since April, I am letting my hair grow this time (I thought I’d never have long hair again and I’m so thankful I’m able to now). I do notice the bottom “half” of my hair is a lot more dense than the top half, likely due to more hairs in anagen coming up vs when the top half grew out. \n\nI also have Acquired Progressive Kinking of the Hair, which makes my sideburns incredibly curly, it seems to be linked to aggressive hair loss but there is very little scientific literature on it. This did improve but only by about 15%.\n\nAside from that I have basically reversed all my hair loss excluding the hairline, (although it did thicken a bit) I am looking to get a small hair transplant in the future to get back to NW0.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions!",

I feel like I’m so critical about my hair that I can’t tell what looks good anymore because im just staring at it for so long. I live in New England and I feel like winters are the worst. I feel like it makes my hair boring and flat and dry. \n\nI tried a new styling routine today and want advice on if I’m in the right direction or not or what even am I doing. Am I being overly dramatic and too much of a perfectionist or what.\n\nAlso a note I am getting a haircut next week but last time I saw someone they ruined my hair and I cried for like a month.\n\nRoutine;\n\nBrushed out my hair before the shower\n\nIn the shower double shampoo with all soft mega curls \n\nPut in all soft mega curls conditioner on hair only below my ears, clipped it up for about 10 minutes\n\nHalfway rinsed it out and brushed in the shower and then fully rinsed before getting out of the shower \n\n(This routine is slightly different than what I was doing before that wasn’t working)\n\nOut of the shower i re wet my hair, sectioned it above my ears and added very little leave in(ouidad frizz control),  Ouai curl cream, lots of mousse (NYM), very little gel diluted with water(NYM flash freeze) and then I used a bounce curl defining brush to brush style my curls in sections (hoping to avoid any middle parting in the back by doing this). After I brush style I added more mousse and then scrunched with a t shirt. I repeated this on all sections over my whole head and then I diffused starting by hovering on a cold setting, and then flipped my head upside down and diffused on medium heat then flipped my head side to side and then straight up. My hair was crunchy and then I scrunched it out with olaplex oil. so my areas of concern are my hair curled better in the back towards the top of my head and curled more around the top of my head but it seems to be falling flat and has light frizz (although I’m not sure I’ll be able to get rid of all frizz). I feel like I generally have more volume (could be just this New England winter) I also have not gone outside and probably won’t until tomorrow when I have to go to work. I sleep with a satin bonnet over a pineapple and if I refresh I do water and sometimes rizzos curl refresh spray, have no tried that with this new routine yet however.\n\nCurly hair is not for the weak it’s brutal out here lol",

      "content": "Before anyone says anything, yes, I understand the importance of SPF 50, I use it religiously everyday on my arms and face, but unfortunately, did not use it enough last Saturday at the beach and have learnt a valuable lesson. I am 30 weeks pregnant, I did NOT know that being pregnant can enhance the affects from the sun and if I knew this specifically, I would never have stayed at the beach for an hour and a half. UV was unfortunately 9, but 26 degrees.\n\nIm really wanting some not advice, but guidance. Any experiences? Any suggestions? Really just wanting to not feel alone during this. It’s been hard, being pregnant has been tough enough but this added on has crushed my confidence, lol. Been wearing airy elephant indian pants or just any long pants to cover really, even looking at it makes me want to cry,\n\non Day 6 since being sunburnt. The images below are taken today.\n\nFirst 4 days, absolute agony, crying, losing my mind, feeling like an alien, absolutely devastated over the damage of my legs.\n\nBeen to the doctor yesterday, she prescribed me Tricortone. I’ve applied twice to the parts that have been still a bit sore and need a little extra “help” with inflammation.\n\nThese are the things I have been doing:\n\nMild cold showers for the first 4 days, using shower head over my body, i’ve mainly been only burnt on my legs in the photos. Have had a couple oatmeal baths to really get some hydration back into there.\n\nAloe Vera - 100%, I don’t have a plant, but if you recommend me get one and it’ll 100% make a difference, which I doubt at this point, i’ll invest.\n\nHave been using aveeno oatmeal moisturiser/alternating with Vitamin E moisturiser on top.\n\nHave bought “Solosite” this morning and have applied once so far on the areas I believe have started to create small blisters.\n\nI have only had 3 1-2 cm’s blisters up until today. The small little bubbles im under the assumption are new blisters all forming over my body?\n\nHave been drinking 4-5 litres of water. Extra electrolytes, celtic salt, etc.\n\nThe doctor specifically told me yesterday that the purple on my skin is just under the skin bruising and that’s why it’s so purple on the surface, but I feel as if i’m needing a second opinion. Been told I don’t need a dermatologist, but considering it at this point.\n\nI’m thankful the painful limbs, muscles and aches have gone away as panadol was only just taking the edge off (can’t have neurofen during pregnancy), but this has been so worried. I’m wanting to do anything I can to help this.\n\nAgain, I understand the importance of sunscreen. I always wear SPF 50, everyday, but the Australian sun does NOT play and I am NOT experienced with being at the beach or even at the sun for extended periods of time. Im always scared of things like this happening as a pale white girlie. This has traumatised me lol. I’ve already asked my doctor my chances of sun cancer due to this, she says because this is my first ever bad burn, I need repetitive consistent exposure to be worried but i’m still going to get annual skin checks after this to be safe. This has genuinely never happened to me before.\n\nPlease and thank you in advance.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "**Skin type:** Oily, acne prone, enlarged pores, post acne marks  \n**Main concerns:** Acne control, irritation, texture, acne marks, achieving clear/plump skin\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI’ve struggled with acne since my early teens, which caused my skin to mature earlier than most people my age. Oral treatment helped stop the severe breakouts, but it left behind stubborn acne marks and visible pores. After moving countries, my acne flared up again quite badly possibly due to diet, environment or hormonal changes.\n\nMy family doctor prescribed **Cabtreo (Clindamycin 1.2% + Adapalene 0.15% + Benzoyl Peroxide 3.1%)**, which has helped stop active breakouts. However, my skin is currently **very irritated and dry**, even though the acne itself has improved.\n\n# Current routine:\n\n**AM**\n\n* La Roche-Posay Effaclar Cleanser\n* La Roche-Posay Effaclar A.Z Gel\n* La Roche-Posay Ultra-Fluide Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n* La Roche-Posay Effaclar Cleanser\n* Cabtreo\n* Cetaphil Moisturizer\n\nIn the past year, I’ve occasionally used **CeraVe Retinol Serum**, but not consistently.\n\nI’d love advice on:\n\n* Whether I should use **Cabtreo every night or reduce frequency**\n* What other products (if any) I should add to my routine?\n* How to improve texture, pores, and acne marks without worsening irritation?\n* I recently got **LRP Hyalu B5** and **Mela B3 Serum** from LRP along with my order, can I use them to soothe my skin, and if so, **when should I use them?**\n* Suggest me a gentle oil-free moisturizer.\n\nI’m still pretty naive when it comes to skincare routines and would really appreciate some guidance. Thank you!",

So I did. After 24 hours I got in a shower, I rinsed my hair for a while, really working my fingers through, then washed it, scrubbing my scalp and even through to the ends as hard as I could, five times. I even used Head and Shoulders and a scalp scrubber (one of those hard, pointy rubber ones). I used very hot water the whole time. My scalp is on fire. But the product is still in my hair! I look like a disgusting grease ball that doesn’t know how to bathe. And it feels just as bad. I’m so ashamed and embarrassed and can’t stop crying. How do I get this crap out of my hair!

      "content": "Okay so I was literally hovering over the \"Place Order\" button on Nykaa when my desi instincts kicked in like \"beta, have you checked other apps first?\"\nI'm SO glad I listened to that inner voice because y'all... the price difference for the SAME THREE PRODUCTS was ₹360. That's literally another full-size Minimalist product just... sitting there for free if you're smart about where you order.\n\nWhat I was buying:\n1. Minimalist 8% Glycolic Acid Toner (150ml)\n2. Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Serum (30ml)\n3. Minimalist Vitamin B5 Moisturizer (50g)\n\nThe shocking price breakdown:\n\nTIRA - ₹1,186 (THE CLEAR WINNER)\n1. Cheapest price\n2. FREE Minimalist tote bag as GWP\n\nNYKAA - ₹1,441\n1. ₹255 more expensive than Tira 😬\n2. Zero freebies but you'll be paying for lice pink packaging??\n\nMYNTRA - ₹1,321\n1. ₹135 costlier than Tira\n2. No GWP either\n\nBLINKIT - ₹1,428\n₹242 more than Tira BUT delivers in 14 minutes (see screenshot lol)\n\nAJIO - ₹1,546 💀\n1. Most expensive by FAR (₹360 more than Tira!)\n2. Had random GWPs like travel vouchers??? (for skincare???). There was a coupon but it straight up refused to apply\n\n\nThat ₹360 difference is literally the price of another Minimalist product. Do. The. Math. It took me 10 minutes to check all these apps and I basically got a free product out of it. Also I'm attaching all my cart screenshots because I know the skincare community loves RECEIPTS 📸\nIs anyone else this obsessive about price-checking or is it just my broke millennial energy?",

However, my face has gotten worse with more hyperpigmentations and new acne, and it has been really bothering me so I went ahead to see a GP. An actual dermatologist will cost too much for me at this point\n\nThey determined that my acne was likely a result of stress, and advised me to start using Differin on a daily basis, and prescribed me:\n\n1. Benzac spot treaments 5% benzoyl peroxide\n2. Clindamycin (Mycin Lotion)\n\nand told me to use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night as spot treatment.\n\nHowever, reading through this subreddit, I've seen a lot of advice thrown around to avoid using other actives with Differin as it can cause skin irritation and damage my skin barrier. So far, I do not feel any burning on my skin and only have had more pimples and hyperpigmentations as a side effect from Differin.\n\nI am very confused on what to do. On one hand, I feel like I should be listening to a doctor more than I listen to Reddit. But as it was a General Practitioner, and not a specialist, (Dermatologist) along with the general advice here, I also feel the tug to not follow through with the medication.\n\nWhat are your opinions on this? Is it a bad idea to use these 2 medications with Differin?",

I like it when my hair looks a little spiky, but usually ruffling it up does the trick. I've actually never used a curler or straightener or anything to ever style my hair (it used to be pin straight down my hips so it's too heavy and idgaf) so I'd also really like some tips on how to get a certain look with certain layers. Everything I see is for long hair smh.\n\nObviously I don't expect anything specific if I'm not including reference photos, I just need to read up on some methods and tips.

It’s weird, almost like it gets too dry and too moist… I try lavender but it’s too harsh, some cerave moisturizer but it’s too much and makes it break out ( even when using a small amount ) and rose oil, which dries it out too much as well… My nose has been in a borderline irritated state for the majority of my life, lol \n\nIt’s like no matter what I do It gets all red and irritated and starts breaking out, as well as the surrounding area. It may partly be because I have such bad allergies and have to blow my nose all the time, but I do my best to mitigate the damage by using good tissues that aren’t rough, but it still only does so much \n\nI’ve never been to a dermatologist and honestly I’m trying to just avoid it if possible. I’m not looking for any concrete medical advice, just friendly suggestions and anything that might point me in a good direction \n\nI’m a little desperate honestly, I just turned 30, having a hard look in the mirror and finally pushing myself to get my health and general well being together again. I’ll place an order for whatever you guys think could help me out, and do my best to put it into practice \n\nThank you in advance for anyone who got this far and those who offer their help! 🤍",
