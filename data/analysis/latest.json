I found this routine on tiktok, usually they don't go well but this one made me feel so great about my hair. I did use a hair mask on this specific day, it was Camille Rose cocoa and mango butter mask.\n\nI then sectioned my hair into 3 sections, went through the first section with a small amount of curl cream, then with the bounce Curl brush, I applied mousse after and then gel (still in that first section) after I did that , I proceeded to dry that section.\n\nAfter the first section I rinsed and repeated the above for the next section, and then once again repeated for the last top section. I found it cut down on drying time because the sections were smaller. Maybe each section took no more than 5 minutes to dry. Also easier on the neck and able to achieve volume easier. It sounds like a lot but I promise it was easier than plopping you head over for an eternity.\n\nThis will be my permanent routine as long as it continues to do me right. I am pretty excited. \n\nI wash my hair twice a week only. Rest of the time I just let her do her thing. If it looks too bad then I will put her up, but I find",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hey all, \n\nSearched around this subreddit and online and couldn't find any good examples of this happening with oral minoxidil, but has anybody else gotten facial Pili Multigemini (compound hair growth) from oral minoxidil? I have relatively thick facial hair, and started oral minoxidil roughly a year ago at 2.5mg, once a day.  I haven't noticed these elsewhere on my body, just on my face. \n\n\n\nI used to get these compound hairs once every couple of months, but now I've been finding them after shaving 1-3x per week. They almost always end up becoming ingrown hairs/turning into zits if I don't pluck them, and I've been shaving with a Norelco OneBlade which generally doesn't leave any ingrown hairs/irritate my skin at all. I wash my face with a silicone scrubber in the shower (helps exfoliation), apply moisturizer 1x per day. At night I wash my face and apply 0.5% tretinoin cream 2-3x weekly. I've had this skincare routine for years, so nothing's really changed on that front. \n\n\n\nThese aren't particularly bad or anything, but I'm wondering if anybody has any advice on how to deal with them, or if they've also experienced dealing with these. Overall oral minox has been pretty good for me, I tried finasteride a few years ago, had some bad side effects, but aside from extra body hair/ear hair and these, no negative side effects on minoxidil. \n\n\n\n(Photo taken from elsewhere on Reddit, I never seem to remember to take a photo of these whenever I pull them).

I've used mousse instead, and that dries quicker, but my hair feels drier, less smooth, and gets more tangled. I have pretty high porosity (from bleaching 🥲), hair is both moderate thickness and density. I've used all sorts of gels and mousses, trust me, and I never get that smooth, moisturized feel without a nice heavy cream.\n\nY'all, I swear to god, the second ANY cream hits my head, even just a little, it doubles the drying time but GOOOOOOOOOD does my hair feel so much better.\n\nMaybe there's like, a really hydrating, thin, water-based leave-in out there?

(pretty confident about this, correct me here too)\n* pore clogging/black heads on nose\n* spot cystic acne\nthe cystic pimples aren’t constant but mostly appear on my forehead, chin, and sometimes cheeks when they do occur. some are painful and skin colored, some are painful and beating red, both rarely ever being able to pop\n\nand i will say though, i never break out this bad on a regular. my period is supposed to start anytime now, but i guess it’s good to ask  now so that you can see its “full potential.” i feel i break out the most around ovulation and my period, so a good amount of the months time. every month is a new month, so where and what the breakouts will be are a mystery. my cheeks rarely ever break out, my T-zone is what gets everything the most\n\nmy current routine (once a day, at night):\n* vani cream facial cleanser\n* vani cream daily facial moisturizer\n\ni’ve heard the moisturizer actually contains pore clogging ingredients, and i believe the cleanser may be too gentle for me. the moisturizer can also burn on open, scarring pimples for me too. i started using jojoba oil as an oil cleaner a few days ago since i heard it can work as that, and i already had it on hand, but can stop if it’s not actually helpful. i’ve never used an oil cleanser before, but heard it’s good for closed comedones and future pore clogging\n\nwhat tiktok/chatGPT suggests:\n* differin adapalene gel 0.1% acne treatment for my hormonal pimple/cystic acne spotting\n* cerave acne control face cleanser with 2% salicylic acid\n* cerave PM lotion\nall 3 products were said to be acne safe and would help with all my skin needs\n\nclearly, i’m wanting advice from real people that can actually see my skin and go from there. the products i currently use, and what was recommended are all included with my skin’s photos below. let me know your thoughts, and ask questions if needed! thank you all",

I used to get my nails done every month but I’m taking a break while my husband and I save to buy a house. I got bangs last month and I’m still trying to figure out how to style them. I’ve also stopped the monthly facials and went back to trentinoin, so my skin is currently in that purge phase. I’ve also stopped self tanning/spray tanning bc honestly I can’t get it right and my hands always turn out orange. Everything kind of came to a head when I got my driver’s license updated today with my new last name and I got my picture taken when I wasn’t expecting to…it’s the worst picture I’ve taken in a while and of course it’s my new license photo, so self esteem is an all time low. So long story short, instead of being upset I’m going to do something for me. \n\nWhat do you do for beauty when you feel like you need a change, update, pick me up, whatever you do to make yourself feel pretty?
