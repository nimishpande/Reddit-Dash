La Roche-Posay Cicablast Baume B5+**\n\n**10/10 HG**\n\nI’ve been getting this product (incidentally, through a friend of my husband’s) for over a year now because I have very dry eczema prone skin. And I love this shit. my biggest gripe is that i run out of it so soon. It’s a thick THICK occlusive cream which I apply as the last step in my PM routine and wake up with “healthy” feeling skin.\n\n**2. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume**\n\n**8/10 Will always RP**\n\nThis one feels a lot more hydrating than LRP if that makes sense? So typically I use this in the mornings when I am not layering too many products and I need the same moisturiser to hydrate and seal\n\n**3. Skin1004 Centella Light Cleansing Oil**\n\n**8/10 Will always RP**\n\nSo I use this because my absolute holy grail Softymo Speedy is very hard to source in India. This one is lightweight though and smells really really good \n\n**4. numbuzin no. 2 protein creamy serum**\n\n**9/10 WRP**\n\nI am fairly new to this. But the texture of this has to be the best I have ever used and I have used a ton of milky toners. It’s actually thicker than milky toners/ usual serums, almost a body lotion texture if you will.  Thats why I love it so much for my DRY dry skin\n\nI am just not very sure if I absolutely need this in my routine given that I already use so many other barrier repair products all the time. But most likely will repurchase just to have it handy for extra dry days. \n\n**5. Skin1004 Centella Sunstick**\n\n**9/10 Will always RP**\n\nHeadsup: I don’t use it over makeup. I just reapply through the day when i am not wearing makeup using this because it feels like nothing on your skin. not sticky not heavy. Love it for that reason \n\nCiao✨",

Burns, cuts, pimples—you name it. It works quickly and soothes the skin really well. Apparently, it can also be consumed for digestive or internal issues, but I haven’t personally tried that.\n\n2.\tBoronil – Super effective for dry or irritated skin. I like to keep it on hand; it’s like an Ayurvedic moisturizer with healing properties. I use it for face lips and hands.\n\n3.\tTup Anjan (ghee-based eye balm) – This one’s underrated! I use it for dry or tired eyes, and surprisingly, it helps me sleep better too.\n\nWould love to hear if others have discovered lesser-known Ayurvedic or traditional remedies that actually work for everyday use.

      "content": "Hello, I have been using azeleic acid for about 3 weeks every night. I have sensitive, combinational skin (leaning more oily but not super oily) that's prone to acne and redness. I've noticed some purging and improvements in my texture so far. I live in a tropical, humid climate so dryness is not an issue.\n\nI usually do not use a moisturizer after using azeleic acid (only using moisturizer in the AM ). I decided to try using a barrier repair creme about 15 minutes after applying azeleic acid (15%) because it's what people here seem to recommend but shortly after applying the barrier repair creme my face started burning terribly. Usually, I might have a bit of stinging for a few minutes after applying the acid but it goes away. This time it didn't go away so I washed it off.\n\nI took a break from active for 3 days and returned to the same routine of not applying moisturizer in the PM. Basically just wash my face, wait for it to dry, and then apply the azeleic. Is this ok? It doesn't seem like my skin likes having a creme after this active. I can use the same barrier repair creme without the azeleic and it's fine, no reaction.\n\nMy routine  \nAM - gentle cleanser -&gt; Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel -&gt; LRP Tinted oil control gel Anthelios UVMune400 50+ sunscreen\n\nPM - Miscellar water -&gt; Gentle cleanser -&gt; Azeleic acid 15%\n\nFor the barrier repair creme it is AXIS-Y's Panthenol 10 Skin Soothing Shield Creme",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "title": "Since a lot of people asked in my last posts, I made a rough guide/tutorial (In Post Body)",
      "content": "Before I get in to the actual details I think a lot of it is just genetics. I got blessed with good hair color, and my hair is naturally thick and doesn't break easily. A lot of my routine is based around minimizing frizz because my hair will naturally form curls very easily. The first two pictures I attached to the post were Day 3 morning hair so you can see some frizz showing up. The last one is after being out working in humidity for that full day.\n\n\n\n# Basic Care\n\nThe one thing I think I have done for my hair that's been super beneficial is that I have never used heat products. If you straighten/curl your hair on certain occasions you're probably fine honestly, I choose not to just to play it safe.\n\nBesides that you probably already know most of the things. A silk bonnet or a silk pillow case is always a good idea, not dunking your hair in buckets of dirt and grease (or just using too much product) will also definitely help. Keep it tied back during physical activity in order to prevent knots and frizz.\n\n\n\n# Wash Routine\n\nA lot of my routine is based off of the Curly Girl Method (CGM). While CGM does take it a bit far in my opinion a lot of my routine is taken from it. If you are interested you can find a lot of guides on reddit, but be careful as it can cause product build up.\n\nWhat I have found works best for me is-\n\n1. Get hair DRENCHED as much as possible\n2. Detangling with a curl defining hair brush (skip this if you have fine hair or hair that easily tangles)\n3. Shampoo (2x a week, or if hair is greasy/dirty)\n4. Rinse thoroughly\n5. A LOT of conditioner, brush through with curl defining brush.\n6. Let conditioner sit for \\~3 minutes\n7. Rinse thoroughly \n8. While hair is still dripping wet use product, comb through or just scrunch in depending on product (skip if you feel like you are starting to get product buildup or if its just not needed)\n9. Scrunch extra water out with hands\n\nAfter that my hair is still \"wet\" by most standards but I normally go to sleep since I shower right before bed. There is probably a hundred reasons not to do that but when I wake up its always tangle free and I just need to scrunch/shake it out which is really nice in the mornings. I use a silk pillow case so I just \"whip\" my hair on to it before I sleep.\n\nThis is what I have found works for me, if you know something doesn't work for you personally just swap it out or skip it.\n\n# Products\n\nI say this with complete sincerity there is one product I would literally go to war for. [Lush Super Milk](https://www.lush.com/us/en_us/p/super-milk-conditioning-spray/100ml) is my absolute saving grace. I never skip using this, it prevents frizz and smells amazing. The only other product I use is [Function of Beauty Curl Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Function-Beauty-Curl-Cream-Curly/dp/B0CT2FY1S5), it helps to revive my hair but I don't use it every time.\n\nFor shampoo and conditioner I honestly use anything that says curly on it. However what I normally use when I can get my hands on it is the [Aussie Miracle Curls](https://www.amazon.com/Aussie-Miracle-Curls-Collection-Conditioner/dp/B0886XTJDN) line (the link has the full set but I recommend just getting the shampoo/conditioner).\n\n# Closing\n\nLike I said this is definitely not perfect for everyone but I find it works nicely for me. If anyone has any advice for me I would love to hear it. Improving a routine never hurts :)",

I have combination skin as well, with my forehead and nose being the main parts of my face that are oily.

Also, I have random marks on my skin and i’m not sure how to make them go away (its like some skin is just missing??) Any help would be appreciated!!",

I've used multiple shampoos, from loreal, to head n shoulders which claims to work on all hair types, to even a special shampoo called \"Milk Shake\" that I’ve heard is good and none have been able to sort out my greasy hair issue. I washed my hair yesterday with head n shoulders and right now I'm sitting with my curtain bangs being greasy. Even after I wash them the next day I am still left with greasy bangs. It's extremely annoying especially when summer arrives because my issue becomes worse. I can't last even a day without my hair becoming greasy and it's really embarrassing and annoying because it seems as if I don’t wash my hair when I do. I wash my hair every 2 days otherwise it will look like oil was spilled on my head. Even after one day of no washing it tends to looks bad. I try to scrub my scalp well and most times I try not to brush or touch my hair with dirty hands some may say that my pillowcase isn’t washed but I reassure you my sheets get switched into clean ones often. I believe maybe it’s a product issue, but finding a shampoo/conditioner from some good brand with a well price is difficult as most are way over 50 euros and my budget would be typically below that. Can anyone give me some products or solutions to fix it..? Any solutions would do wonders as I have been struggling for a long time now!",

      "content": "So last summer, I was really liking how my curls were coming out most wash days. Felt like they were lasting long and curling up nicely. But I felt like I just didn't quite have the frizz control I wanted, so I went on a quest for a new routine. I'm pretty sure it gave me moisture overload because everything started looking stretched out and flimsy.\n\nSo I swapped back to my old routine from the summer, hoping to get back to where I was and go from there.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n1st cleanse: Panteen Sheer Volume (clarifying days only, maybe every 4-5 washes); Shea Moisture Apple Cider Vinegar (every wash that isn't clarifying)\n\n2nd cleanse: Maui Moistuire Light Curls + flaxseed (only step that's different from summer routine, before it was Maui Moisture Light Hydration in the pink bottle)\n\nConditioner: V &amp; Co. Wave Babe (formerly Wavy, Wavy, Wavy)\n\nLeave-in: Curlsmith Hydrate &amp; Plump\n\nGel: Tre Lux Hi Definition gel\n\nStyling: Rake leave-in through with fingers, lightly brush style upside down (typically the Bounce curl brush), glaze gel over sections, scrunch, plop for 20 minutes, diffuse\n\nI know curl type doesn't matter but to give people an idea of what I'm seeing, I am usually seeing 3A curls with a few very intense 2Cs thrown in. Now it's almost all 2C with some 2B. I'm genuinely confused. I've clarified a couple times since going back to the old routine, so I would think any old products would be long gone and no longer influencing the weight of my curls. \n\nI know a lot of people are talking about the \"finish\" of your hair being important but... I genuinely thought mine was coarse, but every coarse product killed my curls so I'm guessing I'm a soft finish. I think the Tre Luxe gel is considered good for \"coarse\" but it was working great in the summer apart from frizz control. \n\nMy best guesses right now are either the Maui formulation (contains aloe) is just a bad match or I don't have enough protein?? But both rinse out conditioner and gel have protein and were working well together before. Any suggestions are appreciated!",
