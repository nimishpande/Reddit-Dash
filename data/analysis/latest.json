Yeah so Tretinoin really does work if used according to your skins needs. (If you want to ask about peeling, then yes it peeled for first one year and now also it peels but significantly low peeling, and strangely the peeling kinda reduced when I jumped from 0.05% to 0.1%, so yeah it might take different durations for your skin to adapt to the peeling).

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I have had hairdressers say I have a lot of hair but the strands themselves are very fine. \n\nThe photos show my hair air dried after using my regular routine of OGX Bond Protein Repair shampoo and L’Oréal Elvive renewing conditioner. I wash it every other day because if I go two days or more my scalp gets very greasy. \n\nI live in a very dry climate and when I go to humid places it definitely forms more of a curl which tells me it needs a lot more moisture but I haven’t found a conditioner that won’t weigh it down a lot. \n\nI’d love to see what it would look like with the waves/curls more well defined.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

My biggest struggle right now is frizz, and I’m having a hard time figuring out how to manage it.\n\nI currently wash my hair twice a week since it tends to get dry. These are the products I’m using:\n\n* **Shampoo:** &amp;honey Deep Moisturizing Shampoo\n* **Hair mask:** Fino Hair Mask\n* **Oil:** 100% Camellia oil\n\nWhile these help with moisture, frizz is still my main issue. I’m looking for something I could use daily that would help style my hair while also controlling frizz.\n\nI’ve tried curl creams specifically Umberto Giannini Curl Crème. It does define my waves, but it also makes my hair feel matte and still somewhat frizzy.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions or tips on how to better manage frizz (especially for wavy hair), I’d really appreciate it.\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "content": "Hi all! The title is my current prescription - got it this morning from a dermatologist. This was my first time seeing this dermatologist or any dermat, and the process actually felt pretty rushed and I didnt have time to explain my concerns/reservations.\n\nI am a bit scared ab using either of these topical creams, partly because I wasnt struggling with acne up until 2.5 weeks before. I would get the occasional fungal acne that I use head and shoulders for and it worked. \n\nA little bit about me: I remember getting some acne when I was about 16 but idk what I did to clear it up. At this point I had started using some kind of milk soap that was drying but afair effective. Then when I was about 19 I used vitamin E on my face once and it broke me out. This prompted me to look into acne clearing \"natural\" products and I landed on this charcoal soap, that helped me quite a bit at the time. Even since then I have used that soap every day. When I was about 22, I started working out and drinking milk. This caused breakouts. But it healed by itself. I was probably still using the soap. In the recent years, I would get small acne only on my forehead and cleared up with head and shoulders.\n\nRecently, I started working out again. This time also taking whey. I started seeing small acne on my forehead and jaw, and thought it was fungal. So I applied head and shoulders and it worked for a bit until it stopped, mostly for the jaw. Now I have active breakouts on my jaw. \n\nWith this, I went to the dermatologist. My current routine invovles just the charcoal soap and BOJ sunscreen in the morning. The dermat didnt really ask for my routine, like I said. I am writing it here in case it matters. Anywho, so he has prescribed me the topical creams I wrote in the title of my post. Both every day. \n\nWhat do you all think? I understand that the dermat knows best, but i didn't get enough time with him. So I am looking for additional advice before I dive into the world of Tret! \n\nMy skin is p dry but im not sure if my barrier is compromised?\n\nCurrent pictures of my acne are attached for your reference! I turned 26 a month or so ago, if that also helps.",

I have a shower filter, I moisturize and have a good skin routine. However, my hair is constantly greasy and separating at the roots yet I have dandruff, and it’s dry at the ends, I also developed keratosis psoriasis on my arms and legs. \n\nI was wondering what the best everyday shampoo and conditioner for hard water was? I’m planning on getting the Malibu C shampoo but I’d only use that once a week. \n\nThe shampoo I currently use is the Dove anti-frizz and smooth and L’Oréal Elvive conditioner (I’ve tried a few, not too much of a difference though)\n\nI also use the Moroccanoil hair treatment oil after the shower, and Gisou hair perfume (when frizzy)\n\nFor reference, I have curly/wavy hair but usually wear it wavy or straighten it (since curly is a lot of work lol)\n\nFor my skin I use glycolic acid, salacytic acid, and Olay super serum lotion.   \n\nAny recommendations on products/routines?\n\nThank you!!
