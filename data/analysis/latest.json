Shampoo every other week with Briogeo Clarifying Rice shampoo ($13 on sale at TJ Maxx). Rotate between Not your mother‚Äôs curly shampoo/ Ouidad humidity shampoo when not clarifying. (I shampoo approximately every 5 days or so). \n**Today I brushed shampoo through hair with 4 row denman, separating bottom half from crown. \n\n2. Condition with Aussie curl quench (head upside down and finger combing before a light rinse) \n\n3. Thick layer of Cant√π leave in (squish with couple handfuls of water to clump curls) \n\n4.  Two gentle scrunches with cotton t shirt, before a generous dollop of tresemme curly mousse applied with prayer hands \n\n5. Pink Eco Brand gel (about a shot glass full) squished throughout \n\n6. Flip head over and make sure curls are laying as desired before spraying whole head lightly with alcohol free hair spray \n\n7. Air dry then break cast with Verb Ghost oil (note: hair not fully dry at time of photo) ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe‚Ñ¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Tbh I think I‚Äôm cooked and the only way to get rid of these is probably botox but I do want to work on preventing them from getting anymore obvious since I‚Äôm still pretty young. \n\nI suspect this could be mostly sun damage (my left side is much more advanced than the right side- driver side window may be the culprit) but I am very expressive and don‚Äôt have prominent facial structure features to balance out the movement- slim jaw, small cheekbones. \n\nI‚Äôve been working outdoors for the past 3.5 years and only started wearing sunscreen daily for the past 1.5 years. I‚Äôve been wearing sunglasses daily for the past 1.5 years - I lagged because I require prescription lenses. When I work I usually have a baseball cap on. I drink a minimum of 2L of water during the day and even more at night. I hardly drink alcohol, don‚Äôt smoke cigarettes but do smoke weed. I take a few daily medications- the only one that might have a negative impact is Seroquel, which I take to help with nasty dreams. I have a go to moisturizer but have been pretty meager with it because keeping my skin more on the dry side has kept my acne manageable but I‚Äôm now realizing that may have contributed to the lines. \n\nIn the past year my go-to routine has mostly been:\n\nAM\nCeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser \nStridex pads (red box) - all over face \nNeutrogena Clear Face serum sunscreen SPF 60+  \n\nPM \nCeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser \nStridex pads (red box) - all over face \nHumanrace humidifying cream \n\nNow that I‚Äôm panicking over aging I‚Äôve been researching and buying new products to build a new routine. So far I have:\n\nAM\nCeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser\nStridex pads (red box) - spot treatment, away from eyes \nThe Ordinary Multi-Peptide + Hyaluronic Acid\nCOSRX Snail Mucin Peptide Under Eye Cream\nHumanrace humidifying cream \nNeutrogena Clear Face serum sunscreen SPF 60+ - if I‚Äôm going outside OR\nAquaphor slugging around eyes if I‚Äôm staying inside\n\nPM\nCeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser\nStridex pads (red box) - spot treatment, away from eyes \nThe Ordinary Multi-Peptide + Hyaluronic Acid\nThe Ordinary Retinol 0.2% in Squalane (only tried once 2 nights ago, my face isn‚Äôt too dry so I‚Äôm going to apply again tonight) \nCOSRX Snail Mucin Peptide Under Eye Cream (not sure if this should go before or after retinol)\nHumanrace humidifying cream \nAquaphor slugging around eyes\n\nI‚Äôm brand new to retinol so I chose what seems to be a relatively gentle option. From research it sounds like I‚Äôll have to work up to tretinoin to make any kind of difference. I haven‚Äôt gone to a dermatologist since high school and health insurance has been inconsistent as of lately so I‚Äôm not sure how soon I can get in. So any and all advice/suggestions/recommendations would be much appreciated!\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Greetings! Making this post because I often see discussion of overall oily faces, but what would you suggest if ONLY my chin is getting oily throughout the day? First few hours is completely fine, but after that I have to continue blotting the area at least 4-5 times, or it'll be super shiny and I can definitely feel the oil on my skin.\n\nRest of my skin gets a bit oily, but its primarily a glow more than anything. It's my chin that bothers me the most, and it's also the only place where I continue to get acne \\[primarily closed comedones/whiteheads. Sometimes cysts near/during my period\\] and it's very, very frustrating. I have normal to oily, sensitive skin that is prone to fungal acne. Most products have broken me out, and I fully understand that this could potentially be a hormonal problem, but I dont have access to a dermatologist at the moment unfortunately. Routine below:\n\nAM:\n\n\\- Water rinse\n\n\\- Hypochlorous Acid Spray\n\n\\- Purito Oat &amp; Gel Moisturizer\n\n\\- I'm From Ginseng Eye Cream\n\n\\- Nivea Super Water Gel SPF 50+ \\[Japanese SPF. Only one that hasn't broken me out lol\\]\n\nPM:\n\n\\- Water Rinse\n\n\\- SKINN Oil &amp; Enzyme Cleanser \\[Or cleansing wipes\\]\n\n\\- Paula's Choice Azelaic Acid \\[Spot treatment/using on dark spots + acne\\]\n\n\\- Moisturizer + Eye Cream \\[Same as above\\]\n\n\\- Topical Salicylic Acid \\[Optional, for active acne/blemishes if applicable\\]\n\nAll I can think of is perhaps I'm cleaning the area of my chin a bit too harshly? I tend to pick at the area and wipe a bit roughly due to the acne/closed comedones. I don't apply SPF to this area because I'm worried it'll lead to further breakouts as well. Does anyone else struggle with this? It's been bothering me for at least 5-6 months now, and I have no idea how to treat it outside of blotting sheets. Any suggestions/help greatly appreciated, thank you so much!",

I don't mind if that means that it's all extremely curly, or it's all just wavy, but the way it currently is just looks wacky as fuck.\n\nI've tried mousses and curl creams on the outer layers, along with the usual \"curly girl methods\", even completely ignoring the under layers, but I just cannot seem to get the two to match lol. \n\n\n\nBackground:\nMy hair is 100% uncolored, I never use heat (I only even blowdry it maybe once a month, the rest of the time I just let it dry naturally as I wear it in a braid at work every day anyway). I never wear it tied up in a ponytail or bun, usually either a single or double French braid unless I'm just wearing it completely down. ",

It mostly peaked last spring when I was in the middle of prepping for a dream job interview, woke up to a hugee pimple in the middle of my forehead and smaller pimples everywhere. Even with concealer/foundation I looked like a cyclops. That was all I could think about when I went to the interview, which screwed up my performance and failed it. Ended up crying myself to sleep that night thinking about how acne's is going to ruin my life.\n\n  \nTried everything, all the stupid serums, dermatologists, TikTok hacks. Nothing worked honestly. The magic fix was literally tracking my skin. I literally looked at every little thing that could be affecting my skin. Kept paper logs and even used an ai skincare app to take weekly scans, (helped me realise that diary and eggs were the root cause). I also cut coffee, added gentle cleanser. Started using CeraVe moisturizer, SPF, salicylic acid, niacinamide. Stayed consistent for 2-3 months and now cysts gone, skin is glasss. Nailed a new interview bare-faced last week and your girl got the job! Feels like I can finally live life again haha",

Travel size product recs\n\nLately, after travelling and limited to 100ml bottles I've just used whatever I could get a hold of easily or using up the last dwindling scraps of old supplies not in the best condition. With all the change in products a few months ago, I'm not sure if skincare routine needs a switch up or is direly missing something.\nI'm also now noticing what seems to be a sprinkle of hormonal acne or clogged pores near jawline, where as normally I'd only have to deal with 1 or 2 spots each month even on back-to-back BC. Chin, lower cheeks near and on jawline feels less smooth. \n\nUsual routine used to be as follows - \n\nAM:\nNivea refreshing face wash/ Cerave hydrating cleanser \nSimple Triple Protect Moisturiser SPF 30\n\nPM: \nEither cleaser mentioned in AM\nE45 moisturising lotion\n+ Occassionally hydromol emollient when dry in Winter\n+ rarely a retinol\n\n\nAnd at the moment -\n\nAM:\nNeutrogena spot controlling wash/ mask\n(Used a dandruff shampoo for a bit hearing it supposedly helped with fungal acne?)\nOff brand SPF moisturing day cream\n\nPM:\nNeutrogena spot controlling wash/ mask (sometimes as mask)\n(Or the dandruff shampoo again)\nHydromol emollient with some water/\nZerodouble emollient gel\n\n\nThe emollient ointment is from previous bouts of eczema and dry skin. Skin doesn't feel particularly dry at the moment, but I'm using it as a 'safe' product for the meantime. Skin usually seems to swing between dry to combination (usually only ever oily around chin).\n\nPlease give a shout out for your recommended travel size products go-tos! And ideally doesn't require prescription (e.g. spirolactone), as it can sometimes be an issue at the airport. Thanks!\n\n",

I have radically different skin (rosacea, sensitive skin) than my partner and I‚Äôm just trying to help ‚Äòem. \n\nMy partner is a black AMAB who normally has flawless skin with zero skincare routine (go figure lol), has trouble breaking out when they use regular razors, to the point where they‚Äôve had cysts at least twice. Electric razors *usually* do not cause break outs, but two weeks ago they went to visit their uncle and tried out his new electric razor and wound up breaking out. Honestly, I think it‚Äôs just bc they shared razors with their uncle‚Ä¶ The bumps/breakout seemed to either lessen or were just covered up by new beard growth, but a few days ago my partner shaved again with a new razor that was exactly like their uncle‚Äôs and broke out again. Maybe it‚Äôs just the razor or maybe it‚Äôs leftover from when they shaved previously? Either way, when they pointed it out to me yesterday evening, I had them clean their face with my cleanser since it‚Äôs paraben and sulfate free and made for sensitive skin, but I haven‚Äôt yet done anything else since I don‚Äôt want to agitate their skin further. They say the bumps are itchy and I think it could be an allergic reaction to the new razor, but I‚Äôm unsure.\n\nIs there anything we can do to lessen the razor bumps/break outs aside from obviously never sharing razors again and keeping their face and current electric razor clean?",

I only got the enzyme mask this past week, and I use it around every other day, but I'm wondering if I should get mandelic acid as well (I was thinking the Ordinary's but I'm willing to take recs). I have a habit of overdoing it when I'm breaking out, so I don't want to be too harsh with my skin, but I reallyyyy want these closed comedones to go away ASAP because I have so many, and I just want my skin to look nice again. Any thoughts on whether adding mandelic acid into my routine is a good idea, or if I should leave it with using the Prequel Enzyme mask a couple times a week?\n\n(for context my skincare routine right now is evian water spray, prequel half and half milk, prequel enzyme mask on some days, prequel moisturizer, april skin spot treatment, and sunscreen in the mornings)",
