The replies to that post were very helpful and I wanted some help on choosing some alternate products or sticking to this routine.\n\n- Moisturizer: should I stick with the ponds or switch to minimalist b12 since I'm using niacinamide and need to protect my skin barrier?\n\n- Sunscreen: this is where I am facing the biggest confusion (so are others when I searched this sub lol), I initially decided to go with the regular minimalist spf 50 but then I found out it has retinol in it (seperate thread on that later, because that makes no sense) which is a big no no with the other actives I'm using so decided to switch to the light fluid one instead. I've also heard korean ones are good as well as reequil ultra dry matte but there's so many choices and not enough budget to go around so please help me choose one :\")\n\nI hope y'all can provide a overall verdict on my routine, I'm scared and excited to be starting this journey for the first time after decades of tanning and negligence of my skin \n\nSee you on the other side 🤎",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

This product is actually a 2 in 1 because not only does it soften your hair it does shape your curls.\n\nAfter that I put on curling gel, I specifically use Marc Anthony Strictly Curls gel. \n\nThen I diffuse. First I use the highest heat possible then when my hair is half dry I go to medium heat. This is to prevent my hair from getting too dry from being exposed from the highest heat for too long.\n\nThen to break up the case made from the gel I use Ciliganic Moringa oil.

See- she is a “masculine” presenting lesbian with hair that ends right at her shoulders currently. She has asked me to help her choose a new hair cut because she’s gotten quite bored with the current style. The thing is- I have a shit ton of frizzy, wavy/curly THICC hair. She has (and I say this with the utmost respect) the FLATTEST SPINACH HAIR IVE EVER SEEN. I can’t even describe it. She doesn’t even use conditioner yet her hair is always soft and glossy. She’s never had to straighten it EVER. And if we try to put her hair in a ponytail the ponytail just… slips off. Honestly sometimes I am jealous by how effortlessly beautiful her hair looks but it’s also the most frustrating hair texture I’ve ever seen. We tried curling it and not even a minute later her hair was flat again. So now I’m asking the hair gurus for some advice. What haircut can she get that would be something different for once yet still look good in a professional setting (she works as a public servant in an office so she can’t look tooo crazy) ",

No reaction, no breakouts.\n\nBUT I didn’t love the finish (a bit too shiny/gelly for my liking), so I thought I’d try others.\n\n\t•\tDot &amp; Key SPF &amp; Aqualogica SPF – BIG mistake. Both gave me dermatitis. Burning, irritation, texture — the whole nightmare. This really shook my confidence in cosmetic brands.\n\n\t•\tWent to a dermatologist:\n\n\t•\tSuggested Venusia sunscreen → made me extremely oily, felt heavy and uncomfortable and also i felt it didn’t work much i felt my tan increased with the use\n\n\t•\tThen suggested Acne UV.\n\n\t•\tAcne UV (50g) – LOVED it. Blended well, no irritation, skin was happy.\n\nSo I confidently bought the 100g version and… it was HORRIBLE.\n\nThick, doesn’t blend, terrible white cast, stays patchy on the skin. I don’t know if it’s a batch issue or formulation difference, but it was unusable.\n\n\t•\tUV Doux – Tried this too and it felt good on my skin. No immediate reaction.\n\n•\tBoj OG Sunscreen — Too heavy, felt like a moisturizing blanket for dry skin — not for me.\n\nNow I’m thinking: Korean sunscreens?\n\nI’ve seen people rave about them, but they’re costly, and I’m nervous because:\n\nI apply sunscreen properly (2–3 fingers) every day, so cost matters — but if something is truly worth it, I’m open to trying.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n\n\t•\tSafe for very sensitive skin\n\n\t•\tNo dermatitis / irritation\n\n\t•\tPrefer matte or comfortable, slight dew is okay\n\n\t•\tWorth the price for daily use\n\nIf you’ve had similar skin issues and found something that works (especially Korean or pharmacy sunscreens), please share 🙏\n\nI just want sun protection without my skin panicking .",

At the time, I was assured by the dermat that the acne would not return.\n\nHowever, it has come back, and this time, it feels worse. It seems hormonal, especially since I also have PCOS. I recently sprained my ankle as well, so my regular exercise routine has been disrupted, which may have contributed to the flare-up.\n\nRight now, I’m using the Effaclar serum from La Roche-Posay at night, along with a few topical creams prescribed by my dermatologist. She is now suggesting a chemical peel as the next step.\n\nTo be honest, I’m feeling quite exhausted and overwhelmed by the process. I double cleanse at night, religiously follow AM-PM skin care regimes - will this never go away?\n\nWhat has worked best for you if you have faced similar issues?\n\nTL;DR: Acne has returned after isotretinoin (which caused severe depression), likely hormonal due to PCOS. Current topicals aren’t helping much, dermatologist suggests a chemical peel. Feeling exhausted and unsure how to proceed.\n\nPS. Clicked this picture on one of the better days unfortunately ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I think this is the best my hair has ever looked, really wish I had more pictures with it. Switched bc my hair started feeling really greasy and product heavy to the point I was washing nearly every day.\n\nPic 2: Cantu leave-in conditioning repair cream, Cantu coconut curling cream, and Aunt Jackie's flaxseed elongating curling gel.\n\nThought these products would stretch my curls more but somehow the opposite happened. Heavy, greasy feeling was even worse than previous routine. Look wasn't bad, tighter curls are just not what I'm going for personally so certainly not worth washing every day for.\n\nPic 3 (Current routine): Carol's Daughter devine strength leave-in cream, Not Your Mother's Curl Talk defining cream, and LA Looks extreme sport gel.\n\nGreasy feeling is gone and I'm back to only washing my hair once or twice a week. My hair is stringy and frizzy however. Any hold I get is lost within a few hours and my hair is left a frizzy mess because my gel won't leave a cast at all with these products under it.\n\nSo either my hair feels bad and I have to wash constantly but it looks the best it's ever looked, or my hair looks bad but feels okay. Do I just suck it up and accept the greasy hair? Any other product recommendations or styling tips?",

I take a day or 2 off from the p501970 and trying to incorporate Tret at 0.025%, about once weekly. I also use BR masque vivant and infrared/red light therapy mask\n\nI’ve used all of these products during times of great skin clarity, so they shouldn’t break me out\n\nI also texted some BR lotion p50 since they’ve discontinued 1970, and it super irritated my skin at first. That could also be a culprit!\n\nLet me know if you’ve experienced something similar and have any tips!

      "content": "Hi everyone.\nI’ve had a dark spot on my neck for about 3–4 years now. Over this time, I’ve done several medical tests, including ones related to insulin resistance and other health issues, and everything has come back normal.\nI’ve also seen dermatologists, but so far none of them have been able to clearly identify what it is or give me a definite diagnosis.\nHonestly, I don’t even remember exactly how it started. My only guess is that it might have appeared after shaving, maybe due to irritation, an allergic reaction, or some kind of inflammation that later turned into hyperpigmentation, but that’s just a guess.\nIt doesn’t itch or hurt, but it never goes away and it really bothers me aesthetically.\nIf anyone has experienced something similar or has any idea what this could be and what usually helps in cases like this, I’d really appreciate it.",
