      "title": "My Naturally Curly Wedding Hair",
      "content": "Being able to wear my natural curls for my wedding was very important to me, but it was SO hard to fund images of curly wedding hair that was not curled with a curling iron. I really wanted to make a post with some images in case anyone is looking in the future!\n\nSome background: I was a bit disappointed with my hair trial. The HMU artist brushed through and re-curled each curl, which made my curls not only much looser, but they also did not hold for even an hour. I also think my hair did not like whatever hairspray was used. I don't have much experience having my hair styled so was not aware how this method would work on my hair until it was tried. No shade at all to the har stylist. My hair can be difficult... It's fine, low-density, doesn't behave like most curly hair, but also doesn't behave like non-curly hair. After agonizing a bit over it, I did some experimenting. I bought myself some CurlSmith hair spray which worked amazingly well on my hair. I bought a curling wand to match the width of my natural curls. I styled  my natural curls as I usually would (leave-in, curl cream, bowl method, plop 10-ish minutes, scrunch gently with microfiber towel, mousse, heat protectant, diffuse). I jazzed up any curls that didn't feel like cooperating with the curing wand. I did not brush or smooth them out, just re-wound them on the wand following the natural pattern and held for a couple seconds. I mocked up a very simple twist and sent her the pics. I asked her to let me style the curls myself, if needed she could re-curl pieces using the same method I did. Mostly she just needed to twist the front pieces and place the dried flower pins. I also asked her to use the hair spray I bought. She was super receptive and executed it so well on our wedding day. We recently got our professional photos back and looking through them I kept thinking \"damn, my curls look so good!\" for so many of the pictures! Long story short, I'm really happy I went with my gut and found a way to style my curls the way I wanted on our wedding day, and I am also so grateful for how flexible and understanding my stylist was.

I feel like this will greatly improve my mental health and my confidence in general. It almost sounds too good to be true, and now that's my concern.. what's the catch?\n\nI understand it needs regular maintenance and can cost a bit (\\~400$ for new installation and $30 for maintenance where I live). It's definitely worth it since it solves a major insecurity in my life, while the alternative is min/fin forever or go bald. I'm also an active person (heavy cardio 2-3 times a week, and gym 6 days) so that's a concern.\n\nHas anyone had any regrets getting into hair systems?\n\n  \nEdit: As most say, the psychological effect of wearing a \"wig\" is not my concern now as I hate my current hair / going bald and see this as a solution. Folks who using it over at the hair systems sub have all good things to say about it, and it seems to be the exact opposite here. Is it because folks here haven't tried it ever and have an already existing stigma around it?",

I haven't been happy with a wash day in a long time. The pictures I've included are in reverse chronological order.  Lately my curls have been feeling stretched out, misshapen, suuuper frizzy. My gel/mousse situation is leaving my hair feeling like straw after it's dry, and also way, way too dry. I'm just kind of at my wit's end. I've tried a good handful of products, am super for real in need of some new recommendations. I started using gel and mousse earlier this year, love the definition and hold, would really love for my hair to still feel soft afterwards though. I feel like my shine is gone too. I have low porosity, medium dense hair, completely virgin, no heat at all since shaving it.\n\nI tried prose a few years back and was really happy with it, couldn't afford to keep getting it. Since looking at the mega document on here and other people's experiences, it seems like it might not be worth a rebuy? \n\nI'm currently using innersense shampoo, conditioner and mousse, loma maximizing volume gel.  \nWash day's just include normal shampoo cleanse, conditioner sits while I do body stuff, scrunch in mousse/gel combo, let it dry, scrunch out. I've tried and failed with some refreshes in between, it usually just ends up in clips or braids before the next wash\n\nwould love product or routine recommendations, drug store or \"designer\", anything in between.
