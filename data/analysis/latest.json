For my routine, I typically use maui shampoo and conditioner (purple bottle) and style using miss jessies pillow soft curls, multicultural curls and the jelly soft curls, and later put in coconut oil and diffuse. However, this only lasts until the next day! I sleep with my hair in a silk bonnet and the next day it doesn't even look like I had just styled my hair, and my hair also gets frizzy within 2 hours after styling. My sister's hair lasts up to almost a whole week the way it is and her hair is so much curlier than mine. How can I improve this? Do I need to change the way I style my hair? Or the products? Please help! ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "I’ve had acne on and off since puberty started, but it’s never been as bad as this. During my junior year of high school, I basically had clear skin with the occasional pimple here and there until my ex and I broke up (oct 2024). Idk if that’s what caused it, but since then, my skin has been absolutely terrible, maybe from a lot of stress during that time?? Anyway, I’ve tried pretty much everything, and I consider myself to be very hygienic (washing pillowcases often, not touching face, etc), and I make sure to stay active and eat very clean. I literally avoid dairy and added sugars like the plague, and I go to bed at 10 pm. I try my best to manage stress by journaling since I am a college student and therefore always stressed, but I guess that could be a reason?? Ever since I started winter break, my face has been much better (less active pimples, more pie and whatnot) since I’ve been eating warm foods and reducing my protein intake (I ate too much during the semester in chase of gains). However, my neck has been an enigma, since nothing seems to affect it. I’ve left it alone for the most part, which seems to have helped, but I put spf on it yesterday and I got new pimples less than 12 hours later. I have gradually accepted my acne face, but my neck pisses me off because I know I’m supposed to keep my hair off of it, but I can’t put it up and then not put spf on it.\n\nAnyway, any help would be greatly appreciated. I feel really gross whenever I look in the mirror and it sucks even more since everyone at my uni seems to have perfect skin and can roll around in dirt and still not break out. It’s also worth noting that I currently have no insurance so I can’t see a derm and I can’t get rx meds or topicals. I’ve been to the derm multiple times in the past but nothing they told me actually helped much and my skin wasn’t at this level yet. My skin type is oily btw.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that I was using Differin and then I cooked my skin barrier bc I tried gradually building up to 5 days a week which was too much and yes I sandwiched. I then tried using the LRP Cicaplast baume b5 bc everyone said it was hg of barrier repair but it cooked my barrier even more so I just stripped back to the basics and stopped using any actives. I’ve been using this routine for about a month now and my barrier has definitely recovered so I am trying to restart soon. \n\nCurrent skincare routine:\n\nAM\n\n1.\t⁠La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser\n\n2.\t⁠Light layer of Vanicream Daily Moisturizer\n\n3. Haruharu black rice airyfit spf if i go out\n\nPM\n\n1. La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser\n\n2. Vanicream Daily Moisturizer",

What **needle depth** would you recommend for a scar like this, considering the nose area?\n2. What is a **safe and effective interval** between sessions?\n3. Based on your experience, what **percentage of visibility reduction** is realistically possible for an old, small chickenpox scar like this?\n4. Is it possible to make it **almost imperceptible**, or should expectations be more conservative?\n\nIn the photo it may not look very noticeable due to the lighting, but in very bright environments or outdoors under direct sunlight it becomes clearly visible, which really bothers me.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikxxh80fodcg1.png?width=939&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78571ba49453f757a84a43978ac56887d0918568\n\n",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

      "content": "For Christmas, my boyfriend got me all new skincare products. I had been researching for almost 3 months,s trying to find the best fit. What I have now is a problem. After putting on my new routine, my face feels tight and dry. My makeup does not sit well on my face. It sits on top of it rather than blending in. I have also noticed a lot of texture and my pores are huge even with primer on under my foundation. \n\nFor reference, my skin is very dry, more so in the winter. When I was researching, most of the products I had seen for daytime routines were gel. Maybe the gel is just not hydrating enough for me? I'm not sure what to replace it with. I had gone with inexpensive products that had really good reviews. I know one size doesn't fit all with makeup, but the fact that I hate all four products says a lot about my choices.  My nighttime routine is much heavier and I don't have any problems when waking up. \n\nThe List I had supplied and received:\n\nSerum- The Ordinary niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%\n\nMoisturizer- Peach and Lily gel moisturizer\n\nUnder eye- Good Molecules Yerba Mate Wake Up Eye Gel\n\nUnder eye brightener- Catrice Under eye brightener\n\nI also had reicved Elf Foundation but they don't have a shade light enough for my face. I'll look into CoverGirl. They have so many different shades that I should be able to find something. Any Advice on products that will make me hydrated and smooth will be greatly appreciated. ",

      "content": "For some reason Reddit won't let me post to r/wavyhair , but it seems like it's a sister sub to this one anyway, so I hope y'all will forgive me if my hair is considered wavy rather than curly (idk, it seems like there's a lot of disagreement about curls similar to mine in curly spaces lately).\n\nThis might be a bit of a novel so apologies in advance, and I'll try to organize it as best I can.\n\nI'm looking for **tips on quick and easy ways to work with short hair** (men's cut short, I generally present more or less as a guy) that's been cut wet as if it were straight -- how can I easily style it so that the curl looks intentional and enhanced instead of like I'm trying and failing to subdue it?\n\nI currently have basically shorn back and sides (scissor taper), and then on top in the front, everything on the long side of my side part was cut as one forelock. The overall effect is sort of 40s/50s/neo-Edwardian, like something you might see on a guy from the 90s Jeeves &amp; Wooster TV show.\n\nI've been to a couple of curl specialists before but never felt like it was really worth paying 3x as much as a barber, especially because when my spouse (not a professional hairstylist) cut my hair I was usually happier with the look. My spouse doesn't currently have time to cut my hair (due to illness in our social circle), so I recently tried a new semi-traditional barber, and it seems... fine, but I think I just need to figure out how to work around the result.\n\nI'm also looking for **recommendations for all-in-one silicone-free styling products** with a matte finish, that could help my hair curl more and clump better with less frizz without weighing it down, ideally can be used on soaking wet hair in the shower, and also will last 3-4 days between washes and still look presentable enough for webcam meetings.\n\nJust to make clear that I'm not breaking rule 2, I am \\*not\\* looking for scalp condition help. I have that handled with my routine as described below.\n\nI have hair I always thought was 3a when properly cared for -- big loose curls the diameter of sidewalk chalk or a bit bigger, but the curl pattern isn't an S, it comes full circle -- but I'm also seeing a lot of curly hair discussion labeling hair that looks like mine, with visible full circles that are just big and loose, as \"actually just 2c at most\" so I'm not really sure what type exactly my hair is. Not looking to be typed, I just figure that info may be useful when determining what products to recommend.\n\nLast I tested, porosity, elasticity, and texture/thickness were all medium, and density seems like it might be medium lately too. It was high density when I was younger but I've been on testosterone about a decade now and I'm nearing my 40s, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's thinner.\n\nMy current routine is as follows:\n\n* The day before wash day, I spritz my scalp with Briogeo Scalp Revival to help remove dandruff buildup. I use this because it's the cheapest non-shampoo salicylic acid scalp product I could find where the application process doesn't bug me.\n* Wash day: 2 sulfate-free shampoos.\n* First I use Grandpa's Soap pine tar shampoo and either immediately rinse out per package directions or maybe let it sit 30 seconds while I wash my face.\n* Second I use Vanicream pyrithione zinc shampoo and let it sit a few minutes while I apply skincare and wash my body, and maybe also while I shave if I don't feel like I need conditioner.\n* In the winter, I apply a little bit of Innersense daily hydrating conditioner and let it sit a few minutes while I shave. In the warmer/less dry parts of the year I feel like this leaves my hair weighed down, but I foolishly bought the big bottle many years ago and I refuse to throw it out until I've used it all up.\n* I rinse everything out and scrunch in styling products. I have used Max Green Alchemy styling gel with a little bit of the matte paste on top, usually with maybe a tsp of added neutral protein filler, and that was fine, but it was too many bottles for my limited shower space. Currently using Uncle Funky's Daughter Curl Stimulator, which has protein in it already, but I don't love the shiny finish and I feel like my flyaways still kind of give middle aged STEM professor who's never heard of the CG method and wouldn't give a fuck if they did.\n* Last, I wrap it up with a floursack towel so it doesn't drip everywhere while I do the rest of my morning routine. If I have enough length to do so, I plop. It stays like that maybe 10 minutes until I'm getting dressed, and then I take it off to let my hair air dry the rest of the way.",

When I was 16 I was prescribed 0.025% tretinon then after around 10ish months I went on 0.05%, it worked for abt a year then I started to break out crazy again! I went to my dermatologist and asked what can I do, she prescribed me sulfur face wash. I use it but I don’t notice a huge difference. I recently went to an acne specialist aesthetician. She recommended me the skincare line MIXI, it is a medical grade skincare brand. Before I was using la Roche posay for the longest time, I didn’t have much issues besides extra oil/greasy look. Anyway, so far I’ve been using mixi skincare since 11/14. She recommended that I stop tretinon since my skin barrier was damaged and it doesn’t have good long term effects. So I stopped for 2 weeks completely before adding any of the actives in the picture below. I honestly feel like this is the worst my skin has ever looked!! She claims it is just purging and I need to wait the long process. Help me!! Do I continue with this new skincare and trust the process or go back on tretinon or try accutane?!",

I even tried using a salicylic cleanser as a mask—putting a thin layer on my face for 10 minutes and then washing it off—but the bumps worsened, and my skin became dry.\nI also tried using Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo on my face thinking it might be fungal acne because I have dandruff, but the inflammation increased. I’m not really sure which products I should be using.\nCurrently, my routine includes:\nSimple Refreshing Face Wash\nSimple Hydrating Light Moisturizer\nCOSRX Aloe Sunscreen\nCOSRX Salicylic Cleanser (twice a week)\niUNIK Calendula Cleansing Oil (twice a week)\n(Note: I took the picture with my tablet, so it’s not very clear.

I’ve done a lot of treatments in the past and at this point I just want to find the best route no matter how much it costs. Looks like ice pick, rolling and box scars. The PIH doesn’t bother me as much rn and isn’t as much of a priority.\n\n—————\nI (F29) have had hormonal acne since I was about 21-22. It’s ebbed and flowed in severity and was semi-managed through diet in the last year but has recently flared up again. I have PCOS so I think anything stress or hormone related seems to trigger it… I used to get the perfect derma peel pretty regularly to manage PIH/actives but decided to save money and try to build a skincare routine at home that manages both. It seemed to work for a bit but recently have had some stressors that have caused flare ups. Feels like no matter what I do, my skin is so sensitive that one tiny move in the wrong direction kills all my progress.\n\nIn the second half of this year, I developed a lot of small closed comedones after a chemical peel. Over the months, I was able to get rid of a lot of them through adapalene and some other actives but they seem to return regardless especially around my jawline.  I’ve been reading online about how physical acne scarring = uneven skin surface = more clogged pores = comedones, aka a never ending cycle?\n\nDoes anyone have any experience/expertise with treatments that work for the type of physical scarring I have? I’m not an expert lol but I think I have the big 3 - ice pick, rolling and box car.\n\nI don’t want to do subcision, but I don’t know what my best option is especially given that my skin doesn’t really go through “calm” phases that would lend itself to microneedling. I’ve read about the halo laser - I did it once many years ago but not sure if I saw a huge difference and really don’t wanna waste money and time on things that aren’t going to help",

I’m 30 years old, male, and I have very rough hands because of my job. I work as a firefighter, and due to my passions—sports and working on cars (mechanical work)—my hands are very rough. They are always clean. I place great importance on keeping my hands hygienic and clean. Especially with regard to my girlfriend, I make sure my fingernails are always trimmed and clean, just like my toenails.\n\nWhen I compare my hands and fingers to those of other men, I have the feeling that my fingers simply don’t look very nice. On the sides, both left and right, there is noticeable callus, which is sometimes also palpable, and I would really like to change that.\n\nNevertheless, my fingers simply don’t look very nice. I think about this a lot and wonder what causes it and how I could change it. I have very rough hands, and of course my girlfriend can feel that too when I touch her. Thank you very much.\n\nHave a great weekend",

And now I literally have snow falling off my head everyday, it has gotten so bad. I need something moisturizing STAT! Also, for the last year or so (when I've mostly been using Aussie), I've noticed my ends have started to break really easily, and have been fighting split ends constantly. \n\nI know literally nothing about hair care and don't even know really how to start fixing this. I don't know the first thing about leave in conditioners, dry shampoo, gels, oils, whatever.

I know I need to protect it at night but idk how. I cannot braid even a little bit, I’ve tried and tried and tried so many tutorials!!!! After I wash and condition, my hair feels dry and the ends look awful, but they aren’t split. (Btw: I’m not married to my hair, I don’t hold on to length despite dead ends— I always tell my hair dresser to cut off what needs cut). My hair used to lay like this no matter the length, and feel rough to the touch, but then I got a wolf cut when my hair was shoulderish length, and it looked and felt great. It laid well with no heat products. Now I’m not sure if I need a more dramatic wolf cut since it’s longer, or if I need specific products. The pictures attached are after a wash and condition with leave in treatment as well. I just want it to not look dry or dead when air dried and to not lay like a rats nest without heat, or look oily/dead when curled or straightened. Ironically I don’t think the pictures are capturing the issues very well…..any recommendations would help!! If it needs chopped too then that’s what I’ll go with! ",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nLooking for some experienced opinions here.\n\nI started topical minoxidil 5% in June 2024. The recommended dose was 6 sprays morning + evening, but for practicality I only applied it once daily in the evening. Over the first year, I honestly saw very limited results.\n\nIn June 2025, I added oral finasteride while continuing topical minoxidil. Since then, the results have been very noticeable and I’m genuinely happy with where my hair is at now.\n\nBecause of that, I’m wondering whether I could eventually come off topical minoxidil. I find it uncomfortable, it makes my hair look dirty, and it’s the part of the routine I dislike the most.\n\nIf I did stop, I would obviously taper it very gradually over several months, not cold turkey, to reduce the risk of a shed / effluvium.\n\nHas anyone here successfully stopped minoxidil while staying on fin?\n\t\nIs it reasonable to assume that fin is now doing most of the heavy lifting, given that results only really appeared after starting it?\n\nWould really appreciate hearing from people who’ve tried this or understand the mechanisms better. Thanks!",
