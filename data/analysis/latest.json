It comes with an inner mesh cap that you place over the wet hair to hold curls in place, then apply the black blow-drying cap that connects to your hair dryer. I live in the Midwest where it is currently very cold, and traditional diffusing before work tends to result in bad frizz and a bad hair day overall. My curls do not like this cold winter weather because I prefer to air dry, but there is not enough time in the mornings. I cannot wash the night before because my hair gets mis-shapen  and smooshed down from my CPAP that I wear at night. I do wear a silk cap under the CPAP. I have to wash daily (morning)  due to oily fine hair.\nRoutine: L’Oreal ever pure moisture S/C, It’s-a -10 coily leave-in conditioner spray, Cake Curl Crush light hold gel. I finish with a gel/moose combo once 90% dry, for extra hold. My hair gets easily weighed down by too many or too heavy products.\nCaucasian, fine 3a/3B hair, length is just past shoulders, dishwater blonde with medium highlights.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Thet set also comes with two 3-clips.\n\nThe set was about $160 on sale from $200. The extensions are really lovely and fantastic quality. However, as much as I love the extensions, Bebonia gets a fail on convenience. I tried a different color initially and exchanged them for another. They charged me $30 to return! It's really hard to match your color on the first try, so that's kinda BS because it could take more tries. \n\nFor my routine, I use suave daily clarifying shampoo, 2 pumps each half of my head of aunt jackie frizz patrol mousse, generic bounce brush, and dyson dryer to set the curls. \n",

      "content": "I'm 20M and was hoping someone could give me advice on how to get rid of my acne. I've had pretty severe facial acne (mainly on me cheeks, I have a few spots and scars on my forehead but they're minimal and not super noticeable. I no longer have chest and back acne after some treatments) for a few years now. I've tried different things to get rid of it/manage it. I went to a private dermatologist and she gave me a skincare routine with her recommended face wash and moisturising cream. On top of that she gave me oral antibiotics along with two prescription creams (Finacea which had Azelaic acid, and Treclin which is a Vitamin A gel). The combination of those things seemed to work for a little, but when I stopped the course of antibiotics the acne just came back; the creams only helped reduce the severity of acne. Now that I've run out of the creams the acne has come back just as severe as before, if not worse. \nI've also tried some other things, like Norse Organics which I heard worked for some people (did nothing for me) and going vegan for a while (only made me lose weight). I feel like the only other treatment option for me is to get Roacutane, but that has some very bad potential side affects so I would like to try other things before I get on that. \nDoes anyone have any tips on how to get rid of my acne?

After a haircut in September, where my hair was sadly straightened,my curls started looking a lot looser and were not as nice looking. They started falling flat and limp, were frizzy and just looked way different than they used to. When they were straightened a heat protectant was used, however, I don’t know which one. I started using Rizos Curls Products after that haircut, which basically has no Protein as far as I know. So basically my hair wasn’t getting protein for almost 3 months straight. My hair dries different now and also feels different. I have no idea how to get them back.\n\nMy routine consisted of:\n\n\\- Shampoo and Conditioner by Jean&amp;Len\n\n\\- As I Am leave in classic\n\n\\- Rizos Curls Curl Defining Mousse\n\n\\- Rizos Curls Strong Hold gel\n\nI started with the leave in and raked that throughout my hair with my hands, just a quarter size. Then 3 pumps mousse, sometimes raked in sometimes scrunched. Then the gel, just a little bit also scrunched. After that I diffused and always slept with a bonnet.\n\nWhen I started researching why my hair was like this, I heard a lot about Protein, so I got the Rehab Salve from Curlsmith. I used this like 2 times now but it just looked better right after that but not long term. I’ve been trying for a month now to find the problem but I am clueless. I don’t know what to do and how to fix it and it’s really messing me up because I love my hair :(\n\nThe first 4 pics is my hair now using the same styling method, however, my curls look much looser now in my opinion.\n\nThe 5th and 6th pic is before the haircut, during that my hair was straightened and I wasn’t using any protein products. \n\nThe last two pics is my hair over a year ago where I was only using As I Am Long&amp;Luxe Curl Enhancing Smoothie.\n\nCould it be dead ends now that they grown out more? Is it the lack of protein over 3 months? Is it something else entirely? If you have any ideas please help me on how to fix this.\n\nThank you!",

I use the Come Clean shampoo, Knot Today conditioner (I use this as a co-wash between shampoos and also as a rinse-out/leave-in), and the Curling Custard gel.  I love this routine because it is free of proteins and heavy butters and oils, and because it is very simple - only three, CG-friendly, natural and versatile products, all from the same brand.  I also love that none of the products has a strong fragrance.\n\nI now live in Spain and will soon run out of the Kinky Curly products that I brought from the U.S.  Can anyone recommend a similar product line that is available in Spain?  Bonus points for products available in stores like Primor or Druni, but I will order online if necessary.

I went to a dermatologist for years, tried all the meds and even did 2 full rounds of accutane years ago. I remember my skin being dry but literally still having active breakouts. Nothing worked and I was told it was hormonal and there was nothing they could do. Now I am on birth control specifically for acne but have noticed no real difference.\n\n3 months ago I decided maybe I could try the dermatologist again. I went and she was suggesting accutane but thought we could try spirolactone first since accutane wasn't successful and it may be hormonal. She also gave me tretinoin .05%, azelaic acid, and clindamycin. My current routine is AM-wash tace with water, hypochlorous acid spray, clindamycin, Vanicream daily facial moisturizer. PM-double cleanse with prequel gleanser, alternate azelaic acid, rest, tret, rest, then the Vanicream again.\n\nI have noticed pretty much no difference since I started this routine and the medication. When I tried to increase tret usage my skin would get irritated and break out, and I don't think it was purging. I feel absolutely discouraged that I will have acne my entire life. It is so unfair to be a girl in college, and basically no girl has acne the way I do. If I want to feel even remotely pretty and put together I have to wear heavy makeup. I hate it and all I want is for my acne to go away, but even the end all be all of Accutane didn't work at all. What do I even do at this point?",
