If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

It wasn’t until early-mid quarantine that my hair started to curl, and even then, it was only after I shaved it. \n\nSome days my hair is straight and poofy, and other days my hair holds curls. Whenever I try and follow a wavy hair routine, the products make my hair straighter than if I just shampoo/condition and air dry. \n\nRight now I use Moroccanoil shampoo and Keune Care Karatin conditioner, sometimes a Keune hair mask if it feels dry. \n\nI’ve been dying my hair since 4th grade, which could definitely play a big part in the bipolar process. I’ve bleached my hair numerous times, but I end up with waves around a week or so after the initial bleaching. \n\nI’m not sure of my hair type or texture, but I do know that I have to knead water into my hair when I shower, otherwise it’ll drip off. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!!!

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Without changing that routine, my skin slowly started breaking out again.\n\nNow \\~5 months later, my skin has definitely seen better days. It fluctuates between very minor to mild acne, and changing my routine a few times hasn’t really helped. I went to a walk-in clinic for a derm referral, but they said it wasn’t severe enough and instead prescribed 3 months of apo-minocycline (I’m starting my 3rd month now). It’s helped somewhat, but not fully.\n\nI’m wondering if there’s anything I could improve or simplify in my routine.\n\nAM\n\n1. Avène Cleanance Gel Cleanser\n2. (Once every 3 days) MEDIPEEL Micro Tea Powder Cleanser\n3. Coxir Vita C Bright Toner\n4. Hyaluronic Acid serum (only if skin feels tight/dry)\n5. The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA\n6. Coxir Light Sunscreen SPF 50+\n\nPM\n\n1. Avène Cleanance Gel Cleanser\n2.

I used to use salicylic acid, but it low key caused chemical burns, so I was told to stop by a derm/cosmetologist. I was also on topical clindamycin, but my walk-in doctor discontinued it when starting minocycline.\n\nAny feedback or suggestions to the routine would be appreciated, I'm way out of my depth.",

My new manager is a woman, and she is very well dressed and does a full beat daily. She often makes comments about how important it is to “represent the business” or be “the face of the business” &amp;etc.  \n\nSoooooo I would like to start wearing more makeup to work again— but I cannot figure out how to wear mascara anymore 😅\n\nI feel like whenever I put on mascara, my eyes look droopy? Idk if it’s maybe because my eyelashes are too weak, and so they drop down despite curling them? Or if this is just an issue with my eye shape? Or maybe I need to try different mascara applicators? or formulas? Or abandon the mascara altogether and do something else to lift the eye?\n\nSoo If anyone has any mascara tips for weak lashes, be it product recommendations or application step recommendations— PLEASE help me out 😭😭\n\nMascaras I have tried:\n\n•Volume de chanel (waterproof and normal)\n\n•Maybelline great lash waterproof (actually not that bad looking but I would like more drama/volume)\n\n•Maybelline lash sensation \n\n•Maybelline scandal eyes (formula too wet for me)\n\n•Wet n wild mega lash waterproof \n\n•Diorshow (not enough drama but a surprisingly good formula if anyone is curious hehe)\n\n\\*\\*I have attached pictures of my eyes with Volume De Chanel waterproof Black. I feel like my eyelashes become droopy despite curling before AND after application. I feel like it’s especially noticeable when my face is resting (pic2) ☹️\n\nAny advice welcome 🤗 ",

I wanted wispy bangs and side pieces with a lotttt of layers. I even showed her the last picture so she knew what I meant by “layers in the back” I started with nearly waist length lightly layered hair. But I feel like I just got face framing layers leading to a U cut and it’s kind of shorter than I wanted. And she didn’t point cut so the ends are very blunt and when I asked for her to thin it a bit she said the layering does the thinning. But my hair is so thick it gets bottom heavy really easily and that’s a big issue I’m seeing with it after this. I tried styling it like the girl in the picture (not the ones of my hair, it’s just straightened in those) and it wasn’t the same. I’m just really frustrated because I spent $80 on this haircut and went to an alternative stylist like people recommend and in my opinion it’s nothing like I wanted :(. It is cute just not what I wanted. Does anyone have any tips I can follow to just cut my hair myself to get to this? Is it too short for it now? I guess I can try again next year after it grows out but I need a tutorial link or something lol.",

It seems my hair will curl but then it seems extra fluffy at the bottom and I would rather have more volume towards the front of my face and I top and how do I get the back of my head to curl more like the front?? Also - how in thr world do people get their hair to last longer than a day without loads of hairspray??? I resisted the urge and did NOT use hairspray today but the last two photo are now hair after only 8 hours and I was forced to pull up the front cause it was losing volume at the frontz\n\n\nMy routine: I use a suave shampoo and conditioner. This was a morning wash and I used the suave clarifying shampoo and basic suave conditioner. Then I put it up with a cotton tshirt for a few minutes. Then I put in tresemme extra strength (number 6) gel. I did it section by section and then brushed it with a wide tooth comb. I diffused it upside down, on the roots, moved the diffuser. I diffused it till about 80-90 dry and let the rest air dry and then I did SOTC with a bit of oil in my hands. The front looks decent, though usually by mid day I feel the back will be extra frizzy or fluffy and lose some curl- it def doesn’t stay for days like some people.\n\nSo my question is - how do I get more volume and/or face shaping to my hair and the back so it actually looks curly all around? Do I need layers? What kind of cut? Change my routine any??  How do I make my back not too boxy?",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I have naturally wavy hair, and no matter what I do, it always ends up feeling extremely dry. I do take care of it and use products consistently, but nothing seems to help long term. I also do get my waves but they feel dry after the next day. Fyi I’m only 16.\n\nI rarely use heat maybe five times this entire year and even when I blow dry or air dry, my hair still feels dry and rough. I know it’s not just bad technique. Lately, my hair has gotten noticeably drier, and I’m also worried because I feel like I’m losing more hair than usual.\n\nI’ve been trying to eat a balanced diet and take my vitamins, but I still don’t know how to fix the dryness or promote healthier hair growth. Dry hair definitely runs in my family, so I know genetics play a role, but my hair didn’t used to be this bad.\n\nThe only time my hair looked truly healthy and moisturized was right after I cut it last year. It looked great for a short time, and then suddenly it went back to being dry again almost overnight. Now it looks dry every single day no matter what.I lived in Pakistan for a year and the humidity and water I'm not sure what made my hair thick and amazing as you can see in the last two images!\n\nFor reference my hair has never been dyed, I’ve never done chemical treatments, I use a regular shampoo for wavy hair sometimes Ouai shampoo, and I use the Ouai leave in conditioner. I’ve tried deep masks and fine hair products, but they haven’t really helped.\n\nI just want healthy moisturized hair again and tips on how to grow it without losing so much. If anyone has advice routines or product recommendations especially for genetically dry wavy hair I would really appreciate it. Thank you! also the pictures are my hair before a year back in fact when I was living in Pakistan for a year.",

I haven’t washed my face consistently like ever. Whenever I do wash my face, no matter what product I use, I get normal white heads and black heads as well as weird huge pimples that don’t have a head. Like big lumps on my face that don’t have a head, and I usually take a (sterilized) sewing needle to the so they can develop a head. These acne lumps vary in size but usually end up the size of a dime. They don’t leave scars, maybe just some short term discoloration when they finally go away.\n\nAt this point I’m desperate for any tips to fix this, because my face is super oily if I don’t wash it, but when I do I get these lumps and acne. I’ve used various face soaps,  cetafil (can’t figure out how to spell that right), some peach one with mountains on it, plain cvs soaps, even just body soaps, the list goes on. I can’t figure out what’s going on so any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAttached is an image of one of the lumps a few days after disappearing.",

      "content": "Hi! Im a 32 y/o F, my natural hair is always been curly over the years growing up in the 2000s I took a flat iron into it one too many times.. as I got older I still really didn’t like my curly hair because I live in Florida with the most extreme humidity so anytime I wore it curly it is a frizzy mess. Flash forward to being an adult- discovering the shark air wrap dryer is how I typically will “blow my hair out” a couple times a week or I put curl products in it (usually lately!). I like my curly hair but the current state it’s in is a freaking wreck and I’m not sure which way to go. Gloss, dye dark, highlight, any other suggestions?,etc. Overall, I wish my hair was straight and dark, but I can’t figure out what my options are. The first couple photos are taken tonight out of the shower air dried. \nBelow are my issues: \n1. My first problem is that doing my hair daily because it’s curly and straight is a lot of work. I have always struggled to wash my hair after workout  because I don’t want my curly hair to lose moisture often and also redoing my blowout becomes exhausting. Also I find going to bed with curly hair and wake up a complete mess and having to redo it in the morning such as adding water &amp; re adding products. Yes, I use a silk pillow and a bonnet in my hair still looks literally cracked out in the morning. \n2. Now that I’m 32 I have horrible gray hairs as pictured. My natural hair is dark dark brown. I have been seeing the same stylist for 4+ years for highlights and toning, and root dyes. She’s amazing! But she was on mat leave This is the most grown out it’s ever been, but I’m pretty much desperate and depressed at what to do at this point for color. I really want to go back to dark, but the problem is my grays stick out like a sore thumb after 2 weeks. I am considering highlights again, but I also don’t want to kill my hair off. The growth of my bangs are damaged. \n3. I have seen Gray blending, but I’m really not interested in it as I would have to lift my other hair &amp; damage it and I have a very young appearance so having gray hair I think wouldn’t really look good on me. But it’s definitely something I would consider when I’m older! \n4. My stylist has talked to me before about gloss and keratin but once again I’m not sure if this will damage the curl ? I feel like I already spent so many X amount of years damaging it that like I’m really trying to be in a regrowth process. I haven’t gotten in Highlights  since July 2024..\n5. Attached is some photos of what my hair looks like when I blow it out and when it was darker (but I had less grey), and  live in Florida and summertime blowouts are just a waste of my time because my hair automatically starts curling again outside - see photo. My “Straight” hair ends up being greasy for days because I’m trying to save the blowout.. or flat as shit with no volume.\n6. Lastly, I’m just open to any suggestions that anyone knows of or would think would look great with my hair style TIA! \n",

And just general advice on skincare products I should use/ any changes I can make.\n\nMy skin is usually oily, I have what I think are closed comodones and a LOT of clogged pores, it’s usually not very visible bumps but when I squeeze my skin, gunk comes out. Have acne prone skin that’s not sensetive.\n\nThe products I use are in the pictures,\n\n\\-night time: cleanse with either centella or cerave, centella serum, differin every second day and bha by anua once a week, moisturize\n\n\\-morning: cleanse, serum, moisturizer, sunscreen\n\n\\-makeup removed with micellar water\n\nAfter 5 months my clogged skin hasn’t changed but I think I get less active pimples.",

I want to clean them all out and recycle them but I wanted to know if there were any rewards based recycling programs I could give them to. I plan to start collecting my empty products every month to recycle those too!\n\nI know I should recycle them even without the incentive but I’m not going to lie, it would still be nice. I plan to recycle them anyway even if I don’t find anything.\n\nThis is what I have found so far (just so people don’t suggest things I already found)\n\n• Pact - has a lot of locations, accepts a wide range of stuff, and seems reputable, but no rewards. (I think I will recycle here if I can’t find anything else)\n\n• Terracycle - Originally wanted to recycle with them because they said you can earn points towards charity which I really liked (I would rather donate to charity than get the points myself) BUT I heard it’s really scammy and does a lot of greenwashing\n\n• Credo - gives you store points for any empties but I don’t shop at Credo so that would be useless lol\n\n• Lush - only accepts lush products for points/a free mask I think? But I don’t shop at Lush either lol\n\n• Literally any store that only accepts their own products for points or rewards. - I don’t buy enough of one single brand to justify it\n\n• Boots - This seems like the kind of program I am looking for. They accept a wide range of empties for points BUT they’re UK based. I also found similar companies in Australia but nothing like this in the US.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Like I said, I’m still recycling them regardless, I just want to see if there’s any nice programs out there first.",
