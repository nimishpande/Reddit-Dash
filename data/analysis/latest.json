I've been using the cosrx snail mucin for quite some time, probably finished 4 or 5 bottles but honestly, I didn’t see much improvement. I just kept using it without any real reason.Recently, I read about using glycerin on the skin and decided to give it a try and my skin loved it!\n\nBought the atomiser from Blinkit and got glycerin and distilled water from a local pharmacy. Glycerin needs to be diluted, otherwise it can make your skin feel even drier. I diluted it in about 1:8 ratio (glycerin : distilled water)\n\nThe glycerin bottle cost me around 50, and the distilled water packets were rs.3 each. I spray it on my face when it’s slightly damp after cleansing, then follow up with a moisturizer. I’ve been loving it lately, it’s super hydrating and very budget friendly!",

Every morning I put on sunscreen and moisturizer and every night I wash my face and do my routine that I got from a dermatologist. \n\nRecently I noticed that I had wrinkles under my eyes. I talked to my mom about them and she said that they could be tired lines and that they would go away. It would make sense as I’ve been working ) day weeks for the last two months. The thing is though it’s been a week and they haven’t gone away. \n\nI want to age with grace, but half of the reason I do skincare is want to postpone again for as long as I can lol.

Let me know what you think or if products contradict with each other. I’ll put links below! \n\nLittle bit of background : I do believe I have a weakened barrier from trying to fix a menstrual / hormonal breakout a few months ago and am currently on 50MG spironolactone and plan to go up to 100 next week. it’s been a month and my skin is slightly improving or atleast preventing more breakouts while the old ones heal, but I’m having trouble lightening the spots. I only recently started having that problem where even tiny pimples with a head and untouched will still leave a dark spot. I believe I have some PIE from what I can see. The first selfie is my initial breakout around end of July, the second one is my skin currently. When I had clear skin I was using (and still am) cetaphils daily cleanser, dermologicas rice microfoliant 3x a week, and Sephoras brands mineral SPF 30 but recently switched to Beyond Angel Aqua moisturizer incase the shea butter in the Sephora brand sunscreen was contributing to my acne. \n\nLinks to new skincare products : \n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/ginger-melt-oil-cleanser-pimprod2030963?sku=2592879\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/power-calm-hydrating-gel-cleanser-pimprod2004468?sku=2541744\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/rice-70-glow-milky-toner-pimprod2048932?sku=2634193\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/redness-relief-azelaic-acid-serum-pimprod2033306?sku=2597522\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/zero-cast-moisturizing-finish-sunscreen-pimprod2052428?sku=2641345\n\n",

As far as I understand, silicone somewhat smooths/seals the cuticle and forms a protective layer which would make it harder for other things to penetrate to the hair.\nSo is there any benefit (esp hair health benefit) on applying a non-silicone containing hair oil after a silicone containing leave-in and styler?",

I also noticed I don't really think about my hair anymore, I was going crazy for like 2 years before that and was very self-conscious but that kinda disappeared, not sure if it's because of actual progress or just because \"I'm doing what I can\".\n\nI've been using fin 1mg for a year now pretty consistently (M/W/F) and minox 5% on and off because I'm lazy",

      "content": "For a little context, I had pin straight hair from out of the womb til around 30. For different occasions (prom, weddings, etc) professionnals tried to curl my hair to no avail. No matter the work, technique or product, 30 min later it was back to straight, not even a wave in sight. Then a few years ago my endo quickly got a whole lot worst and my hormones have been all over the place ever since. Which is what I suspect caused a change in my hair. \n\nI’ve seen then noticed loose waves forming when my hair is wet and even some random curls curls in the back of the my head. But I continued to treat them as fully straight and brushed when wet (and dry), mostly air dry and wore it in tight messy buns. My hair gets super frizzy and they never look good when not tied up. \n\nSo today I tried this routine (in order):\n\n- Washing the roots (Marc Anthony strictly curls shampoo)\n- Conditioning the ends (MA strictly curls conditionner)\n- Brushing (head down with curl defining brush)\n- Curl creme on dripping wet, scrunch (MA curl defining lotion)\n- Gel on dripping wet, scrunch (MA flex gel)\n- Scrunch some more with my hands\n\n\nAt this point they were very wavy / some curls\n\n- Plopping for about 20 min with a non textured microfiber towel\n\nAt this point they were looser waves with one side wavier than the other lol. (Photo 1)\n\n- Air dry\n- Scrunch to break cast\n\nOther photos. \n\nAnd now about 7h later they’re even looser. There’s still some wave pattern on the bottom but eh. \n\nErrors I might have made : \n\n- Too much cream\n- Not enough gel / Not well distributed\n- Touching my hair too soon because I had the impression it had fully dried but I don’t think it was\n\nHaving had straight hair all my life I kinda feel like an imposter that’s just trying to force it and feel like an idiot. So all this to say, is this normal day 1? Are these waves in need to be defined over time? Or am I just seeing things and my wavy wet hair means absolutely nothing? Thanks yall. &lt;3\n\n",
