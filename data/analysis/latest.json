      "content": "Now on the presumably \"tail end\" of my logarithmic reaction to my hair routine. Here's my stack and some commonly asked questions from my updates a quarter ago.\n\nRoutine:\n\n- .3% Finasteride, 6% Minoxidil topical combination. Applied originally via four .25ml sprays. Moved to a dropper bottle at month 4. Applied nightly 6x per week right before bed, have only missed 2 nights total.\n- Dermastamp (microneedle) 1mm once weekly before bed. Temples and scalp. I skip the topical on this night. \n- Keta shampoo, normal concentration, 3 mins on scalp once or twice a week.\n\nOther Considerations people asked about (probably didn't have much of a hair-effect):\n\n- I religiously take a multivitamin, fish oil, magnesium glycinate, and 5g of creatine daily.\n- I lift 4x weekly and play team sports once or twice weekly.\n- I sleep 8.5 hrs per night consistently.\n- I drink socially most weekends. In the back half of my 20s.\n- I am not sponsored, so I will not provide the brand name of the topical. It is safe to assume that it is the largest US men's hair regrowth company.\n- Receded lightly through college then thinned consistently for a year before deciding to do something about it.\n\nI have had zero side effects. None whatsoever. I know that is individual to myself but no need to ask in the comments, I promise I don't miss issues with my body when they arise.\n\nHappy to answer any remaining Qs or take any advice for further temple regrowth!\n",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Lately my pores(or blackheads?) have become really horrible, used to be just on my nose but now it’s also chin, forehead and cheeks. My skin is oily on my T-zone but the rest is pretty dry and flaky, which is lately causing lots of issues if I am wearing makeup.\n\nI am currently using the medicube zero pore 1day serum, b-bomb (niacinamide &amp; B12) from Geek&amp;gorgeous, hyaluronic acid from the ordinary and Neutrogena hydroboost water gel. Occasionally I use retinol from cerave, vitamin C from Geek&amp;gorgeous and Copper peptides from The Ordinary. Three times a week I use red light mask.\n\nI’m not sure if any of the products can be worsening my pores since I feel like this is the worst they have ever been plus I get a lot of what I think is clogged pores or pimples but they are just skin colored and never get red or become whiteheads. Noticed I get some milia under my eyes or on my cheeks as well lately. I do not use the b-bomb every day as I feel like it does have a tendency to cause some dryness so I use it occasionally or just as spot treatment on any pimples. For cleansing I use Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and micellar water. My skin is pretty sensitive.\n\nI have considered trying Curology as one of my friends recommended it, but I don’t really trust that they make it actually custom plus feel like they would try to give me more and more expensive things just to make money. Anyone have experience with that?\n\nThank you for any advice!",

I’ve always had those little dots everywhere though. I’ve never really known much about skincare because when I was on birth control my skin was flawless with no work, but I wanna fix the root issue rather than just taking the pill again. \n\nRight now I use Vanicream gentle facial cleanser usually just at night or whenever I shower, and then I moisturize with laroche posay moisturizer. I am sure there is something I could add or a better product I could use but I am completely at a loss! Any recommendations would be appreciated. :)",

My acne is still better than it was, but I feel like i should have seen more progress with this routine by now. I'm not sure if I need to switch up my all my products, or if I just need to add an extra step. I have been thinking about trying azelaic acid. (And I know I should be using a sunscreen.)\n\nMy skin is oily, sensitive, and easily irritated. It's hard to find things that don't burn me or overly dry me out. It's become so dry lately that even the thick moisturizing cream doesn't feel like enough.\n\nI know the deep scars need professional intervention. I can live with them for now. I'm wondering if there's more I can do at home for the persistent closed comedones, blackheads, and hyperpigmentation. And I can't tell if the situation on my chin is sebaceous filaments or comedones.\n\nI was prescribed tretinoin in my teens, but it burned my skin really bad even at the lowest percentage. I tolerated retinol better, but had to stop after becoming pregnant and didn't get to see how I tolerated it long term. PanOxyl dried me out so bad.
