Any recommendations?\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone with similar skin type 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "content": "I’m starting to believe that spicy foods are correlated with the potentiality for maintaining hair. Hear me out: I’ve observed that men from countries with higher contents of spice in their cuisine generally have thicker, more fuller hair deeper into their 30’s+. For example, I’m from Pakistan, and you’ll likely see a full head of hair across the country, from the rich to the poor, from the young to the middle aged. Of course, there’s always the “balding gene”, but compared to other countries, not even close. Same with South American counties, and more, I’m sure. \n\nI believe a reason for this is because of the high spicy content in the cuisines. We know that blood flow is important for keeping pores active and open, and spicy food directly results in blood flowing through the head. Every time I eat really spicy, for example, I feel a strong rush of blood through my temples and on top of my head. Yet, I stopped eating spicy food in my teens, mostly because of stomach issues. My father still has a full head of hair into his 60’s, and his hairline is immaculate. He loves spicy food and eats it often. I’ve resorted to using min/fin for my temples. Of course, my mother’s side is also prone to balding, but her side also did not eat many spices growing up.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you think a high spicy content can sustain blood flow to the scalp? In the least, it should help with maintaining longer, no? \n\nNot saying a lack of spicy foods results in hair loss, but that a high intake of spice may encourage blood flow to the scalp, and thus maintain hair density longer.

I’ve been trying to achieve a wet hair look for ages, but I still haven’t got it.\n\nPics 1-2 show how my hair looks right after a shower or the beach (no products)—it’s legit perfect. The issue is, once it dries, it turns into pics 4-6, which isn’t bad, but not what I want.\n\nIdeally, I’d love it to look like pic 3 (Neymar style). I’m a total noob at styling curly hair, so I don’t know how to get there.\n\nOn products: Most I’ve tried (leave-in conditioner, gel, curl cream) make my hair too curly and don’t keep that straight, wet vibe from pics 1-2. They tangle my curls more and turn it coily, like a lil fro.\n\nMy routine: Wash 4 times a week (after sports), then air dry. Shampoo once, conditioner every other time. No real products except a bit of oil sometimes or sea salt spray. I sleep with a bonnet and silk pillowcase.\n\nSorry for the essay, but if anyone has recommendations, I’d really appreciate it ✌🏽 (Also if anyone knows what hair type I have that'd be much appreciated!!)",

My routine is:\n\nI only wash my hair maybe every 2 or 3 days, Im using at the moment for shampoo the Tresemmé Replenish &amp; Cleanse, for conditioner i’m using a Garnier reconstructing conditioner for damaged hair and after shower I use the cantu leave in conditioner repair cream. I only air dry my hair never used diffuser or hair dryer. And then during the days where I don’t wash my hair I just use and style it with the same cantu conditioner. I think that’s my refresh routine on the days I don’t wash my hair.\n\nI’m open for shampoo suggestions and conditioners too!\n\nthe first 2 pics are after shower after wash and applying the cantu leave in conditioner, the last 2 pics is after waking up. (i use a bonnet but most of the times to protect my hair but it just comes off during the night) 😅\n\nAny advise would be greatly appreciated!!! ",

Looking for a moisturiser to use here, please suggest the best one.\n\nResults-\n\nCleanser: i’ve been using for about 6-7 months now and i dont know if it works but i have noticed that oil production has reduced in my T-zone. It has never broken my skin out or anything harsh like that so I’ll probably repurchase it and continue using it.\n\nSunscreen: Been using this since the start of summer this year so around March, and I quite like it. Again I honestly don’t know if it’s doing anything because I have fair skin with redness on my cheeks 😭. But I haven’t tanned so i guess it’s working? It’s light-weight, blends into my skin quick, no white-cast, and the texture is thin, not thick at all, hasn’t caused any breakouts so I have recently repurchased it and will continue using it.\n\nToner: Just bought it a week ago, no clue if it’s working or not, hasn’t caused a breakout, let’s see if it reduces pores as it claims. Will update in the comments if I notice improvements.\n\nSerum: Definitely noticed a difference from the first week itself, I used 5% for like 6 months and it hardly did anything so I started using 10%, I can see the redness reducing and other people have noticed it too so i’ll keep using this one.\n\nTLDR: Sharing my review of these 4 products &amp; Requesting y’all to drop some advice/comments about my routine, what other serums I can try to reduce redness and acne scars, and please suggest a good moisturiser for my skin type.",

      "content": "Hi! I started following the curly girl method in June and to this day I’m still trying to find the best products that work well with my hair. I think my hair is wavy but I think it does get curly (?) depending on the routine I follow. \n\nI have low porosity, more coarse than fine hair that is thick. I’ve dyed and bleached my hair multiple times in the past 3 years but had 2 big chops before starting CGM. All the hair on my head is healthy hair. \n\nI need help with damn roots. It’s always straight no matter what I do and it ends up looking so awkward. Please help!\n\nHere’s my routine for Day 1:\n\n1. Shampoo and conditioner every 2-4 days with Love Beauty and Planet’s shampoo and conditioner, and twice a month I use ACURE’s clarifying shampoo and use the Tsubaki hair mask after, and I leave my hair sopping wet\n\n2. Section my hair into 2 parts and comb through using a wide tooth comb, I keep my hair parted into 2 and style with my head bent down from here onwards\n\n3. Scrunch out excess water and add in Aussie’s Instant Freeze Gel using the praying hands method and scrunch afterwards\n\n4. Hover diffuse for 3 mins for the gel cast to form. I diffuse on low heat and speed for around 5 mins and add in Aussie’s Curl Refresher and continue diffusing until 80-100% dry\n\nFrom Day 2 onwards, I dampen my hair with water (maybe around 50% wet) and add Aussie’s Curl Refresher. I diffuse to dry. Results are the photos attached. I used to add in gel for day 2+ routines but it ends up weighing my hair down so my current routine is what I think my hair looks best in. \n\nI’ve noticed my hair loves gel and mousse as I’m looking for definition rather than volume since my hair is thick anyway. I have Cantu’s Wave Whip Curling Mousse on the way and want to incorporate it into my Day 1 routine. \n\nAlso, please excuse my English!! It’s not my native language 🥹",

I’d really appreciate some guidance from people who’ve actually been through this.\n\nShort background:\nGrowing up, I didn’t really take care of my skin — lots of sun exposure, stress, and inconsistent habits. Over time, my face became darker and uneven compared to my hands/legs, which still look closer to my original skin tone.\nNow I’m fixing things slowly and properly.\n\n(I’m also posting a leg photo for reference so you can see the tone difference.)\n\nCurrent routine (doctor recommended):\n\nGentle face wash\n\nBrightening / depigmentation serum\n\nBarrier-repair moisturizer\n\nSunscreen (this is where I need help)\n\n\nMy skin type:\nNormal to sensitive. Not naturally oily, but some products make my skin look shiny.\n\nMain question (sunscreen):\nWhich would be better for my skin?\n\n1. La Shield Lite SPF 40+ PA+++\n\n\n2. La Shield Fisico Matte Gel\n\n\n\nI’ve read mixed reviews. I even saw one girl mention that she experienced white cast, which made me a bit confused. Since sunscreen is something I’ll use daily, I want to choose carefully.\n\nAlso asking for advice 🙏:\n\nHow can I gradually get back my original skin tone (face matching body)?\n\nAny habits, ingredients, or mistakes I should be careful about?\n\nAnything you personally did that actually worked long-term?\n\n\nGoal:\nHealthy, even-toned skin nothing extreme, just consistency and patience ✨\n\nThank you so much for reading. I’d really value your honest experiences 💛\n",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "Hello hair gurus, I posted this request on some chronic illness subs, but figured I should come to the source of hair knowledge and see what anyone here has to suggest as well! My physical limitations are key in selecting a new hair dryer, but it would be nice to have a less frizzy/ more manageable result as well. \n\nBACKGROUND/ PHYSICAL LIMITS\n\nI need to dry my hair because I have craniocervical instability and any bonus weight (such as wet hair) on my head exacerbates my symptoms. I keep my hair shoulder length because any longer is too heavy and any shorter, outside of a buzz cut, requires more maitnence/ styling than I’m willing or able to do. \n\nI have both POTS and hEDS, my shoulders easily sublux and I have to be very careful with how much time I spend with my arms raised and heat being applied to my head/ neck. \n\nHAIR TYPE\n\nI have fine curly/ wavy hair that I used to describe as thick, but due to recent health issues a good amount has fallen out and I’d put myself in the average spectrum now with some thicker areas on the top of my head and thinner wedge shaped patches with a few bald patches on either side of my head. \n\nOLD HAIRDRYER\n\nMy last hair dryer was a travel model because it was the lightest weight option I could find, I then purchased a universal diffuser to add to the end which effectively doubled the size and weight. So, questionable overall strategy there. I use a diffuser because it’s less direct heat for my POTS and the most efficient way to get a rough dry on my hair and make the weight tolerable. It also works well for my hair-type. \n\nNEW HAIRDRYER SPECS?\n\nIdeally, I am looking for a hairdryer that is lightweight, ergonomic, has lower heat settings, and has a diffuser attachment (I never use any other kinds, so I don’t care about concentrators or fancy brushes). Ideally, a cool shot would be nice because that might help cool down my neck when I start getting dizzy from heat, but as long as a relatively low heat setting is available I think I should be okay. My old travel hair dryer that just died only had a low and a high heat setting and I made that work. (Although the frizz was very present, less of that would be nice.)\n\nAlso, I’ve heard of the inflatable hoods, but those looked very hot for my POTS. Has anyone actually tried these? Bonus question — has anyone had luck with using any kind of small stand with their hairdryer for hands free drying? I have a small shared bathroom, so it would need to be easily collapsed/ moved but that’s an adaptation I’ve considered researching/ exploring. \n\nThank you in advance! ",
