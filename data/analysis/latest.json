      "content": "I’m reaching out for some advice. Lately, I’ve noticed that my hair isn’t curling as well as it used to, even though I’m using the same products and have the same routine (gel or foam). I go to a hairdresser who specializes in curly hair.\n\nNow I’m confused because I’m not sure whether my hair just doesn’t curl the same way anymore, or if it’s simply too long (although I’ve had long hair before, and it used to curl better) or it’s not cut correctly. \n\nI’ve always had the issue that the bottom layer of my hair hardly curls at all – it’s more wavy than curly. When I get a layered haircut, that bottom part tends to stick out, making the difference between the curly and wavy sections even more noticeable. This is why I don't like very layered cuts. When my hair is shorter, the curls are more defined, but the bottom layer still stays wavier.\n\nI don’t know what would be best – to change my hairdresser, cut my hair shorter, change my routine or just accept that my hair doesn’t curl the way it used to or something else?\n\nEdit: my routine: I change shampoo and conditioner a lot, I brush my hair in the shower and then apply Tootilab Styling gel and then in between drying it with a diffuser a spray PoulMitchell Sculpting Spray. As somebody mentioned - I indeed started with new medication (oral contraceptive) two years ago. I was also thinking this could be a reason why my hair curls less (when I was a kid I had completely straight hair, they started curlying in puberty- so maybe hormonal changes does affect my hair a lot).

I’ve been off dut for 3 months and I can tell you it was probably the worst decision I’ve ever made. DO NOT DO IT, I DID IT SO YALL DONT HAVE TO.\n\nI’m starting to realize I didn’t even know what a real shed is I’m genuinely losing like 200 hairs a day now almost diffuse thinning. The worst part is my scalp environment has harshly shifted to extreme dandruff and inflammation. I’ve been using selsun blue once a week which has helped a lot but I’m also hesitant to consistently use it because I hear it can cause hairloss. Not to mention the side effects from getting off of dutastride are INSANE I’ve never had sides from any hairloss meds until getting of dut. Luckily I’m level headed because the depression, ED and brain fog are so real be careful with this stuff guys.\n\nSo now I must ask where to do from here? Do I gun it back to dutastride daily asap or slowly get back on it? Sorry for doubting the dutastride fan club it was always dutastride. Feel free to ask me any questions about switching. \n\nEDIT: what are the odds after this shed I get some regrowth??",

      "content": "Hi! I'm a 26 M and I just started using Anua's AA serum about a month and a half ago. Since then I noticed way more acne production (some cystic some regular) than before. I've been getting them mostly in the T zone (forehead and upper lip area) with the occasional ones on my upper cheekbones. This is where I would usually get acne before too. I'm wondering if this is just regular purging from using AA or if it's something else like a damaged skin barrier.\n\nMy routine has been:\n\nAM\n\n* Cleanse\n   * ROUND AROUND Comfort Green Tea Purifying Cleansing Foam\n* Shave\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Shaving Cleansing Foam\n* Treatment/Actives\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Toner\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Ampoule\n   * Anua 10% AA\n* Moisturize\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Sunscreen\n\nPM\n\n* Double cleanse\n   * Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil\n   * MEDI-PEEL Red Lacto Collagen Clear Cleanser\n* Treatment/Actives\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Toner\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Ampoule\n   * Paula's Choice 2% BHA (alternating days)\n   * Cerave Resurfacing Retinol Serum (alternating days)\n* Moisturize\n   * Round Lab Dokdo 1025 Lotion\n   * Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream\n\nMisc.\n\n* Try to change sheets and pillow cover every other week if not every week\n* Change out bath towel every few days\n* Separate towel for drying face\n\nAs you can tell I'm a big fan of Round Lab products 😆 is there anything in my routine that sticks out as problematic? These breakouts really only began once I started using the AA product so I'm wondering if it's just purging and I should stick it out for longer but the acne only seems to be getting worse which is concerning... Should I focus on just cleansing and moisturizing for a week to let my skin recover and then try to reintroduce actives again?\n\nI've also been suspicious of my shaving routine since a lot of my breakouts seem to be happening in that area but that wouldn't explain the forehead stuff.\n\nWould love any insight/advice. Thanks!",

It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful.

      "content": "Hi everyone! I am a college student who is looking for hair advice. I lost my hair due to\nchemotherapy in high school and am growing it back. I currently have hair extensions and my real hair is probably about a pixie cut. \n\nFor a while, i’ve wanted to color my hair darker. I finally took the step to do this last week. My hair stylist dyed my real hair and hair extensions very dark. The issue is, after one wash (using color safe shampoo) my natural hair lost a lot of the color and lightened up a lot, while my hair extensions stayed dark. It’s creating an ombré look. \n\nI was really disappointed by this outcome because I spent around $600 in one day on getting my hair extensions moved up then getting my hair dyed. I texted my stylist to see if there was something she could do to help with the lightning effect of my hair. She offered me a treatment that can help detox the hair in hopes that the color sticks better next time. This treatment is fairly expensive along with getting more color which is also pretty expensive, considering I am a college student and I just spent a lot on my hair. \n\nI am troubled because I really love my stylist and she has the most knowledge on hair extensions that I have, and I don’t want to ruin my real hair nor extensions by going somewhere else. However, I really wish there was some grace with pricing since my previous round did not work. I understand that i’m paying for her service and knowledge though so that’s not really my problem. \n\nI just can’t decide what to do. She also said I could box dye my hair, even though she doesn’t recommend it, if I want to be cheaper. The other thing is the detox treatment isn’t a 100% guarantee that it will help, and if it doesn’t we would have to just change the formula completely. I want to see if anyone has any advice or experienced something similar? ",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m hoping to get some advice about my hair routine because I’m not sure if I’m using the right products or if my routine needs to change. I started with separate products like the Mark Anthony Strictly Curls leave-in, curl cream, and mousse. Recently, I decided to try something new, so I bought the yellow Skala product to see if it would work better.\n\nMy hair type is 2C/3A and very long, but every routine I try ends up with frizz and barely lasts two days. All I want is definition and absolutely no volume. Here’s my current routine: I start by wetting my hair completely and brushing it through. I then separate my hair into sections. I start with the crown because I want it to stay gelled down. The two front pieces are separated into about three smaller sections each since that’s how I usually wear my hair. The back is separated into just two horizontal sections because it’s very heavy and hard to manage.\n\nFor each section, I apply the yellow Skala product and brush it out, then I add Eco Styler gel and use a bounce curl brush. I’ve been thinking about maybe trying gel first, then mousse, then brushing, but I’m not sure if that would help. After finishing the front sections, I move to the back sections, which are harder to style and don’t hold curls well. Finally, I put my hair into a bonnet till I go out.\n\nDespite all of this, my hair always ends up frizzy, and the curls barely hold. I’m not sure what to do differently. Does anyone have suggestions for products, routines, or techniques for long 2C/3A hair that would give definition without adding volume? Any help would be really appreciated!",

Over the past year or so it has gotten flat, oily, and frizzy.\n\nI'm concerned I'm just taking care of my hair wrong and trying to treat it like thicker/fuller hair which is causing it to go flat. I went to a dermatologist to ask if it was something else and they just told me to start paying them (or buy their hair supplements /roll eyes ). I'm only 27 so not yet ready to start paying a subscription service for my hair, lol. Any tips are welcome!!\n\nRoutine: function of beauty wavy hair shampoo and conditioner, either their curl cream or mousse depending if I'm at home or not, and ouai hair oil just on the lengths of my hair (to try to combat the frizz). I use Maui Moisture Scalp Care Clarifying Shampoo irregularly, but occasionally. I wash it 2-3 times/wk (couple months ago increased this from every \\~4 days). I use a silky pillowcase to sleep, considering starting to wear a bonnet.",

I didn't visit any dermatologist for this; I knew what they would prescribe me and the expensive products. Being a teenager, not only do I not earn much (and that too is sometimes I do, sometimes I don't), but also I didn't want my parents to spend a luxury for my skincare. So I did my research, or whatever you'd like to call it, and started using my savings to purchase all these products one by one from a generic pharmacy. \n\n**Slide 1: Prior to May 17, 2025**  \nAM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra\n\n**Slide 2: Prior to August 26, 2025, till Sept 2, 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: AcMist  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nActive: Adapalene 0.1%\n\n**Slide 3: From Sep 3 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC (Using this as a moisturiser base provides better sun protection.)  \nActive: Azelskin - Azelaic Acid 10%  \nSunscreen: FixDerma Shadow SPF 30 (cheap and gets the job done for me)\n\nIn-between AM/PM (occasionally only if I am at home):  \nCleanser: Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC  \nActive: HQ 4%\n\nElse not at home:  \nSunscreen reapplication\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Minimalist B5 10% Moisturiser  \nActive: Melapik (0.0125% tretinoin, 2% HQ, 1% allantoin) **// Not a steroid cream**\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\nYes, I am aware of the ochronosis risk using HQ. But cycling it, 2 months use (alternative) and then stopping for a few weeks and then starting again will keep the melanocytes sensitive. So I will not encounter any of it, as most side effects happen due to long-term abuse without any protection and carelessness, and I am not at all careless.\n\nAll of the supplements I take are within the safe limits; I will mention the dosage and the frequency in the comments.\n\nI am looking forward to starting microdose isotretinoin. \\~7 mg / day.  \nEven weeks: 20 mg Thrice  \nOdd weeks: 20 mg twice\n\nAvg weekly intake: 50 mg\n\nWill be monitoring my lipid and liver panels every 3-4 months and ensuring they are within the ideal range.\n\nAny review and insights would be helpful.\n\nThank You",

So far, my skin is tolerating it quite well with minimal dryness or irritation.\n\nOnce I finish my first tube, I’m wondering what should be the next step. Should I:\n\n•\tContinue with the same retinol for a few more months to build tolerance?\n\n•\tMove to a stronger formula like tretinoin?\n\t\n•\tOr try another over-the-counter \nalternative that’s more potent but still gentle on dry skin?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences and suggestions, especially from those with dry skin who’ve transitioned from OTC retinol to tret.\n\nTIA! 💕\n",

I am white (English/German genes) but I do have a slight olive tone to my skin and otherwise red undertones. \n\nI’ve tried Bondi Sands self tanning foam and felt like it was way too orange, but I can’t recall what the name or shade of the product was. I also didn’t like that it was immediately a very severe tan, I want a somewhat natural looking, brown glow. So I decided to go simple and I’ve been using Jergens Natural Glow Gradual Tanner in fair to medium, and I like that it’s a build-up tan but have found that it doesn’t stay for longer than a few days if I stop daily application and it gets splotchy. I also liked that it was a clear/cream liquid rather than a colored liquid. I think I should be using something different for my face too, but I don’t know where to start with that. \n\nWhat do I try next? How do I know what to try? What do you recommend?",
