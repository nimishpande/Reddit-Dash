      "title": "Curls are starting to go straight even with product / No consistency (UK)",
      "content": "Hair type: Low density, Course, High porosity 2c/3a (I think)\n\n\nHi, so I started growing my hair during Covid and by Oct 21 it was shoulder length (pic 1), and it looked pretty good considering I did nothing with it except wash (Aussie Miracle Moist) and condition (Tresemme rich moisture), then air dry.  I have satin pillowcase and a silk bonnet that I wear to bed.  I also turned 50 in October 25, and my hair has definitely got thinner in the last 5 years.\n\n\nAt some point in early 22 I had my hair done to make it lighter halfway down and the following year (2023 - pic2) I discovered Flora &amp; Curl curl lotion - I would use a blob of that after washing (hair still wet) and comb it through root to tip with a curly hair comb, then let it air dry which worked great for a while (pics 3-5).  Unfortunately at some point mid-late 2024/early 2025 F&amp;C changed the lotion in some way and it changed consistency.  After that it felt greasy and heavy, although it did still help a bit with the curl (pic 6).\n\n\nAfter that I noticed that intermittently my hair would go straight halfway down the strand, and be super frizzy and or lose definition (pics 7 &amp; 8).  After that point if I washed it and didn't use anything except shampoo &amp; conditioner + air dry it turned into a horrible frizzy mess (pic 9).\n\n\nI tried Curl Smith, Curl Show, Camille Rose, Only Curls, Cantu and some others but they all did the same thing as the single F&amp;C lotion after it changed, and some of them were really heavy.\n\n\nIn mid December (25) I had my hair coloured (just a dark red, no bleach) and just after I went and picked up the 3 stage F&amp;C line (lotion, gel and mousse) to see if those together would do anything.  For my work Xmas party I washed it the night before, and then used the F&amp;C lotion, then mousse, and then used my hands to remove excess water and then scrunched my hair for the first time ever, and did that for about 30 mins.  I then used a hairdryer on low blowing up at me to try with my head upside down to try and remove some moisture and add volume.  When it had finished and I took the picture the next day (pic 10) I had the best curls I've seen in years, and a ringlet one I could put a pencil up at the front.\n\n\nWeirdly I've not been able to recreate what I had at Xmas since - Over the holiday period I was told I should be using a defuser, so I brought one (Tresemme Pro Pure Curl Define).  Yesterday I tried using all 3 F&amp;C products + the defuser (watched some vids on how to use it) and it went horribly.  About £50 in product + defuser and to be honest it looks the worst it has in SO long I just want to give up (pic 11).\n\n\nIt looked so good right after I had it coloured and just using the lotion and mousse + hand scrunch, and now I'm wondering if the colouring is doing something to the hair that makes the product work better.  Of course as I'm washing it now no colour runs out so if that was the case that would help explain the texture change.  The last 2 pics don't even look like the same hair!\n\n\nI originally wrote this back in November 25 but with the colour and my lucky Xmas hair I thought I had cracked it, but that turned out to be a one off so here I am, asking for any hints or tips on what to do next.",

Every time I look up how to look better without makeup on TikTok or YouTube, all of the advice is from people who already are naturally beautiful or surgically enhanced. \nI don’t have the money for fillers or micro blading. I havent had a proper hair cut in years. I have quite a prominent, straight nose, and uneven eyebrows no matter how I try to do them. I feel that this asymmetry is not doing me any favours.

Here's the boring routine that actually worked: \n\n1. Face wash: If your face feels squeaky after washing, congrats, you just irritated it. Gentle&gt; deep clean always.\n\n2. One serum. literally one: Not a cocktail. Not skin cycling. Just pick your fighter: \n\ndull--&gt;vitamin C\n\noily/breakouts --&gt; niacinamide\n\ndry/tight --&gt; hydrating serum\n\n3. Moisturiser : yes, even if you have a oily skin. Skipping this made my skin more bad. Lightweight&gt; thick and barrier&gt; glow\n\nBiggest skincare scam is thinking you need *more*.  \nMost skin just wants less, consistently.\n\nSo… what actually helped your skin, simplifying or adding products?  \nLet the comments fight 👀",

It comes with an inner mesh cap that you place over the wet hair to hold curls in place, then apply the black blow-drying cap that connects to your hair dryer. I live in the Midwest where it is currently very cold, and traditional diffusing before work tends to result in bad frizz and a bad hair day overall. My curls do not like this cold winter weather because I prefer to air dry, but there is not enough time in the mornings. I cannot wash the night before because my hair gets mis-shapen  and smooshed down from my CPAP that I wear at night. I do wear a silk cap under the CPAP. I have to wash daily (morning)  due to oily fine hair.\nRoutine: L’Oreal ever pure moisture S/C, It’s-a -10 coily leave-in conditioner spray, Cake Curl Crush light hold gel.

I know some of this is mechanical damage from claw clips and the like, but I'm thinking a product or two might help, though I'm pretty minimalist with my routine. I'd say my hair is probably medium thickness and maybe medium density, maybe less dense not sure\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nWash every 4 or so days with Biotera color safe orchid shampoo (my hair isn't currently color-treated but I started using this when it was and kept it).\n\nPantene conditioner in the shower, rinse partly and leave in (bad, I know). Recently I've started rinsing most to all of it out in favor of hair oil. \n\nTwist my hair up in a T-shirt, take down, brush and let it air dry or put it in a bun and go to bed (I know, I know).\n\nWhile brushing wet add Garnier Marvelous oil, also as  needed in between washes. Better and this oil seems to nice and lightweight, but I'm reading that too much hair oil is bad for your hair too. I also just ordered a Denman wet brush that I'm hoping will be better for my hair. \n\nSo I'd like to try a hair mask or leave-in conditioner that will help hydrate my hair, tame frizz and accentuate waves or curls. I'll still probably use the hair oil but I can cut back on it. \n\nI need to avoid anything too heavy for my hair and anything that makes my hands feel gross after handling my hair (why I avoid styling gels and mousse but I'm open to ideas).\n\nIdeally reasonably inexpensive and accessible. \n\nThanks all :) \n\nAny recommendations?

My main concerns now are fine lines (mostly around the eyes), diffuse redness from mild rosacea, and restoring skin barrier/improving hydration.\n\nWhat I just bought:\n\n\\* ﻿﻿La Roche Posay Anthelios (repurchase, but need to be much more consistent about using this)\n\n\\* ﻿﻿Dermatica Azelaic Acid 20%\n\n...and the rest from Good Molecules:\n\n\\* Gentle Retinol Cream\n\n\\* Lightweight Daily Moisturizer\n\n\\* Hydrating Facial Cleansing Gel\n\n\\* Pineapple Exfoliating Powder\n\n\\* Caffeine Eye Patches\n\n\\* Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\nHere’s what I’m thinking for my daily routine (planning on only starting the retinol after giving my skin time to get used to the azelaic acid):\n\nAM\n\n\\* GM cleanser or just water\n\n\\* GM hyaluronic serum\n\n\\* Dermatica azelaic acid cream\n\n\\* GM yerba mate eye cream (or caffeine patches as desired)\n\n\\* GM moisturizer\n\n\\* LRP sunscreen\n\nPM\n\n\\* GM cleanser\n\n\\* GM hyaluronic serum\n\n\\* GM moisturizer (including eye area to prep for retinol)\n\n\\* GM retinol cream (starting out 1-2 times/week)\n\n\\* Kiehl’s eye cream\n\nThe pineapple exfoliator I intend to use only occasionally to prep for makeup, and keeping in mind when I last used/will next use retinol.\n\nI’d much appreciate feedback, if you have any! Anything seem redundant, out of order, or glaringly missing?",

      "content": "Hello, everyone !\n\nI normally don't have reactions to hair dye, but I stupidly used a new brand last time I dyed my hair, and it seems to be causing some allergic skin irritation. I didn't experience much discomfort during the dyeing process (perhaps some mild burning), but only weeks later did it start becoming unbearable.  \n\nI normally get my hair dyed at the salon, but I was financially struggling last year, and I stupidly decided to risk using box dye. The dye I used was Ion 1V permanent jet black hair dye, and I used the developer I always use with it (20 vol. argan oil crème developer). It claims to not have PPD which I always avoid.\n\nI'm experiencing redness and irritation on my scalp, neck, and face. I have a few bumps over my scalp in some places, including acne in the areas where my hair touches my face. Mostly it is just a mild burning pain or severe itching. I am using a topical hydrocortisone solution which seems to help a little bit. I am also taking cetirizine daily.  \n\nI am doing twice weekly double shampoo/conditioner. I also begin my routine with warm water and rinse in cold water. Once a week I will use a clarifying shampoo twice and a hair mask. My products are from the brand Olaplex. I've been using Olaplex no. 3 and a scalp oil (with argan, olive, coconut, castor, etc.) which I massage into my scalp for 20-30 min before shampooing. I also use no. 0 when I use my clarifying shampoo; however, it doesn't seem to be going away, and I'm becoming desperate.  \n\nI have an appointment with my dermatologist in two days. Until then, I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for me to perhaps either strip my hair completely of the dye, or neutralise it enough to stop the reaction from occurring. I contacted my salon, but they didn't want to try any treatments until I'm cleared by my dermatologist and my scalp is not irritated (understandable). \n\nAny advice is extremely welcome. Please withhold criticism as I understand what I did is completely my own fault and was very stupid of me.",

After a haircut in September, where my hair was sadly straightened,my curls started looking a lot looser and were not as nice looking. They started falling flat and limp, were frizzy and just looked way different than they used to. When they were straightened a heat protectant was used, however, I don’t know which one. I started using Rizos Curls Products after that haircut, which basically has no Protein as far as I know. So basically my hair wasn’t getting protein for almost 3 months straight. My hair dries different now and also feels different. I have no idea how to get them back.\n\nMy routine consisted of:\n\n\\- Shampoo and Conditioner by Jean&amp;Len\n\n\\- As I Am leave in classic\n\n\\- Rizos Curls Curl Defining Mousse\n\n\\- Rizos Curls Strong Hold gel\n\nI started with the leave in and raked that throughout my hair with my hands, just a quarter size. Then 3 pumps mousse, sometimes raked in sometimes scrunched. Then the gel, just a little bit also scrunched. After that I diffused and always slept with a bonnet.\n\nWhen I started researching why my hair was like this, I heard a lot about Protein, so I got the Rehab Salve from Curlsmith. I used this like 2 times now but it just looked better right after that but not long term. I’ve been trying for a month now to find the problem but I am clueless. I don’t know what to do and how to fix it and it’s really messing me up because I love my hair :(\n\nThe first 4 pics is my hair now using the same styling method, however, my curls look much looser now in my opinion.\n\nThe 5th and 6th pic is before the haircut, during that my hair was straightened and I wasn’t using any protein products. \n\nThe last two pics is my hair over a year ago where I was only using As I Am Long&amp;Luxe Curl Enhancing Smoothie.\n\nCould it be dead ends now that they grown out more? Is it the lack of protein over 3 months? Is it something else entirely? If you have any ideas please help me on how to fix this.\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "I have been dealing with acne for the past 6+ years and over that time my addiction to wanting clear skin has become worse and worse. Idk what to do and it’s destroyed my life.\n\nI change my silk pillow sheets every two days, I eat completely whole foods, no refined sugar, no dairy, little gluten, I even keep fruits to a minimum because I think the sugar breaks me out. I definitely have some sort of acne induced eating disorder as I can’t really eat any food that isn’t deemed safe. I haven’t had chocolate, takeaways, or anything in over a year. I can’t do anything every day without being afraid, I feel like I’m living my life in constant fear as everything ever breaks me out. I’m scared to drink alcohol or hangout with my partner, as they kiss my face and stuff. I spend time in the sun each morning, I eat a copious amount of salmon and I take vitamin d, zinc and omega 3s. I don’t eat whey protein, only occasionally eat pea protein as I tend to rely on real protein sources. I don’t eat eggs. I eat low gi and am very careful about blood sugar rises. I make turmeric and ginger shots every week. I drink a looot of water, plus green tea and dandelion tea. I spend all my money on fancy Korean skincare, and spend hours researching on what to buy next. It’s so consuming and taken over my whole entire life and I don’t know how to live normally. My skin has cleared up a lot, it is so much better than it used to be but any slight change in my insane routine and I tend to notice breakouts appear. It’s so tiring and idk what to do, I want to just go on accutane to end this war and constant battle but I’m afraid my acne isn’t ‘bad enough,’ as obviously all of these things I do has cleared up my skin a lot. Yet I can’t keep doing all these things. I think it’s mainly hormonal, as especially around my period it’s worse and whatnot, yet im scared of taking spiro because I don’t want my acne to just come back. I haven’t spoken to a dermatologist (surprisingly) due to the lack of them in my area and expense. but I’m really at my wits end, and I don’t want to live like this forever. I want to enjoy food out with friends, I want to be able to hug my boyfriend without being afraid of bacteria and I just know if there was an actual end to this my life would improve so much. I can’t go on the combined pill as I get migraines and it’s a blood clot risk, and I bought spearmint tea a few days ago, although I’m afraid it’ll mess with the mini pill I am on. I’m going to stop the mini pill soon as I know it hasn’t helped my acne whatsoever (only made it worse) which is expected. I have only been on it for a month and a half for personal safety reasons but I’m sick of it potentially being a cause for this hell. The first thing I do when I wake up is think about my skin, do my skincare and it’s the last thing I think about before I go to bed. I miss being able to wear makeup without being scared of it and I just want my life back! I feel so lost and alone.\n\nP.s I’ve never posted on reddit before so I’m sorry if the layout is wrong lmao I just want help",
