      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I’m on the hunt for a great body wash and body oil, but the second I started researching, I got bombarded with ads and now I can’t tell what’s actually worth it. I don’t want to waste my money on hype.\n\nThese are the five brands/products I keep seeing on repeat:\n\n•\tBesque\n\n•\tSaltair\n\n•\tIota\n\n•\tBeauty From Bees\n\n•\tOsea\n\nHere’s what I’m looking for:\n\n1.\t⁠Clean ingredients\n\n2.\t⁠Smells and feels luxurious\n\n3.\t⁠Reasonably priced (doesn’t break the bank)\n\n4.\t⁠Body oil that’s not super thin/watery\n\n5.\t⁠Dries fast and doesn’t leave a sticky feeling\n\n6.\t⁠Helps with crepey skin, especially around my knees and décolletage\n\n7.\t⁠Bonus: the scent lasts and I still smell good after\n\nIf you’ve tried any of these (or have better recommendations I’m missing), I’d love your honest thoughts — what’s worth it, what’s not, and why.\n\nThank you so much in advance.",

I wouldn’t call my skin sensitive, but it reacts really dramatically to some ingredients.\n\n**AM 6x/week**:\n\n\\- Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner\n\n\\- Peach &amp; Lily Glass Skin Refining Serum\n\n\\- Skin1004 Poremizing Fresh Ampoule\n\n\\- HadaLabo Gokujyun Premium gel (gold bottle)\n\n\\- summer: Beauty of Joseon Aqua Fresh sunscreen. In winter I get very very little sun exposure and only use sunscreen if I will be in a car or outside for &gt;30 mins during the day.\n\n**AM 1x/week**:\n\n\\- The Ordinary AHA/BHA peel\n\n\\- Keana Rice Pack mask\n\n\\- HadaLabo Perfect Gel\n\n**PM 5x/week**:\n\n\\- Bioderma Sensibio micellar water for makeup removal\n\n\\- a foam cleanser, currently using iUnik Centella Cleansing Bubble Foam\n\n\\- The Ordinary Rosehip Oil \\*just added this, still testing it out\n\n\\- Stratia Night Shift\n\n**PM 2x/week**:\n\n\\- Bioderma Sensibio micellar water for makeup removal\n\n\\- a foam cleanser, currently using iUnik Centella Cleansing Bubble Foam\n\n\\- HadaLabo Gokujyun Premium gel (gold bottle)\n\n\\- Tretinoin 0.025% cream\n\nIf my skin is feeling extra dry, I’ll also throw in a moisturizing face mask in the evening randomly and/or use the HadaLabo Perfect Gel a few extra nights a week. I use Tret on Tuesdays and Thursdays and use the TO peel on Mondays. I started Tret in October, 1x/week for about 2 months and 2x/week since then. I have tried to increase to 3x/week but experienced a lot of dryness/peeling, so I dropped back down to just twice.\n\nAny critique or suggestions?",
