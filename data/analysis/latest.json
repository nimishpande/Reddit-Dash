      "content": "\n\n\nHey everyone,\n\nAfter reading so many transformation stories here, I finally gathered the confidence to share my own. It’s been a full 12 months since my journey began, and honestly, choosing to go ahead with a hair transplant has been one of the best decisions of my life.\n\nI’m a 41-year-old doctor, but for years I looked much older than my actual age. I had a very large forehead, strong frontalis muscle activity, and a badly receding hairline. It affected me more than I’d like to admit. I avoided mirrors, disliked being photographed, and slowly my confidence started fading. I run a small hospital, so looking constantly tired or stressed didn’t help either.\n\nThe Surgery &amp; Choosing the Right Doctor\nI had been thinking about a hair transplant for a long time, but time was always an issue. Traveling to another city felt exhausting, and I was very clear about one thing—I didn’t want a “hair mill” setup where technicians do everything. I wanted a qualified doctor who personally performs the procedure.\n\nThrough one of my colleagues, I came across a doctor in Patna, and from the very first consultation, I felt comfortable. What impressed me most was that he didn’t just talk about the number of grafts—he talked about aesthetics. He carefully studied my face, age, muscle movement, and skin laxity, and explained why my case needed a customized approach.\n\nFirst Sitting &amp; Setbacks\nMy first surgery involved 3,500 grafts. Unfortunately, soon after the procedure, I went through a very stressful personal phase. Because of that, I couldn’t follow the post-op routine properly—diet, supplements, and overall care were not ideal for almost six months. Naturally, this affected the results.\n\nBy the 8th month, the outcome was decent, but deep down I felt something was still missing.\n\nSecond Sitting – A Grateful Moment\nWhen I discussed this with my doctor, he was incredibly understanding. He agreed to a second sitting for refinement—free of charge, except for a minimal OT cost. I wanted a slightly lower hairline and better density, and around 1,800 additional grafts were added to enhance the hairline peak and blend everything naturally. I’m genuinely grateful for his honesty and support.\n\nHairline Design – The Game Changer\nThis is what truly changed everything.\n\nInstead of giving me a straight, artificial-looking hairline, he designed a:\n\nTriangular, age-appropriate hairline\n\nOne that perfectly matches my face shape and muscle movement\n\nNot too low, not too youthful—just natural and balanced\n\nThe Real Journey (No Sugarcoating)\nMonths 1–3: Shedding, anxiety, stress, and poor aftercare\n\nMonths 4–6: Early signs of growth\n\nMonth 7: Good density, but I wanted a lower hairline\n\nMonth 8: Second surgery for refinement (1,800 grafts)\n\nMonth 12: Major transformation\n\nSome areas are still improving, and since it’s only 4 months after the second sitting, I feel I might gain another 20–30% density.\n\nHow I Feel Today\nFor the first time in years, I don’t look constantly stressed or older than my age. I finally see a version of myself that feels right. The confidence this has given me—both personally and professionally—is something I can’t put a price on.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nA hair transplant isn’t just about getting hair back—it’s about getting your confidence back.\n\nIf you’re thinking about it:\n\nChoose a doctor who designs, not just implants\n\nBe patient—it’s a long journey\n\nTrust the process\n\nI’m finally at a place where I truly like how I look, and that feeling is priceless.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or share pictures if anyone wants",

One week it looks relatively calm and normal for me, and then very quickly it turns into what you see now — red, inflamed bumps concentrated mostly on my cheeks (even apples of my cheeks) and jaw, with a lot of background redness and irritation. Normally no issues with my forehead.\n\nThe inflamed pictures I have aren’t even at their worst. They are probably a day or two post peak inflammation. I never want to document the worst but I guess I should.\n\nHere’s where I’m confused:\n\n• I’ve been on spironolactone (for hormonal acne). Has helped some. • I use tretinoin • My dermatologist recently prescribed Cabtreo • BUT… my skin seems to be getting angrier, not better\n\nI’m starting to seriously wonder if this is type 2 rosacea, a damaged skin barrier, or some overlap, rather than classic acne. I don’t have persistent redness like typical rosacea.\n\nSome important context: • The bumps aren’t always typical whiteheads; they’re more inflamed red papules that flare fast and can hurt. • The change happens quickly, not over months • I have pretty dry skin so normal acne solutions like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acne make me so dry it hurts. • I own basically every skincare product under the sun, but clearly I’m not using the right things or the right approach\n\nI don’t know if I should push my derm harder about rosacea evaluation or if this looks hormonal + irritated rather than true rosacea\n\nIf anyone has dealt with rosacea vs acne confusion, sudden flares like this, or worsening skin despite “doing everything right,” I’d really appreciate hearing what helped you.\n\nI feel like I’m in a never ending cycle 😩\n\nThank you 🤍",

Unfortunately, I had to stop because my dermatologist-prescribed tret became hard to access. While I was on it, it did a great job controlling my breakouts. I’ve since switched back to benzoyl peroxide 0.5%, which is more accessible for me.\n\nMy main concern now is PIE and PIH—something I’ve been struggling with since starting tretinoin last year (December 2024). Acne is mostly under control, but the marks just won’t budge.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nAM: Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser - Cos De Baha Azelaic Acid 15% - Cetaphil Cream Moisturizer - Cetaphil Sunscreen\n\nPM: Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser - Benzoyl Peroxide 0.5% - Cetaphil Cream Moisturizer\n\nI’m thinking of adding Cos De Baha Tranexamic Acid 5% + Niacinamide 5% Serum to target these stubborn PIE and PIH marks.\n\nDo you think this would be a good addition to my routine?

I checked on chatgpt it said it doesn't cause any major side effects with this dosage. But my mom isn't convinced. My mom took away the 15 tabs that I had of isotretinoin and told me i don't need them anymore so i should stop as she says my skin has improved now. I believe i should atleast complete those 15 tablets and then visit the new dermat later whenever possible as I've exams coming up in a while. Should I convince my mom to give me those?

(sorry if the quality is bad)\n\nFor around a year now I’ve been slowly neglecting my hair and haven’t been taking care of it as much as I used to because of life circumstances.\n\nI’d usually just wash it, blow dry it and just wrap it into a bun or just leave it down since it was most convenient for me.\n\nHowever, I’ve been trying to take care of my hair more recently but I’ve noticed quite a change in my hair.\n\nNot that long ago, I got a curly cut which ended up not so good (uneven layers, thick short fringe…) and my hairs pretty much been suffering 😭\n\nAs you can see from the images, around 60-70% of my hair is kinda flat and limp and I get some ringlets at the end.\n\nHere’s my current hair routine:\n\nCurlsmith Multi-tasking Conditioner\nAveda Nutriplenish Shampoo Light Moisture\nEither: Innersense Sweet Spirit Leave-In Conditioner OR Boucleme Super Hold Styler \nKerastase Elixer Ultime L’Huile\n\n(For the most recent pics I used the Innersense)\n\nIn the last image I can’t exactly remember what shampoo I used but I would probably wash with either the Curlsmith Core Strength shampoo or Briogeo Don’t Despair Repair Super Moisture Shampoo and style with the same boucleme hair gel and super volumising foam and the kerastase hair oil\n\nI’m not sure if I should continue using conditioner in my routine, I feel like all of them just weigh down my hair no matter which one I use, but I got recommended to use one to detangle to prevent breakage idk\n\nI’m lowkey on the bridge of just big chopping but I have no idea what to do and would rather seek advice before doing anything drastic 😭",

I’m overall just trying to get rid of my dry scalp while using products that do justice to my curls. I was using Cantu curl cream and mousse for about 5-6 months, then stopped because I thought it was starting to strip my scalp. Since then I tried Miss Jesse’s Multi-Cultural curl cream, which didn’t work AT ALL. I normally use a t-shirt to let my hair dry and then let it air dry.\n\nI’ve been trying to search for a good leave-in conditioner for about a week or now because I wanna start using products in my hair again, but I don’t want to dry my hair, at the same time I want to make my hair more curly. I would try Shea-Moisture, but their Manuka Honey Shampoo and Conditioner dried out my hair, so I’m weary of trying their leave-in. I’m just confused on where to start or what brands to get. ANY help or advice is helpful!",

I tended to use curly marketed products already because other products made my hair puff out or feel greasy. When it’s wet, it arranges itself like pictures I’ve seen of 2c— small bundles that sometimes twist around themselves and sometimes form short S shapes- but usually it air dries looser and with straight portions especially towards the top of my head. \n\n But taking care of that was hard enough without trying to figure out a routine to encourage curls 😂 I got a shoulder length haircut a few months back and my hairdresser commented that my hair texture had definitely changed and had started curling a bit as he cut it. TBH didn’t think much of it until it got chilly in my house and I decided to break out a diffusing attachment my sister got me. \n\nPretty much all the layers below my eyes started forming larger C shapes at the ends as opposed to the long S I usually get. I thought it was cute and thought I’d try changing my routine a little to try and get more definition to the wave I already have and maybe encourage it to curl more if it would like to 😊 \n\nI like the shampoo/conditioner and infusium I currently have— so I’d be aiming for Technique and leave in conditioner/gel(?) recommendations! \n\nAttached pictures are from right after I used a diffuser on my hair :)\n\n\\-Soapbox argan oil shampoo and conditioner (wash roots with shampoo, condition through full length of hair and rinse after 5 minutes)\n\n\\-squish out some water, then spray until wet with Infusium23\n\n\\-sit there toweled up until it’s less drippy, then apply Anika Supernova Moisture and Shine Cream (usually I use the Aussie curl cream)\n\n\\-diffuse hair, plopping 1/6 of my hair right on that diffusing head of a hair dryer\n\nNowadays I sleep with a poly satin pillowcase, loose or in braids depending on my mood :)",

      "content": "I have 3c coily hair. l used to box dye my hair often, but I haven't in a year and half and want to leave my hair fully natural from now on. The ends are all orange now, they're not totally fried, but they don't look as healthy as the rest of my hair. I don't have many split ends because I take very good care of my hair now. I've been slowly cutting my hair, but i can't cut it too short it looks too awkward.\n\nI'm looking for a mid term solution. I don't wanna cut it short and get extensions, they thin out my hair. I don't wanna do a big chop, it would destroy my confidence. I don't wanna dye my hair fully. The only solution l've found would be to dye or apply a gloss on the ends only. My hair atm only looks good in low lighting because you can’t see the orange 🤣🥲. \n\nMy current hair routine: \n- wash + deep condition weekly\n- I mostly style using the pink skala, my hair loves that stuff. (Suggestions for healthier products with similar consistency would be appreciated) \n- I do diffuse my hair with heat but only sometimes \n- I sleep with a satin bonnet \n- I never ever wear my hair up anymore to avoid breakage (and it worked 😍) \n",
