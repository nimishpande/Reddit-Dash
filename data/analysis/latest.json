I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

      "content": "Sorry for the long paragraph in advance, but here goes: \n\nSooo I'm a teenager (16F, caucasian if that helps), and a few years ago when I went through puberty my hair went from light waves to whatever craziness it is right now, and I'm not sure how to handle it. I don't have much of a routine unlike other girls my age, and since I'm basically broke, I just use whatever off-brand shampoo that we have in the house, and for conditioner I usually use Tresemme, Aussie, or just whatever else I can find on sale. I don't really have the money to afford fancy hair products, but I have found that if I scrunch in a bit of Mark Anthony curl cream, plus NYM curl defining gel after I shower, they usually work to define my 2b 2c 3a curls for a little while, but I have to use sooo much of the products it's ridiculous and I feel like I'm wasting money. I don't have a diffuser or anything fancy, so usually I let it air-dry, or just put my hair in a bun or braid while it's wet, but as soon as it dries or I take it out of the braid it just turns into frizzy, undefined curls that you can basically see through, which is basically the opposite of what I want. It's still soft, but the curls just aren't together. At night, if it's not wet, I'll just sleep with it in a bun, but if it's wet, I'll just let it be and just air dry while I sleep. I don't have like a hair bonnet, silk pillowcase or anything like that, but I'm open to buying one if it would help. And in the morning I just usually do a braid, bun or ponytail, but I wish I wasn't so basic lol. My hair is super thick and long (like to my waist when it's heat straightened), and on the outside it's sort of wavy, while underneath it's super curly ringlets. Idek what's going on though because it frizzes super bad like right after it dries, and I need help because the rest of my family just has straight hair 😭. So these are some of the things that I was wondering:\n\n  \\- Are there any inexpensive products that work really well for defining frizz without being crunchy?\n\n \\- How can I make my curls be better defined (with or without product)?\n\nAlso idk just some random things like should I brush it or not, would cutting it help, should I sleep with my hair wet or dry, etc...?\n\nJust any hacks that I could use to make my curls frizz less and are much appreciated ❤ \n\n  \nTL; DR\n\nI (16 f)need help with my frizzy, undefined 2b 2c and 3a curls. any product recommendations, treatments, or just general curly hair life hacks would help 🙏",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

Typically texture (congestion?) on my forehead, smaller zits and blackheads on my temples and sides of my face, and large/deep zits on my jaw and cheeks. My skin is very dry and easily irritated. I see a dermatologist and currently use Tretinoin 0.1% every other night and clindamycin gel and the Ordinary’s azelaic acid suspension 10% in the morning. This routine doesn’t seem to be helping. I typically rinse my face with water in the morning, apply the prescribed creams and moisturizer (i use first aid beauty’s ultra repair cream). At night i double cleanse with miscellar water and a CeraVe cream-to-foam cleaner for dry skin and then apply tretinoin and lotion. Once a week I use a benzyl peroxide face wash (also cerave 4%) and derma plane, and occasionally apply raw vitamin e oil at night. Any suggestions/improvements to my current routine are welcome!",

I’ve started noticing wrinkles around my eyes and dark circles too, and honestly I look way older than 24 right now. My skin isn’t sensitive at all so I’m down to try strong stuff if they actually work. I’ve attached a pic so you can see the tan and the eye situation.

Apart from my dry skin being uncomfortable and feeling terrible, my makeup also looks pretty rough. Because of this, I stopped wearing makeup all together for the past 9 months. I really want to get back into doing my makeup but, I know my skin prep needs to be better. \n\nFor reference I have fair skin, and struggle with redness. I used to be very acne prone but have since gone on accutane, and been off of it for the last 2 years. I still get blemishes here and there but nothing like what I used to deal with. My skin isn't flaky, but it is textured, dull, and even at 21 I have forehead wrinkles. \n\nI know other things contribute to dry skin so I will try to mention other relevant variables. I eat a fairly balanced diet and drink water regularly (could probably drink more). I live in northern California right now, but still struggled with my dry skin when I lived in Paris and when I lived on the east coast in Maryland. I currently do not take any supplements but plan to add cod liver oil into my daily routine. I also work out 5-6 times a week.\n\nRight now my routine is:\n\nNight:\n\nSkin1004 Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil \n\nIsntree Yam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser\n\nEqqualBerry Swimming Pool Toner\n\nIunik Beta-Glucan Power Moisture Serum\n\nIlliyoon Ceremide Ato Concentrate Cream\n\nMorning: \n\nTorriden Dive In 5D Hyaluronic Acid Soothing Cream\n\n\n\nI have experimented with adding to my morning routine so that my makeup might sit better, but to no avail. If you have any recommendations please let me know! \n\nRight now I am considering adding an occlusive such as the La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 Baume on top of my night skin care, and including a stronger chemical exfoliant weekly, such as the  Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Peel Pads.\n\n",

Seeking routine advice.\n\nRoutine:\n\n• Shampoo: Head and Shoulders.\n\n• Conditioner/Mask: L'Oréal Elvive 8 Second Wonder Water, followed by either Tsubaki Hair Mask or Dove One Minute Super Conditioner (alternating).\n\n• Treatment: Olaplex No. 3 used a couple of times a month.\n\n• Leave-in: BioSilk Silk Therapy.\n\n• Styling/Serums: Gisou Hair Serum used during the week.\n\n• Application Method: I apply the leave-in to damp hair. Because of chronic headaches, I must comb my hair for relief at least once every 2 days.\n\n• Drying Method: Mostly air dry, but I use the Revlon One-Step Volumizer brush to manage the frizz and texture.\n\n• Sleep Protection: I sleep in a loose bun or a loose braid.\n\n• Refresh: I do not have a refresh routine.\n\nThe Issue:\n\nI know my hair is curly, but it never clumps into defined ringlets. It stays in this \"cloud\" or \"frizzy\" state regardless of the masks I use. I am considering adding the Kerastase Overnight Serum to help. Any advice on how to get my curls to actually stick together?",
