      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Does it look like my skin really needs retinal or it’ll repair itself eventually by following above routine. \n2. Is it true that if we start using retinal we need to keep using it forever or can discontinue in between due to xyz reasons?\n3. As a beginner is it recommended to use 0.1% retinal serum directly or should I start with something light like a retinol based moisturiser?\n\nI have weddings to attend in Feb 2026 and want to look my best there, please helpp!",

      "content": "I grew up where it is super dry and moved to a very humid area 5 years ago. I was honestly shocked to find that my hair was actually curly and not just a bit wavy. It's literally been 5 whole years of fighting the humidity, trying to style my hair the way I did growing up, accepting that my hair needs to be treated differently in the humidity, and then doing TONS of trial and error with products and methods and everything. But... I think I may have finally figured it out!\n\nPhoto order:\n\n* Pics 1–2: From about a month ago, feeling absolutely shocked at the curls.\n* Pics 3–4: Years 1 and 3, when I first discovered the curls but was still fighting it.\n* Pics 5–6: Years 4 and 5, embracing the curls stage, but still figuring out the right products and techniques.\n\nI’m still learning, but I finally feel like I’m working with the humidity instead of against it.\n\n(reposting cause I forgot to include my routine, adding below)\n\n# Current Routine\n\n**Wash Day**\n\n* **Shampoo:**\n   * First wash: *Suave Keratin Shampoo*\n   * Second wash: *Kérastase Genesis Shampoo*\n* **Conditioner:** *Kérastase Genesis Conditioner* on ends, fully rinsed\n\n**After Shower (on soaking wet hair)**\n\n* **Leave-In:** *Curlsmith Frizz Control Duo Conditioner* on ends\n* **Heat Protectant:** *Nexxus Heat Defense Spray* throughout\n* **Mousse (at roots):** Currently alternating between:\n   * *John Frieda Frizz Ease Dream Curls Curl Reviver Mousse*\n   * *Curlsmith Invincible Volume Hair Mousse*\n* **Distribution:** Brush products through, part hair, finger-separate large clumps, then scrunch until curls form\n* **Microfiber Towel:** Scrunch to damp using *The Perfect Haircare* towel\n\n**Styling**\n\n* **Gel:** *Curlsmith In-Shower Style Fixer* — applied with praying-hands method, then scrunched\n* **Drying:** Diffuse for a few minutes (mostly scrunch-diffusing up to roots) to set the gel, then air-dry the rest of the way\n\n**Finishing**\n\n* **Hairspray:** *SexyHair Big Spray*, lightly at the roots and around frizzy sections\n* **Break Cast / Soften:** Once fully dry, scrunch out the crunch with *Verb Ghost Oil*\n\n# Refresh Routine\n\nI definitely have NOT figured out a great refresh yet. Right now I just spray my hair damp and scrunch as needed. This re-activates the gel, which can make it crunchy again, so sometimes I use a bit more oil to break the cast.\n\n**Would love refresh tips if anyone has suggestions!**",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI went to the dermatologist today because I wanted to start finasteride. I’ve been using minoxidil for over half a year now with good results. In the Netherlands minoxidil is available without a prescription, but finasteride isn’t.\n\nI intentionally waited to start finasteride because my partner and I had a desire to have children. Now that this is no longer a concern, I figured it was time to finally begin.\n\nHowever, the dermatologist refused to prescribe it. He said that very recent research (&lt;1 year old) showed worrying results regarding male breast cancer as a side effect. According to him, depression was still “manageable” because they could monitor that, but the breast-cancer findings caused him — and apparently the entire medical team in my region — to completely stop prescribing finasteride.\n\nHe also mentioned hearing at a conference about a finasteride topical lotion that includes 15% minoxidil, which he suggested as an alternative. That sounded like overkill to me and honestly made me question his knowledge a bit. He also said there was no difference between dutasteride and finasteride in terms of side effects or their frequency, which added to my doubts.\n\nObviously I assume a doctor should know more than someone like me who gathers info online, but the whole consultation left me feeling like he might not be fully informed on hair loss treatments.\n\nMy question to you all:\nHas anyone heard about this supposed recent study linking finasteride to increased male breast cancer risk? I can’t find anything about it anywhere.\n\nThanks in advance.",

I'm just not sure what to classify my hair as though? I've had a couple people say its curly, but most online say its not - thats its wavy at best. Either way, I really need some tips on how to help it.\n\nI don't have much of a routine. I don't use product, I haven't found any that works that well without breaking the bank (recommendations welcome tho). I usually air dry, but sometimes diffuse on low heat for special occasions. I wash my hair every day (shampoo and conditioner). Ive heard that isn't good to do for some reason, but I swim in a public chlorinated pool every day as part of my workout routine, so I can't afford to not clean it. Other than that, some other facts that could be useful is that I live in a cold climate with basically no humidity. I have died my hair lighter a couple times in the past. I have some vitiligo on my scalp. \n\nI added some pictures of my hair. The first is right after I brushed through it (which I don't do often) and the second is it sopping wet. The rest is my daily look.  ",

It’s caused so much breakage I’m pretty much bal*ing (no kidding) and atp I’m just crying myself to sleep every other night.\n\nDoes anyone please have any recommendation for protein treatment? Rice water doesn’t work for me, I’ve tried multiple times :(. I’ve tried so much and yet nothing seems to help. I am willing to spend as much money as possible and do anything that would help.\n\nRecently I saw someone suggest Shea Moisture’s Manuka Honey, I haven’t tried that yet, but when I Google it it says it moisturizes the hair? I added photos of the product. If any of you have used it, how is it?\n\nRoutine rn is pretty much all over the place, most recently I did Curlsmith Strength recipe shampoo, the same conditioner/mask and no products for styling, diffuse so the hair doesn’t stay wet for too long.\n\nPlease please if any of you have been in a similar situation, I would be forever thankful, if you could help :,).",

      "content": "As the title states, I’m in my early 30s and have NEVER had any sort of skincare routine. Right now, I’m specifically looking for a good lip mask, face wash, and something to help with dead skin. I need something that is hypoallergenic (as I’m allergic to A LOT) and my skin isn’t all that dry, nor is it oily. I don’t know if it matters in what may work, but I’ve also never worn, nor currently wear, any sort of makeup.\n\nThe chapsticks I usually use (Burt’s Bees and Blistex) just don’t seem to be helping anymore. I would also like to stay away from anything tinted. I did see TATCHA and Melixer (Agave) suggested to others, but what are the thoughts on these? I’ve seen such wildly mixed reviews.\n\nAs for a scrub/face wash, any suggestions at all? I’ve tried Apricot scrub from Neutrogena, Burt’s Bees, and small businesses, but I still come out with a TON of dead skin flaking off after a shower. Do I need a specific washcloth/tool? I can’t use cotton (allergic) so I don’t have a typical washcloth, but something more loofa like in texture (but not a loofa). Is the loofa like texture just not good enough to get all the skin?\n\nI’m sorry for the long post, and if there’s extra info needed to be able to help, please let me know! Thank you in advance for any advice!\n\n(PS Anything I can get at Ulta would be a plus as I have a job interview Wednesday and would love to not have chapped lips for that!)",

Its so embarrassing and usually comes along the 2nd day after washing ://\nHeres my routine: \n- I wash my hair with shampoo every other day-every two days - always double cleansing\n- I Use an acv scalp rinse 2x a month\n- I use conditioner on my mids-ends and rinse with cold water ALWAYS\n- I use lightweight products on my mids and ends ONLY\n- I never air dry as I find it makes it worse. \nInstead, I always diffuse my scalp first thing after styling, then work my way down my hair\n\nI've tried using dry shampoos but they only weigh my hair down and honestly dont help much at all, especially with the smell :(\nI dont remember my scalp ever being this oily I swear it just came along this year and I HATE IT!

His skin has some dark sun spots due to the nature of his work/job.\n\nFew days ago he used the pilgrim 10% vitamin c serum and he really liked it, says it gave him some kind of result, but personally I'm skeptical about this brand and so got him the deconstruct niacinamide + alpha arbutin serum but we did not see much changes in his skin after using this serum. So I'm confused if I should just get him the pilgrim serum again or any other serums. And any other suggestions or recommendations would also be thankful.\n\nPS: I did got him to use sunscreen everyday now so his skin looks good not completely repaired.",

One other time, I ended up with curls but only 2/3 of my hair fell out that time so I had some length. \n\n1- I do not know how to make these curls do individual and weigh them down. Is that even a thing I can hope for at this point? \n\n2- I am a Special Education Teacher and avoid biting my nails ….. so I’ve started spinning my hair when nervous, especially in the back. I don’t want a mullet and I’m afraid it’s getting there. Is this mullet-y?\n\n3-What type of cut can I ask for to make it even up more…. I’d like to have a curly bob in the beard future…. Maybe that will take a long time since it’s so curly though. \n\n4- I’m teaching elementary now and have to go out for recess. What is the best hat for the winter that will not ruin my curls? \n\n5- is there an elongation method for my hair? Can I twist it at night or something? What would that be called? \n\nRoutine- I wash it every other day with curl enhancing shampoo/conditioner. Daily- I spray it down. I use a leave-in conditioner, then a strong mousse, then use my hands to push the curls up. Next, I use a comb to part it and sometimes a little bit of gel to keep the part longer. \n\nPlease, take note of the images. Some are at the beginning of today’s work day (the bottom dries so fast and frizzes up but the rest doesn’t) and the other is after work. ",
