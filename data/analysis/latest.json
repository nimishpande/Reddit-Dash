I have really thick curly (probably) heat damaged hair from when I used to flat iron my poor curls, i've been wearing my hair curly for about a year now and I still feel like my hair hasn't reached its full\npotential yet no matter what I do it feels big and dry and feels like straw 🥲 oh to have shiny soft curls. My curl routine is first I shampoo with Aussie miracle moist and wash just my roots. Then I rinse and usually use a hair mask instead of normal conditioner because my hair seems to struggle to keep moisture, the mask I use is shea moisture intensive hydration masqe. After brushing that through my hair I let it sit while I wash my body etc, when my hair is rinsed out and now soaking wet I detangle with a curl detangling brush and brush before applying Marc Anthonys curl envy cream, then I brush again to make curl clumps and scrunch in some eco gel. After the eco gel i spray in some leave in conditioner by Marc Anthony. Finally! I pray hands in some shea moisture curl mousse and plop for 10 minutes in a microfiber towel before diffusing for about 50 minutes.. also It seems I can never get the back to look as defined as the front. Last time I got a haircut was about 9 months ago. My hair rarely even gets past day 2 despite wearing a silk bonnet using the pineapple method to bed😅",

Usually over the years i have stopped and restarted a few times, and every single time I had to deal with shedding for a few months but then always after the 4-5 month  the hair always bounced back stronger.\n\nSo this time i was silly and thought that i have been consistent for so long and maybe my results will hold up without the meds. Well today is almost 5 months ago i stopped and what i hoped would not happen happened. Major shedding and hair that is thin and look like a diffuse baldy person\n\nSo lesson learned:  this is a lifetime medication, guys.

      "content": "The first picture is how my hair looks after I wash it and after it has fully dried. The second picture is how my hair looks less than 48 hours of not washing it later. I am genuinely feeling so hopeless that my hair can look any good for more than 12 hours. It tangles up so fast. Sometimes it feels like it tangles *as I'm detangling it in the shower*, I'd run my fingers through detangled areas and they'd already feel tangled again. I want my hair to remain in shape and obey gravity rather than poofing up (the individual hairs are extremely thin). And I don't want to expel *all* of my energy to do it and waste *all* of my money on just conditioner, as it takes me 40 minutes to shower *without detangling*, an hour with, and I have to use about half a bottle of conditioner per shower because of how much hair I have, how dense it is, and how hard it is to make sure everything is fully covered between the curls. I would really like to have some advice.\n\nAs for my routine, I usually use either \"conditioner for normal hair\" or \"clay conditioner\", although I do experiment with different conditioners too. But those two are the ones that have made detangling my hair the easiest. I usually use either \"clay shampoo\" or \"shampoo for curly hair\", but again I occasionally buy different types to experiment. I have looked for sulfate-free shampoos and products intended for detangling and felt little improvement. The brands are nothing special, just the ones I find in grocery stores and pharmacies. I wash every 2-4 days. Sometimes just conditioner and sometimes with shampoo as well, depending on how itchy my scalp feels. Sometimes I even do conditioner first to detangle, then shampoo, then conditioner again to soften. If my hair feels too tangled, I detangle it by brushing it with a handheld brush while the conditioner is still on (only way I'm able to brush at all), starting at the tips and working my way up to the scalp inch by inch. I occasionally detangle with my fingers instead but it's usually less efficient, more painful and feels like it results in more hairs falling off than with the brush. I usually wrap my head in a towel to soak most of the water then leave it to air dry the remaining moisture. I've tried just rubbing my hair quickly instead of wrapping, and I've tried using an old shirt for either one instead of a towel, the end result after fully drying looks the same. I don't use any leave-in products, as most of them give me sensory issues, make my scalp itchy, and/or make my hair look even worse. I do have spray serums that I use sometimes, and they have done the best job of slowing down the overpoofing of my hair and maintaining its oobedience to gravity, but they also accelerate getting itchy and needing shampoo again.\n\nAlso important to note: I have had chemical straightening before. I had even less of an idea of how to take care of my hair, so threw years ago I had a chemical straightening. A year later, two years ago, I had it renewed and it was botched and didnt stick, and even the attempt to fix it was imperfect and didn't last as long. I have since cut all the parts from the first straightening and grown out new roots, but I imagine I still have some damaged tips at the top layer of my hair.",

My main concern is the hyperpigmentation/acne scars that are left behind after every breakout even if i don't pick at the acne and the rough texture it leaves behind in some areas. I don't really have much of a routine right now, other than CeraVe SA face wash and turmeric soap which kind of burns after use. I would also like to note that i believe my skin is somewhat sensitive (Ive avoided using Benzoyl Peroxide after it badly burned and irritated my skin when I was first directed to use it, and only use the Turmeric soap once at night). My mom always comments on how \"miserable\" my face looks and i'd really like to improve so any advice would be helpful.",

I had a baby over 2 years ago and lost a lot of hair in postpartum but it hasn't went back to normal. I used to have long thick hair, but I recently cut it shoulder length as it's just driving me crazy and discouraging to see it thinning out. \nSo I'm wondering if there are any shampoo/conditioners/treatments that would be recommended for my hair type.

I’ve had hairstylists tell me I don’t have split ends there (shocking I know) but it’s likely breakage. I’ve tried a lot and just looking for more recommendations. \n\nPictures attached are April —&gt; now (I know I need a trim lol)\n\nThings I do that are bad:\n-use a hairdryer (shark flexstyle) and hair straightener once per week. I have curly hair that I refuse to embrace (at least not right now)\n-balayage. Never more than 2x/yr. \n\nWhat I’m doing to help:\n-sleep with silk bonnet \n-only shampoo 1x/week\n-rarely put my hair in a ponytail or bun. If I do it’s only to exercise and like for 1hr max \n\nProducts:\n-Kirkland shampoo and conditioner (limited in shampoo options due to allergy)\n-ouai anti-frizz crème\n-Moroccan oil frizz shield spray\n-ouai oil on ends \n-k18 molecular repair mask 1-2x/mo\n\nAny recommendations? Products? Can’t really change shampoo and not looking to embrace natural hair (sorry) but otherwise open to any recommendations. Thank you!! ",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

My college is in Hyderabad, where the weather is usually dry  and my skin is perfectly fine there, more on the normal to slightly dry side.\n\nBut every time I go to Bombay for internships (where my family also stays), my skin completely changes. It becomes extremely oily, sweaty, and sticky the moment I step out. Since I’m constantly running around in formal clothes for court/office, by noon my skin looks super shiny, dull, sticky and just... disheveled. Like not the glowy kind of oily, it's the tired, heavy, “why does my face feel like it’s melting” kind. And it feels uncomfortable ngl\n\nI’ve tried blotting papers, which help for a while but even after that my skin feels heavy and sticky for some reason. I also tried the Innisfree No Sebum Powder, but it made my skincare kind of pill (that weird rolling feeling on the skin), and I hate that texture.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\n\nMorning:\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n2. L’Oréal Revitalift Serum\n3. L’Oréal Revitalift Hyaluronic Acid Cream\n4. Dot and Ket Watermelon Sunscreen\n\n\nNight:\n\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n2. Earth Rhythm Serums (I alternate between the CLEAR SKIN SERUM and 10% NIACINAMIDE SERUM)\n3. Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer\n\n\nI don’t wear makeup daily, maybe just sunscreen and Etude water tint. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, but my skin just hates Bombay weather. Is it the humidity? My routine? Any product or routine adjustments that could help?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice, I’m tired of looking like a greaseball by lunchtime 😭",
