      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is Part 2 / update to my [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/1pn678r/i_emailed_indian_sunscreen_brands_asking_for_iso/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) where I mentioned reaching out to sunscreen brands to verify their SPF, UVA, and water-resistance claims.\n\nI waited over a month before posting this update so brands had sufficient time to respond. Below is a factual summary of what I asked and what I received.\n\n**What I requested (same from all brands):**  \nISO 24444: SPF in-vivo test report (with lab name &amp; accreditation)  \nISO 24442 or ISO 24443: UVA protection test report (with numerical UVA-PF / critical wavelength data)  \nWater resistance testing (WR40 / WR80), if applicable\n\n# Responses after ~1 month\n\n# 🟢 High transparency\n\n**Re’equil**\n\n→ Shared full ISO 24444 SPF report, UVA data, and water-resistance testing (WR40/WR80).\n\n→ Detailed documentation provided.\n\n# 🟡 Partial transparency\n\n**The Derma Co (Honasa)**\n\n→ Directed to a publicly available “Certificate of Sunscreen Efficacy Testing” on their product page.\n\n→ Certificate confirms: In-vivo SPF testing as per ISO 24444:2019 (SPF ≈ 50) In-vitro UVA assessment (critical wavelength ≈ 379 nm)\n\n→ Full test reports and water-resistance data were not shared.\n\n**Minimalist**\n\n→ Shared ISO 24444 in-vivo SPF report.\n\n→ When asked specifically for water-resistance testing (WR40/WR80 or ISO 16217/18861) to support their “80-minute water resistance” claim, the request was escalated but no documentation was shared even after 1+ month.\n\n**La Shield (Glenmark)**\n\n→ Shared numerical SPF/UVA values via email.\n\n→ No test date, full methodology, or lab accreditation details were shared\n\n# 🔴 No data shared (after 30+ days)\n\nThe following brands acknowledged the request, raised tickets, or said they would revert, but did not share any SPF/UVA/WR documentation even after 30+ days:\n\n* Aqualogica\n* Conscious Chemist\n* Brinton (UV Doux)\n* IPCA (Acne UV Gel)\n* Blynds\n* Photostable\n* Episoft\n\nFor this update, lack of response after 30+ days (despite tickets or acknowledgements) has been treated as an outcome, not a pending state.\n\n**Scope note:** Brands listed were selected based on products frequently mentioned on this sub and those I personally used or see recommended. This is not an exhaustive list of all Indian sunscreens.\n\n***Edit:*** *A few people suggested emailing additional brands. I won’t be expanding the scope further at this point, this update reflects only the brands I had already contacted and responses received within a fixed time window. I may revisit this in the future, but not right now.*",

It's getting closer, but I've been really struggling with curl definition and frizz (thanks, Texas humidity!), but I switched up my routine a bit on yesterday's wash day and I've got the best results so far! Any other tips for fighting frizz are welcome!\n\nRoutine:\n1. Wash with Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration (I clarified last week)\n2. Garnier Hair Filler + Bonding for 5 minutes (new)\n3. Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration conditioner and detangle\n4. While still in shower and hair is dripping wet, apply Aussie Sprunch mousse + leave-in conditioner \n5. Shake head so hair isn't dripping, but still really wet to get out of shower (new)\n6. Apply small amount of Lush Super Milk (not really enough to do anything, I just like the smell 😁)\n7. Section top of hair into two sections and apply Ouidad Advanced Climate Control strong hold gel generously \n8. Brush through and style with Denman brush\n9. Scrunch out excess water with microfiber towel\n10. Apply a light layer of watered down gel \n11. Spray EVA NYC Shapeshifter hair spray (newish- I've done this a few times)\n12. Hover diffuse on low speed and low heat until 60% dry, then air dry the rest of the way (new, as I had been diffusing until 100% dry, which I don't think my hair liked)\n13. Slept in satin bonnet then shook hair at the roots this morning and sprayed a little water and did a dry SOTC\n\nEdit: added step 11 that I forgot",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "Hello, I hope everyone is doing well.\n\nMy post is about the title. I am growing my hair out. To start giving you some context, I have low porosity, medium thickness, and medium to high density (please correct me if I'm wrong, haha). Finally, I have loose curls, meaning 3A (again, correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nAlso, sometimes I don't know how to style it, and sometimes it's curlier and other times it's not. There are times when my curls are very flat. I would like it to be curlier and, as I mentioned in the title, for the curls to stay.\n\nMy routine is as follows: first of all, I use Ponto's curly hair shampoo, and as a conditioner, I also use Ponto's 3-in-1 Hydration Treatment. For styling, I start by detangling my hair with a wide-tooth comb (obviously very wet). For products, I use Ponto's Wavy/Frizzy Hair Styling Cream, and I apply it using the hands-in-prayer method and then scrunch. Finally, I use the gel from the same brand, Ponto, called Recover your curls(I apply a very small amount of this).\n\nI usually air dry my hair. I have a diffuser, but due to time constraints, I only use it for 10 minutes at most. To protect my hair while I sleep, I don't really use anything, and I don't usually do a refresh routine. If you can recommend one, I'd appreciate it.\n\nWhat should I do? Try other products? I've heard that it's good to use a clarifying shampoo, but if you could confirm whether that's true, that would be great. I've never had layers cut either, so I don't know if I should try it. Someone also recommended curl foam instead of gel.\n\nI would really appreciate your help with my questions. Any advice would be welcome.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

It feels tight and even water makes it burn.\n\nI tried a few home remedies, some soothing oils, and kojic acid, but nothing has helped and I think I may have damaged my skin barrier.\n\nCan anyone recommend very gentle, healing products that helped calm irritation and repair the barrier?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated.

My hair always seems to lose the wave over time, and I can never keep it overnight no matter what I try. \n\nMy wash routine today was:\n\n1. Shampoo twice with V&amp;Co Wavy Shampoo\n\n2. Condition once with V&amp;Co Wavy Conditioner and scrunch it in\n\n3. Spray NYM Curl Talk leave in conditioner to my ends\n\n4. Run a tiny amount of Prose curl cream (dime sized) through my hair\n\n5. Define sections using a bounce curl brush\n\n6. Ouai wave spray in each section and scrunch it in\n\n7. Run NYM curl talk level 3 gel through my hair and scrunch\n\n8. Scrunch out most of the water with a microfiber towel\n\n8. Plop for 5-10 minutes with a Kitsch microfiber towel\n\n9. Diffuse until mostly dry\n\n10. Once fully dry, scrunch out the (slight) crunch with a little bit of Olaplex #7 oil\n\nThis routine is just not sustainable for me. Between the length of time it takes and the fact that it leaves my hair looking stringy and feeling a bit product-y by the end of the day, it just isn’t suitable long term. My usual routine if I’m styling my hair is 1 (except I only shampoo once usually), 2, 3, 6, 9. Otherwise I air dry and don’t put product in besides the leave in. \n\nAny advice would be really appreciated, TIA!",

I used the Ion Bright White Crème Lightener and the Ion Sensitive 20 Developer.\n\nThe roots and some back pieces turned out very yellow which is a huge contrast from the rest of my hair which is a more icy tone (a bit purple too from all the purple shampoo I used trying to fix the yellow.) \n\nI forgot to take out small brown pieces for it to blend better, I just did an all over bleach on the roots. Now everything is very patchy. I will get this fixed professionally, but what options can I expect? How would you guys go about fixing this? I’d rather now dye it a darker color because my goal is an all over blonde with little brown. Thank you for any advice!! It’s very much appreciated!!",

It oscillates between beautiful bouncy waves and being straight and kinda bleh (see photos). I have been wanting to embrace my curls, but whenever I try, it seems like my hair is weighed down with product and gets greasy. I'm not entirely sure how I achieved the waves in the photo, but here is what I have tried. I'v studied this reddit extensively, and am in need to some advice!\n\nCurrent Routine:\n\n1. Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Conditioner and MorrocanOil Curl Shampoo, with \\~biweekly Malibu Undo Goo clarifying and Ouai Curl Creme and Neuma NEU Styling Mousse - this was working when I had longer hair (1x a week wash) and if I finger curled and then slept in it, but now that it's a bit shorter, it just weighs it down.\n2. I have tried to switch to a mousse only approach and have tried the following products:\n\na)  Innersense I create Definition Mousse raked into soaking wet hair (as well as microplopping with cotton as a variation), hover diffuse at 45 degree angle -- this barely lasted a day before everything went straight and greasy and I had to wash my hair and clarify afterwards.\n\nb) Briogeo Style + Treat raked into soaking wet hair (as well as microplopping with cotton as a variation), hover diffuse at 45 degree angle -- this lasts maybe 1-2 days before not being refreshable. Also tried this with the NYM Curl Talk Gel with praying hands and that fell flat before the day was done.\n\nc) Mai Flexible Hold + Coco Milk Curl FOam Mousse scrunched into soaking hair with the NYM Curl Talk Gel praying hands - this did not give me a lot of definition and has not formed a cast.\n\n3. Have tried to switch to low-poo and the Kristen Ess Lightweight conditioner (after a clarifying shampoo) and while I think things are a bit better, I'm still not seeing my waves again!\n\nHere are my issues (that I think are) impeding my waves. Any and all advice would be helpful\n\n**1. I can never get my hair wet enough to achieve the 'seaweed' texture that people talk about. I feel like my hair does not absorb water in a normal way, but it still takes (literally!) 12+ hours to airdry and at least an hour with a diffuser on medium heat**\n\n**2. I can not get my hair to form a cast! My hair is always super soft and no matter how much or how little product I try, a cast does not show up!**\n\nAny tips or tricks are appreciated. I don't mind spending $ on product but really would love to get back to my 1x a week wash schedule with bouncy waves!",

It is pretty consistent all over my head however, I struggle to get curls from the root at the back of my head, only getting curls from the root at  the top front section, when i use curly products/curly-hair methods.  I know that I can have curly hair from the root because when it gets wet from the rain, it goes curly from the tops. But when I try to get it curly through plopping and with curly hair products, it doesn't take shape.\n\nFor reference, I use the curlsmith routine: shampoo, conditioner, gel and shower fixer. I have previously used Umberto Gianni and various other products to assess whether some products were too heavy and dragging it down but everything seems to end with the same result on the top. I also use a diffuser and try to dry upside down. I previously let it air-dry plopped in a hair turban. \n\nMy question is, has anybody experienced this and successfully rectified it? I would love to have my curly hair for a formal event coming up but I hate the flatness from the top. Any advice? ",

Lately, at-home IPL hair removal devices seem to be getting more attention, and I'm curious how people here think about these devices in general not as recommendations or medical advice, but as part of a broader beauty and self-care approach. For those who've used or considered at-home IPL devices:\n\n1) How do you decide whether a tool is worth keeping long-term versus skipping? \n\n2) Do you treat hair removal tools as part of your beauty routine, or as something completely separate? \n\n3) Do you find consistency with basics (skincare, haircare, grooming) matters more than adding devices? Not looking for product links, buying advice, or promotions just interested in experience-based perspectives and how others evaluate tools versus keeping routines simple.",
