I recently just cut off 3 inches of my bleached under dye to try and get rid of all of my split ends and breakage so on my acknowledgment of trying to keep my hair healthier I don’t know how often I should be washing my head. Should I base it off of how quickly my hair gets oily or should I wash it like twice a week which is what I do now.\n\nmy routine since it’s mandatory\n\nI use the not your mother’s curly bonding shampoo and conditioner on Sundays. I use the eva NYC deep conditioner.\n\nto style I use skala as my leave and not your mother‘s moose and the big papa gel\n\nusually all air dry if I have time, but if not, then I diffuse, which makes my hair look like shit. I don’t know if I’m just doing it wrong.\n\nalso, I use silk hair ties and the silk bonnet every night to sleep",

      "content": "I’ve been going to the same hairstylist for about two years now. We have great conversations, she sometimes gives me free trims, and I’ve recommended her to a lot of people (I’ve brought her multiple new clients). I was also one of her first regulars after she graduated cosmetology school, so we’ve kind of grown together.\n\nHere’s where I’m struggling.\n\nIn my area, there aren’t many hairstylists, especially blonding specialists. Recently, I’ve been low-key stalking the Instagram of another stylist. the girl who works at the chair behind hers. I LOVE her work. She focuses heavily on hair health and does the exact style I’m looking for.\n\nSome of the issues I’ve had with my current stylist:\n\t•\tShe bleaches over already bleached hair\n\t•\tMy balayage isn’t blended the way I like\n\t•\tMy inspo photos never really turn out how I want\n\t•\tI’m worried about long-term hair health\n\nI’ve tried to trust the process, but after two years, I still don’t feel like I’m getting the blonde I want.\n\nThe hard part is the emotional side. She calls me one of her favorite clients, we genuinely get along, and I feel bad because she’s been generous with me and I’ve supported her business from the start.\n\nBut at the same time… I’m spending a lot of money on my hair and I don’t love the results. The other stylist’s work aligns perfectly with what I want, especially her focus on keeping hair healthy.\n\nSo now I’m stuck between loyalty/guilt and doing what’s best for my hair.",

I’m looking for advice on if this is a communication mistake on my part or if something went wrong. Either way I plan on asking for a revision. \n\n  \nI have previously gotten a partial balayage from this person before and they did great. I have never gotten a full balayage or highlights, just partials, on my current hair. I decided I wanted to have a more dramatic hair lightening experience so I opted for a full this time. I didn’t show them a photo but I previously had pretty bright highlights so it seemed obvious to me that that’s what I am into. The hair dresser suggested I do some low lights with the balayage to add back in some more definition, which I happily agreed to. Then he asked me if I wanted him to “bring it all the way to the ends or not“ which he suggested not to do because it would be “too streaky.” I was hesitant but agreed, and I thought we were still talking about the low lights only. Then he got to work. \n\n  \nPhoto 1-3 is my hair after, 4 is before, and 5 is what I expected. What should I say? Is this my fault somehow? ",

I’m newer to being in LA while caring for my curls and I don’t trust a lot of “curl specialists” because wavy hair is kinda fragile and I’ve been burned in the past. Im overdue for a cut, and a fitting hair style is harder to find when there isn’t an existing one. Not looking for that same shag style cut everyone’s pushing for with coils hair because that doesn’t feel like me and I want to be able to do different styles. \n\nWash Routine: detox with Christophe Robin sea salt exfoliating scrub, shampoo with Curlsmith moisture cleanser, and then condition with Authentic Beauty Concept hydrating conditioner (gel like consistency, ran out of Curlsmith). I did squish to condish (scrunch with conditioner) and then tied it up in a bun to finish washing and shaving and then rinse. \n\nStyle/Dry Routine: After showering I brushed and then used Curlsmith hold me softly hair cream and then Curlsmith frizz rescue curl retainer gel and let air dry with some clips in. This is just scrunching in after brushing and no brush styling (trying to only brush style for holidays/special occasions). Still has a cast because I will use oil and scrunch out tomorrow using pineapple and a bonnet. \n\nWhat are you wavy ladies doing to find your wavy/textured stylist and haircut?

Honestly, I've always been clueless about my curly/wavy hair and no one to ever ask tbh.\n\nMost conditioners usually weigh down my hair a lot and I struggle with finding hair products that I'm not allergic to.\n\nFor a year my hair routine worked great until my hair started shedding like a dog, I was mortified because it came out of no where! I have kept the same gel and mousse but my new shampoo/conditioner is super drying. I tried to soak my ends in coconut oil but it was like it just vanished in my frizz.\n\nI was using volumizing shampoo and conditioner from Native (yikes, I know, but I swear it was working) Now I'm using Maui Moisture lightweight shampoo/conditioner. (Waaaay to drying.)\n\nThen I finger comb and squeeze curl mousse and gel from Herbal Essences and air dry.\nI wash my hair twice a week and use Eva Nye freshen up dry shampoo maybe once a week when my roots get a little greasy.\nI also only use satin pillow cases. A little note to make, I have two lock of hair I usually keep braided like rat tails, but they're usually two big ringlets. Rn they're so dry and frizzy though.\n\nNow, here's my problem. I have A LOT of allergies. I cant have any sort of proteins like soy or nuts, nor gluten or eggs. I know that's definitely hard when looking for good curly products.\n\nSince I have my two little \"padawan\" braids, my hair is at two different lengths unstyled. I knowwwww it looks pathetic right now trust me, taking a picture of the back of my head felt like a JUMPSCARE 😆🤡 The first picture was my curls at their peak even while using Native at the time. Legit any advice helps thank youuuu!",

Curls are losing shine and definition very quickly and I feel that my current shampoo and conditioner AG boost and balance is not hydrating enough. I do suffer from anemia which I am treating and my hair is also color treated but it’s so much worse than usual idk what to do. Im struggling to find a good duo as so many curl products have coconut oil which irritates my scalp. I’m looking for any shampoo/conditioner duo for hydration that is coconut oil free. Any price point and it doesn’t need to be a strictly curly hair shampoo. Also if you see anything in my routine that looks off let me know as I’m always wanting to hear feedback. Maybe it’s not even the shampoo and something else? Thank you! \n\nROUTINE\n\nDouble Shampoo 2x week with AG balance and condition with AG boost for one of these washes, deep condition with AG moisture mask the other. \n\nUse light amount of lush super milk for moisture on soaking wet hair then follow with either Amika curl leave in cream or fenty leave in cream. Scrunch a small amount of amika curl gel into ends. Let air dry or lightly diffuse if no time. **OCCASIONALLY** use fable and mane hair and scalp oil to break cast ",

I have dark hair naturally and just wanted natural looking slightly lighter hair.\n\nThis time I opted for a chocolate balayage (no bleach) but found I could barely see the colour. Went back in and asked if they could lighten the ends a bit but was told they would need to bleach for it. Took the plunge as I had already spent quite a bit and was disappointed to see no changes in colour. \n\nAfter bleaching they applied a reddish toner which I now absolutely hate - it’s far too light for me and I’m miserable every time I look in the mirror. What could I do to fix this? I read online about getting it toned again / Demi permanent gloss etc but I’m so lost. Also don’t want to spend a lot more money on this. Pictures attached - last photo is what it was previously after the first balayage. thank you!!",

Does anyone else feel this way?  \n\n\nI typically start my routine off with some coconut oil from OGX on the ends, and leave it for at least 10 minutes before i shower. In the shower, I use treseme shampoo, dove bond strength mask, then tresseme conditioner. \n\nWhen i get out of the shower, I wrap it in a hair towel for 5 or so minutes. Then I’ll go in with leave in products such as Not Your Mothers wavy leave in spray, and then I’ll go in with a veryyyyy small amount of the Olaplex No 6 and mix that in with Not Your Mothers air dry cream and olaplex oil. \n\n\nAfter i do all that, I will actually go back with a spray bottle and re-soak my hair, and allow my hair to air dry afterwards. For some reason this has been the best way to form my waves. I’ve tried scrunching, curl/wave specific products, diffusing, etc—but i feel like my wave pattern doesn’t suit these methods. I like the way my waves naturally form on their own without any mechanical manipulation to them. And i find that wave/curl specific products really weight down my hair. \n\nBut yeah this is my routine 😇\n\n ",
