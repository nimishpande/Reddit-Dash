My routine was wash and deep condition, use product(cantu) and a gel, then put it in small twists, and I would maybe leave it in the twists before taking it out and leaving it for a couple of days, then repeat. But I feel like it doesn’t look as good as I can make it, please help me!!

I still have some of it left… its good i use it once in a while.\n\n What actually helped? \nInitially this hair active serum helped me\nThen i switched to DIY rosemary spray … nothing fancy just boil some rosemary (got it from blinkit under 30 rs) and some methi dana ( fenugreek seeds)… this literally lasted me for 3 months… i store it in a glass bottle in the fridge and keep transferring it to my small spray bottle\nI use it 3-4 times a day \nIt does not make your hair oily … infact it makes your scalp fresh and less itchy\nYou have to massage your hair a little everytime you apply it ( if your hair is too brittle, i suggest don’t massage with pressure… just use your fingertips)\n\nI switched my pillowcase to a satin pillowcase\nI travel quite often so i have this satin haircover that i use everynight.\nTie your hair before sleeping.\n\nP.S. give yourself atleast 2 months to see a noticeable difference \n\nP.S 2 - i know this is not a 180 degrees result but its way better than the second picture. \n1st picture was clicked on diwali ( i straightened my hair) \n2nd was taken in july 1st week",

I've tried a few things, this is my current best, and wow it's an improvement. I'm low-key shocked that my hair is this curly??\n\nI'm trying my best to take care of my hair while also navigating what's bullshit or just OTT. I also don't actually know if I like how this looks? I feel like it looks straggely? Am I just not used to it yet or am I right that it's not as fluffy natural hair looking as I would expect?\n\nThis is about 5 mins after finishing my *new* routine:\nShampoo (kerastase oily roots dry ends) just roots X2\nConditioner (just used tresemme this time but ordinarily kerastase colour protect) mids to ends, let sit 5 mins.\nOnce a month I skip conditioner and do k18 leave in conditioner (sometimes I do it more rarely, p.s. it says on the bottle to skip conditioner)\nI then added Umberto Giannini curl jelly raked through my hair and then scrunched and diffused (high heat, low speed)\nThat's it. I usually spray a little hair oil (nix?) on the ends but this curl jelly has made all my hair look almost too shiny? Is that just me?? So I skipped the oil this time.\n\nThat's it. I struggle with hygiene so this is about my max for how much effort I can put in. I use a detangler/tangle teaser rip off hairbrush. And I get my colour done professional by a colour specialist. \n\nDoes this look good and I need to just adjust or am I right that something I can't put my finger on looks off?\n\nAlso hair cut advice please! Bangs looked BAD on me, so maybe don't suggest that (also too much maintenance), I recently got a shag cut which I think I love! But any advice on a cut for my curl type and face shape would be much appreciated!!\n\nThanks so much!!",

My hair feels completely fine using the cream I use right now, so I feel like it’s getting enough hydration, my issue is the lack of definition. My hair is like 3A/3B I think, but sometimes the curls just don’t curl and I hate it \n\nFor context my current routine is just regular washing and conditioning with whatever is in the shower at the time (sometimes it’s dove, sauve etc) and then applying Aunt Jackie’s curl Lala custard and that’s it. I just put some in my hands and scrunch my hair and then let it air dry. I know there’s got to be a routine better than this for me but I don’t know enough to figure it out. I also need help with shampoo and conditioning recommendations",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\nI really need some guidance from people who understand skin healing and long-term damage.\n\nAbout 6–7 years ago, I made a terrible mistake — I used a dermaroller very aggressively on my face (too deep, too often, and without proper hygiene or aftercare). At first, I thought it would help my acne scars, but over time my facial skin completely changed.\n\nHere’s what’s been happening since then:\n\nMy face becamm 25M , dull, and lifeless compared to my natural color — my chest and neck are still good, so the contrast is huge.\n\nMy skin doesn’t reflect light anymore — it feels thick, leathery, and dehydrated, almost like it’s covered in a layer that hides my real complexion.\n\nIt’s also super sensitive — most products sting, and exfoliation or actives make things worse.\n\nI don’t get acne anymore, but the texture looks uneven, and I’ve lost that natural brightness and smoothness I once had.\n\n\nFrom my own research, I think I developed fibrosis or over-healed collagen from that trauma — basically scar-like tissue beneath the surface that’s blocking oxygen and light reflection. I know my skin still has potential because the rest of my body is proof — I just need to find the right way to reverse or remodel this damage safely.\n\nIt’s been years, and I’ve tried being patient, but I want to finally take control of this.\nSo my questions are:\n\nWhat are the best medical or dermatological treatments to soften fibrotic skin and restore natural tone and texture?\n\nHas anyone here experienced something similar and seen real improvement?\n\nAre treatments like Laser Genesis, RF microneedling, PRP, or subcision worth considering for collagen remodeling after this kind of damage?\n\nAnd how do I rebuild my skin barrier first before doing anything intensive?\n\n\nI know my skin can look great again — I just need to follow the right approach.\nWould really appreciate detailed advice or even stories from anyone who’s managed to bring their skin back after long-term microneedling or dermaroller damage.\n\nThanks so much in advance. 🙏\n",

      "content": "Hello!\n\nDuring the summer I tried my best to take care of my curls but I couldn’t figure out a routine. I’m not even sure what hair type I have because it looks different after EVERY wash, but I think it’s somewhere around 2A-2C?\n\nI think I have Irish curls, as the outer layers of my curls are super curly and then the inside of my hair is almost pin straight. I heard somewhere Irish curls is a myth and is just extreme heat damage, which is possible because I’ve straightened my hair twice every week for about 2-3 years. I’m honestly just really tired of it and I’m not sure what to do.\n\nI haven’t straightened my hair at all this week and I try refreshing it in the mornings by finger combing with wet hands, but it always looks…bad… even when I tried to take care of it in the summer I could never get to day 2 looking good… help 😫",

      "content": "\n\na little background, i have always had cystic acne since puberty , did accutane when i was 17, acne went away for two years, and then it came back even worse, causing this horrible texture that is like deep under my skin, i have these small raised patches and bumps that arent even red or painful around my mouth, and just constant pimples around my mouth. the bumps and acne scars around my smile lines are also increasing the appearance of my smile lines and its driving me nuts. i tried oral spironolactone and had bad side effects so had to stop, even though it really helped. but even as my skin cleared while i was on it, this weird under skin bumpyness persisted. now im doing tret and topical spiro but it just doesnt feel like its unclogging this weird deep texture. and i never used to have this, it was always just deep cysts but now its this texture as well. its truly driving me insane, im 25 now and have been dealing with this since 15, but my acne now feels worse than when i was teenager. no clue what to do anymore, i just want to find a way to just completely flush out my skin on a deep level. is it possible that the spiro could be contributing to this weird clogging? any advice appreciated whether products or lifestyle. really want to see if anyone else has had a similar experience to this. also rn i use la roche posay cleanser and moisturizer and pyunkang yul cleansing balm for double cleanse.",
