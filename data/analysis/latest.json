      "content": "So I've been taking finasteride for years now and it's helped pause my hair loss but I decided randomly to stop taking it for two months just because.\n\nFirst off I thought I didn't have any sides as generally I've been able to have strong erections and have sex about 1 or 2 times a week with my long term girlfriend and didn't really notice anything else out of the ordinary.\n\nNow that I've been off of the meds for a little over a month and a half l've noticed a HUGE increase in my sex drive. Like I literally have to have sex or masturbate if my girls not available every day.  I didn't even know I had a reduced sex drive as I considered myself to have a relatively normal and healthy sex life but man it's constant now.\n\nl've also noticed a difference in my mood. I never had a low or bad mood while on fin but off of fin l've noticed I'm more energetic and slightly happier/more confident. It's more subtle than the sex drive part but it's noticeable. I noticed I'm just kind of having more fun in general. It's hard to quantify.\n\nThat being said I've just started noticing more shedding and my scalp feels sorta irritable. I don't want to loose my hair so I'm going to end up going back on fin but I wanted to post my story for others as I thought I had zero side effects but in reality I just didn't noticed them. There are trade offs with this kinda thing especially when you're altering hormones so you gotta decide what's important to you.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I have large pores on my cheeks and some hyperpigmentation, especially with a friend's wedding coming up in just 10 days. I am looking to get my skin looking its best before the big day and I wanted to know what treatments or products you would recommend for these concerns.\n\n If you’ve had similar skin issues, what treatments or routines worked best for you? Should I go for something like a facial, chemical peel, or perhaps some good skincare products? Any tips for getting visible results in this short amount of time?\n\nThanks so much in advance for your help!",

      "content": "Hi all! \n\nSo, I'm hoping to ask if anyone has advice on a good shampoo (+ conditioner) for tight curls that are washed daily. (Sorry for the long post!) \n\nMy siblings and I all have curly hair, but different tightness of curls. My older sister is currently in the process of learning how to care for her hair for the first time, and since I have experience with my own curls, I'm making her a gift basket with products and instructions/guides/resources (including this subreddit!). \n\nMy concern is that my sister washes her hair every day and is super not open to co-washing or skipping days. (She gets germ anxiety, so daily showers are really important to her.) Her hair is already pretty dry and since she washes daily, I'm wondering if people have recommendations for good shampoos that are easy on dry hair for daily washing. I know its trial and error! But hoping for advice on a good starting point.\n\nShe has ringlet curls (not super tight/small, but moderately tight, defined, spiral curls through most of her hair) that sits at about her shoulder blades. I can tell its dry and I have plans to give some nice conditioner(s) (daily, leave in, and deep condition), but I'm worried that most curl-friendly shampoos I've used before will be too rough for her daily routine. I know to avoid sulfates and silicones and whatnot, but I'm wondering if anyone could provide specific recs or suggestions for daily washers. \n\n(She's also on estrogen/hrt, which I know can affect things, but I figure that's more trial and error.)\n\n\n[The routine I'm planning to recommend: with lots of trial and error recommended\n\n-- start with a clarifying shampoo for initial wash (reuse clarifying shampoo only when product builds up - I used to do once a month, but I'll recommend adjusting based on what she sees)\n-- some sort of soft shampoo for daily use \n-- deep condition (im looking at the wiki guide for advice) (planning to recommend that she starts by deep conditioning 1-2 times per month)\n-- air drying daily (hopefully diffuser for events/big days, but she doesnt like to spend much time) \n-- curl creme for daily use \n-- curl gel for events/big hair days \n\nI think that roughly covers it?]",

After the situation was dealt with the acne stayed (although it improved significantly). Even now, months later I’m struggling though I don’t feel stressed at all.\n\nRight now I’m only using the Cetaphil gentle SA Cleanser because I want to just take a minute to figure out what to do before making it worse. But I’ve also tried mandelic acid, Dr gross exfoliating pads, retinol(if that helps?), oil cleansing(made it worse). \n\nI’ve looked into Microneedling but my injector/esthi I told me that she’d rather I clear the active acne first. \n\nI’m so discouraged and I don’t know what to do. My skin has never really been sensitive! Should I book a dermatologist appointment and try tret? I just miss feeling comfortable in my own skin. :.(\n\nThis is bared faced and the other side is similar but not as extreme.

I've tried a fair amount of products at this point but haven't struck gold on a routine yet and don't want to spend a ton of money on more options that aren't quite right.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n* Shampoo with Curlsmith Essential Moisture (once every 6 weeks, I use Malibu Un-Do-Goo instead of regular shampoo)\n* Follow up with ketoconazole shampoo (applied only to scalp/roots)\n* Condition with Curlsmith Essential Moisture\n* Apply Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream to soaking hair\n* Wrap in microfiber towel\n* Apply Curlsmith Flexi Jelly to damp hair using prayer hands &amp; then scrunch\n* Diffuse in sections\n\nI've noticed that all the moisture tends to weigh my hair down, so the past few washes I've changed one product at a time to see what happens:\n\n* Using Giovanni \"mousse air turbo-charged\" foam instead of the air dry cream gives me much better volume, though definition isn't great (I'd guess this is about the amount of gel I used rather than the foam - not sure about protein content &amp; whether that would impact things)\n* Using amika Plus Size Perfect Body mousse also gives better volume than the air dry cream, but not quite as much as the foam\n* Using Giovanni \"smooth as silk\" conditioner makes my hair angry (protein conditioners and my hair do *not* get along in my experience, but wanted to confirm since my texture has changed!) - I wound up supplementing with amika normcore because the smooth as silk felt so bad when I was using it, and even so my hair felt fried when it was dry\n* Using amika normcore shampoo and/or conditioner makes my curls more voluminous/not so limp and undefined vs when I do moisture-heavy shampoo &amp; conditioner\n* Before buying my current Curlsmith products, I'd been using amika normcore &amp; hydro rush shampoo and conditioner - the hydro rush tended to weigh my hair down if I used it for every wash, but if I mixed it with normcore or alternated between the two that worked well; I'm just hesitant to stick with amika following some horror stories\n* I would try more Curlsmith stuff but everything I'm interested in only comes full-size and I don't want to spend like $200 on products that don't work\n\nTL;DR my hair needs moisture but not too much, and I try to avoid protein too, so I'm looking for lightweight options that'll help with volume &amp; curl definition. Would love any advice on products to try!",

But these are really small bumps and its hard not soft. I am 21M and for the past 6 months these pimple type things popped up on my face. I used Fexo120 (Fexofenadine Hydrochloride)as I have allergy problems. When i used to take fexo and slept overnight, in the morning the pimples used to reduce. I also used the Halobet 0.05% (Halobetasol Pripionate) ointment. When I used these the pimple like things would reduce a little bit didn't vanished entirely. Untill a few weeks back these also stopped working. Now I take Fexo180 and use the ointment overnight also but its not working anymore. \n\nSome may think this could be because of adolescence and all but no I left that phase 2 years ago already when i had pimples covered my face for a long time. This is something happening due to allergy as far as I think. \n\nI went to Bangkok for allergy but doctor gave me Staquis(Crisaborole 2%) ointment and Desloratadine Sandoz 5g medicine and told me to use these and your face will recover in a months or so but its been 3 months since and I see no improvements. So doctor told me to visit her again. As I dont have enough spare time I have to go after a few months. \n\nSo I want to have the suggestions of y'all. If anyone have faced these problems please let me know what should I do to fix these. Its very embarrassing for me. I also became really really insecure because of this. These are hideous. Please help me get rid of these. Thank you.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

For almost my whole childhood, my parents treated my hair as straight hair (brushing it through etc etc) and i always thought i just had frizzy hair but only like this year have i realized that OH! my hair is wavy/curly.  \nMy brothers hair is like really curly too but it's short so he's useless for advice.\n\nOn a good day (days i shower) the curls are pretty prominent, however my hair is still really frizzy after it dries. But then when i sleep it becomes a tanged mess ofcourse and is untamable. I use the TRESemmé bouncy curls shampoo and Coditioner (i dont really have the option of looking for something better because we dont really have the money to finance it).\n\nmy hair also really dry i believe so i need tips on how to hydrate it?  \nI have a really busy routine so it's really hard to even shower for a long time.\n\nI dont really know what to do to maintain these curls. On days that i havent showered they are a wild jungle of a mess and i get frustrated and brush them through which looks like really ugly.\n\ni think it's a combination of dry hair and my lack of knowledge because despite so many things online i cant really understand.\n\ni believe my hair is 2C to 3A ish. Honestly, theyve got a mind of their own.\n\nHow can I hydrate them so theyre not frizzy? (other than oiling) and what type of routine do i need for improvement? is there something i can make at home? what is a curl cream and do i really need those fancy products?  \nAlso how do i keep my hair from not descending into a tangled mess overnight?\n\nAlso im looking for haircut options for me. my hair comes to like just above my mid back. Would layers be good to lessen the volume?",
