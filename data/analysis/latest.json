I only shampoo my scalp and let the foam run down, then condition the mid to ends and detangle while it’s wet. Once a week I use a hair mask instead of conditioner and that helped a lot. After the shower I don’t towel dry, I put my curl cream on while it’s still soaking wet and scrunch, then add a bit of gel. I squeeze the water out with a T-shirt, let it dry without touching it, and once it’s fully dry I scrunch with a little serum. Way less frizz and way more definition so far 😌\n\nProducts I use:\n\nJoviality Curl Wonder Shampoo\n\nBless Conditioner\n\nRaw African Maya Hair Mask\n\nThe Hair Addict Frizz-Off Curl Activator\n\nBio Soft Flaxseed Gel\n\nLocken Glossy Hair Serum",

Embarrassed about going to the doctor because what would i even say that i just picked at my skin for hours til it bled?\n\nIn the photos you can see that my lower lip is really swollen and the bottom of my chin too for some reason.\n\nAny advice on how to heal this quicker without scarring would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you\n\nAlso sorry for any typos or errors.\n\nTLDR: excessive plucking on chin til it bled and now the area around it is red and swollen and hurts. ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "This might be a little neurotic, but I’m curious if anyone else does this.\n\nWhen I do my skincare, I only use one hand to actually touch my face. My dominant hand handles the packaging (picking up bottles, jars, tubes, pumping or squeezing the product), and I dispense everything onto my other hand, which stays “clean”.\n\nProducts that have lids that require two hands to open are loosened prior to washing and drying my hands. Once one hand touches the outside of the packaging, I think of it as less clean. So the hand that never touches the bottle or jar is the only one that touches my face.\n\nI don’t think this is a form of OCD as I’m not obsessive about skincare or even particularly compulsive about this particular method of applying it, it’s just something that makes logical sense to me.\n\nSkincare products are kept closed for a reason; you don’t leave lids off because bacteria and dust would just creep in. So in my mind, the outside of the packaging isn’t exactly “clean”, even if my hands are freshly washed prior to handling.\n\nDoes anyone else do something similar, or am I just overthinking it?",

Is adapalene gel actually that good, or is it some marketing strategy said dermatologist is using?\n2. If it is as good as they say and gives the seeked results, **how can I incorporate it into my skincare routine?** I'm using glycolic acid toner, centella tone brightening serum, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, cosrx snail mucin (occasionally), eye cream, moisturizer and then medicube's new pdrn pink collagen cream (contains salmon DNA).\n3.

      "content": "Hey there! I know NOTHING about skincare, so please be gentle.❤️ But I did some research months ago and decided to buy these products (pictures below). My face dries really fast. Even slightly patting my face with a towel dries all of the water, so I try to pat as lightly as I possibly can. Then I apply 2 drops of HA, 2 drops of Niacinamide, wait until it dries (about 15-20 seconds), and then I apply a big pea sized moisturiser. After about 3-5 minutes, my face feels a little bit dry again. Sometimes a tiiiiny bit firm, but nothing dramatic.\n\nAm I using the wrong products? Am I using them wrong? Am I possibly using too much, or too little?\n\nHabits and skin type:\n\nNot sure how to describe my face’s skin type. It’s dry, but also oily. My nose and forehead are the most oily. My cheeks tend to get dry thin flakes every now and then. I drink over 1,5L of water a day. Usually more. I do however not wash and moisturise my face daily. I struggle a lot mentally and tend to neglect self care sometimes, but I’m working on getting better. Could not washing and moisturising my face daily possibly be a part of the problem?\n\nAny and all advice and help are more than welcome! Thank you for reading, and thank you in advance!🫶",

      "content": "I am 16 female from India and I am really confused but my hair type is I think it's very somewhere between 2A to 1B but the hair routines that I have been I don't really work.. I have been trying to adopt a routine using like beginner level stuff such as a light weight curly cream and styling serum gel after my regular hair wash with loreal hyaluron moisture range-shampoo and sometimes conditioner.....I used to simply wash my hair and after washing it and comb it through while raking it in the products and just scrunching them and letting them air dry after but the waves were not defined and it was difficult to style since the waves would fall out literally the next day or within the drying period( image 1) also it was take really long to dry my hair and I don't really have a difuser so yeah ... It was giving me the not good enough result so I basically dropped the routine for a few days now .. yesterday after a lot of thought I tried the bowl method, it was my first time trying that so I just detangled my hair and then I just dipped into water and scrunched up without any products and this was the wave pattern after drying (image 2-4).. I don't really know how to feel about my hair because it's just somewhere in between and it's really difficult to wear outside because of this and defined, frizzy and unexplainable pattern that cannot get styled without trouble.. I would really appreciate some help and advise on what to do with my hair because it's hitting my confidence at this point..",
