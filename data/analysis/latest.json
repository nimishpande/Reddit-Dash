      "content": "An update from my previous post a few months ago:\n\nI’m currently on 0.5mg of dutasteride and 5mg of minoxidil, still no side effects at all.\n\nJanuary 2024 - Although I could notice my temples getting bigger since 2019, this is where I started to notice my hair was getting very thin and it would only grow a few inches compared to the hair on the back or sides of my head.\n\nJune 2024 - In those 6 months it got really bad and I started to thin very rapidly, I was formally diagnosed with AGA and started only with 2.5mg minoxidil as I was very scared of side effects from 5ARls. (In hindsight I should’ve been more scared of the sides from oral minoxidil but I was ignorant). \n\nSeptember 2024 - Decided to bite the bullet and started with 0.5mg dutasteride every other day (skipped finasteride since I wanted the absolute highest chance of regrowth).\n\nDecember 2024 - Jumped to 0.5mg dutasteride daily (this is were I started to see drastic improvement)\n\nApril 2025 - Jumped to 5mg minoxidil daily, didn’t notice much improvement vs 2.5mg.\n\nJanuary 2026 - Still running the same stack since April, I am letting my hair grow this time (I thought I’d never have long hair again and I’m so thankful I’m able to now). I do notice the bottom “half” of my hair is a lot more dense than the top half, likely due to more hairs in anagen coming up vs when the top half grew out. \n\nI also have Acquired Progressive Kinking of the Hair, which makes my sideburns incredibly curly, it seems to be linked to aggressive hair loss but there is very little scientific literature on it. This did improve but only by about 15%.\n\nAside from that I have basically reversed all my hair loss excluding the hairline, (although it did thicken a bit) I am looking to get a small hair transplant in the future to get back to NW0.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions!",

I feel like I’m so critical about my hair that I can’t tell what looks good anymore because im just staring at it for so long. I live in New England and I feel like winters are the worst. I feel like it makes my hair boring and flat and dry. \n\nI tried a new styling routine today and want advice on if I’m in the right direction or not or what even am I doing. Am I being overly dramatic and too much of a perfectionist or what.\n\nAlso a note I am getting a haircut next week but last time I saw someone they ruined my hair and I cried for like a month.\n\nRoutine;\n\nBrushed out my hair before the shower\n\nIn the shower double shampoo with all soft mega curls \n\nPut in all soft mega curls conditioner on hair only below my ears, clipped it up for about 10 minutes\n\nHalfway rinsed it out and brushed in the shower and then fully rinsed before getting out of the shower \n\n(This routine is slightly different than what I was doing before that wasn’t working)\n\nOut of the shower i re wet my hair, sectioned it above my ears and added very little leave in(ouidad frizz control),  Ouai curl cream, lots of mousse (NYM), very little gel diluted with water(NYM flash freeze) and then I used a bounce curl defining brush to brush style my curls in sections (hoping to avoid any middle parting in the back by doing this). After I brush style I added more mousse and then scrunched with a t shirt. I repeated this on all sections over my whole head and then I diffused starting by hovering on a cold setting, and then flipped my head upside down and diffused on medium heat then flipped my head side to side and then straight up. My hair was crunchy and then I scrunched it out with olaplex oil. so my areas of concern are my hair curled better in the back towards the top of my head and curled more around the top of my head but it seems to be falling flat and has light frizz (although I’m not sure I’ll be able to get rid of all frizz). I feel like I generally have more volume (could be just this New England winter) I also have not gone outside and probably won’t until tomorrow when I have to go to work. I sleep with a satin bonnet over a pineapple and if I refresh I do water and sometimes rizzos curl refresh spray, have no tried that with this new routine yet however.\n\nCurly hair is not for the weak it’s brutal out here lol",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Occasionally I use a barrier cream on top of all of this, which is the experiment molecular mesh. I have been on this exact routine for about 5-6 months now. Recently I have also been using the l’oreal bright reveal peel for the past 2.5 weeks.\n\nI do work nightshift so I rarely wear any spf. But my “am” routine or whenever I wake up I use the redness relief foaming cleanser by cetaphil and top it off with the redness relief moisturizer. My spf I use is the beauty of joseon one.\n\nI would love any advice for what I should do for this! It affects my confidence a lot, especially in bright lighting it becomes very obvious to me.\n\nI feel like I’ve tried EVERYTHING under the sun and my skin just hates me. :( It is super reactive and sensitive to some stuff and it gets irritating to me :(\n\nHere is just some of the stuff I have tried\n\n\\-the ordinary azelaic acid 10% (broke me out like crazy)\n\n\\-the ordinary glycolic acid toner (damaged my skin barrier)\n\n\\-the ordinary salicylic acid 2% solution (broke me out)\n\n\\-panoxyl 4% and 10% foaming wash (both didn’t do anything after a 1.5 year of usage)\n\n\\-panoxyl clarifying exfoliant (did nothing)\n\n\\-basically all of the ceraVe cleansers, hydrating, foaming, acne, SA (the SA and acne one broke me out super bad while the other two just didn’t cleanse my skin enough and caused blackheads)\n\n\\-De La Cruz sulfur mask (didn’t do anything and ended up burning my skin)\n\n\\-la roche posay triple lipikar moisturizer (too sticky)\n\n\\-la roche posay purifying foaming cleanser (dried out my skin)\n\n\\-la roche posay hydrating cleanser was good but I liked the one I currently use better\n\nThank you for reading/helping!!! :)\n\n\\#productrequest",

When I left, even after two washes, the product was still in my hair, to the point where my hair looked extremely greasy, practically dripping, and it felt just as bad but the instructor told me I needed to leave the product in for 24hrs for it to really work. So I did. After 24 hours I got in a shower, I rinsed my hair for a while, really working my fingers through, then washed it, scrubbing my scalp and even through to the ends as hard as I could, five times. I even used Head and Shoulders and a scalp scrubber (one of those hard, pointy rubber ones). I used very hot water the whole time. My scalp is on fire. But the product is still in my hair! I look like a disgusting grease ball that doesn’t know how to bathe. And it feels just as bad. I’m so ashamed and embarrassed and can’t stop crying. How do I get this crap out of my hair! Please someone help",

I was just wondering if any other curly girls use it and how they incorporate it int their routine? The instructions say not to condition your hair before using the mask, then do your usual routine after the time on the bottle, but I don’t know how my hair would do with no conditioner! I’ve been putting conditioner on after the mask, has anyone tried without? Is it conditioning enough in itself? Curious how you all use it!!",
