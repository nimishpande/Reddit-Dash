These results are with the volume brush!! \n\nI’m also super happy, because I’ve been working to get my curls back. In 2021 I dyed my hair dark for a couple months. Decided I wanted to try going back to my natural hair color. I went to a salon. They ended up messing my hair up so bad. I walked out with bright orange hair. I ended up box dyeing it a couple months after, because there was such a drastic difference between my regrowth and the dye. It was definitely a better transition, but it set me back to day one. My curls were in this in between stage where I couldn’t just leave them alone, but I couldn’t get them to look presentable. So I started using heat tools to make it look semi presentable. Last three photos have been taken in the last 4 years since then. \n\nI have spent the last 2 years trying to grow all the dye out, I only straighten it occasionally, and I’ve learned more about my hair and what works for it. \n\nRoutine: \n\n- I double shampoo with the Pantene Volume shampoo. Once a week I switch it out with the Ouai Detox Shampoo (this is what I used today with the first 4 pictures). \n\n- L’Oréal Elvive Hyaluron+plump Shampoo and Conditioner\n\n- Redken Mega Soft Curls Leave in Conditioner\n\n- Moroccan Oil Curl Cream\n\n- Bounce Curl Volume Brush\n\n- Moroccan Oil Volume Mousse\n\n- Kerastase hair oil\n",

      "content": "Hi, I’m relatively new to skincare, and I’d really appreciate your opinions or advice on choosing the best form of salicylic acid in a product. Ideally something that won’t do more harm than good.\nI have oily, acne-prone skin with blackheads and some fungal acne on cheeks.\n\nWould you recommend:\n- more frequent use of salicylic acid in a cleanser (daily)\n- Or using a gentle cleanser (without SA) and applying a \"leave-on\" salicylic acid serum (few times a week)?\n\nFor context, my routine also includes azelaic acid, retinol, moisturizer, and sunscreen.\n\nI’ve read about several cases where people damaged their skin barrier from overusing acids, causing more harm than good. But I’ve also seen dermatologists suggest that more frequent use of SA in a cleanser can actually be more beneficial for oily, acne-prone skin.\n\nWhat’s your opinions/experiences? Thanks in advance. :3",

I don't have an income so I get what I can. I only air dry, I don't have a diffuser. just a dryer with no attachments. if I gel I will put it up in a cheap bonnet for 10-15 so I'm not dripping water everywhere. I used to cowash but I can't anymore, my hair is way too greasy!\n\nmy hair is very greasy and when I gel, it's a grease bomb the next day. sometimes when I gel, it either looks nice or doesn't do much. I also seem to completely miss the back of my hair when I make extra sure I get gel back there... I wonder if I'm doing it wrong or if my bonnet is absorbing it? \n\nI also have autism and the feel of gel in my hair makes my skin crawl. so I don't usually gel. \n\nis there anything I can try doing different? my budget is insanely tight so I can't spend more than $15-$20 on products. \n\nthanks in advance.",

I’ve also bleached and dyed my hair a few times. But tell me is my hair actually seeing some improvement or am I being delusional I really don’t know to trust my judgment bc I asked my sister and she isn’t entirely convinced about any of my hair texture and says I “might have wavy hair” \n\nI use Pantene sheer volume shampoo for well shampooing it and I do it twice, after that I use the shampoo sheer volume conditioner, I finger brush through my hair to get the tangled and then I use a brush to comb all the products into my hair thoroughly, once I rinse the conditioner I used a leave in conditioner called “kinky curly knot today” and rake that through my hair, which I’m again finger combing it to get the tangled out, after basically lathering it through all hair and detangling I brush again to get it really deep in the scalp. After that I use curl gel called “not your mothers sculpting gel” so I rake it in alll over, after coating all the layers through, I shake my head a little, I lift my my hair up a few times and then I start to scrunch, now for drying I plopped my hair by tying it a t-shirt, and then waited for 20 minutes, after that I micro plop for 15 or so minutes but I’m thinking of doing it for less time and after micro plopping I just diffused it in a specific\n\n\nNow as for the routine I did a few nights ago I only changed up my diffusing a tad, didn’t plop or microplop and just diffused. Also I will admit I do not have heat protectant spray but I don’t diffuse all that often tbh. I also finger coiled my hair in sections that night but idk how well it works with wavy hair (or possibly even loose curly hair? Idk)  my hair is thick with fine strands.\n\n\nDoes my hair even have a possibility of getting curlier? Any and all constructive criticism is allowed and encouraged Im still a beginner to this all ",

As far as I understand, silicone somewhat smooths/seals the cuticle and forms a protective layer which would make it harder for other things to penetrate to the hair.\nSo is there any benefit (esp hair health benefit) on applying a non-silicone containing hair oil after a silicone containing leave-in and styler?",

I have some pretty stubborn tanning from my college days (I wasn’t using sunscreen or taking care of my skin much back then 😅).\n\nI was told that consistent use can help lighten it, but I’m a bit confused about how to use these oils properly. I’ve seen people here mention that they leave it on overnight, but doesn’t it stain clothes or bedsheets?\n\nMy plan was to apply it to my whole body, leave it on for around 15-20 minutes, and then rinse it off. Would that still be effective?\n\nAlso, since Kumkumadi Thailam comes in such a small bottle, is it okay to mix a few drops of it with Nalparamadi Thailam before applying? If so, how many drops would be ideal?\n\nWould really appreciate any tips or experiences from people who’ve used these oils regularly!",
