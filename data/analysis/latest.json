      "content": "I have had acne since 2020. I was on adapalene and isotretinoin in 2020 and it cleared my skin but I shifted to Delhi in 2024 and it took a toll on my skin!😣\n\nI came in June and skin started getting worse! Went to a dermatologist in October but he kept on prescribing very expensive hyaluronic acid, vitamin c and niacinamide serums even when I told him I’m allergic to niacinamide😒\n\nSo finally in November my neighbour aunty told me to give raw aleovera a chance and started using it everyday at night after my skincare routine and cleared my skin😭😭😭\n\nMy cousin who is around 18 has acne since he was 14, just how my skin looks. Even he started aleovera and he’s happy with the results! (I will post his before and after in few months)\n\nWith aleovera I followed a simple skincare routine: \n\n1. Facewash : Simple Facewash (using it since 3 years now)\n2. Moisturiser: Formula rx hydra veil moisturiser (love of my life💝)\n3. Sunscreen : I was using reequil matte during the summer season and currently using minimalist fluid sunscreen 🧴 \n4. Bioderma Micellar water or Deconstruct cleansing balm for makeup removal 🎀\n\nI use to 10-15 step routine before this and I have over consuming way too much! \n\nHow I use the aleovera:\n\n1. Cut a piece from plant\n2. Clean it with water\n3. Keep it in water for 20 mins (it ensures all the yellow part is removed)\n4. Apply it after 1 Hour after doing my skincare routine which is just applying my moisturiser \n\nTo anyone who is going through acne just give aleovera a try! Please please please😭😭\n\n*Some people are allergic to aleovera too so do a patch test! ",

      "content": "I live in an area with very hard water (limescale and all kinds of stuff). I've battled it for 5 years, trying everything from different skincare products to shower filters... and I've come to the conclusion that I just can't put this water on my face at all. It seriously breaks me out and triggers rosacaia and basically removes my moisture barrier no matter how good the products I use to replenish it are. This year I switched to medical grade (dermatologist provided) skincare products that really helped, and then on this new regimine I went on vaction, and my skin was GLOWING when I came back. However, when I used the water from my (new) shower filter again, it backslid. It wasn't as bad as it was pre-updated routine.. but it was clear the water was a huge factor. \n\nEver since, I've switched over to using bottled water to wash my face, and this has worked wonders. I now NEVER experience any kind of acne, where as before I was getting rosacia acne, fungal acne, and cystic acne. Now I've gone from experiencing it frequently to it being a thing of the past.\n\n  \nBasically, what I'm trying to drive home is that it isn't a matter of washing with something different or getting a shower filter (which I have.. and I'm a renter so I can't get reverse osmosis installed unfortunately).\n\n  \nWhat I need help with is how to make the washing process... better. I currently pour a bit of water from the bottle into my hands, wash with face-wash, then rinse again using the same cupped hand method until I'm done. However, in my tiny city apartment with my tiny sink, this is just a gigantic mess.. and it's a hassle to get into the shower to do this so I want to find a way to do it at my sink still. I'm also tired of having this bottle of water sitting around all the time because we don't have any room for storage and it's ugly... I've considered mounting a glass beverage dispenser, but that isn't entirely feasable either. \n\nAre there any products to facilitate face washing? Like even some kind of at-home, weaker hydrafacial device? Something that dispenses water but sucks it back up at the same time? Or like.. some kind of water tank that I could mount? I've thought about those gravity-powered camping showers but I don't really want that hanging out in my bathroom permanently... or setting it up every time I want to use it..\n\nIf anyone is aware of any interesting products for this, or even something that could be repurposed for this use, I would love any recommendations or ideas!",

At night, I use Mad Hippie cleanser again and I do the toner and serum, but then use the Ordinary Rose Hip oil followed by Peach and Lily Overnight Star cream, and then the ointment again. I was using dermalogica's dynamic skin retinol serum but stopped a few days ago and haven't noticed an improvement. I also use omnilux men's mask for 10m every other day.

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

Now i want to go back to brunette because my hair has become incredibly dry and i don’t feel like a golden blonde fits me. My hair stylists recommends balayage over everything but i don’t know if i can keep spending $500+ on my hair 😭 Should i do a single process color? I added pictures to show my hair over the years and in hopes of someone seeing what better fits me. i was thinking a chocolate brown? or ashy brown ? Something with no bleach but i really don’t want black.  please help i feel so lost. First pictures are more recent, as you can see my hair got a lot shorter :( my ends are suuuper dry and i have to keep cutting. ",

Last september I added 1x 0.5mg dut to my 7x 1mg fin regimen. I even improved my hair thickness for 6 months. BUT I started to shed after the end of this 6 month.\n\nIn march 2025 I started to shed like crazy… This shed lasted until today, and still going. I tried to increase my dut dosage up to x2 and x3 with x7 fin per week but nothing changed.\n\nTo clarify, I do not use generic brands. Only propecia and avodart.\n\nSo, the question rises now: What should I do?\n\nA) Stop dutasteride fully because it gives damage (?) to my hair and only stick with finasteride. 9 month is already enough.\n\nB) 2-3x dut is not enough so increase it to ED.\n\nFor the option A, I do find it weird to be honest because some people say that I might not be responding enough to dut But dont forget, I have never stopped using 7x fin.\n\nCould you guys help me, or just share your ideas please? I am planning to see a doctor but they are generally useless since they are mainly not pro fin/dut in my country.\n\nI appreciate all the help and comments",

I’ve been straightening it since then and now my hair is a nightmare.\n\nIt’s dry, tangled, and currently shedding bits and pieces of hair. To make matters worse, it’s super short (about slightly below cheekbone). I now realize I need to put down the dye and heat tools and wear my hair natural for a while until I’m comfortable with cutting it. It still curls a bit if I use gel/curl cream but it’s still absolutely trashed. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to help it heal? I know I’m pretty much past the point of return until all the bleach is cut out but I’m at a loss for what to do until then. \n\nThank you in advance! \n\n\nRoutine:\n\nWash: Devacurl No Poo/ Malibu C Undoo Goo.\n\nCondition: Devacurl One Condition.\n\nStyle: NYM Curl Talk Cream and Olaplex Gel.\n\nBonus: I sleep on Silk Pillowcases.",

Adding any amount of oil immediately makes it look oily and gel did not turn out good either. The only positive it’s it’s very soft. I get it trimmer regular but don’t have much issue with split ends. Any suggestions please? ",

Around this time of year, I usually deal with some acne, but this time it feels worse than usual.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\n\nFace wash: The Derma Co. Salicylic Acid cleanser\n\nMoisturizer: Dot &amp; Key Vitamin C moisturizer (morning)\n\nNight cream: Dot &amp; Key Retinol night cream\n\n\nI’m not sure what’s causing this — maybe product layering, weather change, or over-exfoliation? Would love to know if anyone has faced something similar or has suggestions on what to adjust or add to my routine.\n\nAny help would be really appreciated 🙏",
