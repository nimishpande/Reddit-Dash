Tretinoin and or RetinA were used 4-7days/week but cause dryness and irritation with over use. \n\nSunscreen/serums. Used a lot and everyone one caused a reaction. \n\n\n‚Äã‚òÄÔ∏è Current Routine\n‚ÄãAM: Water splash or nothing. Sometimes Aveeno/Avene Cicalfate if cold.\n\n‚ÄãPM: Mild Cleanser (Water/Sulfur/Aveeno) \\to Actives (Finacea 15% 2x/week OR Adapalene 1x/week) \\to Moisturizer (Aveeno Oat and/or Avene Cicalfate)\n\n‚Äãü§î New Prescription &amp; Questions\n‚ÄãI've been prescribed Soolantra (Ivermectin) cream.

(My pharmacist was vague).\n\n‚ÄãAlternative: Should I skip Soolantra and just try to find the \"sweet spot\" frequency for my Azelaic Acid 15% instead?\n\n‚ÄãAny experience or advice on integrating Soolantra into a very sensitive routine would be appreciated!\n\nOr if my dermatologist is wrong and I don't even have Rosacea, hard to say as I don't have traditional red flushing",

      "content": "Hello everyone!   \n  \nI started using topical min last year when my hair was in a pretty bad shape. It got so bad so fast. I'm thinking it was a combination of diffuse thinning + stress? So anyway, I hopped on topical min for a year, I feel like it helped a little?   \n  \nUnfortunately I dropped my phone in the sea where I had most of my progress pictures month by month. But yeah, you can see what my hair looked like when I started min in August 2024. And the next picture is from August 2025. It was drastically thicker and more volume overall. But as expected, min did as much as it could and growth stopped at some level.   \n  \nI'm 30 now and always had long hair most of my life, so my goal is to have the hair I had at 25. I gave myself a buzz cut on 1st of August this year and added %0.1 topical fin, 3x / week dermastamps at 0.6mm and keto shampoo.   \n  \nRest of the pictures with short hair are from today, after being on the new regimen for 3 months. I feel like I'm experiencing great increase in volume &amp; baby hair popping up all over.   \n  \nObviously its different hair length but it's shorter, so it must show the scalp even more? \n\nI took the pictures in the same room, at the same spot and time of the day to have the same natural light.   \n  \nIs this regrowth or am I imagining it? What do you guys think? Before anyone asks, I've experienced zero sides so far. at some point in the future I could switch to pills as well. ",

      "content": "[](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/?f=flair_name%3A%22Routine%20Help%22)Hi everyone, I'm in the process of developing a skincare routine and I would consider myself a beginner. Most of my life I've never really had a solid skincare routine; usually I would just wash my face with water and maybe use a gentle moisturiser, but outside of this I am quite clueless on what actually works and what doesn't for my skin. I would describe my skin as dry with some acne scarring and I have some congestion on my forehead, cheeks and chin. I have recently purchased the following products to start off with:\n\n1. La Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturiser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47kdvyesz3yf1.png?width=440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b292669bdc179ad44b44a2a45ca1fc77a79ddf4b\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/dry-acne-prone-skincare-routine-help-v0-xsdw3k71y3yf1.png?width=440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa3d16da5b9a7e98dabb305a7a2414c469cd0607)\n\n2. The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l3r41w1tz3yf1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=055485821b5edf6aa9d0d4ef11d905bca661635f\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/dry-acne-prone-skincare-routine-help-v0-kdeftmefy3yf1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea1d7076acd22a2a395e490b0baba6f092b46c0d)\n\n3. Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice and Probiotics SPF 50\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0riwp7bvz3yf1.png?width=355&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68bd5aebc57e63781dcf7dfb124d3ee60759f8ec\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/dry-acne-prone-skincare-routine-help-v0-6fao7n86y3yf1.png?width=355&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acf937200b44eb8a738144dde404d3935f946d5f)\n\nThe main areas I want to target are clearing up congestion on my face, eliminating hyperpigmentation as I have darker skin and my face is not an even tone and keeping my skin hydrated (especially during these colder months). If anyone can suggest a routine/ additional products that would work well in targeting these issues, I would really appreciate it as my skin has been one of my main insecurities for a while now.",

      "content": "Hi everyone \nLooking for advice on a haircut. My last haircut was in April 2024 and the last time I colored it was May 2023 (I have only dyed it a handful of times over the years). The ends are so dry and damaged and are in need of at least a trim. \nI am postpartum so my hair care is pushed aside most of the time (and going through postpartum hairloss üôÉ). I have no set daily routine. It all depends on how much time I have.\nHere is a general routine. \nShampoo probably once a month and whatever Shampoo happens to be in the shower at the time. Honestly, just Shampoo once my hair is feeling gross. \nConditioner every shower with either dove/Pantene or shea moisture conditioner.\nFinger comb my hair in the shower\nScrunch some water out\nSometimes I use Not Your Mother's Mousse other times I use just their curl cream. \nJVN Air Dry Cream\nAny product I use is scrunched in while my hair is flipped upside down.\nIf I have time, I will diffuse. Sometimes only half dry just depends on the day. If I have no time then I skip this and just let it air dry. \nIt is usually frizzier and less volume when I air dry. (I do live in high humidity).\nSometimes I use Tresseme or Not Your Mother's Hairspray. \n\n\nI want to go to a curl specialist for the first time and get a haircut (no color). I have no idea what I should ask for though. I used to always get a Bob cut then let it grow for a year and then repeat (pretty much since elementary school and I am approaching 30 now üò±). I kind of want something new. And now having a baby, I want to be able to put it up on the days when I just don't have time for myself.\n\nAlso, I am in the medical field and like my curls to be pulled back/out of my face when working. Any ideas for a cute hairdo other than a high bun using a scrunchie?\n\nThanks for reading this and for any and all advice\n\n",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
