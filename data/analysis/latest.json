      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

When I was 19 I got KP on my arms didn’t know what it was at first and ended up getting it really bad on both arms. Struggled with hormonal acne since I was 18 and just kept asking my dermatologist for help. You know how that goes they give you medication and etc. I know this is a bit off topic I’m sorry.. anyways.. I got on accutane bc my dermatologist told me it was the only way to help with my hormonal acne and I did. Wasn’t even on a high dosage and I ended up getting kp on my chest and face… it’s ruining my life and i personally don’t know what to do. I know people will say “don’t let it affect your life”, but it’s hard. The texture everywhere makes my skin crawl. I don’t know what to do.. I avoid places and going out because I feel so ugly. I’m just wondering if anyone that sees this and has had kp.. well someone with kp as severe as mine were you able to get rid of it?.. like through laser or something. I need some reassurance that it can get better bc I cannot personally handle this anymore.. it kills me and sorry if I seem dramatic, but it just hurts me. I’m a sibling of 8 and I’m the only one with all these skin problems and it’s too much. \n",

One is Avene’s Revitalizing Nourishing Creme; it comes in regular and riche, and I alternate according to the season.  It’s cheap enough for me to always buy it consistently, the scent is very light, and I love the way it glides on and delivers a surge of moisture.\n\nThe others ones that are memorable unfortunately are not as easily available.  One was Dr. Jart’s Body Oil, discontinued years ago.  It had this soft emollient quality that I have not been able to find in any other body oil since then.  My skin just soaked it up and felt smooth and soft, not just slippery the way dry body oils feel.\n\nThe other was this shea butter, mango butter, and jojoba oil balm that I bought from a vendor at an art fair.  It’s called Pharoanic Healing Butter Balm from Egyptian Botanicals and though the scent is sharp and medicinal, it smells the way I imagined Ancient Egypt smelling when I was a little kid.

I haven't changed a whole lot about my routine since this started. I did change a few things to try and help it, but nothing is working. \n\nMy original routine was wash once or twice a week only and usually with clarifying shampoo to prevent product buildup. Then follow up with a bonding or hydrating conditioner (I use Elizavecca CER-100 or Olaplex for bonding). After I get out of the shower, leave-in conditioner and hair gel. Then air dry and lightly scrunch with a cotton t-shirt. My hair always came out silky smooth with nice shine and curl. I would use a curling iron or straightener to help with the strands on the top layers that refuse to curl no matter what I try, but that was the only heat I was using during that time. The only major change that I can think of that contributed to the frizz was that I moved about 200 miles away from where I was living before. So I thought maybe environmental factors or water type/quality had something to do with it? \n\nMy routine after showering has changed - I now use The Doux foam and and heat protectant and will blow dry my hair with a diffuser after it has air-dried some. \n\nPlease recommend any products that might help!
