      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "My hair has been feeling very limp &amp; shiny for quite some time.\n\n\nThe bottom of my hair is usually a mix of 2c-3a, predominantly very springy curls, and the past few wash days it’s been practically 2a. It feels stringy and too soft, but as far as i know i’m not doing anything excessive to be causing this(styling-wise).\n\n\nTo sum it up, the bottom is suffering the most, but all of my hair feels very limp, has basically no retention when messed with, and falls apart quick. \n\n\nI’ve been following a wavy-curly routine for 3 months, and this is what i know about my hair + my full monthly routine:\n\n\n• mixed porosity (crown+ face framing bits are high porosity, everything else is low-medium)\n\n• 2b-2c-3a, i have the occasional damaged pieces that curl and then fall into a 2b wave, and some that wont curl at all. i believe i’m predominantly 2c rn\n\n• medium density\n\n• fine strands\n\n• my curl pattern is quite damaged(used to be 3a-3b throughout my whole life) from years and years of straightening my hair twice a day, excessive bleaching and dying, and a hair pulling disorder focused on the crown &amp; pieces around my neck.\n\n• my hair naturally has a soft finish to it, so the excessive shine isn’t something i’m new to, but yesterday i looked in the mirror and literally looked like a disco ball… i’m reflecting INSANE amounts of light.\nthis isnt normal for me, lol!\n\n\npre-shampoo treatments:\n\n\ntwice a month - curlsmith bond curl rehab salve, i leave it on longer on my high porosity area, and about 20 min into waiting i apply it to everything else.\n\n\nonce a month - some kind of conditioning treatment, usually with a good protein-moisture balance. recently it was the garnier SOS keratin filler.\n\n\nwashing:\n\n- bounce curl gentle clarifying shampoo, i use this as a regular shampoo, it’s very light &amp; really doesnt strip much\n\n\n- macadamia naturals conditioner, i use this every second or third wash, my hair already feels too soft in the shower.\n\n\n- olaplex clarifying shampoo, once a week or once every two weeks. depends on how much i wash my hair that week.\n\n\nstyling:\n\n\n- i use mielle rosemary+mint leave in MAYBE once a month, only for my crown, if it feels dry. \n\n\n- balea sea salt spray, i use this before i do my whole routine &amp; spray pretty generously. my hair is naturally very soft too, so it needs some texture.\n\n\n- got2b curls mousse, 1 pump for my whole head, probably golf ball sized\n\n\n- keune styling x gel, i’m not sure exactly what amount i use, i just follow the needs of my hair that day. sometimes more, sometimes less.\n\n\n- i diffuse on medium air &amp; medium temp, switching to cool temp throughout the process.\n\n\nall products r applied with praying hands &amp; then scrunched in to the top.\n\ni don’t apply any stylers on the scalp, i just go near it, and my hair seems to react pretty well to it. i got it as a tip from my stylist, and my roots have been curling pretty well!\n\n",

Well, this has been such an important question that researchers across the world have been trying to sort out.\n\n&gt;It’s been wonderful to work on a new study with my colleague Dr. Maryam Nasimi and an entire amazing team of dedicated researchers. Our study was just published in the Archives of Dermatologic Research. This was a randomized controlled trial (42 men, 6 months) where we directly compared oral minoxidil 2.5 mg daily vs topical minoxidil 5% once daily.\n\n&gt;Results at 6 months showed that oral minoxidil outperformed topical across nearly every measure — thicker, denser hair with better growth-to-shedding balance. With generally tolerable side effects and easier compliance, low-dose oral minoxidil represents an important option for the treatment of male AGA.\n\n&gt;Congratulations to all for dedication to meticulous work in understanding how oral and topical minoxidil compare.\n\nIt's only 42 men and I'm not sure how reliable the results are, I was wondering if someone who knows better would take a look at it\n\nStudy for reference:\n\nYousefi E et al.

Just Kidding but, we do take exfoliating pretty seriously, the whole body should be squeaky clean after showers and baths. And that takes time as well but while travelling, I don't know how to keep up with the routine or else I will feel uncomfortable with the feeling of dead skin layer on me. \n\nWhile staying at hotels, I can't really spend much time showering as I'll be sharing my room with another family member and I can't take my usual physical exfoliators with me cause airport security and all. \n\nMy skin is used to exfoliating so if I use a scrub, it usually feels like it just made the dead skin loose but didn't remove it completely. So, using a scrub is not a great idea really for me. \n\nA friend of mind suggested to apply glycolic acid on wet skin, wait 3-5 minutes and then rinse it off in shower. I don't know if that'll work? Or should I buy a soap/body wash with chemical exfoliator? I want something that works instantly so I don't have to spend an hour in the bathroom and makes my skin squeaky clean like I want. \n\nPlease 🥺 help. Or share your exfoliating routine, please. ",

      "content": "I’ve been noticing a lot of consumerism, marketing gimmicks, and wrong skincare trends especially things like topical glutathione, 7-step routines, and overly hyped beauty serums. So here’s some simple, dermatologist-backed guidance based on personal experience and expert advice:\n\nA basic routine will always beat a complicated one. It saves money, protects your barrier, and gives long-term results.\n\nSunscreen: Use it daily (preferably a pharma-clinical grade sunscreen with a blue-light protection filter) and a lip sunscreen. If you have active, inflamed acne, avoid applying sunscreen directly on top instead use shade, or stay indoors.\n\nCleanser: Use a gentle cleanser. Double cleansing is recommended on days with heavy sunscreen or makeup and its encouraged to do so if you have oily skin. You don’t need morning cleansing cold water is enough unless you’re producing too much oil. keep the Cleansers with actives on your skin for 45 seconds before washing it off.\n\nMoisturiser: Choose one according to your skin type. Ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramides are helpful.\n\nThat’s all you need. If you have skin concerns, choose one active only. Get a dermatologist assessment and lean towards pharma-grade medicated products, staying consistent with one routine for at least 3 months before changing anything.\n\nRetinoids: Tretinoin is a holy grail as retinoids help with cell turnover and target many major concerns. Glycolic acid , adapalene, and azelaic acid also work well when used correctly (start slow, sandwich method, apply in moderation).\n\nExfoliation: Avoid physical scrubs and herbal DIY remedies. Only use chemical exfoliants like AHA/BHA (salicylic, glycolic, lactic acid, etc.) and use them sparingly.\n\nSheet masks: Expensive and wasteful; the fiber isn’t great for skin or the planet.\n\nToners: Mostly unnecessary. Just dampen your skin with rose water or plain water before applying products to improve absorption. All products like snail mucin, peptides, ceramides, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid should be used on Damp skin while \npotent actives should always be applied on dry skin ideally 10–15 minutes after washing.\nWhen the skin is damp, absorption increases too quickly, which can push strong ingredients deeper than intended and lead to irritation, or burning.\n\nEye creams: Often unnecessary. Under-eye darkness is mostly genetics, sleep, lifestyle, and makeup (some studies show kajal contributes to darkening).\n\nTrends: Don’t blindly follow trends like slugging with Vaseline. It only works if done properly because petroleum jelly is an occlusive  it must be layered over good hydration and only if your skin type suits it.\n\nK-beauty: Korean skincare products aren’t automatically suitable for everyone. Their products are created for Korean climate and skin, and true “glass skin” is usually genetics + aesthetic procedures.\n\nHyperpigmentation in brown skin: Brown skin produces more melanin when healing. So if glycolic acid, shaving, or any method “darkened” your skin, it’s usually because: • your barrier was weak • the product was overused • sunscreen wasn’t applied properly Barrier repair + fewer actives + gentle care is the real solution.\n\nHair removal: Face shaving and laser is usually gentler and better because they don’t pull hair from the root, unlike waxing/threading. (If you have PCOS or hormonal issues, treat the root cause first.)\n\nVitamin C: Not every active is essential. Vitamin C is helpful but potent having the ability to damage your skin instead. improving your diet with these nutrients is often more effective than relying solely on the serum.",

He often says to getting his hair is ‘puffy’ and will also wets his hair because he says it’s dry. As one of his Christmas presents I’m hoping to surprise him with her first hair care routine. \n\nHis current routine is :\n\n-Washing everyday using OBX coconut curls \n- Gels with Davines More inside this is a curl building\n\nIm hoping we can learn how to take care of his curls with shampoo and conditioner ( not sure what curl type) and also a nice gel/serum that will keep his curls in place when he’s out.\n\nAppreciate everyone’s help!!! Photos of his hair are attached for reference. ",

I lost tract of how it got to the point it’s at, I’d say sometime in 2023 my face often would get waves of becoming hot and red, like really red, like it would be my whole face, when im hot, when im cold, or just out of nowhere, and I can feel it on my face because my face becomes getting warm.\n\nand then ever since then it progressed rapidly, then I got pregnant in January 2024 so I feel like that added on to it, for about the whole year of 2024 I was trying every other face wash and moisturizer, I had my child in September that year, tried to keep going with that routine.\n\nAnd the past couple months i said screw the routine. It’s not helping anything, why did my skin randomly go from clear and freckles to a red patchy hell? If you have advice or could help, please do a step by step on what I could do for a routine to help this as i know absolutely nothing about skincare. or am i just stuck with this forever? TIA and sorry for the whole life story lol i just really want my skin back, it’s one of my biggest insecurities.",

Since I have fine hair it takes work to make it have some volume plus so it stays in place. Anyway, since I do have fine hair and a high hairline/bigger forehead, I was wondering if maybe I should attempt a hairstyle that covers it, maybe a fringe or something? I have fine hair but I have a good amount of it. First photo is what I usually wear, second is when my hair is down but with some product left in it cause without product my hair is super flat, and third is when I attempt to mess it up in the front. Obviously it would need to be shorter for that sort of look cause its product heavy.  I am 29 btw ",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I recently started (2 months ago) LRP adapalene and prescription Azelaic Acid for stubborn acne breakouts and acne scarring. I had a small purge but all in all my skin is making slow progress. I was having issues finding makeup to help hide my imperfections and I finally found products that don't make my skin look worse. What really helped was Embryolisse Lait-Cream as a primer. I've tried many primers and this seems to create the best results.\n\nNow the problem is though that helps, some areas: around my mouth, sides of nose/nasolabial folds, and eyelids still look very dry and the makeup exacerbates that. I actually found out I can't use Embryolisse on my eyelids because it causes contact dermatitis, but works great everywhere else.\n\nThe question is, is there a hydrating, non irritating moisturizer I can wear under it that can negate those dry patches from being so obvious? Or should I add a serum/essence under the Embryolisse? I use Illiyoon Ato cream at night but not under makeup as it creates a very sticky base that lasts for hours.\n\nAM routine: Image Ormedic gel cleanser, Azelaic Acid cream 15%, Embryolisse\n\nPM: CVS brand makeup wipe, Image Ormedic cleanser, LRP adapalene, Illiyoon Ato cream",

      "content": "Heyy ladies, so I already read some of the threads here but I feel my situation is slightly different. My mother never showed me how to shave, so at around 16 I took a razor and only shaved my bikini line, without shaving cream or prep because I didn’t know better. Anyway, I did it a couple of times and everytime it will hurt like hell growing back. The last time though i had an ingrown hair and I tried to remove it but it became a cyst I believe. For over two years it will start bleeding and having pus for a week or two, stop for a few days then starts bleeding again. Last year ( I am 20 now) it stopped completely and seems healed but left a dark scar. \n\nOther then that my whole bikini line has dark scars and ingrowns and red spots and bumps. It’s really an insecurity to me I dont know what to do about it. \n\nAlso, i stopped shaving obviously and started waxing instaed a couple years ago. I think it really helped its far a better solution than shaving. Also I exfoliate moisturize with coconut oil and i use the ordinary glycolic acid. \n\nYes I did go see a doctor and they said “well what do you want me to do about it” and I dont feel like exposing myself and getting vulnerable again with another doctor to get a similar reaction. So if anyone has any tips that could help, cause I really want to feel better in my skin and I tried to be patient but I dont see any improvement \n",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

It’s only had the colour on once but it’s been 4 weeks and it’s barely faded after at least 8 washes so it’s taken the colour well.\n\nThis is a picture of when it was first done at the hairdressers. I’d love to be able to get a glossy finish on it at home.\n\nProducts I need help with:-\n\nShampoo/conditioner - what’s good for protecting colour?\n\nClarifying shampoo - should I avoid this altogether now? Will it strip the colour and if so what should I use instead?\n\nHair masks - again, anything I should avoid?\n\nBonding/K18 - from what I can tell this is only good for curly/wavy hair. I like the glossy look I see when other people post about it, what other products or bonding treatments would give me that glossy finish?\n\nLeave in treatments - again, anything for a glossy finish?\n\nThanks 🙏🏻 \n",

I am extremely new to this and just recently bought a diffuser and some products. My routine is as follows: I still use regular shampoo and conditioner (Head &amp; Shoulders), and then I started using \"Not Your Mother's\" curl cream and bought both Garnier mousse and gel, and kind of trying them out (only one at a time so far). Essentially, my problem is that my hair curls while I diffuse it, like obviously curls, but it's gone pretty much as soon as I turn off the diffuser. The curl tends to return after a few hours/after I sleep, which, kinda weird to me. I have extremely thick hair as well as a lot of hair. I have no clue what I'm doing, completely new to this, and I just want to know if anyone has any advice. Why is it doing that? Does this mean I should stop trying (I am willing to accept my hair isn't curly/wavy, I just wanted to try)? Does anyone have any products/tips?",
