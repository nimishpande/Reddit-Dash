Just my personal preference, but for years I’ve been using leave-in conditioner as a curl cream instead. That worked for a while until I found THIS product.\n\nMy routine:\n\nStraight out of the shower, I wrap my hair in a microfibre cloth for about five minutes. After that while it’s still wet, I apply the cream all over (not all the way to the root) and use a coconut oil based hair oil on the ends. After that I let it air dry (diffusing and me just don’t get along LOL) and my hair has never looked better.\n\nI also use a Jamaican black castor oil hair mask once a week and ALWAYS sleep in a silk bonnet, which I’m sure has helped as well, but the cream is the real start of the show.\n\nI’d love to know if anyone else has used this product and what they think of it!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "\nSo, I moved to Noida about four years ago — new job, new city, new life… and suddenly, new problem.\nMy hair started falling like crazy.\nLike actual bunches of hair every wash.\n\nI’ve had acne since my teens, but my parents always brushed it off like, “yeh toh normal hai.”\nOnce I started working, I finally decided — okay, no one’s coming to save me, I’ll figure this out myself.\n\nObviously, I started where everyone starts — YouTube and Instagram 😭.\nTried onion juice, rosemary oil, random “hair detox” tips from influencers.\nEvery reel felt like a new hope, and every shower felt like heartbreak.\n\nThen I realised — I’m actually going to go bald at this rate if I keep experimenting.\nSo began the hunt for a real dermatologist.\nAnd because I’m a typical social media junkie, I started with the ones who looked the most perfect online.\n\nDermat #1:\nThe “prettiest dermatologist” in South Delhi (you know the one whose husband’s also a social media star).\nWent to her for 3 months. She’s from one of those fancy private colleges, looks amazing on Instagram… but her treatment? Confusing.\nShe’d say one thing online, prescribe another in person.\nIt felt like she didn’t even believe in her own advice.\n\nDermat #2:\nNext was a senior male doctor from a big Delhi hospital.\nTotally arrogant. Didn’t listen, kept interrupting. Also, he was completely bald — I’m sorry, but that did not inspire confidence. 😐\n\nDermat #3:\nThen I tried the husband of one of the biggest dermatologists on Instagram.\nHe was good — calm, professional, actually explained things.\nBut their system was impossible. Getting an appointment was like applying for a visa. Truth was , on a weekday noon, which i always prefer, clinic was always empty.\nAnd when I finally got treated, I realised it was the same protocol most good dermats follow.\nNothing unique — just great packaging.\n\n\nDermat #4:\nBy now, I had learnt some lessons.\nSo I found a young dermatologist from a government college — she’d built her page around her degrees and her own acne journey. She was based in Hauz khas.\nI liked her vibe, but she was too cautious.\nShe kept saying my hair loss was normal, just fix your lifestyle.\nLike girl, my lifestyle is already squeaky clean — I needed help, not another “sleep more, drink water” lecture.\nShe waited months before starting anything real, and by then I was exhausted.\n\nFinally…\nOne of my office colleagues kept insisting I go to this low-profile dermatologist in Noida — someone who isn’t even on social media.\nI went with zero expectations, honestly just out of frustration.\nAnd that’s when it hit me — the really good doctors don’t have time for reels and filters. They’re busy doing actual work.\n\nIf you’ve read this far — thank you 🫶\nI just wanted to share this because I know how easy it is to get swayed by social media.\nAnd atleast someone should benefit from my own hard earned money funded research. 😀",

I'm seriously considering bangs of some kind. I very recently cut some parts near my face shorter as kind of a test-run, but I'm feeling conflicted on whether or how much shorter to go. Does anyone have experience with a similar texture of hair and whether bangs work/how short to go? Really appreciate any advice!\n\nRoutine:\nWash with Naturelab Tokyo Repair shampoo OR the Doux One Love Co-Wash\nCondition typically with Toni &amp; Guy Volume Addiction conditioner AND/OR Naturelab Tokyo Repair conditioner, generally keeping it away from the scalp (sometimes I use the Co-Wash on the scalp at the same time I'm using conditioner on the length)\n\nMy styling is evolving and I'm trying products, but this time I used a bit of the Doux Cream right after rinsing and squishing out excess water, then microplop to remove more excess water, then the Doux Big Poppa gel, then brush styling with a tiny bit of mousse applied to the brush for each section. Air dry and scrunch when it's mostly but not fully dry, which I find works better than waiting for it to be fully dry for me.",

Then I shampoo (Native moisturizing or soapbox coconut oil bar), rinse, and put in hair mask/deep conditoner for like 5-10 minutes depending on which one. I will admit I’ve been over using my hair masks, oops. So now, I will be conditioning my hair instead of masking on most wash days. But other than that tweaking, what else can I do?

      "content": "Hey guys \n\n\nI think I damaged my skin barrier w over exfoliation. It happened to me a few times already over the past 2yrs &amp; I’ve never really seen the end of it. \n\nI have no  “ irritation/redness/ or sensitivity. My symptoms are : surge of breakouts everywhere skin oilier than usual , waxy appearance of forehead + deepening of fine lines \n\nThe 1st time it happened it took forever for me to get ahold of it bc I didn’t know how to go about it. I suspected fungal acne so I had tried nizoral among other things. \n\nI finally did a 8w break no exfo no actives. It’s hard to remember exactly how it went &amp; the progress bc I didn’t keep log of my healing journey so details are blurry. I think I cleansed 2x a day bc I still have very oily combo skin &amp; prone to breakouts . I believe I had tried to ditch the AM cleanse before &amp; while it had helped maybe for the 1st week, things were getting very congested after that. \n\n\n\nSo anyways in short I did 2x day gentle cleanse followed by my hydro boost water gel + spf. Obv no SPF in PM\n\n. After 8 weeks I reintroduced actives slowly &amp; cleared all my acne, skin looked great but I messed it up again 2mths later like an idiot w exfo. I think my skin barrier was still fragile &amp; it wasn’t resilient at all. \n\nStarted breaking about maybe 3-5 days later &amp; it got exponentially worse.\n\nI figured let’s start over again &amp; reset everything \nI took another 8w break this time I didn’t cleanse in the AM &amp; idk why I did that bc my skin got super congested. \n\nI reintroduced actives again over 1 mth period but somehow I messed up again this time with physical exfo which is a big no no on active pimples (idk why I did that I’m mad at myself)\n\n\nNow 3rd break. I’m trying to stay hopeful bc I did successfully heal my acne the 1st time so I’m thinking it’s possible again. \n\nBut my skin is soooooo freaking oily &amp; congested. And I feel the more oil sits on my skin the more congestion &amp; the more inflamed&amp; irritated my pores get \n\nMy question is what should I expect as I quit all actives to heal my barrier while dealing with acne prone skin that is very oily?\n\nDid anyone ever heal their barrier w oily acne prone skin? It’s so hard to stay away from actives even though it’s what I should do. it feels the more I neglect my acne the worse it gets &amp; I heard that if you don’t treat your acne, it gets worse &amp; harder to treat in the future. I’m scared things will get out of control. \n\nSo far on this active break I’ve completed 3w no exfo &amp; a little over 2w no actives ( benzoyl peroxide) \n\nSkin is gross oily congested pimples multiplying faster than they heal. It’s hell. I don’t really remember how my first break went so I need to hear from others. Idk what’s normal at this point. I hear people healing their skin barrier &amp; irritation subsides after 1-2 weeks but I never had irritation just a bunch of breakouts !  I’m acne prone so w/o treatment it gets ugly regardless of the barrier . \n\n\n\nI’m hoping by week 4-5 things will calm down since it’s a full skin cycle or so?\n\nPlease tell me your stories of skin barrier repair with oily acne prone skin . How did it go. Did it get worse before it got better or only worse bc you didn’t use acne treatment ??\n\n\n\n\n",

Then on the day when I am walking there, they phone me to say my hairdresser is unavailable and a different stylist will do it. OK I agree. They charge me extra because the hairdresser who did my hair was actually a manager (I was unaware of this.) I was annoyed but I paid and politely thanked them.\n\nI made another appointment with them this week for a cut and wash. I studied their price list and noticed the changes in price according to the rank of hairdresser. So I specifically requested a stylist (most reasonably priced). They mumbled about \"oh your usual will do it for you. I see here you had hair done by (manager).\" I explained that I wanted a stylist and that it was more affordable for me, they kept telling me she's unavailable. I said OK I will come in when she is there. They said she is on holiday and don't know when she's back. We ended the phone call there. I feel pretty deflated. I guess I'm not bothering with them again, so I will find somewhere out of town but WHY does this happen? Any tips on how I can speak to hairdressers next time to avoid this? I think I was polite. I didn't ask for much, I just want a basic service by a stylist",

If I move it up, it gets ruined and doesn't go back down. Now, I assume the issue is my conditioner. After trying an array of conditioners I was recommended to try a deep conditioner. So I tried Alikay Naturals Honey and Sage Deep Conditioner and it was awful. I even tried it with a heat cap and the result was the same. I assume its due to the protein in it but I'm honestly not sure. I was recommended a moisturizing conditioner but I'm not sure about anything at this point.

It never seems to be in stock where I am, they don’t ship to Canada, and whenever I do find a buy online option, it’s way too expensive. \n\nI’ve been trying other gels (ie. Curls Blueberry Bliss Control Jelly, Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Sculpting Gel, Eco Styler Olive Oil Gel) but they don’t give me the same hold/look. For example, the Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk only keeps hold for a day before my hair starts looking super frizzy and I usually like to leave 2-3 days between washes. \n\nMy current routine (I recently switched it up) is Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Shampoo and Conditioner. I use Curls Blueberry Bliss Leave-In Conditioner before gel (currently using Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Gel) and scrunch them both into damp hair in the shower before wrapping it up in a microfibre towel. I usually let it air dry after changing my clothes and doing skincare. And I wear a bonnet to bed and have a silk pillowcase. Not sure if people still subscribe to this, but I’ve been told I’m around 3A/B. \n\nAny and all suggestions are welcome, thank you so much! Let me know if there’s any other info I can provide that would help. ",

She washes morning and night using Cerave foaming face wash or Cerave with SA and does mud masks and sulfur treatments. We were using Benzoyl Peroxide spot treatment but it didn't seem to help and was bleaching her sheets, so we stopped. She also uses pimple patches and that also doesn't seem to help. She uses moisturizer as needed, usually just Vanicream Moisturizing Cream. I'm hesitant to use anything too harsh since I don't want long term damage on her young skin. I really want to help her because she's started picking at them and I'm afraid it will scar. Anyone have recommendations for something affordable to get rid of the forehead bumps?",

But it just will barely stay straight these days and I don't know why. It turns into a wavy kink ridden frizzy mess!

I also thought maybe it was hyaluronic acid that seems to be in everything but wasn’t sure.\n\nI used Vanicream moisturizer for a few weeks but it seemed a little greasy and not working as needed so I’m currently using CeraVe moisturizer with hyaluronic acid to see if that helps and if I can rule it out as an issue.\n\nI used to drink but I don’t anymore and I live a pretty healthy lifestyle at this point.
