These results are with the volume brush!! \n\nI’m also super happy, because I’ve been working to get my curls back. In 2021 I dyed my hair dark for a couple months. Decided I wanted to try going back to my natural hair color. I went to a salon. They ended up messing my hair up so bad. I walked out with bright orange hair. I ended up box dyeing it a couple months after, because there was such a drastic difference between my regrowth and the dye. It was definitely a better transition, but it set me back to day one. My curls were in this in between stage where I couldn’t just leave them alone, but I couldn’t get them to look presentable. So I started using heat tools to make it look semi presentable. Last three photos have been taken in the last 4 years since then. \n\nI have spent the last 2 years trying to grow all the dye out, I only straighten it occasionally, and I’ve learned more about my hair and what works for it. \n\nRoutine: \n\n- I double shampoo with the Pantene Volume shampoo. Once a week I switch it out with the Ouai Detox Shampoo (this is what I used today with the first 4 pictures). \n\n- L’Oréal Elvive Hyaluron+plump Shampoo and Conditioner\n\n- Redken Mega Soft Curls Leave in Conditioner\n\n- Moroccan Oil Curl Cream\n\n- Bounce Curl Volume Brush\n\n- Moroccan Oil Volume Mousse\n\n- Kerastase hair oil\n",

I don't have an income so I get what I can. I only air dry, I don't have a diffuser. just a dryer with no attachments. if I gel I will put it up in a cheap bonnet for 10-15 so I'm not dripping water everywhere. I used to cowash but I can't anymore, my hair is way too greasy!\n\nmy hair is very greasy and when I gel, it's a grease bomb the next day. sometimes when I gel, it either looks nice or doesn't do much. I also seem to completely miss the back of my hair when I make extra sure I get gel back there... I wonder if I'm doing it wrong or if my bonnet is absorbing it? \n\nI also have autism and the feel of gel in my hair makes my skin crawl. so I don't usually gel. \n\nis there anything I can try doing different? my budget is insanely tight so I can't spend more than $15-$20 on products. \n\nthanks in advance.",
