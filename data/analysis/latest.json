My skin tone is definitely more even now than before and it’s much better hydrated. My skin seems to love the salicylic acid from the ordinary which I’m really enjoying right now. Only thing is nothing seems to be helping much with the forehead lines. While I’m sure there’s only so much products can do I’m wondering if I’ve just not found the right fit yet.\n\nI’m using medik8 crystal retinal 6 every other night (alternating the salicylic acid) and I’ve never noticed much difference. Do I give it more time?(I’ve used it for about two months regularly now) or try something else?\n\nRest of routine is as follows: \nAm: \n- beauty pie japanfusion cleanser \n- Beauty pie Niacinamides or the ordinary multi peptide + HA \n- The ordinary natural moisturising factors + phyto (which I’m not loving, just using until I use it up)\n\nPm: \n- Beauty pie japanfusion cleanser\n- Crystal retinal 6 or the ordinary 2% salicylic solution \n- The ordinary multi peptide + HA \n- Beauty pie super healthy skin moisturiser\n\nI adore the super healthy skin moisturiser but I’m about to run out so any nice alternatives where I don’t have to sign up for a subscription very welcome!\n\nSo ideally two recommendations:\n\n•\t⁠something to target lines on forehead\n•\t⁠something to replace my moisturiser (I like the lightness of the super healthy skin from beauty pie the ordinary one feels too thick for me)\n\nAnd of course if anyone has any other advice on how to elevate my routine I’m all ears!\n\nThanks so much!",

I’ve been trying to figure out my skincare routine for years and no matter what I try it never seems to work and I’m sick of wasting money, so I’m asking you lovely people whether you would please be able to give me some advice?\n\n\n- My skin type is oily/combination and I have a fairly decent amount of hyperpigmentation. I am SUPER pale so it shows up really badly, mostly on my chin/nose area but kind of all over lol\n\n- My pores are fairly large in my T zone\n\n- I have the start of some fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead though this is nothing major\n\n-My skin is not super sensitive but it is dull and I think my skin barrier may need some work\n\n\nI eat a super healthy balanced diet so none of this should be diet related but no matter what I do I can’t sort my skin. \n\n\nPlease would anyone be able to recommend some products/a full routine for my skin type?\n\n\nI’m mainly looking to reduce hyperpigmentation but anything that combats oil (and actually works!!) would be a blessing too!\n\n\nThank you so much!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "MY HISTORY\n\nI’m a 21M. My hair fall started when I was 20, during the 3rd year of my degree. People around me started pointing it out, saying I was getting bald and that my scalp was visible.\n\nI went to a dermatologist who is quite well-known. He diagnosed me with androgenetic alopecia (Stage 3) and told me that with treatment, I’d get my hair back within 6 months. The treatment eventually continued for 11 months.\n\nDuring this period, I used:\nMinoxidil\nFinasteride\nTopinate solution\nHair supplements\nAround month 7, my hair fall stopped. My hair became thicker and I genuinely felt like I got my hair back. Treatment was completed (stopped) in sept 2025.\n\nPRESENT SITUATION:\nBut now, 4 months later, the hair fall has started again. I can see my scalp clearly in the mirror. I wash my hair 3 times a week, and every time I do, I see a bunch of hair clogging the drain — sometimes actual clumps.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\n\nAlmost everyone in my family is bald:\nMy father\nMy uncle\nMy older cousins (father’s side)\nThey all have androgenetic alopecia. One of my cousins faced this very early, tried everything — multiple dermatologists, minoxidil, finasteride — and still ended up bald after spending lakhs on a hair transplant.\n\nCONFUSION ABOUT GENETICS\n\nMy doctor said this condition usually comes from the mother’s side, but all my maternal uncles have excellent hair.\nSo why is this happening to me?\n\nMY QUESTIONS\n\nIf I did everything right — medication, consistency, doctor visits — why is the hair fall back again?\nIs there any real cure, or is everything just temporary?\nEverywhere on Reddit and online, people say minoxidil + finasteride stops hair loss.\nIt worked temporarily for me\nNow it’s happening again\nDo I really need to use these for my entire life just to keep my hair?\nI honestly don’t have the money for expensive lifelong treatments or transplants.\nTo be blunt, it feels like doctors just keep extending treatments and extracting money, without a permanent solution.\n\nCONCLUSION / WHAT I ACTUALLY WANT\n\nMy main goal is simple: I don’t want to go bald this early in life.\nI know people say “looks don’t matter” or “nobody cares,” but the truth is — it does affect social and professional life, especially at this age.\nI don’t care about impressing others.\nI just want to look good and feel confident.\n\nSo I’m asking honestly:\nIs there any realistic way to slow this down long-term?\nOr is early baldness inevitable no matter what I do?\nAny genuine experiences or advice would really help.",

This is not very common for East Asians, and my hair also exhibits typical E.A. hair traits - on the thinner side, low porosity. Growing up, I had no idea how to take care of my hair and I was convinced I had unruly, frizzy hair.\n\nAround my late teens I discovered the curly girl/wavy girl method. I tried gels, cremes, mousses... they all made my hair crunchy and I had no idea what I was doing wrong. I did a bit more research and then came across a suggestion: curl foams. \n\nAnd wow, at the ripe age of 23, my hair has never looked better.\n\n(obligatory not sponsored by any of these products)\n\nMy routine:\n\n1. Shampoo and Conditioner (Kristen Ess The One Signature Shampoo, Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Conditioner)  \n2. Towel Dry until damp  \n3. Styling - Umberto Giannini Curl Foam, scrunch and diffuse, finish with ARKIVE Good Habit Hybrid Oil\n\nDo y'all have any holy grail curl foams?

It is also sensitive, I have a lot of redness and really big pores everywhere, not just the T zone.\n\nI have tried La Roche Posay, Cera Ve, The Ordinary, Mixa and none of those helped. I tried niacinamide serums and pore minimizing serums and they didn't work. My routine is mostly just a cleansing gel and moisturizing cream in the morning and evening, when I was trying out serums, I layered them correctly. I wear makeup every day and not even primers work (mattifying or pore minimizing). I do not have acne but I get small white zits or some zits appear under skin (mostly cheeks and around the nose) almost every day. I have some blackheads but I don't have a lot and I can exctract them, they arent a problem. Please also note that I change my face towel regularly, always just dab my face, change my pillowcase regularly and so on. I really try with everything. I do my routine regularly, I am aware that consistency is key, but nothing has helped me so far. I hate it because I hate the feeling of oilyness on my face and it also affects my hair, it gets oily even faster bc of my face. I also cannot walk around with no foundation because I am insecure about the pores and redness, but also if I don't wear foundation, my face gets oilier even faster and even if I dab it or wash it with water, it gets oily again after an hour.\n\nAny suggestions on which products, routine would work for me? A friend suggested retinal, which I havent tried, what do you think?",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I’m looking for some advice regarding my routine\nI’ve noticed a big difference in my hair depending on whether I use conditioner or not. My current shampoo is Phytorelax Keratin (Revive Your Curls - Anti-frizz with Keratin &amp; Bamboo) and my styling product is Framesi 308 curl cream.\nScenario A (No conditioner): When I only use shampoo and then apply the cream, my curls are amazing. They are defined, thick, and form large, bouncy \"chunky\" clumps. This is exactly the look I’m going for, but they become frizz the next day. \nScenario B (With conditioner): When I add a rinse-out conditioner (Sunsilk Curls) before the styling cream, the curls are still shiny and defined, but they feel kinda heavy and less thick. There are \"more\" curls but they're smaller in both diameter and thickness, and my roots end up looking quite flat compared to when I skip the conditioner.\nMy questions:\nWhy does the conditioner make my curls lose their volume and \"clump\" size?\nIs it possible that the combination of Keratin in my shampoo and the conditioner is weighing my hair down too much?\nHow can I keep the hydration from a conditioner without sacrificing that big, thick curl structure and root volume?\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Should I look for a more lightweight, silicone-free conditioner, or is it okay to just stick to shampoo and cream if my hair likes it better?\nI use Sunsilk ricci da sogno balsamo (Sunsilk dream curls conditoner). My hair are medium length (I'm a guy) between 3A and 3B, I let them dry naturally without a diffuser most of the times, I do only a bit of scrunch with my microfiber towel to not let water drip all over me (this after I applied the curl cream). I use every product that I mentioned every time that I wash my hair, once every 2 days.",

It temporarily moisturizes but it doesn’t do much if you have really dry or chapped lips, and it never stayed on my lips overnight.\nThis one is super sticky, almost glue-like, which I actually love because it doesn’t move. If you struggle with lip masks disappearing while you sleep, this actually works.\nI’ve been using it for a month now. I bought the 23g tub for around Rs450 😋 and it’ll last a really long time. The price feels very worth it for the amount you get. \n\nHave you guys tried this one ?!? ",

I also think it’s low porosity?**\n\n\n\nRoutine:\n\nI wash my hair with head and shoulders and their conditioner because it doesn’t cause any breakouts and is good for my acne.\n\nI’ve been using the bowl method because that’s what seems to work best for me. I start by detangling my hair and using around 4 pumps of Xmondo wave tech cream (is that too much?) I dunk and squish 4 to 5 times. Then I glaze and scrunch what I feel like is a good amount of Aussie instant freeze gel in. I micro plop and glaze and scrunch Giovanni medium to firm hold styling foam as a mousse because that’s his want i have lol. Then I plop for 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nI hover diffuse my roots, and then pixie diffuse the rest\n\nHalfway through the diffusing process, it looks almost curly and great and then by the time it’s dry and I’m done it’s loose and not as tight and defined as I feel like it could be. I get absolutely zero gel cast, and it has little to no hold even though I feel like I’m using a lot of gel. From the research I’ve been doing I think my hair could be over moisturized. How can I fix this? So grateful for any help 💕",
