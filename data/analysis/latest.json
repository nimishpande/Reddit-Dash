I use it after showering and I’m good for the entire day. \n\nEasily a 10/10 WRP!!\n\nNivea Pearl &amp; Beauty Roll On:\n\nVery average. It was the first one i used (canon event). formula feels slightly sticky for the first few minutes. No sweat control, it just mixes the smell with the deo’s. And no visible brightening. \n\n6/10 WNRP because there are better options now.\n\nRexona Shower Fresh Roll On:\n\ndecent for odour control but way too strong for sensitive skin gave me a slight burning sensation especially on freshly shaved days. works if you need something heavy, but it’s definitely not gentle. \n\n7.5/10 WNRP for me personally cause i have too sensitive skin.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I think this is the best my hair has ever looked, really wish I had more pictures with it. Switched bc my hair started feeling really greasy and product heavy to the point I was washing nearly every day.\n\nPic 2: Cantu leave-in conditioning repair cream, Cantu coconut curling cream, and Aunt Jackie's flaxseed elongating curling gel.\n\nThought these products would stretch my curls more but somehow the opposite happened. Heavy, greasy feeling was even worse than previous routine. Look wasn't bad, tighter curls are just not what I'm going for personally so certainly not worth washing every day for.\n\nPic 3 (Current routine): Carol's Daughter devine strength leave-in cream, Not Your Mother's Curl Talk defining cream, and LA Looks extreme sport gel.\n\nGreasy feeling is gone and I'm back to only washing my hair once or twice a week. My hair is stringy and frizzy however. Any hold I get is lost within a few hours and my hair is left a frizzy mess because my gel won't leave a cast at all with these products under it.\n\nSo either my hair feels bad and I have to wash constantly but it looks the best it's ever looked, or my hair looks bad but feels okay. Do I just suck it up and accept the greasy hair? Any other product recommendations or styling tips?",

I know that generally, it is advised to not use aggressive acids too frequently, and generally to use at a different time or alternate days as a retinoid to avoid irritation.\n\nHowever, I hate the sebaceous filaments on my nose (and lesser extent, chin), and they truly look best when I blast them with AHA/BHA toner daily or every other day, and then apply a very thin layer of La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ as an occlusive before bed (shout out to Natalie O'Neill for the Cicaplast hack). Is this too much? Or since these are oily and not sensitive parts of my face is it ok? I do struggle with redness (possibly rosacea but haven't been to a derm yet) on my cheeks, but I use a cotton pad to apply the toner only to nose/chin.\n\nI have been alternating days between the exfoliating toner and a retinal (either the Ordinary or Beauty of Joseon). The retinal goes on the whole face and I don't really see any reaction to it (redness was there before and still there after, no change no matter what I do). Any tips? Am I going overboard with actives?",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

Before I started using it, I used to leave my face quite wet before moisturising because that makes it feel, and look best. Obviously I have to apply Vit C on dry skin, so I did for a few days and my skin felt overly dry, tried Vaseline but that clogs my pores and gives me acne. So I have recently tried applying it on dry face, giving my face 30 minutes and then moistening my face or ice water dunking (in the morning), after which I moisturise as I used to before. My question was, does this negate any of the effects of this serum? Is there a better way you would recommend? I use the La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ and a ceramide moisturiser, both. ",

Never mind the moles (which keep popping up every fiscal year for no reason) it’s not showing well on camera, but my whole face has these tiny little white bumps. And I don’t know how to even approach treating it? \n\nI added Purito oat in calming gel for hydration and Cerave for cleansing. My routine is very hands off. The thing with my face is it’s never just one egregious obvious flaw i can address but a million little bumps. I’m about to bite the bullet and get another accutane prescription but I don’t think my liver is at a good place it’s barely flushing the copious amounts of sucralose im consuming on a day to day.\n\nWhat do i do? 😭 i hope the pictures are showing the problem ",

I got another chemical cut, i had to cut my long blonde hair short. eventually i dyed it dark blonde light brown again but then i discovered the highlift color dye. i dyed it in nye of 2024 to 2025 and my hair was doing great. i dye the roots every month, but lately my hair has been feeling reaalllllly weird. like to a point that i feel guilty of even thinking about dying it more cause i seriously feel my hair falling off. my big problem is, i HATE seeing myself with any color but blonde. my natural hair is very similar to the color of sydney sweeney's roots, and what i have right now is whats in the first picture. i ve been feelin my hair getting thinner, having even more frizz, it feels dry but hydrated at some parts(?) idk i feel like im going crazy. my hair gets more sensitive in the winter but what should i do? any hairdresser can give me an honest advice? i have more pictures if needed for a more deep analysis but i kinda wanna hear opinions, what colour should i do? i was thinking in the last picture because she has \"dark\" roots but with the rest of the hair in that darker blonde, she still passes the blonde vibe(?) idk im so confusing and tired, i reallly wanna have nice, healthy and really big hair.

I’m also interested in whether this seems right for my skin (more details below and I’ve included a picture of my skin today).\n\nThe practitioner said my chin is quite clogged up, that I have mild rosacea (as I suspected) and that I do likely having perioral dermatitis around my nose (previously confirmed by an online doctor).\n\nAs you can see in the pictures in the morning, I have been advised to use the iS Clinical Cleansing Complex followed by iS Clinical Active Serum (every other day at the moment whilst I get used to it) on problem areas (chin, nose and part of forehead), La Roche-Posay Effaclar H ISO-Biome and lastly Anessa SPF50+ (I’ve been using this SPF daily since going to Japan in January 2025).\n\nIn the evenings, I’m using the iS Clinical Cleansing Complex, Azelaic Acid (finishing off the 15% before I move onto the 20% which I got this week - seeing every other night at the moment as I stopped consistently using the 15% around a month or two ago) and then La Roche-Posay Effaclar H ISO-Biome.\n\nThe practitioner I saw advised against using the Avene Cicalfate or the LRP Cicaplast as I’ve been using one of those every night - instead she recommended that I use it once a week if my skin is looking a bit dry or on areas such as around my nose as it can get quite dry as I seem to have perioral dermatitis around it which I’ve had for years.\n\nI’m in my mid 30s. Started Botox recently just in forehead and 11s. Do not want to use any type of retinol/vitamin A due to future fertility plans.

Someone who has expertise in treating scars, especially rolling scars and boxcar scars.\n\n2.

I normally don’t wear makeup, so this felt like a lot for me, even though I tried to be mentally prepared for a glam look.\n\nI didn’t like how much blush there was, that my lips were slightly over-lined, or the eyeliner on the upper lash line. I’d also like my acne concealed better (I know makeup can’t hide texture, but the redness is still coming through the foundation near my chin). I plan to tell the artist to change these things for the day-of, but I’m looking for other opinions as well.\n\nI’m just looking for feedback on the makeup, since I can’t look at it objectively and am not used to wearing much makeup. Thank you in advance!",
