I think I can do a great job at home but it does hurt my back 😅. \n\nI just feel like no matter where I go, the pedicures I get are such a disappointment. Am I a perfectionist? Not exactly, but I would hope you’d do a better job than me. \n\nEvery single time: \n- Cold water\n- Cut, scraped, or pinched\n- Polish on my cuticles\n- Constantly fixing the paint job after the fact\n\nI’m always polite and tip well. $10 for a $50 pedi. I never say anything about this stuff. But like - come on? I hate shelling out my hard earned bucks for such a consistently awful experience. \n\nIs it that the people can’t see? They don’t care? \n\nI’m literally currently leaving an appt with a scrape on my toe from the nail file… I think that’s the third appt in a row where I’ve left bleeding. \n\nI’m about to buy some of those magnifying glasses so I can start doing my pedis at home. \n\nAnyone else???",

I can no longer keep up with a normal hair routine,  Brushing my hair, applying product and diffusing all causes me too much pain now.  i had to find a better way that was easy, accessible, affordable,  and maximized the beauty i wanted.\n\ni decided to experiment and this is the routine  that created  the hair above, the hair i have wanted for literal years:\n\n dry brush and detangle (my dad helps me with this)\n\n Shampoo really well\n\n Conditioner in mid section and ends, not roots\n\n Squeeze out excess water and blot with the towel\n\n Take a curl brush with slightly damp, NOT REALLY WET, hair, brush upward against the grain of your hair from the underneath brushing up, this is done to create curl sections\n\nflip your head upside down, gently loosen your roots with your fingers so your roots are not stuck your  head, and then scrunch all the way to the root\n\nflip all your hair forward infront of your face. air dry like that, you basically have to look slightly down till its dry.\n\nonce fully dry flip upside down, fluff the roots, then spread your fingers wide, slip your fingers in the mid section of your hair, and shake. do not brush out  the curls with your hands, just shake.\n\nflip right side up, fiddle with it for i minute, fluff where you need to, and your done.\n\ni know this wont work for everyone, for some this will dry out your hair too much, but i did everything the beauty industry tells you not to do with curly hair and my hair has literally never looked better. i don't  care if this is somehow unhealthy for my hair, im simply too disabled to do more effort than this. maybe if it gets dry I'll do a night with coconut  oil to rehydrate, but this is my routine  forever  now.\n\n I wasted so many years thinking there was something wrong with me or my hair or that the way I wanted my hair wanted to look was not possible,and it was just lies. the thing that was making my hair look bad was product. my hair has always been hypersensitive  to product, even a half dollar size of mouse weighs down my hair. with nothing my hair is so soft, light, and fluffy. i have the volume i want, the definition, everything.  And I do not care if I was possibly using the wrong product and different product would help my hair more,  Like I've said I'm too disabled for a 5 step product routine these days. this routine  is what I've  needed. its perfect.\n\n Maybe you don't need 5 different $30 hair products, maybe  the issue isn't  the wrong product, its product at all. maybe with no product  but the right styling  method, you can have what you want ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯. maybe try going no product and air drying, then slowly incorporate each product to better understand your hair, idk. \n\ngood luck to all others on your curl journey. im very happy i finally  figured  this out. oh also please do not give me any advice, im content with what im doing! &lt;3 i just wanted to share this success in hopes it can help others.",

This generally makes me look much older and more worn than I actually am. I’m wondering if people have any general tips to bring the light back to my eyes and face that I had before?\n\nAdditional info about what changed:\n- way less sunlight exposure (UV is always 0 here)\n- diet changes – I honestly eat higher quality food here but way less variety\n- I’m drinking less than I used to and sleeping more, but definitely could use more sleep in general\n- I changed my facial products. I use the most basic sensitive cleanser and moisturizer and home and I’m doing the same here. Have been experimenting with different products to try to reduce the acne but it hasn’t helped much\n\nI’m looking for general tips, nos super interested in expensive facial products and whatever because I’ve never used them. Are there vitamins/foods/strategies or more basic products I can use to look less tired and withering? TIA!!",

      "content": "This year I have finally mastered how to detangle and wash my hair, and since then my hair has gotten much longer and denser. It’s been over 5 years since I grew out my hair from literally 1 cm and it is now just past my waist when stretched. This routine has been optimized for fine textured, dense, 4a-c hair:\n\n1. The most important step— I detangle with african pride pre poo AND aussie miracle moist conditioner. The combination gives INCREDIBLE slip that is akin to detangling in the shower, but without wasting all that water. I finger detangle, then use the tangle teezer for fine and fragile hair, as well as the unbrush (depending on how fine textured the section of hair is). I twist my hair in 8-9 twists to prep it for washing.\n2. Im currently using Donna’s choice moisturizing shampoo and deep condition with TGIN honey miracle; both are amazing for winter haircare. I shampoo and deep condition my hair while is in twists. The trick is to twist it so that the twists are loose in the roots, but firmer in the mid shaft and ends.\n3. I towel dry and apply camille rose butter gel and chebe-infused hair grease (I literally mix a chebe pomade I found on etsy with Softee hair grease).\n\nChebe is works wonders length retention and is a ritualistic beauty practice for women in Chad.\n\nI braid my hair in a couple braids overnight, then two strand twist it (about 12-16 twists) the next night so I can have a bomb twist out. The key is to keep your hair tucked away most of the week—claw clips, twisted/braided up dos, ponytails, buns, etc. I take style inspiration from African beauty bloggers. \n\nDaily— I spray my hair with either water, Oyin juices and berries leave in, or a fenugreek and rosemary spray from etsy (Queensanity). It depends on the humidity in the air, because glycerin and dry winter air doesn’t always mix!\n\nMonthly—I do a protein treatment with Curlsmith bond repair and clarify my hair with the Strands of Faith clarifying mask. I’ve also started using Pattern clarifying shampoo, which works pretty well.\n\nQuarterly—I trim my own hair after using the Revair to stretch it. Staying out of the salon helped my length retention exponentially because these stylists have zero patience for coily hair and sky high prices. ",

I’ve always had issues with frizz and getting my hair to cooperate, but I feel like it’s finally time to ask for help, lol. \n\nHere is my routine: \n\n1. I wash my hair every other day. In the shower I use Pantene pro-v repair and protect shampoo. Once that’s washed out I use Monday curl define conditioner, and I brush it through my hair with a wet brush. I let it sit while I soap/shave and washing it out is the last thing I do before I get out of the shower. \n\n2. I dry it with a microfiber towel until it’s just damp, then I use Jamaican black castor oil leave in conditioner from the body shop. I get a blueberry/grape sized glob, rub it on my fingers, and then do my best to spread it through my hair without running my fingers through it to mess up the curls. \n\n3. Once it’s all spread through I scrunch my hair up with my hands for a bit, and then I let it air dry. I don’t brush or comb my hair unless I’m in the shower with conditioner in it. \n\n4. I typically only use the leave in conditioner when I’m planning on going out somewhere, but I get frizz whether or not I use it. I’d really love to see my hair with more defined curls, especially at the top of my head, with less of the frizz of course!! Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ",

I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
