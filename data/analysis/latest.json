      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "For context I’m a 20yrs old woman and have never had such bad acne until recently. I haven’t had any acne throughout my teens until my late teens around 18yrs old. At first it wasn’t that bad a few bumps a month, spots showing up and leaving, things of that nature until around the age of 19 where I’ve started to have the worst flare ups ever. Monthly my acne worsens around my chin, forehead, and cheeks. At first when it started I thought it was because of my weight loss. When I finally lost the weight around 18 I thought it was my hormones regulating that caused the acne, but I’m not sure anymore. It’s honestly so horrible and what makes it worse is that I have very sensitive skin while also having certain areas that overproduce oil (my forehead and nose) and my face is very sensitive when it comes to any products. During winter I suffer from dryness around my cheeks and they begin to flake. I’ve been trying to get into skincare but nothing is working. When I mention it to my mom she claims it’s hormones as well and it will eventually go away since I was late hitting puberty I think it may be a late acne spree now, but again I’m not sure. The acne around my chin won’t go away and the cleanser I’m using makes the problem worse I think but I’m not sure. I use “The Beauty of Joseon” products like their double cleansing set, their AHP BHA toner and moisturizer, while also sometimes using a Aztec clay mask and a CeraVe cleanser bar for oily skin, but they don’t seem to help. I can’t use their (BOJ) Ginseng products because it starts to burn my face super bad and I’ve even suffered from chemical burns before, other products also cause this reaction. I workout almost everyday and get 4-6 hours of sleep 3-4 days a week while getting around 8-10 hours for the remainder of the week and it interchanges because of work. I drink 2-3 bottles of water a day and try to eat relatively healthy foods. Can anyone recommend anything to help or is this normal? Any products I should try out or avoid?",

I (23F) grew up pretty poor and wasnt taught good self hygiene habits largely because we couldn't afford much and my mother also didnt know much around it. \n\nI have type 1b/1c hair so pretty straight and I also have pretty thin/fine hair. It HAS gotten thicker since I've switched to using higher quality products in my hair and keeping up with maintenance on it. However my hair doesn't seem to want to grow past a certain length (about 4-5inches below the shoulder) and I REALLY want it to grow longer. \n\nI wash it nearly daily or at least every other day as I have an oily scalp and hair training for less frequent washes has not shown any improvements. My hair does have green highlights right now done at a salon and I use Matrix color shampoo and a Paul Mitchell leave in conditioner 2x a week. HOW can I get my hair to grow longer and perhaps thicken out some more too? \n\nI am also open to any other advice around skin care, makeup, etc as I am doing my best to self teach personal care. Thank you for any help!\n\nTL;DR - Want my hair to grow longer/thicker. Would like advice on how to get hair to grow longer through at home/self care. ",

It tends to be itchy half the time, and it’s inflamed and some look like there’s balls of blood underneath the surface of my skin. I’m not fully sure what the cause is, at first I thought it was my medication, but after I lowered the dosage, my acne still got worse. Could be my diet? Unsure. \nMy dermatologist canceled on me so I have to wait a whole month and I’m pretty upset about it. My face makes me insanely insecure and I’m not sure how to fix it. Googling just says this type of acne needs professional help. \nMy current routine is using 10% BPO Cerave day and night. Was using differin as well but I recently stopped a few days ago. Not sure if that was a good idea cause I can’t tell if it was helping or not. I also use the lightweight cerave daily moisturizer. I also saw that washing my face with a cleanser at night and then only rinsing with water in the mornings is good.\nA few years ago when I went to the dermatologist, they recommended me tretinoin and that seemed to work but eventually I ran out and didn’t need it after 2 years. Unfortunately my acne came back unexpectedly. Might go on that again but just wondering what steps can I do myself to better my acne cause I’m so tired and I get so insecure making eye contact with others cause of it.\n\nWhat can I do to clear this up? \nThank you!",

I’ve only been trimming it for the past 2–3 years, and I bleached some highlights about a year and a half ago (all done at a salon). I’m going to my hairstylist tomorrow and I’m wondering if I should cut more than just the usual few centimeters.\nI don’t want to cut too much because I still want to grow it past my waist (right now it’s just below my shoulder blades), but the bleached parts are still pretty dry and I’m also kind of bored of the lighter color in the mids and ends. I’m trying to avoid dyeing it again because the last time I did that, it completely ruined my hair and I had to cut it up to ear length.\nDo you think cutting more than usual would actually help it grow faster, or is that just a myth?\nFor reference, in the photo my hair is dried and “straightened” with a round brush. Usually it’s wavy, and when it was short it was super frizzy and curly 😂. I use moisturizing and biotin masks regularly and always apply leave-in conditioners and oils accordingly to what my stylist recommends (he is not only a professional but also a family member so I trust him with my life haha!)",
