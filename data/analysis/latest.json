      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I’ve been using Minimalist’s 8% glycolic toner and their 32% AHA/BHA/PHA peel for a while. When I first started, both used to sting a lot. Recently… nothing. No burn, no tingle.\n\nI thought the formulas had gone weak, so I tested both with pH strips.\nThe glycolic toner still shows pH ~3.5–4, and the peel gives that classic low-pH orange/red edge that strong acids normally show.\n\nSo the formulas are absolutely fine.\n\nThat’s when the concept of barrier adaptation made total sense.\n\nHere’s what actually happens:\n\nYour barrier gets stronger with consistent use. Early stinging is normal, but long-term users often stop feeling it.\n\nIf your routine already includes other actives (like lactic acid, vitamin C, glycolic masks), you’re already exfoliating → less reaction.\n\nMore hydration = less sting. Moisturizers, snail mucin, hyaluronic sunscreen all buffer acids naturally.\n\nHealthy skin doesn’t scream. Once your barrier is stable and non-irritated, acids feel mild regardless of pH.\n\nStinging is not a measurement of effectiveness. pH + concentration determine performance, not sensation.\n\nTL;DR:\nIf your acids stop stinging, it usually means your skin has adapted — not that the products lost strength.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I’m a 20yr old F struggling with spots on my nose for 2 years now.\n\nI use CeraVe foaming cleanser twice a day, and use CeraVe moisturiser twice a day. I use a clay mask once or twice a week.\n\nI have tried using CeraVe Sacylic Acid cleanser and Paula’s choice BHA, no improvement.\n\nI have been off and on birth control, no change, and I did not have spots through puberty.\n\nI don’t wear makeup.\n\nI regularly wake up with many whiteheads, or raised red spots. They don’t hurt, but my skin is always red and inflamed. When I cleanse my skin, the red bumps occasionally leak a clear liquid. My skin is very oily and dry at the same time.\n\nThe rest of my skin has very few issues, the occasional spot on my chin but that’s it.\n\nI feel like I have tried everything that i have been suggested, but it just isn’t improving.\n\nAny advice?\n\nWould like a dermatologist to be the last resort.\n\nThanks!",

Easy to blend. Might pill if you layer too many products or use a thick/matte moisturizer underneath it. I skip moisturizer when I use it.\n\nWhite Cast : Low to None\n\nFragrance : None\n\nBest Suited for : All skin types except for oily. I have combination acne-prone skin and it did not break me out.\n\nSweat proof : No (Check out the unwind version)\n\nEye sensitivity : No stinging\n\nPrice : 599 but you can get it under 300 for 50 grams\n\nProtection : 7/10, gives decent protection. Better than a lot of gimmicky sunscreens, but there are better ones out there. \n\nReapplication : Easy to re-apply but definitely feels heavy.\n\nMy experience: \n\nI mainly use it for indoors for two reasons :\n\n1. It works like moisturiser + sunscreen in one. I skip moisturizer as it is quite moisturising.\n\n2. Two fingers’ worth feels heavy on me, and makes me sweat and makes my face look a little dull. So for indoors I apply less amount and it works fine.\n\n\nBeen using it for about a year now. Earlier this was the only sunscreen I used, but I did notice slight tanning with outdoor sun exposure (even with 2 fingers worth). My only real issue is that it feels more like a moisturizer with an SPF, which works on most days but once you get tanned it’s hard to reverse, especially with the UV index in summers. For indoor, it does the job.\n\nVerdict : Would repurchase for indoor use only.",

It has gotten a lot better, but rn I do have a few of these deep hard lumps, not painful after a few days but stays for weeks and weeks. One on my cheek and a couple small ones on my chin. \n\nIts a rollercoaster. Since 2018 I’ve experienced acne (cystic and normal pimples). The pictures show my skin at its best (2023/2024) and then at its worst (June 2024). \n\nI have a prescription for Epiduo. \n\nMy routine is as follows: \nAM\n1. tir tir milk skin toner (been using for a few weeks and no new breakouts, very calming)\n2. Torriden Dive in serum (if my skin is extra dry\n3. Vitamin C – Purito or Mediheal\n4. Skin1004 sun screen \n*makeup (try to stay conscious of ingredients)\n\nPM\n1. balm/oil cleanser – Banilla Co, the ordinary squalane\n2. cleanser – blemish control by Cerave\n3. toner – tir tir milk skin toner (if skin is extra dry)\n4. 1-2 serums (in order of how often)\n- azelaic acid – anua 10+, Cos De Baha \n- torriden dive in serum\n- skin1004 poremizing fresh ampoule \n- anua PDRN 100+\n- the ordinary Niacinamide \n5. Epiduo (every other night)\n6. Moisturiser – Purito Oat-In Gel or Mighty Bamboo panthenol cream \n7. Pimple patches\n*which serum I use depends a little on my skin. F.ex the PDRN is wonderful at soothing, but if I use it too many days in a row it breaks me out, but once in a while doesn’t seem to cause an issue. The pure Niacinamide serum is a bit strong for me, so I only use it occasionally. When I use Epiduo, I limit the use of harsh actives in my other serums. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to get rid of those hard lumps? Or if anything in my routine is alarming? \n\nI have found this works the best so far. It’s been great at treating my scars, and my breakouts are a lot more manageable. And this is the routine that got me away from my worst and kept me away from it. But I still get 1-2 decent size cystic acne spots very month. Do I just have to live with it?\n\nMy doctor said to use Epiduo every night, but that feels harsh. I wanna balance skin barrier with acne treatment. \n\nI have always noticed my period plays a role. I am on the pill, and has been on the same one until a few months ago when I changed to Yana (Dienogest and Ethinylestradiol) because of suspected endometriosis, and I do not take ‘period breaks’ as per gyno orders. My cramps are now a lot better. Not sure if it’s had an effect on my skin. ",

      "content": "Hey everyone, need some help and wanted to share something that recently happened to me\n\nI’ve always used Afnan 9PM before—bought from different sellers and never had any issues. But this time I ordered it from a seller called Perfume Palace, and after applying it on my wrists, I got red patches, itching, burning sensation, and swelling. Both wrists turned red and painful within minutes.\n\nA similar reaction happened recently with Lattafa Khamrah Quahaa — my whole body started itching and became red after using it. I’m genuinely shocked because I’ve never reacted to fragrances before.\n\nRegarding the seller experience (Perfume Palace):\n\nI had already emailed them to cancel my order because I got suspicious after reading a few bad reviews about them.\n\nThey ignored my email, didn’t respond for 4 days, and later claimed the order was already shipped — which was false because they shipped only after that.\n\nI noticed they delete negative comments on their Instagram, which feels very sketchy and dishonest.\n\nOverall, 1/10 experience — would not recommend.\n\n\nBecause of this whole situation, I’m planning to ask them for a refund and return pickup, since I don’t trust the product quality anymore I don't know what they are mixing cozz  the reaction was serious.\n\n\nLooking for advice:\n1. Has anyone else experienced skin reactions from Afnan 9PM or Lattafa Khamrah / Quahaa Decants?\n\n2. Could this be a fake / reformulated / bad storage batch?\n\n3. Any tips on writing a strong refund request email or dealing with sellers legally?\n\nI’ve currently stopped using any fragrance until my skin heals.\n\nSummary:\nApplied Afnan 9PM from Perfume Palace → burning, swelling, and red patches on wrists\nKhamrah Quahaa also caused full-body itching and redness\nSeller ignored cancellation request, deleted negative comments, and delayed reply\nTrying to get a refund and warn others\nNeed help/advice from the community 🙏",

My hair falls even if I run my hands through  the haur.  The left photo(orange) is recent. The right photo is 3 months ago.\n\nThis hair loss has been continuous since last 1 month and is not slowing down.
