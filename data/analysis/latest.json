Bhua recommended some products too.\n\nNothing worked for me. And then for the first time ever, I went to a dermatologist. And she prescribed me some gel, creams, acids(BHA if you call that, idk) etc. and that literally helped my skin so much. \n\nPlease visit the dermatologist. Don't experiment with different products if you have acne-prone skin. \n\nI have oily, acne-prone skin. I suffered so much because of experimenting. \n\nYes, there are many scars left still, but i believe on my dermat treatment. It should be clear by next year or so.",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Recently my new GF kiddingly said want to see me with hair, then due to my curious nature, I start to research about AGA and many things. After a few weeks, I decided to start with 1.25mg of oral fin and 5% topical min in late August. September was a bit of a messy routine due to my father going back and forth to the hospital ICU. Also, I'm adding a derma roller and then switching to a stamp once a week. Kinda surprised with the result just now. At first, I thought it was my bias, but when tried to collage two pictures spanning 2 months apart, it was clear there is progress. I just wish I could shown it to my recently deceased father, he jokingly looking forward to have a same hairstyle with me when I succeeded growing hair lol\n\n*My father died on age 75 with head pretty much full of hair haha Bonus pic of him added 💕",

      "content": "I have been on my own curly hair journey since 2020, and it has inspired some of my friends &amp; family members to start their own. My stepmom asked me the other day if I could come over soon to show her how to wear her hair natural/curly, as she is going on a long trip to Costa Rica and doesn’t want to deal with blow drying/straightening. She is very low maintenance/no frills, so I want to keep it as simple as possible. Over the summer she showed me her hair and said “look, I’m rocking curls like you! And I didn’t put anything in it, just air dried”. \n\nIt looks like she has a 3A curl pattern that would of course come out a lot more with products.  She has course, thick, all silver hair. I got her my favorite leave in conditioner (tres luxe untie the knot) and another favorite one-product-routine item I love, the JVN air dry cream. I also plan on getting her a spray bottle for refreshing, and maybe a gel as well. She said her only concern is that she loves to brush her hair but she knows you aren’t really supposed to brush curly hair. I’ll explain to her when you CAN brush it, but I’m not sure which brush to get her? I personally brush my hair before I shower. I’ve tried the curl bounce brush and it honestly isn’t my fav as I still can’t figure out how to properly use it. \n\nTLDR: Does anyone have any recommendations for a brush I can suggest to her for her 3A, course, thick, silver hair? One that can help her with her own curly journey. Any suggestions for a gel would be nice too! I don’t think she would want one with a gel cast; I prefer a cast as my hair holds better that way, but I think she would prefer something lighter. ",

I was on a short fitness journey and i had to change how i eat too (less oily stuff, anti-inflammatory food, greens and high proteins diet) and i truly felt it helped my skin calm down. Also kept my skincare very minimal (facewash, serum, benzoyl peroxide cream, ceramide moisturizer, sunscreen) it was a long process of trial and error to find which products worked for me and i feel like im on the right track now. \n\nI also just cut my hair very short bec I really wanted to cut my hair but i kept holding back bec i felt like if i had short hair it would show my face more and my long hair was helping me hide my face and acne🥲 it feels so freeing to know it’ll get better.

      "content": "Hi! \n\nI would like to start oiling my hair and I need some advice on the following: should I even do it? What's the best oil for my hair and expectations? How to oil it? (Skip paragraphs about my hair and hair care, if you don't need that information to give me advice)\n\nSo a little bit about my hair - I have straight,  fairly thin hair, natural colour. When I was a baby I had black curly hair, but with time, it has lightened to dark blonde/light brown colour and it has straightened completely. It cannot hold a curl for the life of me. My hair is around my waist length now, and it has been growing fast. It's been getting thicker too (not sure if it's bc of supplements or new shampoo conditioner). But the only issue I have - it's frizzy and although it feels soft, it can sometimes look a little bit like hay. There is not much shine to it. Also, my scalp I would say, is on the oily side.\n\nSo first question, if I want to increase the shine, maybe strengthen my hair, would oiling help? And would it be okay to do even with my scalp being quite oily already?\n\nNow when it comes to hair care, or my hair routine, this is the usual - I shampoo it and I use a silicone scalp massager to get the shampoo to reach every root, and to clean all of my scalp. I rinse and then squeeze out as much water from my hair as I can. I then lather in the conditioner, focusing mainly on the ends and avoiding the scalp. I put my hair up for a bit (1-2 minutes), while conditioner is sitting in my hair. Then I rinse the conditioner out. After I come out of the shower, I towel dry my hair and I add a hair serum, starting from the ends up. Once a month, I use a scalp scrub, to really clear out the pores. And maybe once every two months, I do an ampoule of hair \"filler\" treatment (l'ador hair fill up, korean). And I do, unfortunately, end up air drying my hair. I know I need to stop that xD.\n\nNow with all of that information, do you have any recommendations of what hair oil should I use for my hair? I want it to become shinier and less frizzy, but I also don't want to have my hair start thinning again, so what could I use?\n\nAnd most importantly, how should I use it? During my research, I got very confused, because everyone seems to do it differently, so I guess it depends on hair type. That's why I'm providing as much information that could help.\n\nThank you for advice! And sorry for such a long post 🙈\n\n",

How long did it take to see changes if any?

      "content": "**SKIN DOWNLOAD:**  \nMy acne showed up in my 20s, and I’ve basically been on Spiro since 2012. It helps a ton, but I still deal with redness, inflamed breakouts, closed comedones, texture, the whole mix. A few notes below on my general skincare approach! \n\n* I really try not to fall for trendy skincare or cult products, I’m extremely skeptical by default, I don't have Rouge status at Sephora! \n* I have a dermatologist and I do like working with one, but I get frustrated with the “redness? okay here’s another pill… have you tried Accutane??” approach\n* I do believe acne is often a sign of something internal, I eat pretty healthy, I’m dairy-free, and I’m planning to work with a naturopath next year to do full hormone + gut testing. (I also get chronic yeast infections, which feels related.) I do what I can for gut health, bone broth before coffee, Coconut Cult, etc.\n\n**THE SKIN ROUTINE THAT MADE MY ACNE WORSE : (((**  \nI moved somewhere warmer \\~3 years ago and my skin went from “not great” to “ah shit.” Makes sense, more heat/sweat = more breakouts, so I decided to see an esthetician. Before I moved, I had a Glowbar membership and my skin looked the best it ever has, so I figured why not.\n\nThis esthetician had me on medical-grade everything and it unfortunately wrecked my skin. I was double cleansing with a glycolic acid cleanser 2x/day. I thought I was “purging” and it would get better, I'm afraid it never did. Three months in, no improvement, so I quit.\n\nAnd honestly, my skin has never bounced back...\n\n**WHERE I'M CURRENTLY AT:**  \nI stopped working with an esthetician and only stuck with my derm. For the last two years I have focused on a gentle cleanser (Vanicream) and using tret + Azelaic acid 15%. About a year ago we switched to adapalene because I just could not get past the tret purge. And that’s exactly how I feel overall: like I never get to the “glowy retinoid skin” stage, just stuck in irritation mode.\n\nIt’s been three years and I still don’t totally understand what’s going on...\n\nI lurk this subreddit constantly and wonder if I’m dealing with a damaged skin barrier, but in addition to redness and closed comedones, I also have blackheads in the cheek area and deal with skin texture, so I am in this loop of: am I cleansing too much? or too little??\n\nTo make it extra fun, I got micro needling done in June and have had closed comedones in those areas ever since, pretty sure that was another mistake...\n\nAt this point, I'm super paranoid: I won’t buy anything OTC unless it passes an acne-check. My barrier feels compromised, but I won’t buy heavy “barrier repair” creams as they typically have oils that don’t pass the acne-check, and anything that isn’t “non-comedogenic” freaks me out. A few reccos from this sub + my thoughts:\n\n* LRP Cicaplast Blam B5+ for skin barrier repair, scared to use this due to these ingredients: Shea Butter\n* I have seen that some folks can’t tolerate Vanicream, because of the “fatty alcohols\" (cetearyl alcohol) (\\*cries\\*), now what do I do? I thought this was the most tolerated / gentle stuff on the market!! \n* I have removed a morning cleanse as a lot of folks recommend this, but I do work out in the AM so I will use micellar water for cleansing in the AM\n* I'm interested to try J or K beauty as I have heard they are more gentle, any reccos that pass the acne-checker? [https://acneclinicnyc.com/pore-clogging-ingredients/](https://acneclinicnyc.com/pore-clogging-ingredients/)\n\n**CURRENT ROUTINE (still on Spiro 50mg/daily):**  \n**AM**\n\n* Warm water in the shower (micellar water if I work out in AM)\n* Vanicream moisturizer\n* Azelaic Acid 15% (\\~3x week)\n* EltaMD sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n* Micellar water\n* Vanicream gentle cleanser\n* Vanicream moisturizer\n* Adapalene (3x/week)\n\nI'm so discouraged at this point and feeling so stuck, would love to hear your feedback/reccos, thanks a TON!

      "content": "Hey guys! I started my 'curly hair journey' about 2 years ago and my natural texture is high density but fine and it can never make up its mind so each clump varies between 2A (my loosest) and 3-something(my curliest- on a good day). Its kind of like reverse irish curls because i dry brushed my hair as a kid and straightened + bleached it as a teen so the top is curlier than the underneath. My routine for it would consist of umberto giannini mousse all over, eco gel at the ends, and SOMETIMES a cream (same brand as mousse), seperate my hair w/ a curl brush and 'scrunch' my hair with a tshirt/microfibre towel then diffuse.\n\nMy hair will stay intact for the day but overnight it always falls out- ive tried bonnets, pinapple method, buns, plaits, silk scarves, lightweight products, heavy products, different styling methods- nothing has worked more than once!\n\nBecause of this, I would need to refresh my hair everyday or just put it up, however I'm Scottish so it gets wayyy too cold to have to do this in the winter so I've started to just do heatless waves/curls until it gets warmer again in the spring. Im worried this might mess up my pattern all over again!\n\nIm currently washing hair like normal (2-3times a week), applying heat protectant (Chi- 44 Iron Guard) and anti-frizz cream (Umberto Giannini), then blow drying with a revlon brush dryer and putting my hair in a bun overnight- it actually turns out really cute if its a wrap bun! Ive heard even blow dry brushes can damage your pattern, but my hair takes wayyy to long to air dry, and I dont want to loose all the work I put into my hair over the last two years to be gone just because I dont want to freeze to death XD\n\nAny advice?\n\nps. ive added photos of what my hair looked like a few months ago, one was using just scrunch and diffuse, the other was using brush styling (i didnt get the volume right LOL!)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/097uzwj1f76g1.jpg?width=1241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f864a79a15ecb93ef460ecc0d8da1747501c178\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ebn8maj1f76g1.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cd7738f59bbc15a9d536e40c1fa826a3839b9e4",

      "content": "So I have been seeing my hair stylist for 6 years and have always received quality hair treatment for bleaching, coloring, trimming and styling.\n\nSince I have been seeing her a few times a year for all this time I also consider her a friend.\n\nRecently I reached out to her to get my hair touched up (I have my hair dyed a bright fashion color balayage) and I also inquired about hair extensions.\n\nI can't remember when she first informed me that she had just gotten licensed to do hair extensions but I want to say it has been about a year and I know she has been applying different types of hair extensions on clients in the past so I know she has experience doing that.\n\nI had no reason to doubt her...is what I assumed.\n\nSo day of my appointment we spend a few hours just bleaching and coloring my hair like usual and then came the hair extensions. During our small talk she mentions how the price of the hair for the extensions has increased but that the quality of the hair is worth it. She even had the hair pieces prepped to match my bright fashion color hair. She started applying the extensions on the bottom half of my head and then after 5 hours of being in the salon she nervously informs me that she RAN OUT OF HAIR! She admits she underestimated how thick my hair is and will need more. Then she asks me if I can come another day...WITH MY HAIR HALF DONE! Because I trust her I stupidly agreed to come the next day straight from work. She said that I can get a feel of the extensions at least and let her know the next day if they bother me and she can fix them.\n\nThen the following day happens. She applies more extensions to the rest of my head then she explains to me how she'll be trimming the extensions to blend them and all that and when she's \"finishing up\" I look in the mirror and IT LOOKS TERRIBLE! My natural hair is like barely past my shoulders and the extensions are about waist length IT DID NOT BLEND AT ALL! It literally looked like a bad \"Hime\" hair cut. It was so obviously bad she knew it too SO THEN she tells me she will have to remove all the extensions and reapply them. And if anyone doesn't know but removing FRESHLY APPLIED tape in extensions HURTS! Not bad enough to scream or cry but still. So I let her do that then she tells me she has to wash my hair and the hair extensions to remove the product she used for the tape removal and as time goes on it gets later into the evening it is painfully obvious that all of this will take hours and we should reschedule instead. So I told her I'd go next week....\n\nEven when we were discussing rescheduling I told her that I don't know much about extensions but I think she'll need to apply more hair for me for it to at least look blended and decent quality. She appeared flustered she said that she has like 34 or something pieces and if I wanted more hair I would have to pay more. I asked her since she's the professional if she thought I'd need more hair or if the extensions just needed to be reapplied better and...she really didn't know how to answer me. She said she would let me know or honestly I don't remember...\n\nI paid for the service upfront she gave me a $200+ discount for being a loyal customer so I didn't pay the average $1k+ price for extensions but it was still close to it and a large amount of money but at this point I don't even want a refund... I just don't even want hair extensions anymore. I have lost faith in her! \n\nI have wasted my time and (even more) money just traveling to see her for a terrible job and feel bad because I do consider her a friend of sorts... \n\nIdk if I should give her another chance to do the extensions....",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I’ve been struggling for a long time to adequately nourish my hair. My hair air dried is very puffy but has spiral curls underneath moreso by my neck. I don’t use any heat at all just overnight curlers or sock curls and a silk bonnet and pillowcases. On the rare occasions I do use heat, I use heat protectant. My hair is always extremely dry at the ends and my scalp is itchy even after I shower, and honestly even while I am in the shower scrubbing it 😭 my hair is especially dry in the winter, which is where I am right now &amp; those two problems: dandruff/itchy scalp &amp; dry ends get worse in the winter. I also work 5-6 days a week &amp; have to wear a hat for 9 hours every day which I’m not sure contributes to the problem or not of my scalp issue. My current routine is this: \n\n-Wash &amp; condition 3 times a week with pureology hydrate line. Every Friday, Wednesday, and Monday\n\n-clarify using redken clarifying shampoo 1x a week \n\n-deep condition using pureology superfood deep conditioning mask 1x a week only on mid shaft and ends \n\n-hair oil 2x a week with Donna’s Recipe goddess strength oil, leave on for a few hours and wash regularly. (My scalp usually feels really good when I oil it and no longer itches it’s like a sigh of relief).\n\n-pureology leave in conditioner on mid shaft and ends after I get out, every time\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for helping dry/itchy scalp &amp; how to keep hair from being bone dry all of the time? I also can’t get it to grow past the length it is, it’s been the same length for 10+ years and I get regular trims but do want to add length although I did have layers cut last month for some dimension! I also am curious what type of hair I have &amp; how that might help nourish it better to make it less dry, strong &amp; growing. Thank you all :) \n\n",

      "content": "I've seen so many hair transformations where a person with straight/wavy hair starts treating their hair like it's curly, and a few months later they have gorgeous curls.  I've always had wavy hair that gets frizzy but straight with brushing, and never followed any sort of routine other than using a ton of conditioner when washing, and not brushing it the day I washed it so that it at least looked nice for one day.  ('Nice', in my mind, being at least a bit wavy)\n\nI've accumulated some product - a \"low-poo\" shampoo, Not Your Mother's Naturals daily nutrition conditioner, Hairplexx curl mousse, a microfiber hair towel, and the Bounce curl brush, with Rizo's gel on the way.  I'm looking into salt spray.\n\nMy questions:\nMost of these hair transformations are over a few months.  Is there a generalized time period to expect results by?  Should there be an immediate, noticeable difference in the first week or two that gets gradually further from my starting point over a few months, or will it take patience to tell if my hair is wavier/curlier than I've thought for most of my life?\n\nIf finding product that works for any specific individual is a bit of trial and error, and everyone will have different brand preferences for their hair, how do I know if products are 'working' and my hair just isn't that curly, or if I should try a different brand?  Especially when factoring in my above question about how long to see results?  \n\nSo far my hair is just a tiny bit more wavy than it had been, which is slightly disappointing, but it's only been a few days and I am aware that I am very impatient.  I just don't want to be six months in and lying to myself down the line lol",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
