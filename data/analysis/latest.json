      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

My Current Concerns**\n\n* Forehead fine lines: Look like dehydration lines; disappear right after moisturizing.\n* Small bumps on cheeks: Persistent texture; unsure if closed comedones or fungal acne.\n* Cystic acne around my period: Chin/cheeks flare up every month like clockwork.\n\n**2. My Routine**\n\nAM:\n\n1. Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner\n2. Numbuzin No.5+ Vitamin Concentrated Serum\n3. Beauty of Joseon Dynasty Cream\n4. Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun (SPF)\n\nPM:\n\n1. Either Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid (5x/week) or Medik8 Crystal Retinal 3 (2x/week)\n2. Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner\n3. Numbuzin No.5+ Vitamin Concentrated Serum\n4. Balea Vitamin C Capsules\n5. Beauty of Joseon Dynasty Cream\n\nExtras:\n\n* Apply aloe vera gel multiple times a day\n* Use sheet masks / wash-off masks about 1x weekly\n\nDespite trying to hydrate and rotating actives, my skin still feels dehydrated and bumpy, and the hormonal breakouts won't stop.\n\n**3. My Questions:**\n\n1. Any tips for improving forehead dehydration lines?\n2. How can I tell if the cheek bumps are fungal acne vs closed comedones?\n3. What should I try for hormonal chin acne?\n4. Could I be over-exfoliating? (I'm using BHA 5x/ week + retinal 2x/week)\n\nThanks so much to anyone who takes the time to help!",

Over the course of the past two years looking online about hair care and hair types I think I’m somewhere between a 2C and 3A. The reason I’m not sure is because my hair gets tangled and matted so often that I can barely see its natural shape outside of the breakage and frizz. \n\nMy hair routine is really basic as it stands:\n\n•In the shower I use an off brand oily scalp shampoo to clean up any buildup I have. Occasionally I’ll use Rizos Curls Apple Cider Vinegar Scalp Rinse if I want to go for a DEEP cleanse \n\n•After two washes, I go in with Pattern Medium and try to coat most of my hair. After the first rinse with Pattern, I go in a second time and brush my hair while it’s still wet. \n\n•I air dry my hair. Once it’s sufficiently dry I tie it in a pineapple bun and put on a silk bonnet before going to bed. \n\nI thought a bonnet would help with having so much “webbing” my hair does when it gets tangled, but it’s always so intense and I don’t know what additional steps I should be adding to my routine. I just feel like every wash day is a battle to make my hair cooperate and last. \n\nHoping to get any advice from the wonderful people of this subreddit!\n",

      "content": "Hello! For a while, I have had a fairly basic hair routine;\n\nIn the shower...  \n\\- I rinse it.  \n\\- I shampoo it, usually twice (I think with a moisturising shampoo?), as I only wash it twice a week, and also because I use styling products sometimes in the day.  \n\\- I condition it or put in a masque (both usually moisturising), and comb it out, then rinse after about 15-20 minutes.\n\nOutside...  \n\\- I use a Lotta Body conditioning spray.  \n\\- I use a curl-keeping gel.  \n\\- I comb my hair, first with an actual comb, and then with my fingers.  \n\\- I scrunch, and let it air-dry.\n\nI find the above works decently, save for the obvious lack of protein (which I think I will do once a month starting soon), but I'm not sure if it is actually enough, or even the right thing to do. I see a lot of different advice and routines on platforms like these (some of which seem more like advertising than anything else), and they all appear to be far more intricate than what I do. I can hardly wrap my head around all of it, and it makes me think that my hair could be a lot better than it currently is.\n\nIf anything, I would like assistance on making the *structure* of a routine, rather perhaps than an *entire* routine; I would decide which products I should use, based on the (limited) local offerings. I would also like to know if I should regularly change the \"core\" products of my routine (my conditioner, shampoo, etc), or if one or two specific ones is fine (especially as the climate here ranges between \"hot and dry\" and \"hot and wet\" and nothing else throughout the year).",

I have acne which has gotten better in the last year but is still annoying and noticeable.\n\nMy current routine is wash my face with an acne soap (I can't remember the name and don’t have the packaging anymore, sorry) and  apply aknederm creme. Every few days I exfoliate with the body shop tea tree oil facial scrub.\n\nIs the routine shown in the image good? I literally just googled skincare steps and thought this looked good.\n\nAre there any sun screens that are effective, not sticky and clear? I had to stop using sunscreen in the last year cause the sticky feeling and rubbing it in was giving me sensory issues.\n\nHow those layering work? If I put on a serum and then moisturizer, wouldn’t they mix and become ineffective?\n\nIs african black soap good for acne? A friend recommended it to me a while ago and I've done some research on it but it seems a bit like a tiktok trend thing and I don’t want to spend money if it's useless.\n\nIf african black soap is any use, what would it count as? Cleanser, moisturizer or treatment?\n\nWhat else would be effective and affordable cleansers/moisturizers?\n\nThat was a lot more than I anticipated 😅 Sorry about that!",
