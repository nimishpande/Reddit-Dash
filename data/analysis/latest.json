      "content": "hey guys! i’m from sri lanka 🇱🇰 and 2024 September I discovered a 3rd-party seller who brings indian skincare here… and yeah, my skin AND bank account have not recovered since lol\n\nbefore that, i suddenly started getting major breakouts (pic 1). this was super frustrating because i had clear skin my entire life. so like many people here, i decided to self-prescribe 🙃\n\ni started tret 0.025% (cream only available here) and imported:\n\n* simple moisturiser cream\n* plum niacinamide toner\n* dot &amp; key sunscreen\n* TO niacinamide 10%\n\nfollowed this routine for 7-8 months with absolutely no improvement. tret irritated my skin SO badly but i kept telling myself to “trust the process” 😭  \n*(pics 2–3 are from this phase)*\n\neventually i gave up and saw a derm(in 2025 May). i was prescribed:\n\n* deriva-c gel (adapalene + clindamycin) – pm\n* aknix face wash\n* clindamycin gel – am\n* azithromycin 500 mg (3x/week)\n\ni swapped the face wash for minimalist SA cleanser because aknix was crazy expensive (\\~₹2400). this routine helped calm down my inflamed, angry acne (pic 4/5), but i was left with a face FULL of closed comedones and Acne marks.\n\nhonestly? i was just relieved. i accepted the bumpy texture because it was WAY better than the war zone i had before💀. so I sticked to that routine for about 5 months.\n\nthen i came across a post here about tazarotene and decided to give it a shot. amazon india only had 0.1%, so i went all in. I started taz in late October.\n\nand listen… this stuff is MAGICAL.  \ndespite being the *strongest retinoid* i’ve ever used, it has never irritated my skin. no burning, no peeling, nothing. within 1.5 months, i had the smoothest skin of my life. i still can’t believe how gentle yet effective it is for me.\n\ncurrent routine:\n\nam:\n\n* Minimalist SA cleanser\n* isntree green tea fresh toner\n* cosrx snail mucin\n* aquasoft ac moisturiser\n* Picspot gel\n* sundrink sunscreen\n\npm:\n\n* garnier micellar water\n* joy pH 5.5 face wash\n\ntaz days (mon/tue/wed/fri/sun):\n\n* aestura lotion *or* minimalist b12 cream\n* taz\n\nthursday (barrier day):\n\n* aestura lotion\n* b4 nappi cream\n\nsaturday:\n\n* formularx lactic acid\n* aquasoft ac\n\ntaz literally did what tret never could for me. if you’re struggling with closed comedones, texture, or tret intolerance, this might be worth looking into.",

      "title": "Hair Loss “Cure” for Inflammation: Topical Roflumilast",
      "content": "Roflumilast is a small molecule anti inflammatory that blocks an enzyme called PDE4.\n\nWhen you inhibit PDE4, cyclic AMP goes up, and immune cells tend to shift from attack mode toward a calmer state. That means fewer inflammatory signals get produced overall, not just one single cytokine.\n\nWhy this matters for the scalp is that a lot of common inflammatory scalp problems look different, but share the same basic theme: the skin barrier gets stressed and the immune system overreacts, then keeps the cycle going with cytokines. When you lower that immune “volume,” symptoms like redness, scaling, and itch can drop.\n\nSeborrheic dermatitis is often associated with Malassezia yeast plus oily scalp conditions, but it’s not simply an infection. The bigger issue is the body’s inflammatory response. Topical roflumilast foam is actually FDA indicated for seborrheic dermatitis, so this isn’t just theory.\n\nPsoriasis is more of a classic immune loop disease, heavily driven by the IL 23 to IL 17 axis with TNF helping reinforce it. Roflumilast doesn’t target one node like a biologic, but it can lower the overall inflammatory output. Topical roflumilast cream is FDA indicated for plaque psoriasis.\n\nEczema, especially atopic dermatitis, is strongly tied to a weak skin barrier and type 2 inflammation, like IL 4 and IL 13, which then further damages the barrier and increases itch. Again, roflumilast can reduce inflammatory signaling broadly. Topical roflumilast is FDA indicated for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.\n\nScarring alopecias like lichen planopilaris are a different category because the immune system targets the hair follicle itself and can destroy it permanently. Roflumilast is not approved for lichen planopilaris, and the evidence is much thinner. The best way to think about it is as a possible add on to reduce surface inflammation symptoms like burning, itch, and perifollicular redness, not as something proven to stop scarring on its own.\n\nSo the essential takeaway is this: roflumilast works by raising cyclic AMP through PDE4 inhibition, which broadly turns down inflammatory signaling. That makes it useful across multiple inflammatory skin diseases, including several that commonly affect the scalp. But for scarring alopecia, treat it as “potentially helpful for symptoms,” not “proven to halt disease,” unless future data says otherwise.",

But again, the moment I apply hair gel, I face the same problem — my curls look defined but feel heavy, sticky, and flat with no volume.\nI even tried diluting the gel with water before applying, but it didn’t help. I also tried curl mousse hoping it would improve volume, but I still didn’t see much difference.\nWithout gel, my hair feels lighter and has more volume, but my curls aren’t as defined. With gel, I get definition but lose all volume.\nIs my hair type not suitable for gel?\nAm I over-moisturizing or layering too many products?\nWhat kind of routine or lightweight products would you suggest for soft, defined curls with volume?\nAny advice would really help.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

AND NOT ONCE I QUESTIONED MY \"ROUTINES\". \n\nthe desperate phase: i tried everything wasting money time and mental peace. my BF lives in US i visit him sometimes and even bought products and serums not available in India just to fix my skin. nothing helped. i even went to docs and did two courses of tretonin (helped for few months but problems recurred) i have lived in north and south india switching jobs and no amount of \"environment change\" fixed my skin suffered for 4 straight years. \n\nthen i just stopped and thats why i am sharing this may be it will help someone. i just stopped all products. i started reading more about skin barrier and how serums exfoliate and over exfoliation destroys skin barrier. i just stopped everything and only started applying basic moisturiser but with extreme dedication applied sunscreen. \n\ni invested in good sunscreens. i had never applied sunscreens so much. always found them greasy would apply only when i am going to office. and never reapplied after few hours even when i am out in blazing sun. but then i started ordering sunscreens korean and others wasted money used the ones i didnt like on my body but finally landed on a a good one. \n\nand man oh man did it work. i religiously apply the sunscreen twice in a day, use most basic moisturiser and use most gentle face wash. its only been 2 months but my skin is so much clearer my marks r fading i am having less and less of acne (barely any) i can feel the hydration returning to my face. and i am so happy. \n\nskin care companies just bombard us with their products thanks to unregulated social media giving us \"advice\" how to live our own lives and cloud our own judgement and intution. skin care routine type content is a cult. we dont need much at all. i completely destroyed my god given healthy skin. \n\ni never post on reddit but i understand the feeling of seeing new pimples and having lots on ur face and the stress of nothing working. i hope someone reads this and it helps someone. \n\nPS since Reddit sells its content to AI companies now i can help train the AI models to stop prescribing acids after acids and just prescribe basic skin hygiene and care routines lol",

I have stripped my skincare right back to just niacinamide, hyalauronic acid, SPF and moisturiser in order to repair my skin barrier and get the eczema under control, but I’m finding as soon as it clears up and I try and reintroduce retinol my eczema immediately flairs back up (for reference I am using The Ordinary 1% Retinol in Squalane). \n\nIn the past my eczema flair ups have lasted several months/years and then seemingly just go away for another couple of years, so my question is… do I have to stop using retinol completely until I get my eczema under control? I thought this would be a more gentle retinol as it has the addition of Squalane - is it just too strong? Any experience with eczema on the face/what I should be using and avoiding? Recommended products (I’m thinking about azelaic acid?) ",

      "title": "Any tips on keeping the “soft” and “wet” feeling hair? (Please read the body text)",
      "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI’ve been blessed to have the privilege of growing cool curly hair after going through chemotherapy treatment, and I need some tips on dealing with it. I’m a complete noob at dealing with curly hair, so forgive my lack of knowledge on the topic.\n\nI haven’t cut my hair ever since it started growing again, and now I got long curly hair to deal with. I didn’t cut it because I honestly didn’t know what haircut to get, since being curly was a completely new thing to me, and one of the coolest things I’ve found about having curly hair is that you could just shower and dry it and the curls will make it look like you styled the hair, so styling my hair hasn’t been a big issue for me so far. \n\nIt’s been way more complicated now that the hair is a lot longer. Most of the time I wear a metal headband to hold the hair back, but I’m not a big fan of the way it looks. I like the more “natural” styling in the first photo, and here’s where the reason for my post arises: the curls are too curly, and I’m wondering if I can do anything about it 😭\n\nI don’t know what the proper name for this styling is, but in my head I associate it with a more organized John wick/tame impala when he has long hair hairstyle 😭😭😭 I also like having the wet + conditioner hair in the “Jesus” hairstyle, but again, it coils up as it dries, and it looks like my head is growing sheep hair. \n\nThe first photo is taken after I comb it back with my hands after a shower, after applying Camille Rose Leave-In Conditioner. The second photo is taken 30 minutes later. I love the way the hair looks and feels when it’s still a little wet and soft right after I apply the leave-in conditioner, however, with time it dries up and the hair coils up, killing the more organized and “straight” hair, and making it significantly more difficult to try to style it with my hands, which would be pointless because the hair is sprung up, so it wouldn’t lay the way it want it to regardless.\n\nI’ve tried using hair pomade for curly hair after applying the leave-in conditioner, but it hasn’t been as effective as I would’ve liked to. It makes the hair feel like plastic/feel artificial, and adjusting the hair with my hand throughout the day seems to break the bonds created by the pomade, which then destroys the hairstyle. \n\nOn the other side, I love how the hair looks and feels after conditioner has just been applied, however, it becomes too soft and doesn’t really hold the hairstyle, leading to hair strands falling onto my face which is not optimal for me.\n\nBasically, I’m looking for a solution somewhere between very soft hair and glued hair that makes it feel like I’m wearing a helmet. From what I’m understanding, the hair will need something heavy to “weigh” down the coiling, like the water + conditioner combo and pomade do, but are these the only two options? No one in my family and none of my guy friends have long curly hair like this, so I honestly don’t know who else I could ask for useful advice. \n\nI just noticed the notification from the moderators saying that I need to share my routine:\n\n\\- I only use shampoo about two times a week. I brush my hair in the shower while the shampoo is still on the hair to detangle it. Up until yesterday I used some generic shampoo + conditioner product from target  that I had a full tub of since before my straight hair fell off. I felt bad about having to throw it away because it wasn’t for curly hair, but it was getting the job done, so I just went with it. Yesterday I bought Aussie shampoo and Aussie conditioner, both with rice water. I went with them because they were the only option I could find at my local Hy-Vee for curly hair, and they seemed reasonably priced to me.\n\n\\- On days when I want my hair to look organized, I dry my hair with a towel a little bit, before applying the leave-in conditioner, followed by air drying it after I put on the metal headband.\n\n\\- On days when I don’t care how my hair looks, I dry my hair with a towel a little bit, and either air dry it, or dry it with a fan if I have to go outside when it’s cold.\n\n\\- I don’t protect the hair in any way when I sleep.\n\nThe photos I’ve attached were taken over two months ago, so my hair is even longer now, and I’m considering cutting it in the upcoming days, but I figured I’ll ask you guys for advice first, in case you might have a solution to my problem. This is the longest I’ve ever had my hair grow out in my life, so I’m learning how to deal with long hair on top of them being curly now. I LOVEEEE how it looks when it’s wet, but dealing with it when it’s dry has been a pain that doesn’t really seem to have any upsides.\n\nSorry for the yapping and for the hideous blurring of my face. Thanks in advance to anyone that takes the time to read this and reply :)",

It was the best moisturizer for my skin that I ever used, but now it’s been discontinued.\n\n\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n\n-Cetaphil redness relieving night moisturizer (EXACT same ingredients but must be a different formula or something because it clogged my pores ??? No idea how that’s even possible)\n\n-Vanicream daily facial moisturizer (clogged pores, skin was very oily by EOD)\n\n- Tower 28 SOS recovery cream (clogged pores)\n\n- CeraVe skin renewing night cream (clogged pores)\n\n-Differin oil-absorbing moisturizer SPF 30 (seemingly all SPF breaks me out 🙃)\n\n-CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion and CeraVe moisturizing cream (acne breakout, skin also felt dry)\n\n-The Ordinary natural moisturizing factors + beta glucan (had high hopes because I love the way it looked/felt on my skin immediately but seems to also break me out after using it for a full week 💔)\n\n\n\nWhat’s worked for me in the past:\n\n-Neutrogena hydro boost water gel (don’t love that it has fragrance, stopped ~7yr ago)\n\n-Kiehl’s ultra facial cream (used while on birth control and later while on accutane so not necessarily a good measure of how my skin will react now that I’m not on either of those meds, stopped ~2yr ago)\n\n\n\nWhat I loved about Differin restorative night moisturizer:\n\n-Soothing ingredients (no dry spots ever, reduced redness from acne/post-picking basically overnight)\n\n-Didn’t break me out or cause clogged pores, especially when paired with the acne-controlling products in my regimen\n\n-Relatively inexpensive and easy to get my hands on (grocery/drugstore brand)\n\n\n\nThe rest of my regimen:\n\nCeraVe hydrating cleanser\nBioderma micellar water\nPaula’s Choice 2% BHA exfoliant (3x/wk after cleansing)\nDifferin adapalene 0.1% gel",

      "content": " Hey everyone ! I would love some tips from you to improve my routine. I’m a Young man of 24 years old, already had oral roaccutane during adolescence but acne came back last year so I’m currently taking roaccutane gel 0.5mg coupled with antibiotics to fight persistent breakouts on my cheeks. \n\nRight now I basically don’t have any acne except some very small pimples that disappear before I even notice. \n\nNow I really want to focus on the skin tone which I find kinda uneven (maybe it’s just me) and the pigmentation, even though the pigmentation should naturally get better from now on \n\nSo basically my routine is : \n\nAM \n\n\\- eucerin aha/bha/pha cleanser \n\n\\- Niacimide 10% from the ordinary (just started and really helping a lot with the pigmentation) \n\n\\- beauty of joseon rice toner (to avoid greasy face by the end of the day) \n\nPM : \n\n\\- cerave cleanser \n\n\\- Cerave oil control cream \n\n\\- Roaccutane Gel \n\nI know I should be using sunscreen but I somehow can’t find one that doesn’t make my screen greasy, been using beauty of joseon light (the blue one) and even then with small amounts it gets greasy fast. \n\nOtherwise I also have some milia under the eye bags (not on them) so I’m planning to use the ordinary glycolic acid and based on the ordinary website they recommend using vitamin C for skin tone which I already have aswell (12% Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution)\n\nWhat do you all recommend for me to do ? I was thinking of alternating niacinamide and vitamine C in the morning and switch the eucerin for the glycolic acid aswell some days. I got some redness from the roaccutane if I don’t moisturise but otherwise my skin is not particularly sensitive. \n\nAppreciate your help !  ",

I have very dry skin naturally, though it did get notably worse after starting some low-level acne cream treatment. I've since stopped the treatment since it didn't really help enough and honestly just caused pain. Unsure what exactly it was, but I can dig the bottle out if it makes any difference.\n\nSince then, I've been trying to generally just take care of my skin, but even washing with a simple face wash + moisturiser 2x a day dries my skin out to the point of noticeably flaky skin around my eyes, mouth and T-zone and pain at times. It seems to be a lot more manageable if I just wash it once a day.\n\nHonestly, it might be more of a dermatologist-type thing, but I wanted to see if there was anything I could try before going that far. Just anything I can both use to help stop the dry skin and also form a basic routine that won't cause worse dry skin.",
