      "content": "I have heard that blowdrying your hair can cause heat damage, and that products to prevent heat damage can cause build-up on the hair that can weigh it down and make it seem limp and heavy. I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

SO stoked.\n\nRoutine this time: \n\n1. Wash Ouidad Anti-frizz shampo quick to get most of my products out, then InnerSense scalp detox, BounceCurl gentle clarifying shampoo (been a bit and Ouidad shampoo usually does a good job with getting rid of build-up).\n2. InnerSense Conditioner (although NYM conditioner worked and felt quite similar in post about my recent hotel water fiasco) - detangle brush, then while still in shower: \n3. Rake in: dollop of AG Beach Bomb Cream\n4. Rake in:  *NEW* dollop Briogeo Curl Charisma cream\n5. Rake in: *NEW* dollop Briogeo Curl Charisma gel - detangle brush to distribute everything evenly throughout hair, then scrunch every direction raking hair off scalp, rewettingas needed to get clumps to reform &amp; wet-plop in shower cap - finish shower. Then out of shower, the following...\n6. BounceCurl EdgeLift brush - section top &amp; crown, and leave sides &amp; back dangling and do those first\n7. *NEW* NotYourMother's Beach Babe foam, glaze and scrunch, concentrated on roots area, but also lengths each section \n8. Biosilk Rock Hard gelee, emulsify in wet hands and glaze on quarter-size dollop per section, then scrunch until hands feel \"clean\" of product. I put a little emulsified NYM Flash Freeze gel (5) just on the ends that tend to straighten.\n9. Microplop, enough to dry fairly fast\n10. Diffuse cupping just the ends, just a little to set cast on the ends but not put weird bends, just until cast starts to harden.\n11. Hover diffuse - to 100% dry\n[Ali Noskowiak diffuse routine. ](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cz347PyO6LC/?igsh=MWoweWVuZWw1b2NoYw==) To speed up drying after cast is well set, I use the cone on my roots, upside-down, holding casts with my arm to keep them from blowing around until scalp fully dry, then continue to cup and/or hover till fully dry.\n12. 3 drops Righteous Roots hair oil warmed in palms, gather hair on top of head and gently squeeze to ends. Fluff roots. Scrunch any cast around face by smoothing lengths roots to ends with tips of my fingers carefully. \n\nBedtime: Use coily tie to put my hair at my forehead and silk bonnet to sleep. Just water with a couple pumps (to a full bottle of water) of Ouidad Curl Shaper Memory Maker Revitalizing Milk to refresh this morning. ",

I’ve really been wanting to experiment with different hairstyles and routines and would like some advice.\n\nI’ve always had really short and straight hair but my hair got super curly when I hit puberty. Since then, I’ve sort of just rocked messy curly hair with minimal styling and upkeep but I’ve also lately been finger coiling my hair for track meets. At its longest, the back of my hair is around 11 inches, but the length does vary just based on the haircut I got about 6-7 months ago. I was thinking of getting a front taper and using a headband to push my curls back, but what do yall think?\n\nRoutine:\n\n\\- Detangle, Shampoo and Condition with Being Shampoo and Conditioner once a week (I will not get hair wet if I have finger coils in for about 5 days; I’ll only use curl activator)\n\n\\- Condition about every 3 days\n\n\\- If I’m about to do finger coils, I’ll use Being Leave in, She’s Moisturizing Curl Smoothie and Eco gel after doing my wash routine\n\n\\- Bonnet when I sleep",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

      "content": "Hey guys, I’ve(M26) been on finasteride for almost 2.5 months now. I had pretty heavy shedding in the beginning but it has slowed down recently. So far I don’t see much visible regrowth yet. I have a receding hairline and thinning crown. I’m planning to add minoxidil and a derma stamp, but I’m confused about the routine. I start work at 8 AM and I’m worried about applying minoxidil in the morning because I don’t want my hair to look greasy at the office. I usually go to the gym in the evening and reach home around 9–9:30 PM. I was thinking of applying minoxidil around 9:30 or 10 PM and then washing my hair at 6 AM before work. Is leaving it on overnight for about 8 hours enough for proper absorption? Also, how should I schedule derma stamping along with minoxidil? Any advice from people with a similar routine would really help.",
