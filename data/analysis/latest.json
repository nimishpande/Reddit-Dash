      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

When I’m done showering, i let it airdry and I comb it out, but if im really in a jiffy, I lightly take a towel to it as well. \n\n- To stop the hair from being rude in the morning, I tend to sleep on my stomach, even though this hurts me greatly to do, as i am a back sleeper, how can i sleep on my back still)\n\n- In the morning I have little time to get ready, 30 minutes to be exact, I wake up and I comb with those long prong brushes, and its off to classes, thats it.

It wasn’t until early-mid quarantine that my hair started to curl, and even then, it was only after I shaved it. \n\nSome days my hair is straight and poofy, and other days my hair holds curls. Whenever I try and follow a wavy hair routine, the products make my hair straighter than if I just shampoo/condition and air dry. \n\nRight now I use Moroccanoil shampoo and Keune Care Karatin conditioner, sometimes a Keune hair mask if it feels dry. \n\nI’ve been dying my hair since 4th grade, which could definitely play a big part in the bipolar process. I’ve bleached my hair numerous times, but I end up with waves around a week or so after the initial bleaching. \n\nI’m not sure of my hair type or texture, but I do know that I have to knead water into my hair when I shower, otherwise it’ll drip off. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!!!

      "content": "I am 36F, so i always had tiny pimples here there all my life and sometimes some bad phases with multiple pimples at the same time but would clear in few weeks. thats how human skin behaves unless u use filter to show ur face to the world through social media and never leave the house. \n\nthen came a phase in my life where i got influenced by the over bombardment of skin care routine contents on youtube and insta. and oh the aesthetics the ASMR. and then started the self destruction of my skin. i started using all kinds of serums started finding small issues with my skin i am quite light skinned so small marks show and till 4years back people were not criticising the filters or may be i was living under a rock. n i did not realise that its filter and human skin has marks and pores and lines n they all play their biological role (i wasnt enlightened enough i guess)\n\nn then the problems started the deep pimples that wont go away for months, leaving black dots on my face which was never a problem before, dehydrated skin (i am blessed with a supple full skin thanks to my mother who is 65 barely looks 55) but i felt my skin stripped off all of that then larger pores and then more defined lines. AND NOT ONCE I QUESTIONED MY \"ROUTINES\". \n\nthe desperate phase: i tried everything wasting money time and mental peace. my BF lives in US i visit him sometimes and even bought products and serums not available in India just to fix my skin. nothing helped. i even went to docs and did two courses of tretonin (helped for few months but problems recurred) i have lived in north and south india switching jobs and no amount of \"environment change\" fixed my skin suffered for 4 straight years. \n\nthen i just stopped and thats why i am sharing this may be it will help someone. i just stopped all products. i started reading more about skin barrier and how serums exfoliate and over exfoliation destroys skin barrier. i just stopped everything and only started applying basic moisturiser but with extreme dedication applied sunscreen. \n\ni invested in good sunscreens. i had never applied sunscreens so much. always found them greasy would apply only when i am going to office. and never reapplied after few hours even when i am out in blazing sun. but then i started ordering sunscreens korean and others wasted money used the ones i didnt like on my body but finally landed on a a good one. \n\nand man oh man did it work. i religiously apply the sunscreen twice in a day, use most basic moisturiser and use most gentle face wash. its only been 2 months but my skin is so much clearer my marks r fading i am having less and less of acne (barely any) i can feel the hydration returning to my face. and i am so happy. \n\nskin care companies just bombard us with their products thanks to unregulated social media giving us \"advice\" how to live our own lives and cloud our own judgement and intution. skin care routine type content is a cult. we dont need much at all. i completely destroyed my god given healthy skin. \n\ni never post on reddit but i understand the feeling of seeing new pimples and having lots on ur face and the stress of nothing working. i hope someone reads this and it helps someone. \n\nPS since Reddit sells its content to AI companies now i can help train the AI models to stop prescribing acids after acids and just prescribe basic skin hygiene and care routines lol",

      "content": "i feel like my skin type is so impossible and i’m so frustrated!\n\ni’m 19F and began getting what i suspect is hormonal acne (upcoming doctors appointment about this, looking for root cause) around 2 years ago. it gets better and worse in a constant loop and is currently flaring up again. i get the acne mostly on my chin, and also sometimes around my lips and on my jawline. it’s a mixture of whiteheads and deeper, red cystic acne. it tends to scar very stubbornly even though i don’t ever pop them, and can be really painful. the scarring is PIE rather than PIH, and i’m super pale so it’s very noticeable! i also get mild blackheads on my nose but at present im much less concerned with that than the other acne.\n\nto make matters worse, i have incredibly dry skin, often getting flaky. in the last couple of months i started getting dry forehead bumps again which i haven’t had in years, i think it’s fungal acne but i’m not 100% sure if it’s fungal or closed comedones. it popped up shortly after antibiotics for tonsillitis so fungal acne makes sense. in the last few days, ive started getting redness and bumpiness on the right side around my nose and it’s making makeup sit horribly no matter how much i moisturise.\n\ncurrent routine\n\nAM • skin1004 centella-hyalu cica water-fit sun serum SPF50 • round lab birch juice moisturising cream\n\nPM • haruharu wonder fragrance free black rice moisture 5.5 soft cleansing gel • skin1004 centella ampoule • round lab birch juice moisturising cream\n\ni’ve stripped it back to absolute bare minimum with products i’ve been using for a while. they probably aren’t optimal, but they aren’t obviously problematic like most things i’ve tried so i’m just going with it for now until i feel sure about what else to do. \n\nlast summer i was prescribed epiduo 0.1%/2.25% and lymecycline. i used them for around 3-4 months, beginning the epiduo slowly and working up to every other day using the sandwich method. i didn’t take enough pictures to really be able to tell which was silly but it didn’t do a huge amount. i purged, but not crazyyy bad, and it made my skin dry. there might have been some improvement but it was minor and very underwhelming.\n\ni’m going to raise it with the doctor and see what they suggest - i’m in the UK so accutane isn’t an option. i’m a student so also can’t afford to see a private dermatologist unfortunately. i was wondering about prescription strength 20% azelaic acid as my skin responded pretty well to 10% used to help scarring - i found other common ingredients for this like niacinamide didn’t do much.\n\nsorry for the long post, any help at all would be super appreciated. i’m so frustrated and want to get out of the cycle of trying stuff that makes it worse or does nothing.",

Shampoo, conditioner and mask he uses are from so!flow Let’s twist a hair series, used as said on the packaging. \n\n2. Mousse and curl activator were Anwen - Pina Lokada, but he doesn’t use them anymore since they need a lot of work, used as said on the packaging. \n\n3.

      "content": "Most retinoid discussions seem to assume acne is the main concern and that the end goal is always increasing strength, which made me curious how people approach this when that isn’t the case.\n\nI have combination skin that leans dry on the cheeks (especially in winter) and oily on the nose, chin, and forehead. Even in summer, if I don’t moisturize, my cheeks can feel dry while still having a layer of oil on top, which makes actives feel a bit tricky to navigate.\n\nI don’t have a major acne issue. I do get breakouts, but they’re mostly hormonal and show up around my period, and they’re fairly manageable with diet and a simple routine. What I’m more interested in improving is texture\\*,\\* enlarged pores on my cheeks and sebaceous filaments on my nose and chin; and thinking about retinoids from a maintenance or prevention perspective.\n\nFor those whose main concern wasn’t acne:\n\n* Did you start with cosmetic retinol night creams (like Olay or Neutrogena) and feel they were sufficient long-term?\n* Did you go straight to adapalene, even without significant acne?\n* If you’ve tried both, what factors made you choose one path over the other?\n\nI’m less interested in strict recommendations and more in how people frame the decision, strength vs tolerance, prevention vs treatment, and whether a gentler but consistent approach ever feels like “enough.”",
