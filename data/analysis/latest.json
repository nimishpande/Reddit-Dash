      "content": "Hi everyone! Sorry for the long post. These pictures were taken on the third day after wash day. I haven't looked after my hair well by not treating it as curly/ wavy (not sure what the type is yet), but l'd love to start and get my hair looking healthy again. I've tried reading how the curly girl method works and other people's routines, but it's a lot of information and I can't tell what would be good for me anymore. So l had a few questions to ask and am open to any tips you all have for me!\n\n1. I usually have a bunch of split ends. I'm going to get my hair trimmed in a week, but unfortunately a curly hair specialist is out of my budget. Is there anything I should specifically ask the hairdresser for to help accommodate my hair well? I usually get layers and a U-cut which I think has been alright so far. I want to grow my hair out but the split ends keep me from doing so.\n\n2. Along with the split ends, my hair feels extremely dry, especially at the scalp. This leads to too many painful tangles if I leave my hair unbraided. If I detangle my hair, wear a low ponytail and leave the house, my hair gets tangled in less than 10 mins and shrinks to a little ball of fluff. Can you recommend any products like deep conditioners or leave-ins that can prevent this? I know people say to not brush your hair when dry, but it always felt like I needed to with how instantly tangled my hair gets.\n\n3. What l've picked up as the most basic steps to care for curly hair is shampoo &gt; conditioner\n&gt; detangle &gt; leave-in conditioner &gt; a styler &gt; dry. And product selection, moisture or protein ingredients, product application all depend on the hair characteristics? Do you have any recommendations for products I could start with that suit medium porosity and medium thickness hair? I've heard people say that their hair loves protein but I don't know if mine needs that more or moisture or equal quantities anymore 🥲\n\nMy current routine is just:\n1. Detangle with comb before shower\n2. Shampoo: Crème of Nature Argan Oil Moisture and Shine shampoo\n3. Conditioner: Crème of Nature Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment\n4. Air dry\n\nI realised later that the shampoo and conditioner were not CG approved. So I’d love to get some recommendations!\n\nI have tried detangling in the shower a few times but I didn't notice any difference as it gets tangled immediately. Probably because I don't use a leave-in yet maybe?\n\nAdditional notes: 1. I had used the Crème of Nature Argan Oil leave-in conditioner spray on dry hair once and it made my hair extremely stiff. I couldn't comb my fingers through my hair without it hurting. I haven't tried it ever since but l'm guessing it might be a different story if used on wet hair l've iust been scared of trying it. 2. I wash my hair twice a week. \n\nSo if you guys have any advice on how I can start looking after my hair well, make it look not as dry, reduce the tangles, or anything related to how to choose my products, let me know! I'd be really grateful, thanks &lt;3",

However, my face is just constantly red. I also have had this problem since I was a teen, way before I started using any products. It looks as if I’m holding all the blood in my head all the time and it also feels like it if that makes any sense? Does anyone else have this problem? It gets worse when I’m embarrassed or if I’m exerting any effort. Photo reference is Lucky Blue Smith, who I’ve noticed also seems to look red and flushed all the time in the face. I don’t think its rosacea as well, and my skin doesn’t feel stingy or irritated. It’s more of an evenly distributed red throughout my whole face just like this photo of Lucky.\n\nI never expose myself to the sun and it is limited to only my face. My neck is a completely different shade and with no red undertones.\n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations to lessen this redness? It feels like my head is about to pop off especially if I’m embarrassed. It’s less red in the mornings as well when I’ve just woken up.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

I provided some recent pictures of Jennifer Lawrence as inspo. My goal was to go just a shade blonder than my natural dark blonde hair and I tried to communicate to her that I was nervous about going too dramatic, I really wanted to baby step into this and have it be subtle. I chose partial highlights because that was what a different hairdresser recommended to me.\n\nIt turned out very chunky and icy and I feel really sick about it. I can’t tell if partial highlights were the wrong choice or if I mismanaged my expectations but I really dislike it and feel it looks very fake. The internet wisdom that I’ve read says wait a few days to get used to it, and they’ll also fade in time, so I’m resolved to wait until Monday before reaching out to the salon. I’m hoping for some outside perspective, and perhaps advice on what to ask for? At the very least I’d like my roots to blend better with my natural hair color, I think this will look terrible as it grows out. Thanks for your thoughts!",

      "content": "Hey guys, took some courage to make this post. I’m 31 years old and looking through my old photos, I am really starting to notice my age. I work a stressful job and am nervous it’s making me age, so looking for some additions to combat it. I’m pretty on top of my skincare routine, but I’m looking for additional advice and am also curious on people’s thoughts regarding preventative Botox. The attached picture has no edits, makeup, and natural sunlight — this is me “just rolled out of bed”. I haven’t done my skins care routine yet.\n\nMorning Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil/Cera Ve gentle cleanser (whatever Costco has in bulk when I go)\n* Alastin HA serum -Alastin Trihex Technology serum -Alastin Restorative Under Eye Cream\n* Alastin Hydra Tint Mineral sunscreen (I wear it when I leave the house, but I work from home in Chicago and am not exposed to regular sunlight… I know I should be wearing it all the time though so I’m working on that\n* Alastin ultra nourishing moisturizer\n* Vital Proteins Collagen Powder in my coffee\n\nNighttime Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil / Cera Ve gentle cleanser\n* Bioeffect EGF Serum\n\nOnce a month I get either an IPL treatment, Chemical Peel, or a hydra facial depending on the needs of my skin that month. I usually opt for IPL and sometimes combine IPL and hydrafacials. I get reoccurring broken capillaries all over my face during the Chicago winter hence the IPL.\n\nI’ve been on this routine for \\~3 years… occasional tret use from curology, but my skin struggles at even the lowest fraction of a percent w it h continues use. Tried other products like tatcha dewy skin cream (love this but gave the Alastin brand a chance because I got it free and loved it). Tried triple lipid skins cream from skin ceuticals and it wasn’t hydrating enough. Also tried their vitamin e that’s a lot of peoples holy grail, but it also didn’t do much for me after 2 bottles. I really used to struggle with keeping my skin moisturized but it seems happy current state so long as I don’t use Tret (like my skin won’t tolerate 0.009% without freaking out). I use lanolin for my lips, but it’s starting to get colder here and they’re adjusting to the season… for reference I’m originally from FL so Chicago winters have been a struggle.\n\nAnyways, open to all recommendations and am also considering starting preventative Botox. I don’t have much in the way of wrinkles but have noticed fine lines in my forehead, probably from furrowing at my computer screen. If you have any feedback on preventative Botox, would love that as well!",

I have the opposite of Irish curls, the hairs under the top layer are all straight or wavy. I’ve been using Aussie shampoo and conditioner because that’s the only thing that doesn’t leave my hair greasy right out of the shower. I shampoo, conditioner and then shampoo again. I use k18 hair oil rn, and redken leave in conditioner. I recently heard that Aussie has a lawsuit for hair loss. I definitely don’t eat as much as I should so maybe that’s why I’m losing hair. I’m like 95 pounds and 4’10.\n\nAny recommendations on a different shampoo or conditioner, or oil or vitamins?",

The next day, my skin started to have a reaction, forming pimples, closed comedones and  white heads in a few areas of my face, such as my forehead and my cheekbones, as well in my neck. As it was a bit flared up, showing some redness and starting to form a pustule, i used a combination of topical antibiotics with steroids, for a day and a half. The inflamation has passed, but now i am left with this, and i dont know what aproach would be better. At the moment, my routine consists of cerave moisturizing cream for hydration, and cerave foaming gel, for cleansing. My skin is mixed/oily, not prone to acne and was good before all this.\n\nWhat would be your advice? I have my birthday in 4 days and dont want to have my 25th b-day party looking like this!

      "content": "I’ve always had dry, blemish-prone skin with small bumps on my cheeks and forehead. I usually only washed my face at night with Tatcha and used the Pyunkang Yul Calming Serum and Moisturizer. For the most part, my skin has been manageable—just minor breakouts here and there, especially around my period.\n\nAt the beginning of October, I started using an oil cleanser for the first time (before that I was using micellar water). I’m not sure if my recent issues are from the oil cleanser, the salicylic acid, or if my skin is simply purging.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\n\nAM:\n\t•\tRinse face with warm water\n\t•\tApply Pyunkang Yul Calming Serum and Moisturizer\n\t•\tFinish with Supergoop Unseen SPF (though I’ll be switching to Beauty of Joseon soon)\n\nPM:\n\t•\tCleanse with Pyunkang Yul Oil Balm\n\t•\tSecond cleanse with Tatcha Rice Water Cleanser\n\t•\tApply Pyunkang Yul Calming Serum and Moisturizer\n\t\nI recently added salicylic acid to my routine 2–3 times a week to help with the small bumps, since BHA is recommended for that. The first time I used it, I had no issues, but the next day my face felt hot and flushed. I assumed it was irritation, and the sensation went away after a few hours.\n\nNow my skin looks worse than it did earlier in the summer when I started trying to improve it. I’m not sure if this is purging or if one of my products—maybe the cleansing balm or the salicylic acid—isn’t working for me. I know purging can happen and things often get worse before they get better, but I’m wondering if this sounds normal or if I should remove or change something in my routine.",

I'm acne-prone since I wear makeup fairly frequently and trying to find something to manage it.\n\nAM - Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water -&gt; Cetaphil Facial Cleanser - The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Serum -&gt; TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc Serum -&gt; Differin Soothing Moisturizer -&gt; Neutrogena Clear Face Sunscreen\n\nPM - Garnier Cleansing Water -&gt; Cetaphil Cleanser -&gt; TO Vitamin C 23% + HA Spheres 2% -&gt; Differin Night Moisturizer\n\nThis has been my daily routine for the past couple days! I've been hating the texture of TO Vitamin C though and am thinking of switching to Neutrogena Retinol Cream instead when it runs out. My skin isn't super sensitive but I do experience breakouts (mainly cysts or whiteheads on my cheeks). I've been trying to figure out for low-cost products for brightening, acne scars, dark circles and acne prevention. From my research, I landed on these but I'm still unsure if it's overkill or if it'll actually help with my issues.\n\nAny advice appreciated! Thanks y'all",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

A few months later the shedding is out of control, my hair is thin and too soft and it has lost its density and fullness, it looks like I don’t have much hair now and it’s very stringy, I have lost my curl pattern somehow and the ringlets have become zig zaggy waves that won’t curl much of a curl. I truly don’t know what the issue could be as I continue to take the same care of my hair, and my iron and vitamins seemed fine in my bloodwork. I feel hopeless and absolutely desperate for help, it is devastating to lose my curls after all these years of taking perfect care of them and avoiding damage at all costs.

It’s like 200 a day I’m worried I’ll be bald by the end of the month at this rate. I’ve been on fin for 3 months and haven’t had any notable shedding periods up until now. Has anyone else had this experience where it’s mainly terminal hairs they’re losing and not what you’d expect. Could fin have caused minor TE with the cycles syncing? Advice needed thank you.",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",
