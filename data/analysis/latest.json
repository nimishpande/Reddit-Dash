      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my honest experience with Mercure Istanbul Clinics, I know how difficult it is to choose the right place. I was completely bald maybe for 95% and I didnt expect it would ever get like this again. I used finasteride and minoxidil for more then a year but it didnt work.\n\nI am really happy that I have done it and also happy that I went to this clinic, if I see some hair transplant results here from hair mills and everything… I can absolutely recommend them, they did a good job and they were/are always very helpful. And before the transplant I really didnt tought it will be like this again. I am so happy.\n\nMy first hair transplant was with Dr. Carman more then a year ago, and my second with Dr. Bandirmali who did the fue channel all themself, taking grafts out were done by technicians, doctors are all day with you, and just with you, they do just a few patients per day and that was also the main reason I went them. Their price is also reasonable/avarage without being a hair mill.\n\nThe doctors were very serious and focused on their work, and the team around them are also really caring and very helpful. They really want the best for you, I can highly recommend them and I am very thankful. Beside English they have also Dutch support and translators which was more comfortable for me from the Netherlands.\n\nAfter the treatment they check daily the first days for the aftercare and also the months after they keep contacting you, they follow the growth month by month. That felt really helpful especially with the first transplant in the first days.\n\nI had two sessions in total. The first was 4575 grafts for the hairline and top. The second session was 3500 grafts for the crown. I am very happy with the end result of the first hair transplant after now more then a year, the second transplant I’m at month 10 now, and also the crown is starting to thicken up.",

I think I can allocate $100 to this- gotta buy all new furniture and other stuff so I can't really do anything more. \n\n\nI'd that's all you had for a gift set or item or treatment pick-me-up, what would you recommend!? I'd rather an item/items rather than a single facial or something like that so I can try to feel a lil more special each night during mh nighttime routine \n\nSome thoughts of things I've wanted to try and have seen good reviews on:\n-the dr jart 12 sheet gift set from Sephora \n\n-Dennis gross peels \n\n-tatcha moisturizer \n\n\nI'd love any ideas and recommendations please!

I am more in love with my hair than I ever thought I could be. She did go just a tad shorter than what I asked for, but that’s what shrinkage and styling will get you. Hair grows fast anyways so it’s a nice change up!! \n\nI can’t wait to wash and style myself at home with these new water soluble products which is the KEY I learned!! \n\nRoutine from today:\n1. Shampoo : innersense hair bath shampoo (twice shampoo) \nConditioner : innersense daily conditioner \n2. Gel : innersense I create hold gel \nFoam : innersense I create definition styling foam \nMixed together the gel and foam in an empty container then prayer hands on the product with scrunching at the end \n3. Roots were dried with the overhead hood then the rest of the hair was diffused regularly ",

Then my usual routine of a little KCKT leave in, Treluxe Serum, and NYM Curl Talk Mousse.

Does anyone have a recommendation for how to clear these scars. I was thinking since it's been so long I've had these dark spots, the only solution is a derma roller?

My husband on the other hand has been growing this out since covid. He hasn't had a haircut in years. \n\nRoutine:\nI help him detangle his hair often using Shea butter conditioner, a denman hairbrush, and a leave-in conditioner while its still moist, then it is air dried (we do not own a blowdrier). We do this every 4ish days. But always by the next day it gets tangled again. \nI want to know, how can I help him style his hair to keep it safe and manageable while still long? \n\nAnd a side question: what type of hair salon could handle this type of hair best in the event that I screw up? Husband is latino and has never been to any hair salon before, because he had short hair his whole life up until now. \n\nThank you for the advice! ",

My routine never changed, my diet, and habits also staying very healthy. Suddenly, I had spots around my chin and around my mouth area flare up almost every night. I would wake up with a new or worsening spot, and worst of all, they would be persistent for MONTHS.\nI figured hormones may be the culprit and introduced probiotics and fermented food into my diet. No help.\nI recently cleaned out my laundry room, which is connected to my bedroom, and discovered a smell that I THOUGHT was my cats litterbox, (which is located just outside my bedroom.) but turned out to be piles and piles of cat shit that my cat, in the corner of a crawl space has been collecting just for me to find. \nNow I live with others, and assumed that the bad smell that wafted by from time to time was from the litterbox being cleaned.\n\nNOPE\n\nturns out i've been next to toxic cat shit, just a couple feet from where i sleep.\nfml. hope the acne clears up soon.",

But every now and then when I use it it dries my skin out even after using the Cerave moisturizer. Usually the next day my skin goes back to normal but for the past 3 days my skin has been super flaky and dry, so I stopped using the face wash and for now in the morning I wash my face with a rag and water and at night just water. Today I added the Neutrogena Water Cream after rinsing to see if that helps get moisture back into my skin. It stings a bit when I use the moisturizer but only a few seconds and I assume it’s because my skin is really dry at the moment. Does anyone have tips to help calm this dryness, and any recommendations for a gentle face wash that isn’t CeraVe?",

      "content": "In the Midwestern US right now there have been lots of humidity fluctuations- like one day it’s 30% humidity outside and then the next it’s raining and 90% humidity. It’s been messing up my hair because of that. For reference, I have medium textured, medium density, 2C-3A, low porosity curls. \n\nIn the summer it’s almost always humid and I’ve found that I can use lighter conditioners, non-conditioning or even drying hold products, and my hair holds and feels soft enough for multiple days. If it’s high enough humidity I can even spray on hairspray and it will help with hold but my hair won’t feel dry or mat up with it. \n\nAs there’s been more days with low humidity, I’ve noticed my hair feeling dryer so Ive been wanting to use heavier conditioners and more moisturizing products that typically would soften my hair up too much and decrease its hold in the humid weather. But then a day or two after washing, it’ll be raining with 85% humidity and my hair will be grow so frizzy and poofy. If I style with lighter weight products in anticipation of a humid day, I notice my hair feels dry and brittle until that humid day and I get worried about hair breakage. Not to even mention using hairspray on a dry day- my hair just mats up and feels horrible. \n\nI typically wash every other day to every four days just depending on how my scalp feels (it gets pretty oily or dry depending on what I’m doing) and I would love to be able to style my hair to last for multiple days regardless of changes in the weather. Do yall have any suggestions or advice on what I could use to help my hair last this season?\n\n————————————————————————\nRoutine (summer routine as I haven’t quite found a fall/winter one that works well enough yet.)\n- Shampoo with Dove Clarifying Scalp Shampoo 2 times\n- Condition with Garnier Hair Filler Strength \n- Skip any leave ins or cream as my hair is typically conditioned enough\n- On wet hair, rake through either NYM Curl Sculpting Gel or Herbal Essences Totally Twisted mousse (both work really well for me)\n- hover diffuse dry\n- scrunch out the scrunch with the Verb Ghost Oil\n- when I want extra hold, I use some L’Oréal Elnett Hairspray",
