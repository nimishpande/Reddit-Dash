      "content": "Last few pics are from 2024. It was the exact day I thought, “Hm. Perhaps my hair isn’t straight.” 😂 And then I dived into the curly girl rabbit hole head first.\n\nMy hair was fighting for its life so the first thing I started doing was olaplex no.3 and curlsmith bond repair masks once a week. I alternated between the two.\n\nMy hair was also really thirsty from a lifetime of neglect so I did masks before I washed. This was usually a curlsmith mask. I’m obsessed with the double cream deep quencher. Smells incredible too. Now my hair is really soft so I do this once a month only. (Same with repair masks) I used to use curl cream too until recently. Not sure if I’m stopping completely yet - I’m going by hair feel on wash day.\n\nI tried lots of different routines for a while but one thing that was standard was always styling dripping WET and using a shit load of gel. Like a lot.\n\nCurrent 1x a week wash routine:\n\n•Tootilab shampoo and condish (detangle and brush here) - Clarifying shampoo around every 3 washes or so.\n\n•Tootilab gel. I probably use around a handful. Like a golf ball. I separate top and bottom half of my hair and comb gel through. I don’t usually brush style, I just make sure my hair is wet and smooth/seaweedy before a shake and scrunch. I go upside down, side to side, squish squish squish. You know how it goes. My fingers are pruned in winter.\n\n•Diffuse upside down!\n\n•When it’s around 70% dry - surprise! I add a tad more gel. Smooth it over and scrunch a bit more. Esp on the bottom layers which are a looser curl pattern.\n\n•I use a drop or 2 of olaplex oil for the crunch. Smooth over then shake shake shake.\n\n•I alternate sleeping with a … Bambon? I think it’s called. It’s like a cotton tube. And then I also have silk scarfs that I tie on. That usually works better.\n\n•Refresh is usually just wetting my hands and smoothing and scrunching again. Just to get that slight cast again. On the 3rd/4th day I use mousse and wet a lot more. On 5th/6th it’s cap or bun days with bangs styled.\n\nAny questions, shoot! It’s been a fun learning curve (:",

      "content": "My hair loss was something which affected me for more than 20 years. Hair transplant were not succesful 20 yrs back and I had Norwood Grade 7 at 25 yrs of age. Today I m nearing 45 yrs . \n\nI did a ton of research about hair transplant  in last 10 yrs and was with a hair patch for last 15 yrs. \n\nIt affected my confidence . In 2024 I finally decided to give hair transplant  a good chance and decided to use my scalp,  beard and chest .\n\n During my research in Patna , where I resided , I found my doctor through a google search. I was mentally prepared to go to Delhi. Seeing his past affiliation of doc , I decided to meet. \n\n He said \" you are my second patient in the city where I have newly moved in and we both have nothing to loose as you go back to the hair patch if the transplant fails , but if it is successful , it can be life changing. We will have a 3 to 4 Surgical  sitting  approach over next 1.5 yrs to protect donor aesthetics of scalp and body. We will use your beard in the hairline and crown over multiple sittings  and beard in the rest. He put his bet on my beard which is extremely good. I linked his multi step approach with a conservative hairline initially.\n\nSurgical procedure breakdown:\n\n• 1st procedure - total of 3300 grafts- 1300 from scalp ( very thin donor ), 2000 from beard ( He extracted beard below jawline and side locks ) . This covered my conservative hairline and mid scalp.\n\n• 2nd procedure-total of 2300 grafts- about 1500 from beard and about 800 chest( Further extraction from beard below jawline  and from cheek, 800 from chest 70% of which failed ) . This was used to construct my crown and back part of the head.\n\n• 3rd procedure-total of 2000 grafts- about 1000 from the scalp( these were finasteride dependent hair which thickened with 1 year of finasteride  and about 1000 from beard ( from neck, cheek ) \n\nTotal number of grafts so far = \\~7600 grafts\n\nA primary reason for this approach in regards to procedure was to manage the existing donor hair as well as achieve realistic density. \n\nExperience and recovery:\n\nMy 3 surgeries took 1 year and were placed 6 months apart. The approach was always conservative to slightly aggresive. There was risk of scarring on my cheek and practically after 3 times extraction from my cheek , sidelocks and below neck , there are virtually no visible scar, thanks to excellent post op care guided by the doc and executed my me.\n\n My final results is still 4 months away and last surgery was done in September 2025.\n\nResults (so far): \n\nI’m not trying to boast or claim that I have a “celebrity hairline”, but my observations indicate that hair growth is naturally improving, and I am beginning to feel comfortable again with my hairline as my confidence grows.\n\n I feel confident to go out without a hair fibres or a wig now. Doctor has suggested to go for scalp micropigmentation to further reduce the contrast and recommended use of chest hair to improve my mid scalp  if have he stamina to go for a 4th surgery from chest .\n\nMy advice to anyone considering an HT for extreme high grade baldness with poor donor : \n\n1. Find a doctor who is capable of scalp and body hair transplant.\n\n2. Find a doctor whose approach is conservative to aggresive , rather than vice-versa ( else a failed surgery can't be rectified ) . Even the best donors can fail to grow and worst donor hair can grow.\n\n \n\n3. Wait for your baldness to stablize before surgery and stick to medications like finasteride and minoxidil .\n\n4. People who have good body hair especially beard ( it gave me 80% of the density over 3 surgeries ) should get a good coverage .\n\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to ask I mainly posted this in hopes of providing some insight or motivation to people who have virtually no hair..",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I fortunately have always had easy skin so it's been kept to a minimum. I currently use Innisfree Volcanic face wash, the Ordinary barrier repair serum, and the ordinary beta glucan moisturizer. Occasionally I use the Innisfree sunscreen in the morning (I know I need to be better about it). \n\nI will be 27 this year, and I'm starting to notice aging signs. I am a VERY expressive person lol, I have no idea what to use for this, and where to place it in my routine? I've heard retinol, then I've heard it's too strong for beginners. I've heard Tretinoin, but honestly I'm getting more and more confused. Can someone help me figure out what to use and when? \n\nAreas I'd like to focus on are smile lines, forehead lines, and around my eyes. Thank you so much for any help, I am so super appreciative of this sub. I've been learning so much!! hope everyone has a beautiful day 🫶🏼",

I never had issues like this before so I can pretty much link this to the usage of Finasteride.\n\nI don't really want to try Minoxidil topical because I just know I wouldn't be consistent with it and it would be kind of a hassle for me. At the same time, I don't really feel like risking all the side effects of oral Minoxidil.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts and thank you for your time!",

I'm developing some brown sun spots on my nose/cheeks and wrinkles on my forehead. I currently just use cetaphil gentle face cleanser and vanicream face lotion. I've tried illyoon, dr kiehls, ​​olay, skin food fix, cereve, and quite a few other brands but nothing really helps my dryness and most irritate my skin, and any exfoliating other than a soft wash cloth leaves my skin red and stinging. After a ton of research and product reviews I think I need a routine with better/more products to help my aging skin. I have a full Amazon cart but want some advice before purchasing.. I will list them below and please tell me if I should add or remove anything! I am new to this and unsure if I have the right order lol..\n\nStep 1 - cleanser - Belif Jelly Hydrating Deep Cleanser\n\nStep 2 - toner - I'm From Rice Toner\n\nStep 3 - vitamin c serum - Truskin Vitamin C Super Serum\n\nStep 4 - serum - CORSRX Snail Mucin Repairing Serum 100ml\n\nStep 5 - cream - CORSRX Hyaluronic Acid Intensive Cream\n\nStep 6 - sunscreen - Mixsoon Bean Sunscreen\n\nDoes this sound like a good line up for my skin type? Is it too much or too little? I'm afraid of wasting my money or ruining my skin.. It's so confusing seeing all the conflicting advice online. I will be 33 in September and after having 2 kids back to back I'm feeling aged, just want to preserve my youth and look the best I can. Thank you for any advice!!",

I have those white dots too, and some redness around my nostrils (which can be covered by makeup but I digress), if I can get rid of it I definitely want to. Could anyone recommend me some products to combat this? I really want to have smooth makeup (my makeup looks weird and blotchy, I'm not talking about normal skin texture like pores it cakes up in those parts no matter what I use). Maybe an exfoliator or a face wash? I use panoxyl 4% BP right now, and thayers toner, and then regular CeraVe AM &amp; PM moisturizer. Please help! I've got like 3 months so hopefully I can keep the routine and fix it so I can have nice makeup!",

Nothing scientific just consistency and honesty.\n\nA few patterns stood out for me. Hydration made a bigger difference than I expected. Even when I tried new products, my skin looked better on days I didn’t skip moisturizer or water. Consistency also mattered more than good products some expensive items didn’t change much, while a simple routine done daily did.\n\nSleep and stress were the most surprising. One bad night often showed up on my skin the next day. Seeing it happen repeatedly made it hard to ignore.\n\nThe biggest takeaway for me was realizing that reactions I used to blame on random causes usually lined up with habits I wasn’t paying attention to.\n\nI will like to know if anyone else here tracks their skin like this or has noticed similar things over time.",

      "content": "Heya! Im trying to find a hairstyle that helps hide my rather large forehead and browbone. I have very very curly hair and am looking for specific tips about that (ie not moderately wavy like all the \"curly hair\" tutorials on YouTube). I have found a routine that works if my hair decides to look pretty that day, and if it doesn't I'm kinda just screwed. But on days where it looks good, I really don't know how to style it to hide the bad parts of my face. Right now I leave it in a middle part simply because I don't know what else to do. Every photo you see online is altered or AI these days so looking on Pinterest is basically useless. Curly bangs are extremely high maintenance and given I need to be able to put my hair up to work, a high maintenance haircut like that doesn't really work for me. Also curly bangs on me will prolly come out really stringy and pathetic because my hair is so thin (thanks genetics). I also need the style to frame my face because I also need to hide my very sharp, aggressive, and masculine cheekbones and jawline. My hair is just over shoulder length and I'm in my early 20s if it matters. \n\nRoutine is as follows: Garnier Whole blends for shampoo and conditioner, detangle with wide tooth comb after i get out. With hair dripping wet, add Pantene curl gel and scrunch that in. Follow with Pantene curl mousse. Diffuse for a few mins just to make it not dripping wet, let it air dry. Once dry, scrunch out the cast and part. I'm not looking for product recommendations in this post, just styles or haircut ideas. Please attach photos of your ideas because all the ways ppl describe hairstyles over text make no sense to me, so a visual example is needed. Thanks!",

      "content": "About 4 years ago me and my ex bleached and dyed my hair. Beforehand my hair was extremely healthy, thick, and almost required no conditioner. I am now to this day struggling with dry, frazzled hair, low porosity (the test took 3 days before the strand sank). I have done everything recommended to me by everyone, from washing hair once a week only, coconut oil, argon oil, leave-in's. I've used OGX, which worked for a short while, bondbar which im using now, aussie, hairitage, and native. Even at one point cut 3 inches above the dead ends off. I work an outdoor job, wear a headscarf periodically, i do wear a hat with a silk lining i stitched in. My routine is about once a week (unless i get my hair dirty dirty) i wash my hair with hairitage daily gentle and scrub until ive covered my whole scalp, then condition with bondbar's little white bottle, then ill pat dry and apply a leave in conditioner with coconut oil, I don't use a curl enhancer or whatever unless it's special occasions. I tend to keep my hair in a loose bun or loose pony tail. I'm feeling lost in the whole struggle and I really don't wanna potentially lose my hair. Any tips, advice, product recommendations would greatly be appreciated. I am on a heavy budget so if affordable that would be the biggest help ever!",
