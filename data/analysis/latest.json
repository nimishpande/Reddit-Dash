I’m trying to achieve even 10% of what she has.\n\nI am currently on day 3 after washing. My current routine for this week was: I shampoo with moisturizing curl talk shampoo, then I do Mielle rosemary mint strengthening hair mask. Then I do 3-in-1 Curl Talk conditioner and don’t fully wash it out and squish in a bit to my ends before exiting the shower.\n\nThen I praying hands Pattern styling custard and drag it through a bit on top.  I then use them bounce curl clips while diffusing on warm setting for heat and low intensity with minimal movement to set the curls. I fluff out the roots after dry with the bounce curl volume comb. I scrunch in Ouai hair oil once dry.\n\nToday I sectioned my hair out while using tresemme keratin smooth weightless anti-frizz finishing spray at the roots and using the bounce curl volume comb diffusing where I sprayed after using the comb on low cold setting to set the spray.\n\nI’m pretty happy with the results, but looking for more tips if anyone has any? \n\nI may just need a hair cut. I just can’t seem the back to achieve the same volume at the back that I get around my face. At the side part it seems flat as well.  Amy other hair spray, how to cut the hair (I just cut my own hair how I feel like, so I’m not scared to try), or technique tips?\n\nI also want to understand how they do her lazy messy updo (see photo)??? I’m totally lost on how that is achieved.\n\n\n",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nSo normally I don’t post much, but wanted to drop this as a warning for anyone buying products purely on hype and regretting later.\n\nBack in September I got into fitness, and by December started protein supplements. My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily.\n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

Unfortunately, she didnt explain that it was a cowash (hairstory doesnt really explain either) and essentially framed it as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner. I was not aware of how cowashes work or how they should be used (i am still confused tbh)\n\nHere i am, a year later, with insane scalp build up and significantly thinner hair (said hair dresser also decided to give me a mullet i did not ask for 🥲). \n\nBefore this, i was putting in a lot of effort into my hair. I used hairtage for shampoo and conditioner, would use not your mothers mousse, the curl smith products i mentioned, and Silk by biosilk. i cant remember if i air dried or diffused in the fourth photo. \n\nFirst photo is most recent using hairology, miss jessie’s leave in and a curl cream, and diffused. Second photo is when i still used just new wash and was after my most recent cut. Third is an average day side profile while still using new wash. Fourth is my routine before new wash. Fifth is what it looked like on an average day. \n\nI think my hair is 2c/3a high porosity(pls confirm or deny) and now it is low density (it used to be so thick 😭). \n\nIm looking for advice and recommendations for shampoo and conditioner. I need to tackle my scalp build up above everything else. \nI also want my curls to stay curled longer. I think i will try using mousse but maybe not gel due to the weight. I think i will get one of those curl shaping brushes as well.\nIve also never found a solution for sleeping with my hair. Every bonnet ive tried has scrunched up my hair or has slipped off at night, but putting it up is causing so much damage. I cant use a satin pillow case for sensory issues. \n\nSuggestions welcome ❤️\n",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nSo normally I don’t post much, but wanted to drop this as a warning for anyone buying products purely on hype and regretting later.\n\nBack in September I got into fitness, and by December started protein supplements. My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily. \n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

      "content": "as the years coming to an end, i am curious to hear everyones favorite skincare finds of 2025\n\nfrom my finds, the one with the most value for money is melano cc. it lasts a long time without oxidizing and most importantly it actually works. it visibly brightens the skin and works especially well on fading newer acne marks. totally worth every penny.\n\nanother product is loreal paris ha sheet mask. as a guy who rarely gets compliments, some female friends and two of my ex gfs actually complimented my skin after seeing the glow it gave. it gives a near glass skin look for 2 to 3 days but their ha serum is pretty mid and it doesnt really do better than any other ha serum but the mask is the best one i have ever used\n\nand the third product is pha toner from minimalist. as a person with acne prone oily skin, everything new usually breaks me out just because its new. i normally need to wait a couple of weeks to be sure if a product is actually causing breakouts or if its just new to my skin but after starting the pha toner, new products didnt start breaking me out. it subtly protects my skin from other products causing breakouts and is pretty hydrating and mildly exfoliating for daily use.\n\nso what new products did you find this year that are actually worth it? anything that gave visible results, worked consistently or just felt really good on your skin? tell me your 2025 holy grails",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

(Doesn’t have to be mulberry silk, btw). Let me know if you guys have any ideas. Thanks! \n\n—\n\nRoutine: Wash w/ R+Co Cassette and condition w/ Curlsmith (Essential Moisture or Multitasking), then use Curlsmith Air Dry Cream or Multitasking as a leave-in &amp; finish with Hydro Style FlexiJelly (brushed through, praying-hands, light scrunch).

Use a cleanser morning and sometimes at night. SPF &amp; lip balm in morning (even though l don't live in a 'sunny country'). Moisturiser &amp; sometimes retinol at night. All CeraVe products. \n* Drink water, maybe 2 litres a day.\n* Take multi-vitamin, biotin, Vitamin D3, Omega-3, magnesium per day in morning. \n* Brush teeth morning and night, but l am considering getting braces or Invisalign in 2026.  \n\nMy dress and clothing style could use a lot of work, l usually just wear gym clothes or comfy clothes as l work from home every day (work in Tech).

      "content": "Hello! \n\nIt’s my first time trying to use the curly hair products on my hair. I’m even confused what kind of hair type I have, my guess is 2a but idk 🤷‍♀️ After everything the hair doesn’t look good, it just looks like a bird’s nest and like I haven’t brushed it for a long time, the waves don’t look good. Also, the bottom of my hair is wavier than the top. Could anyone please advise me what went wrong in the routine, what products don’t fit my hair type, maybe are too heavy. I pretended my whole life that my hair is kind of straight, so I have no clue how to go about this. Thank you in advance 🙏 Step by step routine in the shower:\n\n1. Shampooed my hair twice. Didn’t touch the ends, only roots and mids. (Didn’t use a shampoo specifically for curly hair because I don’t have one)\n\n2. Used conditioner on my hair starting from mids to ends. Brushed through my hair and detangled with a wet brush (regular one, not for curly hair) starting from bottom and going up.\n\n3. Washed out the conditioner. Put curl cream (the pink tub from Fenti hair) on my hand and raked it through my hair (used the amount advised by the pinky to thumb method while hugging your hair, idk how to explain it 🤷‍♀️). Brushed through my hair again to distribute the product. Scrunched my hair up with some water\n\n4. Added some Curl Jelly gel by Umberto Giannini on my palms (I have a feeling I didn’t use enough) and raked it through my hair starting from mids to ends, scrunched it up and pulsed 3 times.\n\n5. Went in with the curl styling brush (I watched tutorials on youtube how to use it but I’m not confident that I did it the right way anyway)\n\n6. Started drying my hair by hovering the diffuser over my roots and then moved on to the ends. When I felt the cast harden, started pushing my strands up with the diffuser (confused if I did this part right too). When I pushed the strand up, I held it for like 10 secs in place and let go. Finished drying my hair like this\n\nThe results are as you can see in the picture and I don’t think it looks that good 😭😭 Even considering going back to keeping my hair as is without any product. Please help 🙏 ",

I want to get my sister a haircut as a birthday present but if I were to get her one with my stylist where I live, she wouldn't be able to come get it for a couple months. So just if anyone has a recommendation there, I'd appreciate it.\n\nAlso since I need to submit a routine, I'll do my average day one.\n\n* I apply all products, including shampoo and conditioner, with my head upside down.\n* Shampoo with Suave Rosemary &amp; Mint shampoo. I double cleanse. Somtimes I use a hard water shampoo first, but I unfortunately can't remember the brand right now and I'm out of town.\n* Condition with Garnier Whole Blends Honey Treasures conditioner. I apply over my hair, then brush through it with a detangling brush and let it sit for a couple minutes. Then I use \"squish to condish\" before fully rinsing it out. \n* I make sure my hair is soaking wet before applying any styling products. I start with Garnier Whole Blends Honey Water Leave In Cream. I apply all products with \"praying hands\" and then scrunch into my hair.\n* I rewet my hair after the leave in to be soaking wet again.\n* I apply Oudiad Climate Control Strong Hold gel, and LA Looks Sport gel together. I do three applications, making sure I focus one on my roots.\n* I apply the Garnier Whole Blends Honey Treasures Repairing Serum to the ends of my hair.\n* I use Pantene\\* Volume mousse at my roots, then the Curly mousse over the rest of my hair, followed by the volume mousse as well over the rest of my hair. \n* I then apply the Garnier Whole Blends Honey Treasures Heat Protectant.\n* I diffuse my hair, which takes at least an hour lol, and that's a conservative estimate. When my hair is about 70% dry I apply the Herbal Essenses hairspray, which I then diffuse into my hair as I finish.\n* When done diffusing, I use the Garnier Fructis Moroccon Oil to scrunch my hair.\n* I always sleep on a silk pillowcase. I used to use silk scarves or a bonnet but they gave me headaches, which is on me because I'm very prone to them I take medication for it.\n\n\\*I know Pantene is technically not cruelty free, as they sell in China. It's what's available and affordable where I live that works for my hair :/",
