      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I’ve been noticing a lot of consumerism, marketing gimmicks, and wrong skincare trends especially things like topical glutathione, 7-step routines, and overly hyped beauty serums. So here’s some simple, dermatologist-backed guidance based on personal experience and expert advice:\n\nA basic routine will always beat a complicated one. It saves money, protects your barrier, and gives long-term results.\n\nSunscreen: Use it daily (preferably a pharma-clinical grade sunscreen with a blue-light protection filter) and a lip sunscreen. If you have active, inflamed acne, avoid applying sunscreen directly on top instead use shade, or stay indoors.\n\nCleanser: Use a gentle cleanser. Double cleansing is recommended on days with heavy sunscreen or makeup and its encouraged to do so if you have oily skin. You don’t need morning cleansing cold water is enough unless you’re producing too much oil. keep the Cleansers with actives on your skin for 45 seconds before washing it off.\n\nMoisturiser: Choose one according to your skin type. Ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramides are helpful.\n\nThat’s all you need. If you have skin concerns, choose one active only. Get a dermatologist assessment and lean towards pharma-grade medicated products, staying consistent with one routine for at least 3 months before changing anything.\n\nRetinoids: Tretinoin is a holy grail as retinoids help with cell turnover and target many major concerns. Glycolic acid , adapalene, and azelaic acid also work well when used correctly (start slow, sandwich method, apply in moderation).\n\nExfoliation: Avoid physical scrubs and herbal DIY remedies. Only use chemical exfoliants like AHA/BHA (salicylic, glycolic, lactic acid, etc.) and use them sparingly.\n\nSheet masks: Expensive and wasteful; the fiber isn’t great for skin or the planet.\n\nToners: Mostly unnecessary. Just dampen your skin with rose water or plain water before applying products to improve absorption. All products like snail mucin, peptides, ceramides, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid should be used on Damp skin while \npotent actives should always be applied on dry skin ideally 10–15 minutes after washing.\nWhen the skin is damp, absorption increases too quickly, which can push strong ingredients deeper than intended and lead to irritation, or burning.\n\nEye creams: Often unnecessary. Under-eye darkness is mostly genetics, sleep, lifestyle, and makeup (some studies show kajal contributes to darkening).\n\nTrends: Don’t blindly follow trends like slugging with Vaseline. It only works if done properly because petroleum jelly is an occlusive  it must be layered over good hydration and only if your skin type suits it.\n\nK-beauty: Korean skincare products aren’t automatically suitable for everyone. Their products are created for Korean climate and skin, and true “glass skin” is usually genetics + aesthetic procedures.\n\nHyperpigmentation in brown skin: Brown skin produces more melanin when healing. So if glycolic acid, shaving, or any method “darkened” your skin, it’s usually because: • your barrier was weak • the product was overused • sunscreen wasn’t applied properly Barrier repair + fewer actives + gentle care is the real solution.\n\nHair removal: Face shaving and laser is usually gentler and better because they don’t pull hair from the root, unlike waxing/threading. (If you have PCOS or hormonal issues, treat the root cause first.)\n\nVitamin C: Not every active is essential. Vitamin C is helpful but potent having the ability to damage your skin instead. improving your diet with these nutrients is often more effective than relying solely on the serum.",

And all of the sudden I had straight chunks of hair I went hair previously) and then some what 3a-3b curls? \n\nI use the Not your mothers shampoo and conditioner (the purple and white bottle) I use Carol’s daughter leave in conditioner, and I use the Pattern cleansing shampoo once a month. I wash my hair once a week (any more and my hair might suffer) I have fine thin hair, although apparently I had a ton of hair when I was younger (puberty ig) I use the Not your mothers defining curl talk cream and curl talk sculpting gel. I use hair growth and thickening oils. Such as cliganic jojoba oil, Moroccan oil treatment in light, Bur Bur and go lab beauty oils. I oil my air everyday and since it’s pretty light it never wears my hair down. I typically air dry but I thought a diffuser (which I’m returning it sucked half of my hair into the back of the fan and I had to yank my hair out…all that progress to keep my hair healthy out the window) \n\nNow the issue is, my whole life…my hair has always been curly, thin and stringy. Bad combo. Unless I used 0 product and my hair was frizzy, which in then my hair looked awful but it at least looked huge with volume. I’ve tried routine after routine. I’m just exhausted I can’t wear my hair any way and I don’t apply heat. I think I have high porosity hair, mousse weights my hair down, so does most leave in conditioners, I spent so much money buying products I just leave those two out of my routine. Idk what to do. My hair dries fast. Maybe less than an hour to an hour? When I was younger it used to take FOREVER for my hair to dry. But my hair was also severely damaged back then. Even if I do finger curls it just separates into stringy bits. Any advice? \n\nTLDR: my hair is thin and super stringy, finger coiling doesn’t work. Any advice? ",

This is something to the point where often people can't tell I even have curly hair because of how often it's straight and sometimes people are shocked to find out my hair is naturally curly. That itself,is an issue of its own. I know the only way to work against that is to minimize heat damaging my hair but aside from this, what can I do to take care of my hair better? The most recent photo of my hair is with the red ends! \nWhen I wear my hair curly I feel like the shrinkage is so bad and I lose so much length and my hair gets so puffy and frizzy. Im also confused on what curl type I have, where Im on the scale between a,b,c and 1,2,3,4. I know due to damage my curls aren't as bouncy and spiraled as they really can be. It's like I can't get the right product ratio when styling as well. ONE time in high school I got it perfect and I can't imagine ever experiencing that again😭. \n\nThe hair 'routine' I usually use is I wash it about maybe once a week, for shampoo/conditioner I use Native or Monday generally. Sometimes Dove or Herbal Essence. I normally don't put much product in my hair, generally  leave in conditioner and maybe a little gel. I used to go crazy with it and do a whole hair cream, conditioner, mouse, gel, the whole nine yards and I felt it didn't make much of a difference. I also do sleep with satin pillow cases if that's important and have considered getting a bonnet. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nAfter neglecting my hygiene and diet due to exams I looked in the mirror and noticed my skin is looking extra \\*bumpy\\*. I cant seem to find anything that can fix the scars on my cheeks or blackheads on my nose/chin, so I gave up, but now its gotten a worse from stress and its affecting my self-esteem. So I would like to finally try to improve my skin after years of failure.\n\nI'm open to any suggestions or information dumps because I clearly don't know much about skincare!\n\n**The issues:** Over the last couple of weeks, I have noticed an increase in various bumps on my forehead, chin, and cheeks. I think they're pimples and blackheads?\n\n**Current routine:** I struggle with routines (ADHD, yay) but I \\*try\\* to cleanse with **CeraVe Blemish Control Cleanser** once a day and moisturise with **QV Ceramides Moisturising Lotion**.\n\n**Timeline &amp; New additions**: I have been **using my current routine** for approximately **2-months**.  \n**Prior to that**, I was instead using the **CeraVe SA Smoothing Cleanser** for approximately **7-months**, which I think worked better for me.  \n**In 2024** I used **Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant** which I believe reduced my acne scars (maybe I'm coping) - or at least the redness and overall 'dots' on my face.  \nI was using PC with **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser**. However, I don't think the cleanser was responsible because I was using it **in 2023** with their **Hyaluronic acid** and **Niacinamide** which didn't do much for my skin (I was younger, had a worse diet, and lived in a cooler climate as well so).\n\n**My planned routine:** From researching I'm reading that in the **AM** I should just **rinse my face with cold water** and **apply sunscreen/moisturiser**. And in the **PM** I should **cleanse**, **exfoliate**, **moisturise** (I don't want too many steps for now).  \nHowever, my current cleanser \\*is\\* an exfoliating cleanser, so should I only cleanse 2-3 times a week with it?  \nIf its possible, I would rather use the **QV Gentle Wash Cleanser** recommended in this sub once a day and use **Paulas Choice** 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant every 2-3 days because I know it works for me, but my current cleanser doesn't - Will this possibly reduce all the red dots and cheek scars on my face? or is exfoliating not what you do to reduce scars.",

It feels like I’ve had a compromised skin barrier my whole life. Not sure if you can tell from the photo, but no matter what moisturizer I try, it seems like my skin is always red, burning, inflamed, and itchy right after I put it on, and I can never tell what the issue is. People keep commenting the next day after I use *any* moisturizer that I look sunburnt, so I feel like I’m probably actually burning my face. I used CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion for years, then Clinique Moisturizing Gel, CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream, Ponds Dry Skin Cream (fragrance bad, I know), Curel Intensive Moisture Facial Cream, Soon Jung 2x Barrier Cream, and others that I’m forgetting… all with the same result. Pairing it with madecassoside cream hasn’t helped.\n\nIn the rest of my routine I try to prioritize gentleness and simplicity. I use the Soon Jung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser, a rosewater glycerin spray all over my face for toner, and the Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion for a serum. It’s all super calming and nothing irritates my skin until the moisturizer step.\n\nWhat’s the most soothing, gentle moisturizer y’all have tried that can hopefully calm down the inflammation/redness and not make my face appear so dull? Thanks in advance y’all 💛",

      "content": "I started using Tazarotene .1% for anti aging in September, I got prescribed it by a doctor who knew I was using it for the anti aging purpose. I had told him that when I was a teenager I had used it for acne and I had very minimal side effects while using it. Everything was going fine I was doing the every other day method, and then started doing it every night. \n\nI use a pea size amount, and my skin routine is pretty minimal because I know doing too much can ruin your barrier. I only wash my face at night, after I take off my makeup with Micellar water and I use a CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser at night. When I would notice some dryness I would apply CeraVe Moisturing Cream in the area and then put Vaseline on top of the CeraVe, so a slugging method. After that I would then use the Tarzarotene, then I would top with the CeraVe making sure to not touch the dry area that I put Vaseline on. Everything was going fine, sometimes I would skip using the Tazarotene and just use lotion and my skin was fine with that as well. \n\nRecently however I have had a very gnarly break out, like on my lower cheek area, some on my forehead, and one on my neck. Ive been very fortunate and never have really had much acne so I am kind of freaking out. It recently has gotten very cold where I live and very dry. And I recently had my monthly visitor. Now I’m just apply acne patches on the spots and moisturizing. What should I do? Should I put the Tazarotene on top of the acne since essentially it is for acne? Or should I use a salicylic acne spot treatment? Also I will say I do wear sunscreen religiously like I bathe in the stuff. \n",

I was kind of hoping to do aggressive but im a bit nervous since it my first time.\n\nIf anyone has done this, whats the recovery time look like for aggressive treatment? Is it really that delicate being out in the sun and if so for how many weeks after?\n\nI work as a welder in construction where we are exposed to dust (dirt, particles of metal),arc flash, smoke, sun. Im worried this might affect healing and make something worse.\n\nI planned on taking a month of work for recovery after treatment, but im not sure if that enough time for the skin to heal enough where outside elements wont affect it such as (sun,dirt,sweat,smoke, weld flash)\n\nLooking for advice and tips of people that have done treatment to know realistic recovery times to know wether this is the right treatment for me regarding after care since i work in construction.\n\nI do plan on using a uv face cover at work the ones you stretch over your face i could realistically use that all day while at work to cover up sun, welding arc, but i believe it will cause sweat and collect dust,metal particles. Will that be an issue after 1 month recovery?\n\nThank you all for future help!",

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
