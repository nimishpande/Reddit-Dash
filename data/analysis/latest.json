      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

At the end, I got sick of the high maintenance and the terrible hair days and cut it \"middle length\", but it ended quite short, and I'm not convinced.\n\n I've been thinking about just giving up completely, since I have never been able to get them half decent looking, and cut it as short as I used to. The other option would be starting growing it again and hope for it miraculously to look good.\n\nThe first three photos are from before my last haircut, when it was was longer but not really stylized. Then is me right know, with a long hair on the shorter side, that looks quite chaotic, and the last fotos are how my hair looked like really short and then started growing. I'd be thankful to hear your opinions.\n\nAbout the routine: Wash it every day with a cheap Ballerina conditioner and every 4 days or so with a cheap Ballerina shampoo.

But I have to post my non-existent routine, otherwise the bot won't let me publish. \n\nRoutine - I wash my hair once a week with a cheap generic shampoo, I don't use any products, conditioners, gels or anything else, and since I don't even have a diffuser, I let it air dry after towel drying it a little. That's my whole routine.\n\nAs I've grown older, my hair has changed, becoming curlier and frizzier, and for the first time in my life, I want to highlight my natural hair, so I'm letting it grow.\n\nFor several weeks now, I've been learning more and more about how to treat curly hair and what methods to use. Now my question is: what products do I need for my low porosity 3b/3c hair? And what combs or other tools do I need?\n\nI would really appreciate your response 👍 ",

      "content": "Hi, \n\nHair noob here that could really use some advice :)\n\nThe first three pics are freshly washed hair, I use a mild shampoo (and clarifying shampoo once a week) and conditioner in the shower, and then a leave-in product that I kind of scrunch into my hair. I notice especially whenever I apply the conditioner in the shower or leave-in afterwards, my hair starts to act wavy.\n\nThe last three pics are the days after wash day. Sometimes it even looks like that at the end of the day and I’ll have lost most of the waves that I previously had; It’s never as wavy as when it’s still a bit wet. When I wake up the day after it basically just looks frizzy and untamed as opposed to wavy, and brushing it through actually makes it look better.\n\nI’m honestly not sure what my hair wants; whether I should try a curly routine, wash my hair everyday if I want it to look good, or just try to naturally straighten it more? I don’t think either looks bad, but I prefer the look after it’s freshly washed and I don’t understand why it looks so flat after just a day.\n\nAny advice or insights would be appreciated :)\n\nEdit: More details about my routine: \n\n-Shampoo with 100% pure moisture drench shampoo \n- Condition with 100% pure moisture drench conditioner \n- I use Lush super milk for my leave-in, then let my hair air dry  \n- I apply a few drops of Olaplex N7 bonding oil when my hair is about 80% dry",
