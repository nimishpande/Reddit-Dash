      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I was very impressed with the improvements people were posting here, so finally got the courage to ask.  \nI have used Nincamide serum once before in past for some time based on a friend's advice but that didn't worked out much.  \n Can you please recommend me something that I can use to improve my skin. I have had these weird patches on my cheeks for some time and some irregular texture on my whole face overall.\n\nThanks for your suggestions!",

I was excited to start taking care of my hair, but I’ve had the hardest time managing it. I have a horrible problem with frizz and I’m truly at a loss on how to handle it. I feel like I’ve tried everything and I have a million bajillion product attempts, but nothing has given me any sort of progress. I’ve followed hair routines that are similar to my hair type and porosity type, I’ve bought Camille Rose shampoo and conditioner that are supposed to mend frizz, I tried Not Your Mothers Sculpting gel and after that didn’t work I tried the same brands Flash Freeze gel. I’ve also tried using Not Your Mothers mousse- that didn’t work so I tried Doux’s mousse, but I still had frizz. I have tried SO. MANY. CURL. CREAMS. I’ve tried Rizo’s, Not Your Mothers, LUS, everything I could find; the only one that showed clear signs of decreased frizz was Rizo’s, but there’s still frizz galore. I’ve even been spending a good 3 hours after wash and routine day diffusing my hair with cold air. I’m not sure if it’s the way I’m applying products or the order I rake them in?\n\nMy routine right now consists of:\n\nSoaking wet hair washed by Camille Rose shampoo and conditioner, then I section and spray Not Your Mothers leave conditioner. I then rake in Rizo’s curl defining cream followed by Doux’s texture foam enhancer. After that I take a styling brush and brush out each section. Finally, I use Not Your Mothers flash freeze gel and I scrunch each section and then I diffuse on the coldest setting and allow a gel cast to form. (I’m not sure if this helps, but I have a medium hair strand, it’s not super think, but a strand is noticeable between my fingers and is far from thin.)\n\nAfter the routine, sometimes my curls with separate from each other and I’ll have really small strings of curls that look super weird. The shape and frizz-less curls will usually last the day, but once I’m home from school, my hair is ridiculously frizzy and it won’t last make it another day. I am truly at a loss and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Any advice is super welcomed. I’ve never dyed my hair or had any treatments done, my hair is completely virgin- not sure if that information makes a difference.\n\nI never realized how difficult curly hair can be.",

Any suggestions on how to improve my skins texture, hydration and overall life? \n\nRoutine: \nI’m using dermalogica daily exfoliate with Luke warm water at nights and just rinse with water in the morning, toner is the innisfree hyaluronic acid toner, topped with sometimes both cetaphil moisturizer and my skinfix moisturizer on top. The last few days I’ve felt that my skin was irritated just by using the toner and moisturizer so I had to wash it off gently and use my Vaseline cocoa moisturizer just to calm it \n\nI use sunscreen daily (a Korean skincare brand I’m blanking on) \n\nI changed my MAC foundation from the matte formula to the non matte but anytime I use setting powder (or even when I don’t) you can see just how flakey and dehydrated my skin is - it’s gross and looks so bad. \n\nI avoid super hot showers, drink 3-5 glasses of water if not more when working out and don’t use rough towels on my face. \n\nAny guidance?

I've used a variety of products and all sorts of different routines and honestly none have been helping.

In the moment my skin feels amazing and moisturized, but when I wake up in the morning or go about my day (I use the same routine for day and night), it's super super dry, tight, and flaky. At night, I try to do my skin care earlier in the evening so it has time to sink in, but by the time I wake up in the morning, it's like none of it has sunk in and my skin is drier than ever.\n\nI have also tried oil cleansing, but that made me break out super badly in the past (I've tried mineral, olive, etc), hyaluronic acid (on damp face, on wet face, spray with water after, etc), and other heavy duty creams (aestura atobarrier 365 cream, neutrogena hydroblast, first aid beauty cream). It feels like the products I use almost disappears throughout the day or overnight (like my skin drinks it all up and constantly needs more within the hour).\n\nThe only product I have used that has worked is Aveeno, but unfortunately it makes me break out badly :/ I have been using it off and on because the dry skin is getting so bad and breaking out has become the lesser of the two evils some days lol\n\nSo I was wondering if folks had any rec's for products or routines for super dry skin that's helped them?",

      "content": "A few months back, a dermatologist prescribed hydroquinone for my pigmentation. I used it exactly as directed, but within 2–3 weeks my skin barrier was destroyed.\nI got redness, sensitivity, and suddenly a bunch of breakouts on my cheeks. It genuinely set my skin back.\n\nSo I stopped the hydroquinone and focused only on repairing my barrier. My routine for the last month was:\n\nAM\n• CeraVe Foaming Cleanser\n• Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n• Cosrx Snail Mucin Moisturizer\n• Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun SPF50\n\nPM\n• Same cleanser\n• Centella serum\n• Bioderma Atoderm Barrier Repair Cream\n\nThis routine honestly helped so much .the redness calmed down and my skin finally started healing\n\nTwo weeks ago, my new derm started me on tretinoin 0.025 (retinal/tret). I’m doing the sandwich method and using it only 2–3 nights a week.\n\nHere’s the weird part:\nMy right side is healing beautifully\nBut my left cheek suddenly got 2–3 new inflamed bumps\n\nIs this normal?? Is it purging even if it’s happening on just one side of my face?\n\nFor context: this left cheek is where the hydroquinone damaged my barrier the most, and where I had the earlier breakouts. So I’m wondering if tret is just bringing everything to the surface, or if something is wrong again.\n\nAnyone experienced one-sided purging or breakouts after starting tret?",
