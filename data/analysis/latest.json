      "content": "3 months progress on 1mg Oral Finasteride and 5ml Topical Minoxidil. I micro-needle every 7-10 days or so. I also take cheap vitamin tablets: biotin, vitamin D, iron and zinc (have no idea if they do anything).\n\nBalding slowly since my late 20’s diffusively and never did anything about it until now.\n\n1st pic (wish I’d taken better pics) is the evening after I’d micro needled earlier in the day ready for the first minoxidil application. I went pretty hard, that’s why there’s loads of tiny scabs. I don’t really get scabs like that anymore, my scalp must of gotten used to the abuse.\n\n2nd pic is earlier today in bright sunshine. My hair’s a little greasy from min still but thought it was good light.\n\nAs you can see I was pretty far gone, probably Norwood 6/7. I didn’t really expect any kind of result but had nothing to lose. I was kind of amazed to see loads of tiny hairs pop up within probably the first 12 days. I never expected to get much regrowth due to my age and how long the hair had been gone, let alone as much as this in the first 3 months. I just hope the progress continues, the new hairs are small and fine like a new born baby’s but I have coverage over the entire scalp where it was practically slick bald. Best case scenario is that they continue to mature and I start to have the near appearance \nof a normal head of hair (though reminding myself to be positive yet realistic). Wish me luck and I hope this gives someone as far gone as me a little hope that some progress is possible, like so many other peoples posts have given me. Wish I’d known about these meds when I was younger!\n\nWill probably do an update later down the line.\n",

      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "It has officially been over a year since I've started this journey. At first I started using liquid minoxidil for the first 4 months and the effects the liquid had on me were really rough. I had skin flare ups, bad rashes and I had to stop. After a month break I switched to Foam the generic brand from Walmart. And since then I haven't had any issues with side effects pertaining to rashes or hot spots. I have not had any issues with finasteride what's so ever. Sexual libido is great and have had no issues. Only common thing is with the semen to be watery at times but most of the time it is normal. I've taken to vitamins on and off. At first I did microneedle but due to the fact that I have sensitive skin it would bother me from time to time and then I stopped. I know I still have a long journey ahead but I'm surprised to see these changes. I am considering in doing a HT in the near future just bc I still have less volume on top since it's still thin. I get my haircuts on the side to make it look not as light on top. I've learned alot throughout this community and I'm glad I gave my hair a chance I really wish I would've done this sooner at least 5 years ago when my hair was really thinning out throughout that time I buzzed my head. This is my first year that I've \"grown out\" my hair and I haven't felt this happy in long time. I shall keep you guys posted throughout my journey. Best of luck to all ",

I do have some layering which hasn’t seemed to help much. \n\nRoutine:\n\nI washed my hair x2 (kinky curly clarifying shampoo or Nizoral when needed) and no conditioner because sometimes I feel like it just looks better without? Then I sectioned and brushed in Rizos Curls defining mousse with my bounce curl brush. After I scrunched in four pumps of Innersense I create hold gel and then plopped for a bit. I then did a bit of air dry and then went in with a diffuser. I slept with it in a banana clip on top of my head and my satin bonnet.\n\nOther info about my hair:\n- I would say I have a lot of very fine soft hair\n- It starts to get frizzy pretty quickly out of the shower\n- my hair appears to dry fast but still takes hours for it to fully air dry\n- my hairdresser said I have low porosity very healthy hair and just recommend an air dry cream but the cream doesn’t help with the hold/definition at all (R+Co air dry)\n\nAny help/recommendations would be greatly appreciated! 😊",

      "title": "[Anti-Aging] 25yo male Looking for advice for tretinoin usage for my case",
      "content": "[](https://www.reddit.com/)Hello, I have purchased a tube of tretinoin Retin-A 0.1% gel from online. Initially when I started it, I was using it daily. How I used it was I firstly applied the tretinoin to my bare skin after washing my face, then after around 10 minutes, I put the Cerave Moisturizing Lotion (not cream, apparently its different), on my face. While this did reduce my aging and make my skin smooth, it lead to extensive redness and sometimes even stinging. I thought at first the 0.1% was too strong, so I tried to take a break from it from early October till now. During that break, I used only the 0.05% which I had as well handy once a week, and I slowly started noticing my skin getting worse and worse and textured. Following this, I took a full break from tretinoin and just focused on hydrating my barrier. After the hydration, the skin still looked somewhat textured but was smoother, although not as good as when I was on 0.1%, but it seemed ready for tretinoin application. Then I tried to make a routine with ChatGPT which suggested the following:\n\nWeek 1:\n\nUse only once a week, with moistuirzer sandwhich\n\nWeek 2:\n\nSame as week 1\n\nWeek 3:\n\nTry increasing to twice a week if your skin doesn't feel irritated with moistuirzer sandwhich\n\nWeek 4:\n\nSame thing\n\nWeek 5:\n\nIncrease 3x a week if skin doesn't feel irritated with twice. with moistuirzer sandwhich\n\nI have used the tretinoin once this week, and my concern is that I did not see any kind of peeling or sign that it is working.\n\nSo I had a couple of questions. Firstly, is the moisturizer sandwhich method actually effective, like does it allow the tretinoin to reach my skin and actually do its job? Secondly do i need to see peeling or the skin flakes when I say dry my face with a towel?\n\nI just really need to know what to do especially before February as I have a trip coming which is very important so I just wanted to fix my situation before then, especially because weeks of stress due to work load and lack of sleep really messed up my face.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nBought 0.1% tretinoin gel online and used it **daily on bare skin**, then moisturized 10 minutes later. It made your skin smoother and reduced aging signs, but caused **heavy redness and stinging**. Switched to **0.05% once a week**, but your skin got more textured. Took a full break to repair your barrier, then restarted tret with a gradual “moisturizer sandwich (with the Cerave Daily Lotion)” routine suggested by ChatGPT (1×/week → 2×/week → 3×/week).\n\nNow you’re worried because **there’s no peeling**, and you want to know:\n\n1. **Does the moisturizer sandwich weaken tretinoin or stop it from working?**\n2. **Do you need visible peeling for tret to be effective**\n3. Trying to fix your skin before an important trip in **February**, after stress and lack of sleep made things worse.",

      "content": "My skin used to be in a perfect place about a year and a half ago. I had a solid routine (shown below) that worked really well for me, and my skin was consistently clear, balanced, and never looked overly shiny or dry.\n\nWhen I started college last fall, I got caught up in trying new products and switching routines a lot by using different moisturizers, cleansers, and sunscreens over the past year that ended up causing more harm than good. This summer, I finally got my acne back under control but was unsatisfied with the level of shine on my face and always felt like my moisture barrier was off (I used tret for pretty much the entire time, I did not just get back into it), so I recently decided to go back to the original routine that used to work so well.\n\nThe problem is that my skin doesn’t seem ready for it. I’m not breaking out at all, but my nose gets very oily a few hours after my morning routine, while my cheeks get dry, tight, and a bit red. It feels like my moisture barrier is still compromised from a year of over-testing products that didn’t work for me. I should note that after cleansing and for the first few hours of the morning, everything is perfect; it's normally after around 5 hours that my nose gets oily and I can feel the rest of my face getting dry.\n\nSo now I’m thinking about doing a short “routine reset” to help my skin rebalance before returning fully to my old routine. I’d love some advice on what I should remove, change, or keep during this reset phase. I want to heal my skin barrier and make sure that my skin is moisturized, but I also don’t want to start breaking out again and lose all the progress with tretinoin and other actives. I also don’t know how long I should do this recovery phase, and how to best reintroduce products when my skin barrier is fixed.\n\nAny input would be really appreciated!\n\nMy original routine that used to work wonderfully for my skin:\n\nAM:\n\ncerave acne control cleanser \n\nandalou naturals pure pore toner \n\nclindamycin phosphate 1% gel\n\ncetaphil moisturizing lotion \n\nRoundlab birch juice sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\ncerave acne control cleanser\n\nandalou naturals pure pore toner \n\nazelaic acid 15% \n\ntretinoin 0.025% \n\ncetaphil moisturizing lotion",

In fact, they decided to divorce on an early birthday trip that she planned for herself and her husband (soon to be ex, thank god), she ended the trip early and flew home alone :(\n\nShe deserves and deserved a hell of a lot better of a husband, father, and partner than that piece of garbage, and she has been in a bad place for years due to their marital strife. I’d like to send her a really nice and thoughtful gift for her birthday, as she loves all things beauty (hair, skin, makeup, everything!). I live abroad so I can’t peep in her bathroom to see what brands she likes, and it would be suspicious to start asking if she’s been liking anything new lately! She is blonde and has fair skin, if that makes a difference for suggestions! Alternatively, if you have gone through a divorce, what has been a thoughtful gift you received from a friend? I know this is going to be a hard day for her, and I want to support her and show her how loved and special she is! Grateful for any and all suggestions. Budget is $150 if that helps! ",

I have wavy hair (sometimes even a bit curly but it really depends) and it has always been entirely unmanageable for me. No one else in my family has hair like mine. Because of how exhausting and upsetting my hair is (I feel like it makes me look so ugly), I have been considering keratin or nanoplasty. However, ideally I want to embrace my wavy hair. I just want to know how to deal with it!\n\n  \nHere is my current routine, which clearly doesn’t work based on my hair: I soak my hair in the shower with cold/cool water and use Redken acidic bonding curls shampoo. I wash it out, and I use my detangling brush after my shower. I let it air dry. It’s quite frizzy. Inevitably, my hair gets super tangled out of nowhere and I brush it and it gets even frizzier and poofy. \n\n  \nHere is some other info on my hair: I rarely use any heat; I used to straighten it maybe once a week or every other week, but now I never straighten it. I believe my hair is high porosity. Heavy products seem to make my hair really weird, like curl creams and such. I’ve never tried oiling but I’m, of course, open to do anything that anyone thinks may help my hair. I’ve used hair masks in the past and they are nice but I never noticed a huge difference, and I just stopped getting them because of expense. But again, I’m open to trying anything! \n\n  \nI would love any advice, preferably an inexpensive and simple routine, but I would be grateful to hear anything. Thank you so much for reading!",

It's so brittle and feel like a straw when it's wet. \nIt's 2c curly type, but curls losing their shape by the second day. Such a pain to detangle in the shower.\n\nI don't like using so many products on my hair bcs I don't like the wet/ oily look, or stiff feeling some products give you. So up until this year it's just been shampoo + conditioner. I also air dry my hair for the last 1 or 2 years. \n\nSo a little bit of background:\nAfter I moved to the UK I noticed my hair lost its softness. I found out it's the hard water where we live. Tried a few shower filters which didn't seem to have helped.\nI tried Ogx Argan Oil of Morocco, my hair didn't like it. I also use Camille Rose Algae Renew Deep Conditioner Mask from time to time, this mask gives me mixed results everytime I use it. Sometimes it leaves my hair soft, sometimes the opposite, even drier.\n\nRoutine: I use John Frieda's Frizz Ease Dream Curls Shampoo and I was using the conditioner from the same series. But switched to Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Yogurd Conditioner for a while (also dyed my hair at the same time). But omg, my hair hated that conditioner. I was using more and more conditioner to detangle my hair, but wasn't helping. My hair started tangling more than it ever did, I think it is bcs I dyed my hair. I switched to John Frieda's Miracle Recovery Conditioner, my hair is now at least easy to detangle but after shower when it's wet it feels like a straw, I hate touching it, it's so brittle, I keep finding small hair coming off my hair in the shower, so my hair is breaking!\n\nShea Moisture Manuka Honey and Yogurd Leave-in conditioner feels like it's giving my hair some softness but I'm not sure.\n\nAlso have Label.m Anti Frizz Smoothing Mask, bcs once I went to a hair salloon, they used this mask and one other label.m product (which I can't remember for sure) and my hair was the smoooooothest it has ever been, so I bought the mask but it doesn't do anything!\n\nI don't know what do with my hair, I don't want to get it cut short because I don't think it looks good on me but I'm so frustrated with it. I just want my old soft hair back. What do you recommend? ",

I am not looking for just color safe options (they dim the color for some reason), but the ones that say something like “color line”, “color recipe”, etc. \n\nI have been loving Curlsmith Vivid Tones Vibrancy shampoo and Glow Perfection conditioner from their color line, but it is quite expensive ($30 per bottle, and I fly through them). I have tried L’Oreal Ever Pure curl shampoo and conditioner from their color care line, but it makes my hair very frizzy. Send help!\n\nCurrent routine: Curlsmith Vivid Tones Vibrancy shampoo and Glow Perfection conditioner, Curlsmith Bouncy Strength Volume Foam, Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream, Miss Jessie’s Jelly Soft Curls or Curlsmith Defining Styling Souffle (depends on my mood), air dry or diffuse, scrunch with Living Proof Curl Moisturising Shine Oil. \n\nP.S.
