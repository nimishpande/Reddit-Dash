The pictures are taken almost exactly one year apart.\nMy routine includes a clarifying and a moisturizing shampoo from a drugstore in my country (Rossmann - the brand is called Isana). \nAfterwards I use the Garnier “Method for Curls”-Mask as a conditioner.\nI brush in a gel (also by Isana - Curltastic Scrunch Gel), and afterwards a foam (mostly Wellaflex - Curls Definition Mousse). I do this on soaking wet hair because it tends to bring out the best results. I then scrunch my heart out (first with bare hands, then into an old tshirt) spray on some heat protection (Elvital - Defeat The Heat spray) and diffuse on medium heat, medium speed.\nLastly I scrunch out the remaining gel cast with the Pantene Pro-V Argan Infused Oil.\nI sleep with my hair up in a bun on a satin pillowcase. No refresh routine.\n\n",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I also struggle with gut issues and being a bit overweight, which I know can affect skin and hair but i am trying to get in control of these with lifestyle changes.\n\nLately, I’m really concerned about **both my skin and hair**. My hair quality has gotten worse, and my skin has developed **bumps, hyperpigmentation, visible pores, and some acne**. I can also see **early signs of ageing**, and my face just doesn’t look fresh anymore.\n\nI want to start with a **very basic, low-effort routine** that I can actually stay consistent with. At the moment, I only use **Cetaphil face wash** — that’s it.\n\nI’d really appreciate recommendations for a **minimal routine** (ideally just a few steps) that can help improve texture, pigmentation, pores, and overall skin health.\n\n**P.S.** I perform ablution around **3–5 times a day**, so reapplying products or having a long routine feels overwhelming.

It's a lot of layers, and just generally a lot of hair\n\n When I was a kid I've had some pretty serious knotting issues in the back of my head particularly. We used to spend hours brushing the knots from my hair, sometimes I would just chop them off for relief. \n\nI brush my hair in the morning damp, and it's a rats nest in the back of my head by 12. \n\n in my everyday life I swim once a week, I put a swim cap and fresh water in my hair. I wash my hair besides that day, once a week.  I braid it before I go to bed on most nights. I brush it using a wide tooth comb, and only use a paddle brush for the worst knots \n\nI'm also disabled. Holding my head upside down for long periods, or lifting my arms to shampoo my hair are super tiring and strenuous. I can't keep up with the popular curly routines for this reason. \n\nWhen I've done research online for how to deal with more curly hair the routines are strenuous,long, and expensive. Or I read the \" just don't brush it until it's wet, and don't touch it when it's dry\" advice.\n These are both super great as general advice but the longer I don't brush my hair, the worse the knots get. I've tried brushing it out, and leaving it. It's still a knotted mess by the next day. I don't want to go about my day with unbrushed haid. If I wet my hair everyday, I have to wash it more often. \n\nAnyways people, IM AT MY WITTS END! what do I do? I'm going to a hairdressers in a few days, to reset my head again\n\n I'm unsure if I actually have curly hair, my hair does tend to curl a lot when it's got no weight on it. On a good day, my hair can coil! But my roots are straight more often then not!

      "content": "Hello :) \n\nI’m starting to care for my curly hair but i still have a long way to go. I would love any suggestions or guidance! I’m so confused as to what my curl pattern is, what routine would suit my hair, products etc so anything would help (\\^.\\^) I think my hair is fine and thin? \n\n  \nMy current routine: \n\nMy shampoo is original Ivory Bar soap 💀, I don’t use conditioner, and I only use 1 product Aussie Miracle Curls Leave in Detangling milk (I’m open to suggestions) I usually just use the bar soap, then I put it up in a wrap with a microfiber hair towel. then I take it out of the towel and let it air dry and then sleep. If I’m going somewhere and not at home that’s when I brush my hair with a wet brush and then wet it and add the product and just squish it. \n\n1-2: the first two pictures are when I thought I had wavy hair, I did not put any product or style it at all, I would just brush and go\n\n3:the third photo is no product, not brushed just air dried \n\nThe rest: Either styled or in between wash days and with different hair cuts :) \n\nany suggestions would be VERY appreciated!

Also wondering if I used too much mousse or should never have combed it after the mouse was in? Any advice very appreciated.

Sometimes my hair looks okay, but other times the shedding becomes intense and everything feels like a mess again. When my hair is in a bad phase, it feels like my life goes on pause until things stabilize.\n\nI don’t know if this is the right place to vent, but I just want to talk to people who might understand how this feels.\n\nI’ve been talking to a woman for a few months and I really like her. When my hair loss gets worse, it affects me deeply. During these periods, I feel ashamed to send her pictures of myself. It’s not that I don’t take care of my appearance — I do — but when my hair is bad, my confidence drops completely.\n\nWhat scares me the most is the fear of losing all my hair and never being truly loved by a woman because of it. Recently, I switched from finasteride to dutasteride 0.5 mg daily, and I really hope it works.\n\nAll I want is to find a treatment that truly stabilizes my hair loss so I can live my life normally, without this constant insecurity that keeps hurting me.",

      "content": "Ignore my crazy eyebrows pls lol\n\nI used to have severe hormonal acne from ages 11-16 before I got on birth control, which made the acne very mild. I finally found out about a year ago at 25 that I have PCOS, and got on inositol as well, which cleared it fully. I just break out a little around my period now.\n\nUnfortunately, I think maybe because I also have eczema and hypermobile Ehler’s Danlos syndrome, my skin scars very easily. I have some shallow ice pick scars on my cheeks and forehead, and also all these massive pores that are made more obvious by how shiny my skin is.\n\nMy skin is SUPER sensitive because of my health issues and various allergies. I’m allergic to fragrance and formaldehyde, which are in a surprising amount of products.\n\nMy routine:\n\nMorning:\n\n\\- Cerave acne wash 4% benzoyl peroxide\n\n\\- Cerave moisturizer\n\n\\- Rx Azelaic acid 15%\n\n\\- Vanicream facial moisturizer spf 30 (only sunscreen that doesn’t make my face burn or itch)\n\nNight:\n\n\\- Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser\n\n\\- Cerave moisturizer\n\n\\- Vaseline for dry patches on my eyelids + around nostrils\n\n\\- Tretinoin .025% every 5-6 days with moisturizer under as a barrier (working my way up slowly for a couple years)\n\n\\- Aquaphor diaper rash cream as a mask for the couple days after I do tretinoin\n\nIf anyone has like 1-2 products to recommend for large pores and shiny skin that hopefully won’t mess with my extremely sensitive face, please share!",
