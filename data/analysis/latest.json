I‚Äôve literally only ever used a basic face wash because up until a few months ago, my skin was really clear no pimples, no visible pores, nothing.\n\nBut recently I‚Äôve started break out and noticing pores:\n\n* Forehead has small pimples + visible pores\n* Right beside my nose (Ig bcz I wear glasses?)\n* And now they‚Äôre even starting to show up on my cheeks\n\nI have no skincare routine and honestly no clue where to start. I don‚Äôt wanna go overboard, just need something simple that can help with pores + stop my skin from getting worse. Pls make it affordable and not a long routine..\n\n**Skin type:**¬†My forehead and nose are oily, but after I wash with a face wash, my skin feels dry.\n\nWhat products or routine would you recommend for a complete beginner?",
