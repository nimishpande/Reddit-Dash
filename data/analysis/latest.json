      "content": "Helllpp pls\nI started Accutane in early March and now it’s October. At first everything was great — my pores and blackheads disappeared, I had some small breakouts but nothing major, and after that my skin looked amazing. But around July things started to get worse again: lots of texture, a lot of inflammation, and honestly my skin now looks even worse than before.\n\nAccording to my dermatologist, my treatment could have ended in July since I barely had any acne left on my face (most of it was on my body). So we began tapering down the dose: first three times a week, then once a week. But that’s when things really got worse. I went back to her, and she said she’s not entirely sure what it could be — it seems like follicular acne, not fungal, because there’s no flaking or signs of a compromised skin barrier. Her advice was to go back on daily Accutane and wait to see how things progress.\n\nShe even told me to buy two more boxes for the next two months. In total i have 2 months and 15 days of medication left. Do you think this will eventually resolve? I’ve already tried ceramides (thinking it was barrier related), azelaic acid to reduce redness, light moisturizers, heavy repairing moisturizers… but nothing seems to help.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar?\n",

I’ve struggled with skin picking my whole life (getting better though!) and made it a long time without getting serious scarring, until this year when the texture of my skin got horrible, and I started getting scars even from pimples I let run their course without touching at all.\n\nSo I’ve never had big blackheads before, especially not on my face, and would like advice on how to get rid of this without leaving permanent damage. The blackhead has been here for about a month and it seems to be loosening up, but I’m worried that even if it comes out naturally it will leave a crater :( I’m not great at routine but I currently wash my face with Target’s Oil Free Acne Wash with Salicylic Acid 1-2x a day, and I’ve started applying Clean &amp; Clear spot treatment as well. I moisturize cautiously as I have yet to find something that doesn’t make me break out.\n\nAny advice about my skin in general would be helpful too, as I know I probably need a better routine. The texture, scarring, and CONSTANT irritation has been awful. Planning on seeing a dermatologist next month. Thanks everyone &lt;3",

The acne breakouts vary but i basically never have an acne-free face.\n\nDaily before going to bed i wash my face, use Q+A azelaic acid, and moisturize. I got a tip to use the azelaic acid in the past but it hasnt really worked much for the redness. Ive also just started using Ordinary \"Glycolic acid toned\" once a week because my sister suggested it\n\nI dont like using it but ive been applying a bit of concealer under my eyes since i was about 17 (21 now), because i would frequently get asked if i was feeling sick or unwell due to my pale skin and dark circles. Those comments have died down but im not super comfortable with wearing the concealer, i feel it may be noticable up close. Any advice would be much appreciated. ",

My friend got surgery almost two weeks ago, and the surgeon/assistant poured some kind of solution on her head, maybe for sterilizing or to assist in blood clotting, but I think the latter. They did not clean it properly. As a result, she has an AWFUL matt, think like the size of a nectarine on the right side of her head. We've tried coconut oil, baby shampoo, deep conditioner, peanut butter, and so far, no luck... The nurse said to use Solvo plast (or Solvoplast?) on her hair. A last resort would be to cut it off, but we don't want to cut it that short, her hair would go up to her cheek basically, just under her eye. Anyone know if any really good things to help? She's going through so much right now and I want her to be able to have her hair back &lt;3\n\n  \nEdit: Her mom is going to try perhaps clarifying shampoo as well. ",

(Pics attached—but don’t worry, also included my dog 🐶 because morale).\n\nThey’ve outlived puberty, workouts, scars that took years to heal, even today’s spray tan. Basically, they’re the squatters of my skin.\n\nI’m 36 now and still rocking my middle school stripes. So—\n🤔 miracle lotions?\n🤔 fancy lasers?\n🤔 or do I just lean in and accept I’ve got eternal 7th-grade thighs?\n\nThanks in advanced for answers, jokes, or skincare witchcraft. i need it.",
