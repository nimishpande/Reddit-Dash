      "title": "My 4100 Grafts hair transplant surgery update.",
      "content": "\n\n\nHey everyone,\n\nAfter reading so many transformation stories here, I finally gathered the confidence to share my own. It’s been a full 12 months since my journey began, and honestly, choosing to go ahead with a hair transplant has been one of the best decisions of my life.\n\nI’m a 41-year-old doctor, but for years I looked much older than my actual age. I had a very large forehead, strong frontalis muscle activity, and a badly receding hairline. It affected me more than I’d like to admit. I avoided mirrors, disliked being photographed, and slowly my confidence started fading. I run a small hospital, so looking constantly tired or stressed didn’t help either.\n\nThe Surgery &amp; Choosing the Right Doctor\nI had been thinking about a hair transplant for a long time, but time was always an issue. Traveling to another city felt exhausting, and I was very clear about one thing—I didn’t want a “hair mill” setup where technicians do everything. I wanted a qualified doctor who personally performs the procedure.\n\nThrough one of my colleagues, I came across a doctor in Patna, and from the very first consultation, I felt comfortable. What impressed me most was that he didn’t just talk about the number of grafts—he talked about aesthetics. He carefully studied my face, age, muscle movement, and skin laxity, and explained why my case needed a customized approach.\n\nFirst Sitting &amp; Setbacks\nMy first surgery involved 3,500 grafts. Unfortunately, soon after the procedure, I went through a very stressful personal phase. Because of that, I couldn’t follow the post-op routine properly—diet, supplements, and overall care were not ideal for almost six months. Naturally, this affected the results.\n\nBy the 8th month, the outcome was decent, but deep down I felt something was still missing.\n\nSecond Sitting – A Grateful Moment\nWhen I discussed this with my doctor, he was incredibly understanding. He agreed to a second sitting for refinement—free of charge, except for a minimal OT cost. I wanted a slightly lower hairline and better density, and around 1,800 additional grafts were added to enhance the hairline peak and blend everything naturally. I’m genuinely grateful for his honesty and support.\n\nHairline Design – The Game Changer\nThis is what truly changed everything.\n\nInstead of giving me a straight, artificial-looking hairline, he designed a:\n\nTriangular, age-appropriate hairline\n\nOne that perfectly matches my face shape and muscle movement\n\nNot too low, not too youthful—just natural and balanced\n\nThe Real Journey (No Sugarcoating)\nMonths 1–3: Shedding, anxiety, stress, and poor aftercare\n\nMonths 4–6: Early signs of growth\n\nMonth 7: Good density, but I wanted a lower hairline\n\nMonth 8: Second surgery for refinement (1,800 grafts)\n\nMonth 12: Major transformation\n\nSome areas are still improving, and since it’s only 4 months after the second sitting, I feel I might gain another 20–30% density.\n\nHow I Feel Today\nFor the first time in years, I don’t look constantly stressed or older than my age. I finally see a version of myself that feels right. The confidence this has given me—both personally and professionally—is something I can’t put a price on.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nA hair transplant isn’t just about getting hair back—it’s about getting your confidence back.\n\nIf you’re thinking about it:\n\nChoose a doctor who designs, not just implants\n\nBe patient—it’s a long journey\n\nTrust the process\n\nI’m finally at a place where I truly like how I look, and that feeling is priceless.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or share pictures if anyone wants",

      "content": "I've been taking isotretinoin 20mg for the last 4 months and previous 6 months i took 10mg. Recently a friend's mom who's a doc got to know about it through my friend and she told me and my mom all the side effects it has. I checked on chatgpt it said it doesn't cause any major side effects with this dosage. But my mom isn't convinced. My mom took away the 15 tabs that I had of isotretinoin and told me i don't need them anymore so i should stop as she says my skin has improved now. I believe i should atleast complete those 15 tablets and then visit the new dermat later whenever possible as I've exams coming up in a while. Should I convince my mom to give me those? Or is it really that bad that i should stop? Pls help.\n\nAlso pls tell me if anyone had a similar skin condition like mine and anything else other than isotretinoin that helped them?",

I’m overall just trying to get rid of my dry scalp while using products that do justice to my curls. I was using Cantu curl cream and mousse for about 5-6 months, then stopped because I thought it was starting to strip my scalp. Since then I tried Miss Jesse’s Multi-Cultural curl cream, which didn’t work AT ALL. I normally use a t-shirt to let my hair dry and then let it air dry.\n\nI’ve been trying to search for a good leave-in conditioner for about a week or now because I wanna start using products in my hair again, but I don’t want to dry my hair, at the same time I want to make my hair more curly. I would try Shea-Moisture, but their Manuka Honey Shampoo and Conditioner dried out my hair, so I’m weary of trying their leave-in. I’m just confused on where to start or what brands to get.

One week it looks relatively calm and normal for me, and then very quickly it turns into what you see now — red, inflamed bumps concentrated mostly on my cheeks (even apples of my cheeks) and jaw, with a lot of background redness and irritation. Normally no issues with my forehead.\n\nThe inflamed pictures I have aren’t even at their worst. They are probably a day or two post peak inflammation. I never want to document the worst but I guess I should.\n\nHere’s where I’m confused:\n\n• I’ve been on spironolactone (for hormonal acne). Has helped some. • I use tretinoin • My dermatologist recently prescribed Cabtreo • BUT… my skin seems to be getting angrier, not better\n\nI’m starting to seriously wonder if this is type 2 rosacea, a damaged skin barrier, or some overlap, rather than classic acne. I don’t have persistent redness like typical rosacea.\n\nSome important context: • The bumps aren’t always typical whiteheads; they’re more inflamed red papules that flare fast and can hurt. • The change happens quickly, not over months • I have pretty dry skin so normal acne solutions like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acne make me so dry it hurts. • I own basically every skincare product under the sun, but clearly I’m not using the right things or the right approach\n\nI don’t know if I should push my derm harder about rosacea evaluation or if this looks hormonal + irritated rather than true rosacea\n\nIf anyone has dealt with rosacea vs acne confusion, sudden flares like this, or worsening skin despite “doing everything right,” I’d really appreciate hearing what helped you.\n\nI feel like I’m in a never ending cycle 😩\n\nThank you 🤍",

I tended to use curly marketed products already because other products made my hair puff out or feel greasy. When it’s wet, it arranges itself like pictures I’ve seen of 2c— small bundles that sometimes twist around themselves and sometimes form short S shapes- but usually it air dries looser and with straight portions especially towards the top of my head. \n\n But taking care of that was hard enough without trying to figure out a routine to encourage curls 😂 I got a shoulder length haircut a few months back and my hairdresser commented that my hair texture had definitely changed and had started curling a bit as he cut it. TBH didn’t think much of it until it got chilly in my house and I decided to break out a diffusing attachment my sister got me. \n\nPretty much all the layers below my eyes started forming larger C shapes at the ends as opposed to the long S I usually get. I thought it was cute and thought I’d try changing my routine a little to try and get more definition to the wave I already have and maybe encourage it to curl more if it would like to 😊 \n\nI like the shampoo/conditioner and infusium I currently have— so I’d be aiming for Technique and leave in conditioner/gel(?) recommendations! \n\nAttached pictures are from right after I used a diffuser on my hair :)\n\n\\-Soapbox argan oil shampoo and conditioner (wash roots with shampoo, condition through full length of hair and rinse after 5 minutes)\n\n\\-squish out some water, then spray until wet with Infusium23\n\n\\-sit there toweled up until it’s less drippy, then apply Anika Supernova Moisture and Shine Cream (usually I use the Aussie curl cream)\n\n\\-diffuse hair, plopping 1/6 of my hair right on that diffusing head of a hair dryer\n\nNowadays I sleep with a poly satin pillowcase, loose or in braids depending on my mood :)",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

The ends are all orange now, they're not totally fried, but they don't look as healthy as the rest of my hair. I don't have many split ends because I take very good care of my hair now. I've been slowly cutting my hair, but i can't cut it too short it looks too awkward.\n\nI'm looking for a mid term solution. I don't wanna cut it short and get extensions, they thin out my hair. I don't wanna do a big chop, it would destroy my confidence. I don't wanna dye my hair fully. The only solution l've found would be to dye or apply a gloss on the ends only. My hair atm only looks good in low lighting because you can’t see the orange 🤣🥲. \n\nMy current hair routine: \n- wash + deep condition weekly\n- I mostly style using the pink skala, my hair loves that stuff. (Suggestions for healthier products with similar consistency would be appreciated) \n- I do diffuse my hair with heat but only sometimes \n- I sleep with a satin bonnet \n- I never ever wear my hair up anymore to avoid breakage (and it worked 😍) \n",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

I apologize if this isn't the right subreddit but I thought it would be helpful since I know curly, thick hair can be hard to manage.\n\nShe has beautiful, long, red hair. It is very thick and curly. Like Merida from the movie Brave. I do not remember off the top of my head what shampoo she uses (I know I should). She uses a lot of oils on her hair and I know she talks a lot about how important it is to moisturize. That is as far as I know for her routine.\n\nDoes anyone with similar hair have any good hair diffuser that I could get her for Christmas? Preferably found on Amazon. I'm willing to spend good money on this for her so I just really care about the quality. After searching on Amazon, I saw that some of them did not get hot enough (she complains about this with her current hair dryer), and some other ones got too hot to the point where it burns hair and melts.\n\nI don't know much about haircare, especially with her hair because she is really careful with what she uses. Would anyone have any recommendations or advice for me? I would greatly appreciate it",
