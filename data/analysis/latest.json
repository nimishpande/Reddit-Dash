Every time I look up how to look better without makeup on TikTok or YouTube, all of the advice is from people who already are naturally beautiful or surgically enhanced. \nI don’t have the money for fillers or micro blading. I havent had a proper hair cut in years. I have quite a prominent, straight nose, and uneven eyebrows no matter how I try to do them. I feel that this asymmetry is not doing me any favours. My question is: what are some basic things that take little time or money to invest, that I can do to enhance my looks without makeup? Thanks I’m advance. ",

      "content": "hi guys! i’m seeking a holy grail moisturizing routine. i know that there’s reccs in the sub menu, but i'm really hoping someone can offer some advice for my specific skin situation!\n\ni’m 23F from utah, so my skin is reallyyy dry partially due to the desert climate here. i’ve always had tight flaky skin, the best thing i’ve found for it is Vanicream Moisturizing Cream at morning and night. this gets it under control but i still feel somewhat dry throughout the day. i'm also now using Tretinoin 0.025% topical cream for acne, which my dermatologist warned may worsen my dryness. she recommended CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion, which has helped some but not completely. i'm especially frustrated that when i put makeup over blemishes, there's little rings/flakes of dry skin around them that makes them more noticeable 😭 (so i suppose i'm also seeking concealer/powder reccs that could avoid this lol)\n\ni'm somewhat uneducated about skincare so i'm really not sure where to start and how to address this. i would be so so grateful for any and all tips and recommendations and i'm happy to answer more questions if that could help! i'm balling on a budget so it would be amazing if products are on the affordable side, but if there's something super worth it that you think will fix my problem i am willing to splurge. i just can't really afford to blindly try a bunch of products without vetting them thoroughly, which is why i'm coming here!\n\nthank you in advance :D",

That gel was discontinued a few years ago, and I have literally bought nearly a dozen different gels since then, hoping that one of them would be similar, with nearly zero success.  The only one I've tried that is even remotely close is Aussie's Instant Volume Gel, but it's only 60-70% close and my hair just does not cooperate with it very well.  I've resorted to paying overinflated prices on ebay, but it's even getting hard to find on there.  I even emailed Pantene Customer Service recently, and their recommendation (Pantene Flexible Waves &amp; Curls Gel) was absolutely terrible - very watery, zero Hold.  If anyone used to use this gel and has found something that is very similar in texture and hold, PLEASE let me know.  Here is a list of everything that I've tried and doesn't come even remotely close:\n\n* Aussie Instant Freeze\n* Pantene Flexible Waves &amp; Curls Gel\n* L'Oreal Studio Line Clean Gel\n* L'Oreal Studio Line Mega Gel\n* American Crew Firm Hold Styling Gel\n* Agadir Men Oud Wood Firm Hold Gel\n* Johnny B Fuddy Matte Styling Gel\n* Garnier Pure Clean Extra Strong Styling Gel\n* Aussie Instant Volume Gel\n* Redken Hardwear 16 from like 15 years ago",

We’ve tried a number of different shampoos, conditioners, gels, overnight curlers, skala, etc and nothing seems to help. Hairdressers have suggested shorter layers at the back, which we’ve done, and using pipe cleaners as overnight curlers but that didn’t keep either. \n\nWe do air dry as kiddo has AuDHD and can’t handle the sound of the hairdryer, and we use silk pillowcases as he also doesn’t like keeping bonnets on - he’s a side sleeper so he’s not laying directly on the back. We’ve also tried using a mini curling iron which worked for short periods, but I mostly avoid using that sort of heat on his hair. \n\nI assume it’s just two different hair types but it drives me nuts because he’s so beautifully curly at the front.

      "content": "Hello! Another mixed girl with a yt mother who didn’t know or care to learn how to do her hair 👋🏼😐 As of the last 2 years, I haven’t gotten any chemical treatment and it is now almost completely grown out (I’ve also been cutting it off in like 2-3in increments periodically). Now I just have terrible heat damage. I have NO IDEA how to do anything with my hair. I’ve been educating myself in the last couple weeks and bought a whole bunch of products. As of the last week, I stopped using heat on my hair and learning how to manage it day to day with no heat &amp; no slick backs. I’m going to be trying to learn how to braid, too, but that’s gonna take me a minute 🤣\n\nAnyway, right now my routine: I use Camille Rose Curl Love shampoo, conditioner, and leave in. During the day, I’ve been working on learning how to define my curls (that are currently non-existent). I start with a wet head, leave in (Curl Love), comb that in, section hair, curl crème (As I Am), scrunch, gel (Combat Gel watered down a bit), scrunch, then air dry or regular hair dryer. I bought a diffuser but I don’t have it yet At night, I rinse the day products out and put in a mask. I’ve been alternating every other day with Texture ID deep treatment mask and Shea Moisture Intensive Hydration mask.\n\nI am getting a hair cut (not a big chop, but the rest of my processed hair) next week, I wanted to get it professionally cut since I’ve been doing it myself. What else? What other products? Advice? Anything haha. Thank you!\n\n*First pic is dried, styled, scrunched, all that lol. Second pic is wet with leave-in",

Been shaving bald from 2021, lately just wondering is medication works for me or not. \n\nUsing fin 1.25mg and topical min once at night since early oct. But I just found out my early bottle of min is fake, so probably my min treatment is considered started since november. \n\nAlso adding dermastamp once a week since october\n\nSo far pretty satisfied with the result, perhaps another 3-6 months and I'll get rid of my diffuse thinning 🤞\nGo try it if you're still hesitating, you never know if you don't try. Good luck guys\n\n*PS I'm pretty lucky to not have any sides. My scalp is actually healthier since adding the stacks, no more flaky or dry skin\n\nThe second photo is when I use hair fiber, almost seems like no thinning at all in the crown 😂",

      "title": "[Acne] Is my acne hormonal, diet-based, bacterial? Any solutions other than changing products?",
      "content": "First 3 photos are October, next 3 November, 1 from December, and last 3 are January.\n\nHello! I have struggled with acne since I was 10-12 (idk when exactly) and I’m now 20 and still have it. I guess I’m just coming on here to see if anyone knows any products or things that could help me. My brain really wants to believe that this is all either hormonal or diet-based, because my brother and sister both had acne growing up but got rid of it completely by 18 or so, yet here I am. My skin has always been very oily, but it does often feel super dry after I wash it. I started using hyaluronic acid recently and that has helped a lot I think with feeling less dry.\n\nIt’s always pretty much looked like the photos, however in prior years the big red pimples have been concentrated on my forehead, not my cheeks, same type of pimples though. In fact, the outer parts of my cheeks NEVER had acne up until a couple months ago. I believe they could be because of either dairy (because I was eating like a pint of ice cream a day) or stress? (rough relationship with someone I met a few months back). As you can see in the last 3 pics that area is doing better now, so I think it’s dairy.\n\nBesides that, my nose is one of my biggest insecurities. Scroll to see up close pics of it. I popped my blackheads like crazy in middle school and now have deep holes left behind all over my nose, especially the sides, don’t think I can do much about that. But the blackheads or sebaceous filaments (both?) are horrendous. You can see them from a mile away. I just want a smooth nose. I think I’m just cursed with large pores as you can see in picture 8 with my ears I also have large visible pores there. Is there anything I can do to make these appear smaller? The blackheads or sebaceous filaments, what can help these?\n\nThe last few months I tried a new routine consisting of:\n\nMorning: gentle cleanser, hyaluronic acid, cerave moisturiser one day. And Murad salicylic acid cleanser, salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid, moisturiser the next day.\n\nNight: gentle cleanser, benzoyl peroxide serum, cerave moisturiser, sometimes a light layer of aquaphor.\n\nI only did that for a few weeks, and I also tried oil cleansing with jojoba oil on my nose a couple times. Didn’t see much of a difference and a few days after I would get white heads on my nose.\n\nA few weeks ago I decided to forget all that and get differin. I used it for like two weeks and then stopped so I never really got to see any difference. My problem is that I’m really bad at doing skincare twice a day, mornings I generally do my routine because I’m leaving the house, but at night… it’s bad. Right now I haven’t done anything to my face at night in almost 3 weeks. I mean tbf the last 3 pictures (from today) look the best, so maybe I need to do less. 🤷‍♀️\n\nSo my question is, do you think this could be hormonal or diet based? If so, what can I do to help? Like if it could be diet based what should I add to my diet, like fiber etc. Or supplements? I really think it all could be diet based because I don’t each much real food, I eat a lotttt of processed packaged stuff. And lots of sugar, I’m addicted. And I’m probably lacking most nutrients, like I’m often dizzy when I stand up. I have a feeling my gut is all fucked up and cleaning that up could help, so how do I do that?\n\nAlso, do you think accutane could be helpful? I really am so sick of this I just want to go on it, especially because it’s not something I have to wash my face every night to use.\n\nI tried tretinoin before, but never consistently. That’s my problem, I can’t wash my face frequently enough to see if anything works. So I’m looking for a solution that doesn’t require me to be super consistent with skincare. I will appreciate any help/advice.",

I marked this NSFW just in case. \n\n  \nSome things I've observed are\n\n\\- heat / humidity make this very worse. I live in a very humid area, and the 1-2 weeks I travel to colder climates feel very relieving\n\n\\- usually there is some \"trigger\" that makes the itchiness start, and then I know I'll have a bad day.\n\n\\- there is an interestingly noticeable line where this acne barely affects the outer plane of my cheek, my forehead, or the area between my nose / lips.\n\n  \nThis acne has been happening for around \\~5 years now (start of pandemic). I'm mid 20s currently, and although I had some teenage acne, it was never this all-consuming. \n\nI've been to a dermatologist, with relative success on a round of steroids + a year of antibiotics. However, anytime I tried weening off the antibiotics, it would come back very strong. Lifestyle wise, I'm pretty active / eat whole foods / don't consume a lot of dairy.\n\n  \nHonestly, I know it's time to see a doctor again I think - but just mildly afraid of antibiotic rounds and no real root cause. But I have one scheduled! And this is a bit of a hail mary before I go. I'm just a bit annoyed, and feeling hopeless to ever resolving this. Anyone seen this before?",

I’m trying out Garnier’s vitamin c night serum and it’s kind of iffy for me for these first 5 days cause i’ve seen small pimples from it. Additionally, I tried two packs of Numbuzin no.5 toner pads (didn’t break me out but I didn’t notice any difference), and the no.5 serum that made my face break out. I also tried the small version of Axis-Y Dark spot correcting glow serum and it didn’t break me out, should I buy the bigger version? Lastly I double cleanse well and use micellar water after showering if I see any remaining makeup.\n\nSome additional information, I use heavy makeup almost everyday, and my face is oily sometimes it’s okay. What to do, guys🥲 I really want my skin to get better this 2026.",

      "title": "Went to a family stylist and got botched. Been in tears all day, should I say something or not?",
      "content": "I've been going to the same stylist recommended by family for about 6 months. I had dark hair, almost black hair and I told her I wanted it warm blonde but was totally willing to do it over the course of several appointments. First two went pretty good, some damage but I expected this and knew it came with the territory of going dark to light.\n\nI went back yesterday just for a root touch up and tone as my hair was already a level 8/9, just a little yellow.\n\nFor context I wear glasses and was not able to see my hair for the entirety of the appointment because my vision is very poor, couldn't wear my glasses with the bleach on. She does my roots, she's doing another client at the same time, I have the bleach on my roots for probably 40 minutes. Burning like crazy but I remembered it burning last time. Eventually she rinsed me as she finished her client. Then she put the toner in. Sat for another 35-40 minutes as another client came in.\n\nShe starts freaking out about doing too many people at once. She gave me my appointment and if I had known she was doing several other people at the same time I wouldn't have went. Not like her schedule is public anyway.\n\nShe then says I need a bleach bath on my ends because they're too yellow. She already put the bleach on my ends before telling me this.\n\nMind you at this point I had already done 4 rounds of bleach over the last 2 appointments and my hair had just started to heal somewhat.\n\nI sit with the bleach on my ends for 20 minutes, then rinse. I get back in her chair, she works on another client for 20 minutes, then comes back to finish me. Even without my glasses I see purple, yellow, white, silver, and I'm internally panicking.\n\nI see my hair falling out onto the cape and breaking off. When she's done blow drying my hair I see the result with my glasses and my face drops. I know she knows I don't like it because I pay, say nothing about it and she asks if I want to reschedule, I say no and that I'd call her, run out to my car and cry. I already had plans to travel and visit family and couldn't say longer to ask her to fix what she did. She's also over an hour from my home.\n\nToday I put box dye over it and I absolutely hate it. I wish I could just buzz it off and start over but I can't because my boyfriend said he would hate it. It looks muddy even with the 4 different colors covered up and it's falling out in clumps when I try to brush it. It's so damaged it looks like hay.\n\nI've been crying all day about my hair. It doesn't feel right that I spent over $300 to get my hair destroyed. I wouldn't go back to her for a color correction or cut. I know I wouldn't get a refund. I don't know if I should just show her my hair and tell her I won't be coming back or what.\n\nHas this happened to any of you? The rest of my family still sees her and I don't want to cause any strain between anyone but I genuinely am devastated over this. I was getting my hair done to treat myself and it ended up causing me more stress anyway.",
