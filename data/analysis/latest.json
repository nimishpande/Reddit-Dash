      "content": "My hair has turned salt and pepper! (48F) I have naturally dark brown hair. I get stopped on the street by strangers asking if I got my color done at the salon. I don’t color my hair and usually do my own trims. \n\nI have medium/fine, low porosity, Irish curls- curlier underneath than on top. I think my grays are straighter than my other curls and they loosen up faster on day two.\n\nMy holy grail of products:\n\nShampoo &amp; Conditioner: Innersense Bright Balance (to keep grays from going yellow)\n\nProducts: A Curl Can Dream cream and gel- actually holds but is soft to the touch.\n\nRoutine: wash once or maybe twice a week. Apply a very small amount of the moisture definition cream throughout sopping wet hair. Flip head upside down, apply light hold gel to each section using a half pump of gel per section (really smoosh it in) and brush with Bounce curl define brush to the back of head starting at the base of the neck and doing several sections to the crown. Then head right side up, I do the tops and sides by sections, always brushing from the underside of the section, up and away from scalp. I let air dry about 50% and then finish with diffuser blow dryer. Sleep with silk bonnet and refresh each day with a continuous fine mister spray bottle and scrunch. Sometimes I’ll use a curling wand on the top layer to refresh flattened or wayward curls. I will use a heat protectant like Kenra Platinum Blow Dry Spray when I use the curling wand, but usually don’t when I blow dry bc I don’t use super high heat with the blow dryer.",

      "title": "[B&amp;A] How I got rid of Blackheads",
      "content": "Hi everyone!         \n\nI’m 28M. Like every human, I have sebaceous filaments but mine were more noticeable than “normal.” I also have some blackheads… after my ex made me self-conscious about it I dug deep into the hole and geeked out researching what I can actually do.                                                                                      \n\nOutside of clinical treatments, I’ve pretty much tried everything: clay masks, nose strips, BHAs, sulfur, niacinamide, azelaic acid, retinoids, you name it.             \n\nI wanted to share my progress after a couple months, my current routine, and a few tips I wish I’d known earlier. This will be a longer post, but hopefully it’s helpful. If you have questions lmk!           \n\n# Routine:            \n\n**Am**:           \n\n1.      Water rinse.         \n\n2.      Clinical Vit C + E + Ferulic Defend Serum.        \n\n3.      Skinfix: Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream.        \n\n4.      La Roche Posay Anthelios UVMUNE 400 invisble fluid SPF 50+.                \n\n**Pm**:           \n\n1.      The Ordinary: Glucoside Foaming Cleanser + a couple drops of 1% salicylic oil mixed in.             \n\n2.      Skinfix: Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream.              \n\n*(Mon, Wed, Fri)*              \n\n3.      CVS: Differin Adapalene Gel 0.1% (Entire face).              \n\n\\+ Dr Song 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Gel Treatment Lotion (Acne spot treatment)         \n\n*(Tue, Thu, Sat)*        \n\n3.      Murmure: Bisou clarifying oil 1% salicylic acid (Nose spot treatment).               \n\n**Sunday no actives!**              \n\n# Notes:       \n\n\\-         The Ordinary Cleanser - Skin-barrier friendly surfactants.       \n\n\\-          Clinical Vit C + E + Ferulic Defend Serum – Best Skinceuticals dupe.       \n\n\\-          CVS Differin + Dr Song - Epiduo equivalent but without the need of a prescription.       \n\n\\-          La Roche Posay Sunscreen - Non greasy, true protection.       \n\n\\-          Murmure Bisou - Salicylic acid in a lipid carrier.         \n\n# Blackheads vs. Sebaceous Filaments:        \n\nTurns out not every dark dot on your nose is a blackhead. Blackheads are actual clogs (oil + dead skin) and yes you can treat those.        \n\nSebaceous filaments, on the other hand are just pores doing thzir job. Totally normal. They just look worse when your skin gets irritated, oil production ramps up, oxidizes or when pores get stretched.         \n\n# Avoid: \n\nExtracting sebaceous filaments, inconsistent retinoid use, sleeping in makeup/sunscreen, flower/citrus essential oils, harsh cleansers that leave your skin “squeaky clean”, and pore strips or suction tools.

I’m trying to embrace my curls, but I’m really struggling with volume, fullness, and consistency. Some wash days look great, other days my hair looks flat or stringy. I also wake up with a mess even though I sleep with a silk scarf + silk bonnet. The first few photos are my hair with curl creams and gel. The ones at the end are my hair 6 years ago when it was super thick and long:( I just want to know what suits my hair and why it’s gotten so much more curly all of sudden, it was never like this when I was younger. And it’s always frizzy. I want big voluminous curls with volume.\n\nI think I might have low porosity hair (water sits on top, slow absorption), and I’m wondering if I’m using products that are too heavy or if my haircut is part of the issue.\n\nROUTINE\n\nShampoo\n\n\t•\tUmberto Giannini – Moisture drench Curl Shampoo\n\nMask / Treatment\n\n\t•\tFenty Hair Mask (used every shower because my hair is so dry, sometimes I use AMIKA soulfood hair mask instead.\n\nCURRENT styling products (used every wash day)\n\nApplied on very wet hair:\n\t•\tInnersense Quiet Calm Curl Control\n\t•\tInnersense Inner Peace Whipped Creme Texturizer\n\t•\tInnersense I Create Hold Gel\n\nOther products I own but am NOT currently using\n\n(I’ve tested these in the past)\n\t•\tMiss Jessie’s Curl Cream\n\t•\tFenty Curl Cream\n\t•\tPattern Curl Cream\n\t•\tOuidad Curl Cream\n\t•\tNot Your Mother’s Curl Cream\n- the doux pop lock curl forming glaze but not really sure if this is a gel, or curl cream?\nCake beauty as well and I’ve also tried mousse and gel but it makes my hair stringy.

Every time I try to scrunch my hair upside down, when I put my head back upright, it looks really bad and gets tangled at the roots. So I need to run my finger through to put it back, and obviously your waves don't look good when you mess with them. \n \nBecause right now I need to wash my hair in cold water so I do it upside-down, but if I don't brush it with my head right, it looks messy. \n\nIs it because I have wavy hair ? Does it work better for curls maybe ? Or am I doing something wrong, or is there something I’m not understanding about this step ?\n\n\n\nMy routine is :\nShampoo with Timotei for oily hair but sometimes I use an old Function of beauty shampoo,\nI use Timotei conditioner, sometime Cantu avocado conditionner, sometime Shea moisture Strengthen and Restore.\nThen I use Timotei spray to untangle my hair and scrunch it with Eco olive oil gel. Then I microplop during the time I put body cream and that's it, I let it air dry. I don't protect it while sleeping, and I'm usually too lazy to do refresh even if it looks good.",

I think I’ve got 2b waves, medium density, medium texture, low porosity.

I’ve been prone to it in the past but pre CG era I would’ve just grabbed some head and shoulders and I’m not sure that’s the right move. \n\nCurrent routine (products pictured):\n\n\\- Wash every 3-4 days with curl shampoo\n\n\\- Condition with the L’Oréal, rinse pretty thoroughly \n\n\\- Apply quarter size curl cream in shower while soaking wet, comb through\n\n\\- Apply quarter size gel out of shower, comb through then prayer hands and scrunch \n\n\\- Short plop with t shirt to remove some water\n\n\\- Low heat dry with bonnet attachment to hair dryer\n\n\\- Break cast once fully dry\n\n\\- Sleep with bonnet\n\n\\- Water refresh days 2-3 as needed\n\nI’m open to any product suggestions!

If you have an OCD due to hair loss induced BDD, you probably are already taking hair loss medications. The truth is, many people are in denial and are unaware of their own internal issues. So, they blame fin, dut, and even min for their problems.\n\nFinasteride Use Does Not Lead to Depre$$ion or su!c!d@l: Insights From a Large-Scale Cohort Study and Mendelian Randomization Analysis\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.70579\n\nAssociation of 5α-Reductase Inhibitors with Depre$$ion and su!c!de: A Mini Systematic Review and Meta-analysis\n\nhttp://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405456924000622\n\nThese two studies conclusively demonstrate that finasteride and dutasteride are not correlated with higher su!c!d@l risk factors so we have to ask if those with PF S are dealing with an extreme BDD?

I apply it to clean, dry skin and wait around 10 minutes before applying my moisturiser. I do experience itchiness after application, but it’s now reaching a point where it feels extremely itchy and uncomfortable.\n\nFor context, my skin has been quite reactive and problematic over the past four months, and this is currently the only active treatment I’m using.\n\nMy current skincare routine is:\n\n\\- Round Lab cleanser  \n\n\\- Tir Tir milky toner (I’m planning to stop this as I don’t think my skin tolerates it well)  \n\n\\- Gel moisturiser  \n\n\\- Sunscreen during the day only  \n\nI wanted to ask whether I should continue pushing through with this treatment or stop using it due to the irritation. I’d also really appreciate recommendations for alternative options to mainly target dark marks and hyperpigmentation, as my skin seems quite sensitive.\n\nThank you!!!",

      "content": "I had a halo laser done 3 months ago for acne scarring. I posted a while ago on laser damage support, and my skin had slightly improved but still messed up. All this texture on the lower half of my skin was not there prior to halo, and at this point I don’t think it’s going to heal any more. I stopped all actives and have been using barrier supporting products for 2 months now since after a month post halo, the med spa that did my halo gave me a mixture of tret/hydroquinine/hydrocortisone 0.025% cream in hopes it would clear up the rest of the hyperpigmentation. After noticing my skin not reacting well to it, I stopped after 3 weeks, and have only been using these products as listed below.\n\nThis is my routine\n\nAM:\n\nCerave daily foaming face wash\n\nBeauty by joseon green tea panthenol serum\n\nCerave daily moisturizer\n\nSkin 1004 sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\nCerave daily foaming face wash\n\nBeauty by joseon green tea panthenol serum\n\nCerave daily moisturizer\n\nLa Roche posay cicaplast\n\nIdk what to do anymore. The med spa that did my halo suggested a few free moxi treatments to clear things up, but I no longer trust them.  Any suggestions? What can I add to help improve the texture? I’m open to peels, other actives but Idk where to start.",

After 4 months, the results were clear:  \n\n\nDensity: The combo group saw a +27.5 hairs/cm² increase (vs. +24 for Minoxidil alone).  \n\n\nDiameter: Significant hair thickening (+4.8 μm) was seen in the combo group, while the Minoxidil-only group saw no significant change.  \n\n\nSatisfaction: 95.9% of combo users were satisfied, compared to only 27.5% of those using just Minoxidil.  \nWhy it works: Minoxidil signals blood flow, while peptides like Procapil and Redensyl target follicle stem cells and \"anchor\" the hair into the scalp to stop shedding.",
