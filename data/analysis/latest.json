I have naturally curly hair, usually straightened, but I've learnt how to manage my curls. However, for as much as the blonde hair looks great straightened, it looks terrible when it's natural. I look like a popcorn flower or a poodle. Every time I try to to curl it with my diffuser, it barely curls and it just frizzes.\n\nWhat is some advice you could give me? Any recommendation for any purple/toning shampoos and conditioners that could help? My hairstylist bleached it yellow, but she told me to use toning shampoos, but I don't know which one to buy. Any good deep hydrating masks?\n\n  \n",

      "content": "I’ve struggled with depression most of my life, and after a few years of living in the countryside and working from home, my self-image has definitely taken a hit. I’ve loved the freedom of embracing my  most natural look and not prioritising beauty, but since moving back to the city and seeing more people day-to-day more, I just don’t feel as settled. \n\nI know I can scrub up well when I go out, but on the weeks I don’t, my self-worth tends to tank because I’ve spent days looking at my roughest self in the mirror lmao. I’m trying to find a balance — to feel good, fresh, and confident without feeling like I need to be fully dolled up or stuck in a beauty routine I can’t maintain.\n\nI’ve been trying to break it down into 3 groups: \n\n1.) Non-negotiables:\nBasic hygiene stuff — daily cleansing, brushing/flossing twice a day, washing hair 3x a week, skincare routine, trimming body hair, moisturizing, keeping nails clean and tidy, etc.\n\n2.) Natural but spiced up (need ideas here):\nSimple things that elevate my look and make me feel a bit more ‘attractive’ — lip balm/gloss, nice hairstyle, daily earrings, roll-on scent, painted nails? I don’t really know.\n\n3.) All-out look:\nMy everything shower &amp; in the process of finding a better makeup routine that’s most suitable for me. \n\nI’m also focusing on sleep, hydration, diet, exercise, posture, and confidence — which is all really helping too!\n\nI’d love to know what you’d put in these categories yourself and any inspiration to just elevate your day to day look without having to rely entirely on makeup - I do love a bare face most days.

As per my estheticians suggestion, I started using Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel + Dermalogica Active Moist. The cleanser feels great on my skin and doesn't dry me up but is too expensive! I also really started flaring up after using it but it might be the moisturizer, it doesn't offer the kind of moisture my skin needs I think.\n\nSo I started using La Roche Posay Toleriane cleanser and moisturizer which my derm recommended but the cleanser is giving my skin a burning sensation which I've heard some people on here talk about. The moisturizer is like meh, worried it's also contributing to that sensation..\n\nI'm at a loss right now and need help and cheap recommendations because I can't keep buying and returning products!\n\n",

      "content": "Hi everyone! Sorry for the long post. These pictures were taken on the third day after wash day. I haven't looked after my hair well by not treating it as curly/ wavy (not sure what the type is yet), but l'd love to start and get my hair looking healthy again. I've tried reading how the curly girl method works and other people's routines, but it's a lot of information and I can't tell what would be good for me anymore. So l had a few questions to ask and am open to any tips you all have for me!\n\n1. I usually have a bunch of split ends. I'm going to get my hair trimmed in a week, but unfortunately a curly hair specialist is out of my budget. Is there anything I should specifically ask the hairdresser for to help accommodate my hair well? I usually get layers and a U-cut which I think has been alright so far. I want to grow my hair out but the split ends keep me from doing so.\n\n2. Along with the split ends, my hair feels extremely dry, especially at the scalp. This leads to too many painful tangles if I leave my hair unbraided. If I detangle my hair, wear a low ponytail and leave the house, my hair gets tangled in less than 10 mins and shrinks to a little ball of fluff. Can you recommend any products like deep conditioners or leave-ins that can prevent this? I know people say to not brush your hair when dry, but it always felt like I needed to with how instantly tangled my hair gets.\n\n3. What l've picked up as the most basic steps to care for curly hair is shampoo &gt; conditioner\n&gt; detangle &gt; leave-in conditioner &gt; a styler &gt; dry. And product selection, moisture or protein ingredients, product application all depend on the hair characteristics? Do you have any recommendations for products I could start with that suit medium porosity and medium thickness hair? I've heard people say that their hair loves protein but I don't know if mine needs that more or moisture or equal quantities anymore 🥲\n\nMy current routine is just:\n1. Detangle with comb before shower\n2. Shampoo: Crème of Nature Argan Oil Moisture and Shine shampoo\n3. Conditioner: Crème of Nature Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment\n4. Air dry\n\nI realised later that the shampoo and conditioner were not CG approved. So I’d love to get some recommendations!\n\nI have tried detangling in the shower a few times but I didn't notice any difference as it gets tangled immediately. Probably because I don't use a leave-in yet maybe?\n\nAdditional notes: 1. I had used the Crème of Nature Argan Oil leave-in conditioner spray on dry hair once and it made my hair extremely stiff. I couldn't comb my fingers through my hair without it hurting. I haven't tried it ever since but l'm guessing it might be a different story if used on wet hair l've iust been scared of trying it. 2. I wash my hair twice a week. \n\nSo if you guys have any advice on how I can start looking after my hair well, make it look not as dry, reduce the tangles, or anything related to how to choose my products, let me know! I'd be really grateful, thanks &lt;3",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

I like my curls very much, but am unsure of how to properly take care of them since they are pretty new. \n\nMy routine has been to shampoo using the Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, the Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine Smoothing conditioner, then a leave in conditioner (either the Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine leave in or the Solutions by Great Clips leave in conditioner). \n\nThis routine worked very well during the summer when it was humid but now that it is colder and drier, my curls are loosening and turning more wavy again. I have also straightened my hair a few times, which has also loosened my curls, and I need suggestions on how to revive my curls. I just bought the Not Your Mother's Refreshing Curl Talk Foam, is this a good product? I want to avoid putting heavy products in my hair since I have sort of thin hair and I don't want to weigh my hair down much, what should I add to my routine?",
