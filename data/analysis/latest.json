      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Even without the back of head cowlicks, it’s persistently frizzy and only holds strong curls on the day I wash it (sometimes I can revive them by spraying with water, but I think I’m allergic to something in the tap water where I live, so I’ve been avoiding that as it makes my scalp itch). I also feel like the longest layer is weighed down and doesn’t curl up as much as the rest? But I would really like my hair to look more put together, ideally camouflaging the awkwardly short bits as they grow out and reducing the overall frizz that seems to like the sides/back of my hair. (Should I cut it? Can I just put products on it? I don’t even know lol)\n\nIn other words, im tired of my hair looking messy when I’ve just washed it!!! (Like in these pics!)\n\nCurrently my routine includes: Neutrogena TSal shampoo (not my fav ever but guys im desperate), a random tea tree oil conditioner I got at aldi, and one of three leave in conditioner products (today for these pics was a mousse by not your mother’s curls, but I also have a Shea moisture foam and miss jessie’s multicultural curls cream in rotation). And I 99% of the time just air dry my hair\n\nMy hair is medium thick, pretty low porosity, and the area where I live has hard water &amp; high humidity, in case those factors impact any recommendations for products/routine. I want to keep the routine low maintenance (even diffusing to dry is a big ask for me on a regular basis lol) but would appreciate advice!!! I was never really taught how to properly care for curls, so it’s all been trial and error. thanks in advance!!",

I. Do. Not. Know. How. To. Take. Care. Of. It.\n\nI currently just use Native shampoo, sometimes I change between other brands but Native is the one I’m currently using. After I get out of the shower, about 80% of the time I let it air dry and not use any products. The other 20% of the time I use a Garnier Fructis cream but I don’t really like it because it gives me pimples on my head (sometimes right where the hairline begins). And I don’t wear anything special when I go to sleep.\n\n\nSo my questions for y’all are\n\n1) What’s my hair type?\n2) What haircut(s) should I get(fits me best)?/What hairstyle(s) could I rock?\n3) What should my whole hair routine be? Like what products and brands should I use (shampoo?, conditioner?, hair cream?) and should I air dry, use a diffuser?\n\nI really don’t know what to do but I wanna have beautiful hair!\n\nI’ll be more than happy to share a before/after after some time.\n\nThanks!",

So please, help me out. \n\nMore info, I'm a 21 year old male, I've had acne like this since around puberty, I have gone on a kind accutane course but it was a lesser strength version and while I saw some improvement I felt it wasn't that worth it but would be willing to try again if it's deemed necessary. I would say I have dry skin (it's definitely not oily but I feel like it's not *that* dry either so idk), I don't really know what type of acne I have maybe take a look and let me know.\n\nSo what's the move? Specific product recommendations would be very much appreciated especially if you've had similar acne in the past. Thanks in advance everyone!",

      "content": "So I went to get my hair trimmed and ended up having 7 inches chopped off. It was so blunt, shapeless, and way shorter than I’m used to. I went to get extensions. They are hand tied invisible bead wefts. I have one doubled up row placed near the crown. I think 100g. The girl installing them said it was going to be a tricky blend as my hair was cut so bluntly. I watched so many IG and TikTok videos on blunt cuts getting hair extensions and some had the stylist taking thinning shears like mad and drastically thinning out the bottom few inches of hair. Other videos said there are other techniques to blend and the client’s own hair should never have to be cut into. I let the stylist point cut and use texturizing shears in the bottom 1-2 inches of my natural hair before adding the extensions. She did not want to cut into the extensions themselves while blending as she didn’t want to take away thickness. Because of her not wanting to cut into the extensions, I had a feeling they weren’t going to blend and therefore I wanted her to remove the least amount possible from my natural ends so that if I had to take them out due to it looking unblended my own hair wouldn’t look all uneven at the bottom. \nWell, it doesn’t blend. It blended with curls at the salon but by the time I got home my natural hair had separated from the extensions and you could just see a huge drop off. A “shelf” if you will. I’m looking for advice on what would need to be done to fix this. The stylist wants me to have the blunt cut completely cut out using thinning and layering of my own hair. She still doesn’t want to cut into the extensions. I don’t think that’s the solution. My ends are no longer super blunt because she already worked on them and I believe the real problem here is a) not enough extensions. I think I probably need double what I have. And b) I think the extensions themselves need to be layered in order to connect the length of the extensions with the length of my natural hair. I do not believe that layering or removing more weight from my own hair is going to fix the huge drop off in length or the fact that the extensions just look like a few long tentacles sticking out the bottom. \nPlease advise what you think would blend them and if you happen to do extensions/ be a hair stylist please indicate that. \nIn the last two pictures you can see what happens if I don’t constantly make sure that either all my hair is in front of my shoulders or all of it is behind my shoulders. \n\nTLDR; my extensions don’t blend with my natural hair. Is my hair too thick and blunt or do I need thicker, maybe layered extensions?",

      "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI am looking for any and all hair care advice. My goals at this moment are hair growth, maintenance, and styling it to fit my profile.\n\nMy current routine looks like this (very low maintenance): \n\n1. I wash my hair roughly every two days (as my scalp tends to get oily, and my skin has a tendency to break out) with Dove daily moisture damage therapy Shampoo at the roots/scalp and body, and Dove daily moisture damage therapy Conditioner at the ends / lower half of the body of my hair.\n\n2. In my cabinet, I have Amika dream routine overnight hydration treatment, Amika blockade heat defense serum, Mizani 25 miracle milk leave in for all hair types, Shea Moisture Jamaican black castor oil strengthen and restore leave in conditioner, and Shea Moisture coconut and hibiscus curl enhancing smoothie. \n\nAll products of which I have experimented with and used infrequently or for various periods of time (the Amika was better for my hair when I was off at college and the water was harder due to it being less filtered, whereas at home I can use the shea moisture and it won’t weigh down my hair).\n\nI also have one of those water spray bottles that I have used on and off.\n\n3. I typically air dry my hair, brush it and go (wearing it straight but floofy). When I need to dress up, I will use heat to straighten it, but my hair doesn’t often take to maintaining this style- it will often wave/curl at the ends (especially if it is humid or at the slightest interaction with /exposure to water)\n\n4. I recently invested in a 100% silk pillowcase and bonnet due to my acne. Since then, I have noticed a huge positive change in the sense that my hair is way less frizzy. However, I find it so hard to get my hair in the bonnet, or to stay in the bonnet overnight. Any advice here would be welcome!\n\nI typically wear my hair down or half up. I most always wear it “straight”, which more often than not means floofy like seen in the pictures. \n\nI also have a slightly long nose, and natural cowlick in the front near my widow’s peak which I am very self conscious of and (in terms of the cowlick) don’t know how to hide / get rid of.\n\n\n*When it comes to the pictures, all but one are modern day. My hair has grown out now, but I included one picture from when I had bangs (which I had a love hate relationship with, but overall really liked them just didn’t know how to maintain them).*\n\n\nRight now I am thinking about growing out my hair, and cutting bangs again and/or getting a wolf cut. While my mother isn’t a fan of the bangs, it’s something that really boosted my confidence so there’s that haha.\n\nI appreciate everyone’s help!!\nThanks in advance to everyone who takes some time to help a girl get her hair game together :)",

I have completely straight hair that gets oily the day after showering, this is the first time I've had it cut about an inch in length on the top. Shorter on the sides. I've never used hair products or styled it ever.\n\n- What products will help it lay flat?\n- I towel dried it after cutting, bad idea. If I leave it wet and put a hat or wrap or something on it, will it eventually lie flat?\n- Could a barber thin it or shape it or fade it into a more appealing shape? My friend tried to get it as even as possible, but they have zero training beyond shaving their own head.\n\nAssistance appreciated! Right now I'm debating on cutting it shorter, wearing a hat till it grows longer, or finding a barber that can figure out how to shape it better if that is even possible.",
