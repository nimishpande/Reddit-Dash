      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "\nSo, I moved to Noida about four years ago — new job, new city, new life… and suddenly, new problem.\nMy hair started falling like crazy.\nLike actual bunches of hair every wash.\n\nI’ve had acne since my teens, but my parents always brushed it off like, “yeh toh normal hai.”\nOnce I started working, I finally decided — okay, no one’s coming to save me, I’ll figure this out myself.\n\nObviously, I started where everyone starts — YouTube and Instagram 😭.\nTried onion juice, rosemary oil, random “hair detox” tips from influencers.\nEvery reel felt like a new hope, and every shower felt like heartbreak.\n\nThen I realised — I’m actually going to go bald at this rate if I keep experimenting.\nSo began the hunt for a real dermatologist.\nAnd because I’m a typical social media junkie, I started with the ones who looked the most perfect online.\n\nDermat #1:\nThe “prettiest dermatologist” in South Delhi (you know the one whose husband’s also a social media star).\nWent to her for 3 months. She’s from one of those fancy private colleges, looks amazing on Instagram… but her treatment? Confusing.\nShe’d say one thing online, prescribe another in person.\nIt felt like she didn’t even believe in her own advice.\n\nDermat #2:\nNext was a senior male doctor from a big Delhi hospital.\nTotally arrogant. Didn’t listen, kept interrupting. Also, he was completely bald — I’m sorry, but that did not inspire confidence. 😐\n\nDermat #3:\nThen I tried the husband of one of the biggest dermatologists on Instagram.\nHe was good — calm, professional, actually explained things.\nBut their system was impossible. Getting an appointment was like applying for a visa. Truth was , on a weekday noon, which i always prefer, clinic was always empty.\nAnd when I finally got treated, I realised it was the same protocol most good dermats follow.\nNothing unique — just great packaging.\n\n\nDermat #4:\nBy now, I had learnt some lessons.\nSo I found a young dermatologist from a government college — she’d built her page around her degrees and her own acne journey. She was based in Hauz khas.\nI liked her vibe, but she was too cautious.\nShe kept saying my hair loss was normal, just fix your lifestyle.\nLike girl, my lifestyle is already squeaky clean — I needed help, not another “sleep more, drink water” lecture.\nShe waited months before starting anything real, and by then I was exhausted.\n\nFinally…\nOne of my office colleagues kept insisting I go to this low-profile dermatologist in Noida — someone who isn’t even on social media.\nI went with zero expectations, honestly just out of frustration.\nAnd that’s when it hit me — the really good doctors don’t have time for reels and filters. They’re busy doing actual work.\n\nIf you’ve read this far — thank you 🫶\nI just wanted to share this because I know how easy it is to get swayed by social media.\nAnd atleast someone should benefit from my own hard earned money funded research. 😀",

      "content": "Hi, I’m hoping someone can advise on my skincare routine. I’m 38 F, UK-based, pale white skin that I think is fairly normal (possibly leaning slightly oily if anything). For a few months now I’ve had bad breakouts of spots, mainly on my cheeks, but also forehead and that part where my earlobes meet my jawline (not sure if there’s a better name for that!).\n\nI’ve never had consistently bad skin before, just the occasional spots that clear and leave me with pretty decent skin again. I’m not very well versed in skincare and all the ingredients so could do with some help identifying what the cause may be and eliminating it or replacing it with something that could work better for me. \n\nAt the moment I use:\n\nMorning:\n– Beauty of Joseon Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/green-plum-refreshing-cleanser\n– Beauty of Joseon Calming Serum : Green tea + Panthenol https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/calming-serum-green-tea-panthenol\n– Freck Rich Bitch Cactus + Vitamin C moisturiser https://www.freckbeauty.com/products/rich-bitch\n– Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics SPF https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/relief-sun-rice-probiotics-spf50-pa-uk\n\nEvening:\n– Beauty of Joseon Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser (again) https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/green-plum-refreshing-cleanser\n– Medik8 Crystal Retinal Ceramide Eye 3 https://www.medik8.com/products/crystal-retinal-ceramide-eye\n– Freck Rich Bitch Cactus + Vitamin C moisturiser (again) https://www.freckbeauty.com/products/rich-bitch\n\nRecently I tried swapping the eye cream for Medik8’s general Crystal Retinal 3 on my whole face, but my breakout seemed to get worse so I stopped using it for now.\n\nWhen I started using Rich Bitch moisturiser a couple of years ago I liked the not-too-creamy almost chalky texture, but now I’m questioning whether this is the problem product. It kind of feels lightweight but is it actually too rich for me?\n\nI’d like my routine to be simple, with minimal products, which are ideally cruelty-free/vegan. I’d like to include sun-protection and, if possible, something to signs of ageing at bay (which is why I introduced Crystal Retinal).\n\nAny advice on potential causes / things to look out for would be greatly appreciated :) Thanks in advance!

      "content": "I recently came across this picture: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718073318im\\_/http://www.twinshairloss.com/images/twin-brothers-hair-loss.jpg](https://web.archive.org/web/20110718073318im_/http://www.twinshairloss.com/images/twin-brothers-hair-loss.jpg)  and remembered that the channel More Plates More Dates made a video a while ago about this case where one identical twin took dut and didn´t experience balding while the other twin didn´t take anything and did started balding, which it basically confirmed takind DHT blockers does prevent hair loss if you´re predisposed to it (which we all knew). But then I remembered PP405 will be supposed to work precisely by reviving hair follicles that you already lost and I wonder if PP405 does work (and I´m perfectly aware of the amount of hopium being pumped into it) and your hair does regrow, would it be neccesary to continue with PP405 indefinetly or, once you regrew the new hair, would fin/dut be enough to maintain that new hair that you got thanks to PP405?\n\nI know we can´t make any assumptions about something that isn´t even on the market yet, however I don´t see any motive why fin/dut would not keep the potential new hair you would get and I´m looking for arguments against my belief to see if I´m wrong about something. Thanks in advance for your insight. ",

I don't have problems with i.e. putting moisturizer on my face, seruns or spf.\n\nmy dermatologist started me on retinol (very happy) so i think need to have a better way to cleanse my face daily, even when i can't wash it properly (pleaseee if you don't understand my struggle, abstain from criticizing as this is a sensitive topic for me 🥹 i know the best way is to cleanse it so the skin is oil free to absorve the product!!!)\n\n1. currently, when i can't wash it PM, i use micellar water (a lot) on a cotton pad (doesn't need to rinse, doesn't foam, doesn't get sticky) and my face feels dry afterwards (in a good way!!! dry as in not oily) afterwards.  + moisturizer\n\n2. i can wash it with (just) water in the morning + spf\n\ndo you think this is enough to start retinol, considering my limitations? do you think it would be better to i.e. use a lukewarm wet microfiber cloth? with water and/or micellar water?\ndo you have any tips for alternatives like these?\n\nmy dermatologist is a busy guy, he just rushed me and I didn't have the opportunity to ask... i also think he would roll his eyes at me lol\n\nthanks a lot (◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠).♪✧⁠*♡",
