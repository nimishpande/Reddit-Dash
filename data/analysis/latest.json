I cried, thanked them, and just like that I was back in my room.\n\nTry 10mg in 1ml oral syringe and USE LUBE. I used rosemary oil because it's what I had but anything will work.\n\nWill try with LSD and update.\n\nEDIT: Checked my bottles and that *was* the LSD... Will boof actual RU 58841 and update.

And I don't want to expel *all* of my energy to do it and waste *all* of my money on just conditioner, as it takes me 40 minutes to shower *without detangling*, an hour with, and I have to use about half a bottle of conditioner per shower because of how much hair I have, how dense it is, and how hard it is to make sure everything is fully covered between the curls. I would really like to have some advice.\n\nAs for my routine, I usually use either \"conditioner for normal hair\" or \"clay conditioner\", although I do experiment with different conditioners too. But those two are the ones that have made detangling my hair the easiest. I usually use either \"clay shampoo\" or \"shampoo for curly hair\", but again I occasionally buy different types to experiment. I have looked for sulfate-free shampoos and products intended for detangling and felt little improvement. The brands are nothing special, just the ones I find in grocery stores and pharmacies. I wash every 2-4 days. Sometimes just conditioner and sometimes with shampoo as well, depending on how itchy my scalp feels. Sometimes I even do conditioner first to detangle, then shampoo, then conditioner again to soften. If my hair feels too tangled, I detangle it by brushing it with a handheld brush while the conditioner is still on (only way I'm able to brush at all), starting at the tips and working my way up to the scalp inch by inch. I occasionally detangle with my fingers instead but it's usually less efficient, more painful and feels like it results in more hairs falling off than with the brush. I usually wrap my head in a towel to soak most of the water then leave it to air dry the remaining moisture. I've tried just rubbing my hair quickly instead of wrapping, and I've tried using an old shirt for either one instead of a towel, the end result after fully drying looks the same. I don't use any leave-in products, as most of them give me sensory issues, make my scalp itchy, and/or make my hair look even worse. I do have spray serums that I use sometimes, and they have done the best job of slowing down the overpoofing of my hair and maintaining its oobedience to gravity, but they also accelerate getting itchy and needing shampoo again.\n\nAlso important to note: I have had chemical straightening before. I had even less of an idea of how to take care of my hair, so threw years ago I had a chemical straightening. A year later, two years ago, I had it renewed and it was botched and didnt stick, and even the attempt to fix it was imperfect and didn't last as long. I have since cut all the parts from the first straightening and grown out new roots, but I imagine I still have some damaged tips at the top layer of my hair.",

I have really thick curly (probably) heat damaged hair from when I used to flat iron my poor curls, i've been wearing my hair curly for about a year now and I still feel like my hair hasn't reached its full\npotential yet no matter what I do it feels big and dry and feels like straw 🥲 oh to have shiny soft curls. My curl routine is first I shampoo with Aussie miracle moist and wash just my roots. Then I rinse and usually use a hair mask instead of normal conditioner because my hair seems to struggle to keep moisture, the mask I use is shea moisture intensive hydration masqe. After brushing that through my hair I let it sit while I wash my body etc, when my hair is rinsed out and now soaking wet I detangle with a curl detangling brush and brush before applying Marc Anthonys curl envy cream, then I brush again to make curl clumps and scrunch in some eco gel. After the eco gel i spray in some leave in conditioner by Marc Anthony. Finally! I pray hands in some shea moisture curl mousse and plop for 10 minutes in a microfiber towel before diffusing for about 50 minutes.. also It seems I can never get the back to look as defined as the front. Last time I got a haircut was about 9 months ago. My hair rarely even gets past day 2 despite wearing a silk bonnet using the pineapple method to bed😅",

I used the Equal Berry Swimming Pool toner for about 4 months, but it didn’t make much of a difference. I’m now on my third month of using the PC 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid, but again, I haven’t seen much improvement.\n\nWhat’s worse is that whenever I apply sunscreen, my skin texture looks even more noticeable, and since my face gets really oily throughout the day, that makes its even worse . I did some research and found that lactic acid is supposed to be stronger than mandelic acid, but I also came across recommendations to try pairing azelaic acid with niacinamide instead.\n\nDo you have any advice? I just really want to get rid of the texture and dullness for good.\n\nmy current routine\n\nAM\n\nNuetrogena Hydro boost Cleanser \n\nSkin1004 Centella Ampoule \n\nPurito Oat In Calming Gel Cream\n\nCOSRX Ultra-Light Invisible Sunscreen \n\nPM\n\nNuetrogena Hydro boost Cleanser \n\nPC 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid ( only on Monday , Wednesday and Friday )\n\nPurito Oat In Calming Gel Cream",

      "content": "Hey guys, I need some advice.\n\nI got K-tips installed Thursday (10/30) by a stylist who just moved her setup to her house. It was a “model call,” so I paid for the hair (around $780) and still gave her $150 for her time. She had a lot going on and rescheduled me three times + did a full head in about 90 minutes.\n\nIt’s only been 5 days and several bonds have already slipped. My scalp feels sore and itchy (not chemical burn sore, just tight/pulling). Some bonds are really thin at the top and thicker at the bottom, others are flat (like the one pictured that slipped) I’ve only washed once and followed all the aftercare.\n\nI messaged her but haven’t heard back yet, and since she’s working from home, I can’t just stop by. She’s really nice and I’d still refer people to her if it gets fixed, but I’m not sure what’s fair to ask for.\n\nWould it be fair to ask her to redo the install since it’s only been a few days, or should I just expect her fix the ones that slipped? Does it look like an install issue or something I could’ve caused? And if I go somewhere else, would it be reasonable to ask for the rest of the unused hair?\n\nHonestly, I just did this as something for myself — I’ve been feeling down and thought it’d help me feel more confident. I’m not trying to spend another grand to fix it, but I also don’t want to ruin my hair.\n\nPhotos attached — any honest opinions or advice appreciated 🙏\n",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
