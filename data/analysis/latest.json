      "title": "Curly Cut - Why no product?",
      "content": "Hi, I am wondering why hair stylists who do dry curly cuts require you to come in with no product? My hair is completely different with and without product. Without product, it is a giant ball of frizz. There are no individual curls. With product, I have clearly defined curls. I have never gone outside of my house with no product on my hair and I'm scared to. I've had curly cuts before but I didn't know you weren't supposed to put in product. Now my stylist is telling me I have to come in without product and I would love to hear why, so that I feel reassured that it will come out well. I looked it up online and it said it's so they can see how each individual curls falls, but without product, I have no curls. Just frizz. I'm worried they will not cut my hair in the way I normally wear it.  Photo of how I usually style my hair. Thanks!\n\nRoutine:\n\nWash with Dove Intensive Shampoo\nCondition with John Frieda Ultra Volume\nIn shower, apply Not Your Mother's Curl Gel\nOutside shower, apply AG re:coil and scrunch\nChi Heat protecting spray \nDiffuse \nSleep with a silk bonnet, never towel dry, rather brush with a Denman\n\nAnd if anyone has further advice to get rid of the frizz, I'm all ears 😁 Thank you!",

While researching it, I’ve repeatedly come across the point that—like many medications—minoxidil must be used continuously to maintain any results. If you stop, the regrown hair is usually lost.\n\nWhat I’ve been wondering, and what I’d really appreciate insight on from someone more experienced, is this: with newer and potentially more advanced hair-loss treatments on the horizon (such as PP405 and other emerging therapies showing promising results), is it likely that people would still need to use minoxidil to maintain the hair they’ve gained? Even if these newer “miracle” treatments become publicly available, would minoxidil still be necessary for retention of the hair that was grown using it?\n\nGiven how many new treatments seem to be on the horizon, I’m also questioning whether it’s worth starting minoxidil at all right now, if hairloss is not super aggressive and fast.\n\nAny insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, and happy holidays!\n",

      "content": "Long time lurker on here, been through lots of ups and downs with my skin over the years. Used to have awful acne, went on Accutane and it cleared for a few years. Now, I notice that my skin flares up whenever I have sugar, dairy or gluten. I've gotten it mostly controlled, and at least when I break out, I saw it coming. I noticed that I do have very dry, sensitive skin.\n\n\n\nFor the last few weeks, I've been getting tons of these tiny little zits. I have no idea what would cause this. I was originally using cleanser (Vanicream) twice a day, using Purito Oat Gel as moisturizer day and night. Usually, about halfway through the work day, my skin would feel extremely tight and greasy. I thought that these tiny zits might have to do with a moisture barrier issue, so I started only cleansing at night and rinsing my face in the morning. However, the issue persists. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ni891e3vo7g1.jpg?width=2348&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1fba6ef7e72ef32be49155bdaa58a7b38f05323\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8i931e3vo7g1.jpg?width=2233&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5860de93c8c5d90cc36f530f97c616be68090f76\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xuo2c1e3vo7g1.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e0aee68b9477f6e6e5ecb139953dc307adff024\n\nI'm not really sure how to tackle this or what's causing it. Any ideas? Thinking maybe I need to cleanse in the morning too and just moisturize halfway through the day? This is uncharted territory for me lol",

Usually you might see it just below a layer or few of skin, but I can't see these. Is there a recommended cream I could buy to bring them out or maybe exfoliate them, or something that destroys them from the inside?? People please help",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin?

It became quite dynamic sometimes straight, sometimes wavy, (and more recently) sometimes straight-up curly. I'm not sure why this happened. Attached pictures are of my current hair. I currently live in Canada (east coast) with colder, humid/dry weather. My hair is still very dynamic and becomes more or less wavy/curly depending on my geographical location and the day post hair wash.\n\nDay of hair wash - voluminous and curly\nNext 1-2 days frizzy/wavy\nDay 3 post wash - 50/50 chance it might become quite straight (depending on greasiness) \n\nHas anyone experienced this, and can tell me why this might be happening?\n\nI would also appreciate some advice on hair care. I apply rosemary hair oil (occasionally, biweekly or monthly - the night before hair wash), and the usual shampoo and conditioner. \n\nThe second last picture shows my current length. I am thinking of getting a hair cut soon. What kind of hair cut would look good on me, especially with such dynamic hair texture? \n\nI don't mind any hair type, all hair is beautiful. I'm just hoping to understand it better, and make it healthier. Please lmk your thoughts! I will appreciate it. Thanks :)",

I've tried looking online in larger stores like Walmart and Target, as well as Amazon, and even the Jergens website and only found a lavender hand and body lotion. I'm out of my depth here as I have no real knowledge or experience with skincare products or routines so I was hoping the people here could at least guide me in the right direction. Are there any stores/retailers that really specialize in these products who may have a larger selection and therefore the item I need? Does this product even exist?",
