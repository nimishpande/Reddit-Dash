The last one is the most recent one! \n\nMy routine essentially just consists of double shampooing with head and shoulders shampoo and just any old hydrating shampoo, and the conditioner I use is Sukin Hydrating Conditioner. Then I brush style in the shower, make sure not to disturb the clumps, then once I'm out of the shower I add in Garnier Aloe Vera leave in conditioner and Hask curl cream. After that I scrunch with a t shirt and plop it until it's about 50-60% dry, before adding in the Cake curl scrunching jelly and then leaving it to air dry the rest of the way. I don't brush once I'm out of the shower and I typically wash my hair every 4-5 days :)",

      "content": "TLDR: listened to my mum's advice on hair. Regret.\n\nSo I only went to this salon because my mum reccommended it, and she and my sister were going and we had somewhere to be. But I had a bad feeling about it because it was a small salon in a shitty area, and, most of all, it was my mum's idea.\n\nContext: I've got curly hair, around 3b curls, and fine. Mum also has curly hair, but it's looser curls, mostly waves which disappear after she puts it in a bun- and she has NO idea how to deal with curly hair. She's the type to think if I just 'take care of it', it will just magically turn straight. And that it being out curly is \"messy\". Yeah, that type.\n\nAnyway, we had somewhere to be and my mum was kinda pressuring me into it and I thought, hey, I haven't had my hair done in AGES, and maybe I shouldn't be so prejudiced as to think a small business in a shit area ran by a middle aged auntie can't do anything a bigger salon can do. So I went. And yeah, my instincts were all correct.\n\nThe woman was very old school about hair, seemed to think that flat ironing curly hair was 'fixing' it (right up my mum's alley). Not a fucking drop of knowledge about curly hair. She reccommended a conditioner with non-water soluble silicones, then said my hair is \"thick\" and \"difficult\"- now I KNOW my hair and I KNOW that it is FINE- quite dense, yes, but fine. And DIFFICULT?? Tf?\n\nSo she first washed my hair twice, no problem, I do the same. She focused on my scalp the first time- but then on my mids and ends the next. Is that normal? It was a \"deep cleanse\" apparently, so it would've been quite harsh for my hair, especially as she didn't use a conditioner afterwards. She towelled my hair so it was half-dry- I noticed she used the same one on me as she did on my mum and sister and other clients, no washing it, no replacing it. Then she brushed my hair while blow drying- again, same comb she used on other clients, no washing or replacing it, just tugged off the hairs stuck in the bristles 🤢🤢. Didn't detangle starting from the bottom, didn't do it whilst it was wet, she just ripped through my damp hair with a very stiff comb (albeit wide-toothed comb) from top to bottom. I could literally hear my strands breaking, and a bunch of hair came out. Not to mention it fucking HURT. She said that the brush she was using was really good because it detangles hair well- yeah love, by ripping half of it out so you have nothing to detangle.\n\nThen came the actual straightening- NO heat protectant. And I did ask her about heat protectant, said I have one in my bag, and she just shook her head and said, \"no, no, no it's fine\". Um, okay. I know heat protectants don't completely prevent damage but you'd want to bloody minimize it, wouldn't you?? Then she proceeded to rip through it again with the stiff comb while straightening, and going over the same strands like a million times- I'm not exaggerating, she'd go over the roots like a dozen times or more before straightening the mids and ends. Again, NO heat protectant. Then no setting spray.\n\nAnd in the end, do you want to know how much it cost? Do you want to know how much the split ends and sore scalp cost? Do you want to take a fucking guess?\n\nONE. HUNDRED. FUCKING. POUNDS.\n\nAnd I wouldn't even be this fuming about it except, you know- IT LOOKED NO FUCKING DIFFERENT TO WHEN I STRAIGHTEN IT AT HOME. I must stress this. NO. BLOODY. DIFFERENT. Except for maybe the FUCKING LOADS of split ends I can see it in now.\n\nAnd I've had my hair straightened at a salon before, and it had turned out nice- better than when I straighten it at home, because that's why you go to a salon, to get something you can't do at home, DUH. It lasts longer, and it looks smoother- you know, less like you straightened it and more like you just have straight hair.\n\nBut this looked the exact same straight-but-poofy that I can get at home. And she said it would usually be £50 for straightening- still a bit steep if you ask me, considering the quality- but that because my hair is long and thick (it's not thick) and \"DiFfiCuLt\" it would have to be more. I'm pretty sure I just paid to be hate crimed???\n\nAll that damage, all those split ends, all that pain, and all that money... for FUCK ALL.\n\nAnd I was getting so happy because I've been taking care of my hair and it's grown so long. 🙃🙃🙃\n\nLesson learned: never listen to my mum about my hair again, and go to actual curly-friendly salons.\n\nObligatory routine information: Wash with shampoo and conditioner once a week, clarify and deep condition once a fortnight, leave-in conditioner and serum and protective hairstyle like braids.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Thinking of growing my hair out, opinions needed\n\nI’m thinking of growing my hair out, but I’m unsure if it’s the right move based on past experience. The last time I let it grow was during quarantine (5+ years ago). I didn’t use any products or take care of it, and it just grew upwards instead of falling down, which looked terrible on me. After about 4–5 months I shaved it all off.\n\nRecently I’ve read about the “awkward phase” and that hair can eventually start falling down due to length and gravity. My question is: based on my hair type, is it realistic that it would eventually look good if I actually take care of it this time?\n\nI think my hair is wavy, maybe 2a–2b (correct me if I’m wrong). I’ve started trying to improve my routine, but I still don’t really know what I’m doing.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n•\tWash hair max 2x per week\n\n•\tShampoo + conditioner\n\n•\tApply leave-in conditioner on wet hair\n\n•\tLet it air dry\n\nRight after washing and applying leave-in, my hair looks decent.\n\nThe problem is the next few days: it gets dry, frizzy, and unmanageable, and I can’t style it at all.\n\nMy main questions:\n\n•\tShould I reapply leave-in on non-wash days? (Hair is usually dry then, and I read leave-in works best on wet hair.)\n\n•\tIs it okay to wet my hair daily with just water and reapply leave-in?\n\n•\tShould I be using oil (and if so, which kind and how)?\n\n•\tDo shampoos and conditioners really matter as much as leave-in, since they get rinsed out?\n\n•\tIs Cantu Shea Leave-In worth trying for my hair type, or is it too heavy?\n\n•\tAny specific product recommendations that are beginner-friendly? I don’t want to buy 10 different things just to experiment.\n\n[These are the products](https://imgur.com/a/OEmLyK8) I have been using\n\nAny advice is appreciated — especially from people with similar hair types or who’ve been through the awkward grow-out phase. Thanks!",

The texture also looks rough.\n\nI consulted a dermatologist and was advised to use a moisturizer. I’ve already tried multiple brands including Cetaphil, Dermaco, and Epilyno (dermatologist-recommended), but I’m still seeing no real improvement.\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this?\n\n\t•\tWhat was the actual cause in your case?\n\n\t•\tDid anything other than basic moisturizers help?\n\n\t•\tWas it dermatitis, fungal infection, allergy, or something else?\n\nI’m not looking for a diagnosis, just real experiences or routines that worked. It’s making me feel quite insecure, so any input would really help. Thanks 🙏",

If I don’t use the right products, it gets super frizzy and the curls turn into an undefined mess pretty quickly.\n\nFor reference, my current routine is pretty simple: conditioner only, plus a Curly Hair Method–approved curling cream. Always air dry. If needed I use a cleansing shampoo, but only once a week.  \n\nI’m open to ideas that work with the curls rather than fighting them—both in terms of cuts and styling.\n\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks!",

Most of the active acne has faded &amp; just left behind marks, and i’m clearly still dealing with a little bit as I think im suffering from a dehydrated skin barrier, but im really confused about all of the texture! I get a lot of teeny tiny whiteheads as well. It seems like a mix of really tiny bumps all over my face that just don’t seem to go away. It makes the texture of my face feel rough like sandpaper and that bugs me more than how it looks.\n\n I am stuck between two possible solutions: exfoliation or hydration??? I use panoxyl 4% about once a week, and I have been using azelaic 10% every other day, trying to be veeeery gentle, but I feel like maybe it’s time to just cut them both out.\n\nHowever, for a month I used zero actives and only vanicream moisturizer (in the tub) and gentle cleanser and that did not help\n\nI am unsure if I should be using a heavier cream, or if a heavier cream would just make it worse.
