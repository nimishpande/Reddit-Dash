I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

      "content": " \nI was using minimalist and plum sunscreens last year and they just felt very sticky, greasy or just uncomfortable out in the sun. But this sunscoop actually feels like a proper body lotion that just happens to have SPF 50+ PA++++ in it. Like i just get out of the shower, pump it out like a normal body lotion which acts as a sunscreen too 😭\n\n**Texture and feel**\nVery smooth lotion texture. Not runny, not thick and spreads easily and absorbs pretty fast. After it settles, it doesn’t feel heavy or oily. My skin just feels normal and soft. I can get dressed in a few minutes without that sticky sunscreen feeling.\n\nIt’s SPF 50+ PA++++ with broad spectrum UVA and UVB protection. I’ve worn it out in proper sun and didn’t notice tanning or redness. \n\n**Ingredients I liked**\nWhat makes it better than basic sunscreens is the added skincare.\n5 percent Niacinamide to help with pigmentation and even skin tone.\nIt has 5 Essential Ceramides too.\n\n**Full ingredient list on the bottle:**\nPurified Water, Octocrylene, Niacinamide, Octyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Trehalose, Methylene Bis Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Avena Sativa Oat Kernel Extract, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Aloe Vera Extract, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Propanediol, 1,2 Hexanediol, Hexyldecanol, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Ceramide AS, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide NG, Sodium Acrylate Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, C15 19 Alkane, Fragrance, Sodium Polyacrylate, PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer 6, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium EDTA, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum.\n\nIt’s also free from Benzophenone, Formaldehyde &amp; Oxybenzone, atleast that's what the bottle says.\n\n**Hydration**\nIt actually feels moisturizing. I’ve skipped my regular body lotion a few times and this alone was enough. No dryness, no tightness.\n\nI do not write such long reviews but i am fr in love with this Sunscoop sunscreen body lotion and is honestly the most comfortable body sunscreen I’ve used. High protection, good ingredients, lightweight feel and no greasy mess. For daily use, it’s a solid 10 for me. \n\nDefinitely repurchasing!!!",

      "content": "Hi! I just cut my hair and I’m in the process of basically resetting it. I’m trying to get rid of all of my layers, though it’s mainly the super short face framing pieces that are bothering me. To cut it and even it out I put it in 2 low pigtails when wet and cut. After styling I went in to further even things out by pulling both sides under my chin and tying. I basically shaped it into a ball to get the stragglers. Then I put it in a low pony at the back and smoothed between 2 fingers to get any extra stragglers. Repeated that until it was straight and how I liked it. I’ll be cutting layers again once my hair is all one length (minus the bangs ofc), hopefully in about 6 months. This is the video I follow for cutting layers: https://youtu.be/rLsVd2AWW0A?si=jl6yAnLB2\\_NzClyD, which I won’t do again until my hair is fully reset. I think I’ll just completely leave out the face framing pieces, unless I cut it and decide I do want them. I honestly liked the method I did today so much I’ll probably continue doing it when I cut layers again just to keep things nice and even. My goal is to have my hair to my butt when styled in a few years. I’ve been growing out my hair since 2023. 2023-2024 was basically just cutting out all the damage I had done. Before that, it wouldn’t grow past my shoulders because I dyed it and didn’t detangle it like I should’ve. My hair is the longest it’s ever been (but every time I say that my mom tells me it was long when I was little, but I don’t remember that lol). I think I could survive with my hair a few centimeters shorter, but I want to keep it long while I’m evening it out still, so the length it is now is probably what it will be until around August, or when it’s one length. I’ll trim it probably once a month on the new moon to promote new growth until then. Around my birthday in February, once it’s quite long but still one length, I’ll cut the layers again. I’ll do it around my birthday just because I usually only cut my hair once a year. Doing it around my birthday just makes sense because that also comes once a year lol. \n\nRoutine: \n\nShampoo: Shea Moisture raw shea butter shampoo\n\nDeep conditioner: Shea Moisture raw shea butter deep moisturizing masque \n\nConditioner: She Moisture raw shea butter conditioner\n\nLeave in: Shea Moisture raw shea butter deep moisturizing leave in conditioner\n\nStyling: Damp hair, a little product, brush\n\nDrying: I use a t shirt for a few minutes to get extra water, put product in, then use a hair dryer on medium/low heat and low blow, flipping my hair upside down for majority of the drying time, and switching between one side and the other. I don’t dry my hair with my head completely straight get as much volume as possible.",

And I have gotten bleach on this hair ONCE and no other dye.\n\nSecond- I regret the bleach job. I asked for more of an ombré look and protested highlights like this (even had so many reference pics), but whatever, I really didn’t care that much and was just happy to have something new so I didn’t complain when it was wrong, but I’m growing to hate it so much \n\nThis brings me to my main dilemma- \n\nI have just really not wanted to take the time to style it (usually when I use heat, I feel like it really shows off the highlights which I hate) but this is seemingly the only way to smooth the hair (see last picture, it’s doesn’t showcase the highlights there but you can see how tame it is) \n\nThe under layer of my hair is relatively smooth and tame, so I thought maybe I needed a shower filter- got one, hair has almost been worse? \n\nThe hair pictured here is after this routine:\n\nShampoo: Accure Hydration \n\nConditioner: same line\n\nLeave it: IGK 4 in 1 good behavior pump spray\n\nAir dried\n\nI never use a blow dryer because it gets inSANEly frizzy but lately even air dry looks so bad. I’m at a loss because IGK leave in gives me amazing results if I decide to use heat (in which case I add the aerosol version of to the dry hair) and up until lately I also felt like my hair looked decent with just it and no heat afterwards, idk what changed other than weather?\n\nPlease help me combat this frizzy result from air drying- would love a leave in product or shampoo/ conditioner recommendation!!!!",

Others are closed but I can feel hard nodules under the skin. They never seem to come to a head, which is frustrating! If I squeeze them, a string of sebum/dead skin comes out. \n\nSkin type: Dry/normal cheeks, oily T zone\n\nAM Routine\n\nKracie Naive green tea cleanser\n\nHyaluronic acid serum and ceramide toner (mixed together, I just pat it into my skin)\n\nCerave Daily Hydrating Lotion\n\nBeauty of Joseon Sunscreen\n\nPM Routine\n\nAnua oil cleanser\n\nKracie cleanser\n\nSerum and toner combo\n\nPaula’s Choice Barrier Repair moisturizer (retinol)\n\nSunflower or avocado oil\n\nAs needed: Glycolic acid on areas of hyperpigmentation\n\nWeekly: Clay mask, sheet mask\n\nBiweekly/monthly: Ordinary AHA/BHA mask\n\nAny advice on products I should add in/remove? I’ve been thinking that I should just get these professionally extracted, but still need help figuring out how to prevent them, especially since it’s been my problem area for over a decade.\n\nThanks!!",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

My baby hairs and the front pieces curl tightly from root to tip, but in the back, only the ends curl while the roots stay flat. I washed with L’Oréal Gloss Shampoo and used the L’Oréal Dream Long Conditioner. After that, I applied Camille Rose Moisture Milk, even though I know it’s too heavy for my hair—I just ran out of my usual Ouai leave-in spray. Even when I use the Ouai, my hair still doesn’t curl from the roots. After the leave-in, I applied mousse and Cantu Avocado Gel, then diffused. My hair actually looked curlier when it was wet, so I’m not sure what changed once it dried. Does anyone have tips on how to get curls to form at the roots? Also, I don’t heat-style my hair—the only heat I use is from a diffuser with heat protection or from the sun.\n\n1st photo is when its wet (finger curled)\n\n2nd when its dry (finger curled)\n\n3rd my regular routine \n\n4th my front hairs (finger curled but usually look the exact same without finger curling)",

I have been developing and adjusting my skincare routine for the past couple years and would love some input!\n\nI have relatively dry skin with larger pores.

I have been jumping around different cleansers, serums, oils, etc.\n\nMORNING\n\n\\- splash cold water on face\n\n\\- TONYMOLY wonder ceramide toner\n\n\\- IT cosmetics confidence cream\n\n\\- IT cosmetics sunscreen\n\nEVENING\n\n\\- elemis cleansing balm\n\n\\- cerave hydrating cleanser\n\n\\- TONYMOLY wonder ceramide toner\n\n\\- The Ordinary rosehip oil\n\n\\- IT cosmetic confidence cream\n\nAbove is the routine i’ve been using for the past couple weeks and my skin has been really happy.  I love the TONYMOLY toner SO MUCH and using the rosehip oil has done wonders for me.\n\nThere are a couple things i’m still working towards/would like guidance on. IT cosmetics confidence cream used to be great but now burns my face and doesn’t hydrate the same. The cerave hydrating cleanser is good but I notice slight burning as well. I also am still struggling with my pores being large on my nose. I am looking into Paula’s Choice BHA liquid exfoliant and a couple other products.\n\nI would love some recommendations and constructive feedback on my routine. I know it’s not perfect and am working towards something that will keep my skin healthy and happy! Any product recommendations or advice for my routine are welcome. Thank you!",

It’s gotten significantly wavier/curlier as I’ve gotten older, and even now I’m still seeing gradual changes.

But because of my health, i'm really bad at maintaining my roots and only manage to redye them maybe 2 or 3 times a year. #tbh I'm just a bit sick of having noticeable roots for 50% of the year since my hair will not stop growing, so I've been thinking of going ginger, since that wouldn't clash as much with my roots as red does.\n\nI doubt I'll go to my natural colour (3rd pic) just because I love having coloured hair too much, but I thought I'd include it for comparison - though I'm not 100% sure that is my natural colour since it has changed since I last had natural hair, so I just tried to colour match based on my roots lol, it might be a bit off. Mostly just wondering if ginger would suit me or if there's another colour that I could try! ",
