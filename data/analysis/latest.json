      "content": "My first ever reddit post is concerning my 4y/o daughter's hair, I would be grateful for any advice! My oldest daughter and I both have straight hair, so I'm a newbie to this curly world. I am asking for tips, because she likes when her hair is curly. 🩷\n\nOur current routine is: \n\nWash at night with a gentle shampoo (usually it's some kid-brand from DM). Spray in detangler, brush through, air-dry. It's usually only damp by the time she goes to bed. In the morning we brush through it again &amp; put it up. When we do this, it still has waves, but the curls aren't there anymore. Since we only wash hair once a week (ish), by the end of the week it's pretty straight. (Reference pic with the pumpkin). If I blow dry her hair it dries very straight and silky smooth.\n\nHowever, I tried to choose pictures that represent how it *can* look, because when she washes in the morning &amp; it air dries it's got a great curl pattern, but only underneath. The top layer is still pretty straight. She loves when it curls like this &amp; wants it more often! The only change to the routine here is that we washed in the AM and didn't brush it when it was wet. \n\nHer hair is a fine texture and is very silky, but she has a lot of it! \n\nAny recommendations for how I can maximize this look for her, on days where she wants it curly? I'm open to trying products, but she's 4, so I'll stick to drug store prices. ;) For reference, we live in Germany. \n\nMany thanks! ",

      "content": "I don’t really know how much  scalp is “acceptable” to show but I try to show as little as possible. The first 3 pictures are what my hair looks like on a good day. I tried showing my bathroom lighting as well as more natural lighting. As you can see it’s very frizzy. I’m told it doesn’t look good/could look better but idk how to style it cause whenever I try to style it like videos on YouTube or try methods I read from the wiki where you just scrunch it then let it air dry or use a diffuser then scrunch it after it just looks like my entire scalp is showing so I might be doing something wrong or using the wrong products. The last 2 pictures are what it looks like when I attempt that. Side note I was thinking of trying texturing powder. Now I think it’s gotta be how I style it cause I think my hair is fine but many people tell me it's thick but I personally think it's due to how much volumizing I do but there is the possibility of me just doing or using something wrong like I said.\n\nRoutine:\nI'll use this routine 6 out of 7 days of the week with the seventh day being my shampoo day and the only significant difference is I use “hask argon oil shampoo” before everything else.\nI use two conditioners I swap between every other day. One I use is “living proof full conditioner” and the other is a protein focused conditioner called “curl smith multitasking 3 in 1 conditioner” and I’ll just rake those in my wet hair. Then like I said I’ll use the living proof one day then the next I’ll use the other instead.\n\nPost shower:\nAfter the shower I’ve tried many things but the most consistent thing I’ve been doing is I’ll use “Kristen ess lightweight leave in conditioner” and use the praying hands method for apply that going mid to ends, then I’ll comb my hair down with an oval brush. Then I use a small amount of “Aussie instant freeze hair gel with jojoba oil and sea kelp” rub that in my hands apply from roots to ends raking in then scrunch my hair at the ends and shake my head up and down gently to make it more natural.\n\nDrying and styling:\nThen I’ll sit and wait for it to be completely dry then scrunch it and my scalp will show really bad especially at the crown and hairline probably because of how short my hair is (due to being in the military I can’t grow it out so growing it more isn’t an option at the moment). After that I’ll use a hair pick to pick at the roots to mid lengths to help separate them and volumize it to make it look like the pictures. I know that this is likely the culprit to my issue but I don’t know how I should style it otherwise as the alternative is I look like I raided a crack shack. \n\nAny recommendations on what I should do differently to avoid showing too much scalp but not creating so much frizz or any products I should try like texturizing powder and if I should replace certain products with ones you recommend?",

      "content": "Hello!\n\nJust noticed that there were not any answered posts about the Dr Dennis Gross daily peels here and since I am an inconsistent user searching for some answers myself, thought I’d share my experience with you girlies 🥹\n\nSo they come in three types - ultra gentle, normal/universal, extra strength. I’ve tried the first two types. Since I have sensitive skin I never thought of trying the extra strong ones. I would suggest to go for the normal one unless you have super sensitive skin (which I do) - then try the ultra gentle ones first.\n\nNow these are a two step routine thingy - steps are basically opening the pack and rubbing the cotton pad soaked in the essence on your face lol. So you wash your face, do first step (exfoliation), after couple of minutes do the second step (anti-ageing) and wait another two minutes before moisturizing.\n\nFirst off, yes, they are expensive. I have only gotten them by paying frens who have visited the States. But the only person I know IRL who uses them regularly is my best fren and she swears by it because she’s a PCOS girlie with angry skin. So I tried them and I am glad I did - even as someone who sucks at consistency, I do really like the effect it has on me even if I can use it for a few weeks on end. You can buy a ziploc pouch, cut each pad in half, and preserve the other half inside the package and ziploc for the next use. Cuz duh they’re expensive. \n\nSecondly, don’t start every day at first. Let your skin get used to it. When I used the orange peel for the first time I overexfoliated like a dumbass. Do it once or twice a week depending on how sensitive your skin is I guess at first. \n\nThird, don’t overdo rest of your actives. The peel pads contain Citric Acid, Lactic Acid, Malic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Retinol, Tocopheryl Acetate etc. Basically retinoids, AHA/BHA are already there in the peels so it might be wise not to use other exfoliants or strong acids in your routine if you’re using this! I didn’t realise this and coupled the peel with a cleanser that had AHA BHA PHA and my skin got so dry 😭\n\nNext - ensure you use sunscreen! I can’t stress this enough. Because you _will_ get sunburnt if you don’t. I made this mistake once inspite of the packaging begging me to use sunscreen. Don’t be like me lol.\n\nLastly - MOISTURISE! The peel uses strong ingredients especially if you have sensitive skin like me so please for the love of god moisturise your skin girlllllll. I use 1.5-2x my usual moisturiser when I use the peel pads. \n\nAnyways, this was not a paid Dennis Gross advert lol. But I will try to be consistent and share the effects of the ultra gentle peel once I’ve used it regularly for like a month or so. This is one of the only products where I’ve felt a difference immediately after using it - almost feels like make up lol. The first set of photos is post using the normal peel and second set is using the ultra gentle peel. The rest of the steps were the same (washing face with a gentle cleanser like cetaphil then peel and then centella toner by skin1004 followed by bioderma sensibio pink moisturiser). Of course the quality of my skin is worse in the second set because the photos are taken months apart xD But I still wanted to share them for reference in case it might help somebody. ",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
