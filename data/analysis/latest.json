I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm 35, with two young kids and have noticed my skin suddenly shift and show more visible signs of aging. Nothing wild, just the usual - fine lines on my forehead and from nose to mouth, crows feet, sagging skin under my eyes. And because of the two young kids I feel and look tired! Possibly slightly puffy under eyes - I think thats making that area look a bit sagging.\n\nI'm a total skincare beginner - every time I start looking into options I get overwhelmed with how many options there are and get paralysed with indecision! My current routine is very simple: oil based cleanser (Aesop Parlsey Seed from a friend), Weleda Skin Food Light and I've started experimenting with The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid after a friend suggested it. I like everything I use but am happy to mix it up and would like to add in something that is more proactive at reducing fine lines/firming plumping under my eyes.im looking for recommendations for a few products and when to use them.\n\nI used to think I had oily skin but years ago I started using Johoba Oil as my main moisturiser and my skin actually totally settled down and balanced. I don't use it now but have a better understanding that my skin doesn't like to be too dry and it overreacts.\n\nI'm in the UK and would prefer products that are relatively affordable and easy to find in the here. And not too many steps or I'll never find time to do it all! I've looked into The Ordinary simply because they have lots of info on their website but don't understand the difference between retinol/growth factors/peptides etc!\n\nOh. And I use sunscreen in the summer but not often in winter/Spring/Autumn. I want to but find it so heavy and greasy and it makes me develop spots. I would love a recommendation for something really light that I could use every day. Maybe something milky in texture if that exists?\n\nAny advice or recommendations are so welcome, I am totally out of my depth!",

I’m thinking of switching to Minimalist 16% Vitamin C (E &amp; Ferulic) since it’s about half the price of Agelite‑X. \n\nAlso I’ve also seen a lot of good reviews about Melano CC (though it seems pricey), but recommendations on that too would be great.\n\nWhat I am asking is it worth switching to Minimalist 16%?

Especially in the winter. My smile lines get a little flakey too. My pores are massive all over my face. It is like my nose pores refill every night with new nasty no matter what I do. I have had chin, jaw line, lower cheek, and some neck acne my whole life (I'm 29). \n\nI currently use a gentle moisturizing face wash for sensitive skin with a wash cloth, thyers rose water toner, and good molecules overnight serum all in the morning. I know it says overnight, but for some reason I'm getting better results when I use it during the day and night every day even though it says once every three days, and I feel like I'm probably using a lot. It doesn't help with acne at all otherwise and it hasn't been making the dry skin any worse than it already is. I just started putting a thin layer of aquaphor by the corners of my nostrils and down my smile lines to help with the dry skin that turns into scabs when I inevitably pick at it because it looks like I have dried snot around my nose all the time and I can't stand it. The overnight serum and the aquaphor has helped with the painful, red, flakey acne skin around the corners of my nose and smile lines, but not entirely. Nothing gets rid of the stubborn black heads from my nose all the way down my chin and what isn't a blackhead is a bump under the skin that won't pop or go away. \n\nI have pretty deep forehead wrinkles for my age, but every lotion/sunscreen I try makes me more oily and break out more. I've given up on lotion/sunscreen at this point but I know I need it. My forehead/wrinkles are like if someone filled the grand canyon with oil. I keep googling and getting results for products I can't afford. I need walmart chic lol. Does anyone have any recommendations? I'm hoping for no more than 3 or 4 products at $5 to $10 each if possible",

But I would live to hear all of recommendations. \n\nI am very new to curly hair, ive only started to wear my hair curly this year. I have been using Kerastas Genesis (the dry hair version it is in pink bottle), and ravines oi conditioner. I have used Davies oi shampoo as well which was good but I feel like weighed my hair down a lot. \n\nI have a dry scalp, I wash my hair once a week bc It really doesn't get oily but I also have some flakes which im trying to figure out whats causing that. Anyways, I need to get new shampoo and conditioner and I wanted to ask recommendations because my hair is thin but doesn't get oily. and I dont do a curl routine because its very defined anyways usually, I just oil it everyday and spray it with water if I want it to be less frizzy or more  defined. (I am scared of hairloss which had been an issue for a while). I think I have 3B ? type of hair, I dont mind not having tight curls haha. I would love to get recommendations! ive tried my sisters amika hydro rush shampoo and it was  good! idk if it was the best tho tbh. ",

I think I need to take care of it differently\n\nthe current routine:\n\n\\- vichy dercos sensitive shampoo\n\n\\- the ordinary behentrionium chloride 2% conditioner\n\n\\- harologi rebuild spray, every third wash for 5 min\n\n\\- hask curl defining cream, scrunched in\n\n\\- air dry or dry with diffuser\n\nthe pictures have been taken on wash day after diffuser drying and brushing once completely dry\n\nI suspect that this routine is drying out my hair a bit too much and I think the curl cream is too heavy. I‘m not sure whether the uneven curl pattern is due to my products not being ideal (the top layer is quite dry) or if that‘s just naturally what my hair does now\n\nI‘d like to try new products and techniques but am having a hard time navigating the sea of options. Any advice I can start researching from is appreciated :) I kind of don‘t know where to begin, that curl cream belonged to my ex and I just stuck with it lol\n\nalso… please be very honest, I feel like the back of my hair looks tragic ;-; do you think I should cut it shorter? I love the way it curls in the front at this lenght but whenever I see a picture of me at a slight angle or from the back I feel pain\n\nthank you!",

I don't use it all that often compared to my days in high school of the frequent full face of makeup that I'd bare to the world. Due to health issues, I had tossed everything I had previously owned ranging from contour palettes​, eyeshadow palettes​, brushes, foundation, concealer, blushes, highlighters, etc. ​ I own an Urban Decay Naked Your Way mini palette, mini Better than Sex mascara, and a Stila Stay All Day eyeliner. Starting with what I have, and having been out of the makeup scene for years, what are some recommended makeup items to add to my collection?",

Almost everything I use regularly at home, and the travel sizes are stuff I've used fine at home and at my daughter's house. \n\nIs the water in the hotel too hard or soft?\n\nThis was my second wash at this hotel. First was fine, not exceptional, but fine. Second wash, hair washed fine, suds were normal. \n\nThe InnerSense Conditioner is amazing, normally, but this time my hair tangled badly, and the wet frizz was off the charts when I rinsed it out. Usually, I have soft seaweed hair after rinsing. Not this time. So, I put extra EcoSlay cream (normally use AG beach bomb sparingly at home), and it felt sticky, so I added more water, and \"squish to condish\" without improvement. \n\nI loaded up my hair with InnerSense I Create volume, that I normally I use for slip while brushing, and it was better, but my hair felt WEIRD. \n\nSo, second wash I left the gel off. Tried a little InnerSense I Create Lift foam to help with definition. Diffused, and I guess it'll stay in a pineapple until I go home. \n\nRoutine (travel kit)\n1. Ouidad Anti-frizz shampoo (I always use)\n2. InnerSense Conditioner (I always use)\n2a. BounceCurl detangler brush (I always use)\n3. EcoSlay Orange Marmalade cream - travel size pump\n4.

I’m verging on 25 now and I’ve accepted the part and middle part is just how I’ve been doing my hair to make it look more natural. I have an in between of wavy/curlish hair. Usually a starts as straight and ends are 2c verging on 3a. As you can see one side goes up and then the opposite side is completely flat? Most days, I’ll put some pics of my hair on a good day that I would try to aim for. The part just seems to keep getting more obvious as I get older. I use olaplex shampoo and conditioner with ouai anti-frizz, which seems to work good for my hair type, but have a very itchy and flakey scalp that it hasn’t helped for on top of the part that I’m becoming increasingly insecure about. I have attached pics and if there’s anything that would help or ways to take care of these things that I don’t know about, let me know and it would be greatly appreciated! Constructive criticism welcome, but please don’t berate me, I’ve never been taught hair care and am asking for advice! \n\nI do have a Harry Potter scar on my forehead, yes 😂 ",
