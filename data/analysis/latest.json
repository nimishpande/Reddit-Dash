      "content": "I have always been afraid of expressing myself as my mom and uncles used to tease me for how my hair curled and I became embarrased by it (it was just teasing but I took it to heart because I THOUGHT curls were \"feminine\" and I wanted to be a big strong man in a rural area. I know curls aren't a feminine thing btw) anyway my friend encouraged me to grow my hair out at the beginning of 2024 and I'm so grateful. People always compliment my hair, and I hate that it took me so long to embrace a part of me. The last photo is from May of this year when I had a different method so you can see the difference. Thank you to everyone who commented on my last curly hair post and gave me tips!! Have a great holiday season everyone 💖\n\nProducts listed at bottom.\nRoutine:\nI wash my hair two times a week. For one wash just shampoo and conditioner.\nOnce a week: wash with clarifying shampoo, then shampoo, then conditioner then conditioning treatment\nWith still dripping wet hair, apply curl creme then scrunch, then apply mousse and scrunch thoroughly, then gel and scrunch.\nDiffuse hair. Scrunch out crunch or use hair oil\n\n\nShampoo: not your mother's curl defining shampoo\nConditioner: not your mother's curl defining conditioner\nDeep conditioning treatment: Mielle Organics Babassu Oil and Mint Deep Conditioner (5-15 minutes) rinse out\nCurl creme: Briogeo Curl Charisma Rice Amino + Avocado Leave–In Defining Cream\nMousse:Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Activating Mousse\nCurl Gel: Briogeo Curl Charisma Rice Amino + Quinoa Frizz Control Gel\nOil: Oaui hair oil\n I wear a satin bonnet to bed every night, and use satin pillowcases and do not do a refresh routine.

I just passed 100 days of treatment using topical minoxidil and finasteride. I dilute hims topical spray and apply with a syringe on my scalp. I would say my results are very good so far but I’m still struggling with very thin hair. The last photo is my hair when it’s long and it looks horrible, I had to chop off most of my hair so it appears more dense. I know my hair will never be the same pre transition but is it still possible to regain the thickness back in the individual hairs? The first 3-4 inches are normal thickness but once it grows longer the ends become very thin and brittle. I know I need more time to see maximum results so just looking to hear other experiences. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone, after trying so many things to help clear my face with no effect, I turn to the wisdom of the crowd. Thank you in advance!\n\nI'm 43, male, with a spotty history of acne: moderate acne as a teenager and young adult that didn't respond to OTC or most antibiotics anda year of accutane about 20 years ago helped me stay mostly clear until 2023. Derm. tried a few antibiotics in a row, including Cipro, with no improvement. A swab in 2024 indicated gram negative bacteria (serratia marcescens), so I went on accutane again — 80mg for the first 6mos then 100mg for 8mos. It helped a little, but didn't solve my skin, and being on it for so long at so high a dose seemed problematic so we stopped last May. About that time my cheeks and scalp (I'm bald) flared up like crazy and I had dozens of tiny CCs on my forehead. Swabs indicated staphylococcus aureus and lugdunensis. Short bursts of cephamlexin, clindamycin, cefadroxil, and ivermectin didn't do much. Nor did bleach baths 3x a week or washing with Hibiclens in the shower. Azithromycin seemed to help for 3–4 weeks but the lesions returned.\n\nA swab in early September found no bacteria or fungus, but by that time I was desperate so I started washing with Nizoral. It seemed to help a little and my scalp mostly returned to normal, so I was prescribed 2% ketoconazole. I also purchased the starter pack from Malezia. Conditions improved slightly, but not meaningfully. Seeing breakouts every 2–3 weeks, I thought it might be demodex I started washing with a sulfur bar in October along with an azelaic acid serum under the moisturizer and I had a month of the best skin in months until it backslid in late November.\n\nNow I'm back to 5–8 pustules popping up mostly on my cheeks each day. Nearly 100% are in a hair follicle, and numerous follicles that don't have visible pus are clearly inflamed. Derm. prescribed 20mg of doxy 2x day two weeks ago.\n\nMy cleaning routine was historically been pretty basic: cetaphil morning and night, with a hyluronic serum, retinol serum, and moisturizer, but I stripped all that away earlier this year to try and figure out what is triggering these breakouts. Right now I'm using what worked best in October: sulfur bar and Sebamed, with Paula's Choice azaleic serum in the morning and Malezia 2.5% benzoyl peroxide in the evening.\n\nLastly, my diet is primarily protein, veg, and fruit with some carbs. I change towels and sheets every two days, try to not touch my face, stay healthy, etc. — the same stuff they tell anyone experiencing acne symptoms.\n\nSorry for the Russian novel-length read, but I feel like I've tried everything, my confidence is crushed, and I don't know what to do next. The leave-on hibiclens regimen? More AHA/BHA? Less? Strip away all products and just moisturize like crazy? Move to a cave? The Derm's response is to wait 6 weeks to see if the doxy helps balance things out, but I don't know if I have that in me.",

Nutrition/supplement wise i take beef liver and methyfolate daily and avoid processed sugars, gluten and dairy. This seemingly helped some inflammation in the warmer months.\n\nThe other thing that was helpful for a time was... get this... I stopped washing it! Physical exfoliating scrub once every other day and then a natural organic plant based balm twice a day. That was it and it was working. Until winter hit and my skin is screaming profanities while simultaneously giving me the middle finger. This is my forehead currently. I can not in any combination figure out a moisturizer that actually moistures and routine that hydrates my skin. Ive tried LRP cicafalate, LRP lipikar and daily moisturizer, cerave night cream, round lab, snail mucin, oils, HA, avene mineral spray, more not mentioned. I recently added a humidifier. I just cant do this anymore, derms just want to put me on Accutane and im currently paused on my tret because my skin is, im learning, very reactive and dry. Also have had patches of eczema since pregnancy. So im sending this out in to the universe hoping, praying, some skin gurus will be able to help me.\n\nThe rest of my skin is scarred, cratered and covered in post inflammation hyperpigmentation marks. The cysts and hormonal acne along my jaw line has resolved since the diet changes and supplements but my barrier is f\\*d. My texture is horrible, fine lines, for a time putting anything on my skin would burn even things approved for literal chemo patients. Like wtf is wrong with me. How do I add hydration to my skin in the winter without making it react, even my tone and smooth texture. I will take all the advice &lt;3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m967zwrin98g1.jpg?width=1017&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a61f16551f01af2e6ec21e3de153e4d769b78b15\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hcfrbzgis98g1.jpg?width=3216&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=512d478d2b6b8374d81f67a30dffd2b245dd46da\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6pa7lzgis98g1.jpg?width=1488&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e532fca2d97c0112c5fdf70eef4c78461b5fd83\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d8w5u5his98g1.jpg?width=1488&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df706977716788bc719dab8b21b42a59a3b0f3b6",

I’m addressing the source now, and it should be improving eventually, but I’m having a really hard time not hating my hair. I miss my old hair. It defined easily with minimal product and effort and pretty much always looked good. Now I put in 3x the effort for 1/3 of the results, and they’re inconsistent too. I don’t know how to have anything but resentment towards my hair for reflecting health issues that could’ve been caught earlier if healthcare professionals bothered to check anything. It’s also been falling out since February and isn’t stopping. I rarely like how my hair looks now, and I don’t know what to do about it. It is not a length thing, as my hair was starting to loosen up when it was still shorter too. I’ll list my routine, so really anything helps. Maybe from people who have my current hair type? I haven’t felt compelled to give up on caring for my hair in a long time, but this has definitely taken me there. \n\nHair type now: wavy, coarse, medium density \nHair type before: curly, coarse, high density \n\nCurrent routine: Innersense clarity hair bath and hydrating cream conditioner. Styler is usually 1 lightweight foam and 1 gel,  ex. the tgin miracle foam + innersense I create curl memory. Usually brush styled with a denman or bounce curl definition brush, scrunched, diffused.

      "content": "I see so much negativity about DUT. I had a hair transplant in 2019, and it fixed what I wanted it to at the time, but I was still diffusely thinned. I had never even heard about finasteride until the surgeon told me to get on it immediately, and ideally delay the surgery. I declined delaying it as I had travelled to Turkey. However, I got on it as soon as I got home. \n\nAfter going on fin for 3 to 4 months, I realised my hair was no longer brittle. My hair grew back nicely in the transplant area and all my hair felt less brittle. In 2023, I was happy and added oral minoxidil to the mix. I definitely felt some more thickness after the first shed, but not as much as I had hoped for.\n\nAbout 5 months ago, I added dutasteride to the mix three times a week, still taking the full dose of fin to try and avoid a shed. I am not quite sure why, but adding this has had an absolutely insane effect on my hair. I am in my 40s and have been thinning since I was 17. I would say my hair is now thicker than when I was 18. Loads of small hairs.\n\nAt the barbers today, I looked in the mirror and with my wet hair I could not see any scalp. I honestly cannot remember the last time I saw that. I have come home and shone my phone light on my scalp looking in the mirror and there are so many new short hairs with fresh regrowth. I was planning to ditch fin after six months, but I might just keep this stack now as it is working so well.\n\nI just wanted to give a perspective from someone who has taken fin and min for a long time, and the thing that worked the most in the mix several years later has been Dutasteride.\n",

I can’t figure out how to get volume in my roots without my hair looking super greasy, like when I try use a gel or mousse. My current routine is double shampoo (Aussie miracle moist), condition (Aussie miracle moist) and a leave in conditioner (Aussie leave in curl mask). Then I diffuse it. I’ve experimented with some mousses but they make my hair look super greasy! Any general curl advice is appreciated, as well as stuff that relates to my question!

Any recommendations?\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone with similar skin type 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

He has enlarged pores and has acne where his hardhat sits and on his body. His skin seems to be combination, more oily in the T-zone and cheeks (also where he gets enlarged pores) and dryer around (but this is likely due to the harsh winter we are experiencing).\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for a routine to deal with pores, acne, and oily skin? What are some trust worthy products that can help him with both face and body? Also, any good recommendations for the winter months when it comes to moisturizer would be great.\n\nI’m planning to get him some of this stuff to help him on his journey towards healthy skin.

      "content": "I decided to come here because I've been growing my hair out for about 2 years now with 2 or 3 cuts in the interim and finally got it to a length I'm liking. But my hair is so coarse, dry, and here it looks floofy because I left it in a ponytail overnight. If I don't do that, it's incredibly flat and dull. This is especially challenging because before I started medically transitioning almost 2 years ago, my hair was incredibly oily and had to be washed daily, so this is new to me.\n\nMy routine lately has been this: wash with Monday moisture shampoo once a week followed by deep condition with a Shea Moisture masque sample pack I got (Jamaican black castor oil strengthen &amp; restore), then condition with Monday conditioner every day following. I often use ion leave-in conditioner and a few spritzes of an ogx biotin &amp; collagen oil mist but it just makes my hair shiny. Sometimes when I'm getting dressed up for a night out I'll use Not Your Mother's curl mousse.\n\nAnd lastly, I stopped blow drying it because it destroys what curls I do have and flattens my hair out so I just let it air dry. I find better results when I put my hair in a ponytail while it's still wet, usually turns out looking decent after that. But after a few hours it just looks lifeless again. I also wish there were a way to help my curves thrive on the top of my head but I think the weight just pulls the hair down?\n\nI've been broke for a while but now have a good job so planning to try to find a salon next month but anything I can do between now and then would be a lifesaver. Thank y'all 🙏",
