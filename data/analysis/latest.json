      "content": "Hey so I’ve had curly hair all my life and last year have decided to start wearing it curly. I particularly like to finger coil my hair because it helps train it to have a tighter curl pattern and I just like the way the ringlets look. That being said when I finger coil, the mids and ends come out exactly as I want but the roots don’t hold the curl. Is there a way that I can have that ringlet curl in those areas too? I Please help!!! Routine I do for my hair as follows:\n\nCake beauty curl cream\nNot your mothers mousse\nWatered down/ pea size amount got2b gel per section (sometimes I mix or use not your mothers gel)\n\nDiffuse for 20 mins upside down with hair resting on a towel to form the ringlets \n\nThanks!!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I don't know what to do to make it better. I've looked up makeup plots and how to make facial features look more masculine, but it always turns out I'm looking like drag or barely noticeable.\n\nIn the first picture is my most recent attempt using a contour/concealer stick (palladio cinnamon) where I feel it's too soft/not very noticable. The next set is me using eyeshadow (LA colors cool) The final set I feel looks good, it was done by a drag king though a few years ago, and I've been trying to replicate it.\n\nSo anyone have any tips or suggestions so it doesn't look like drag but isn't light enough so it's not noticable?

Their website doesn’t disclose cost per unit.\n\nWhen I went In the injector recommended the following\n\n-15 units between my eyebrows -8 units in my forehead -8 units in each crows feet\n\n$12/ unit putting me at a whopping $468.\n\nI told her I was surprised by the price and that I had budgeted for $350. And I was confused about why she wanted to do my crowsfeet\n\nShe told me that it was going to be really difficult to give me a good treatment at that price and she seemed annoyed. She explained that she wanted to treat my crows feet to make sure that I looked balanced as she specializes in facial balancing.\n\nI left because I felt awkward and told her I wanted to think about it\n\nI have a follow up scheduled on Monday, either I go in and my $75 that I paid for my consult goes towards my treatment or I lose the money\n\nI’ve heard about people experiencing weird side effects or dimpling if they aren’t injected in all of the right areas.

The curls in the first photo is from September this year so about 3 months ago, and the second photo I took at the beginning of this month. I’m extremely upset with the way my curls have been looking. I know that the longer your hair gets, the more the curl pattern stretches out. However, I don’t understand how so much can change in such little time. In the second photo the shape is off and my curls are really..thin? I’m not sure how to describe it. I’m noticing some pieces start really thick and then towards the bottom it really thins out. I’m not sure if this is breakage? I haven’t really done anything different so I don’t understand why this could be happening. I shampoo and condition once a week, I sleep with a silk bonnet, I detangle my hair with a detangling brush and lots of conditioner, I don’t use any heat besides diffusing, ect. I have always had the same routine and it has always worked for me. I just don’t understand why suddenly my hair appears so damaged. After my curly cut I wasn’t getting regular trims because my hair seemed to be growing healthy and I didn’t feel the need so I don’t know if that could be the reason? Now I’m thinking about doing a big chop but I’m not sure if there are anyways I can save my curls?",

Now I really want to build a proper routine and stick to it.\n\nMy main goals are:\n\n\t•\treducing dark circles under my eyes\n\n\t•\timproving skin texture (I have small bumps on my forehead that look bad under makeup)\n\n\t•\tmaking my skin look healthier and more glowy overall ✨\n\nI’d love recommendations for:\n\n\t•\ta good gentle cleanser for daily use\n\n\t•\tan oil cleanser for removing makeup in the evening (double cleansing)\n\n\t•\ta toner that’s good for normal skin\n\n\t•\ta moisturizer that keeps skin hydrated and smooth\n\n\t•\tsomething to help with dark circles under the eyes\n\nBasically, I’m looking for a full beginner-friendly routine — AM + PM — that’s not too complicated, doesn’t irritate my skin, and is easy to stick to.\n\nI don’t currently use any actives regularly, so I’d prefer something beginner-friendly and not too harsh.

My hair before coming in wasn’t too far off from the inspo pic just no highlights and more of a chocolate brown color. When she first did my highlights my hair ended up being just an orange blonde. I was kinda ready to leave by that point so I asked if we could just put a chocolate brown color over it and call it a day. She ended up putting a super dark ashy black toner on my hair, I told her that was way too black and she rolled her eyes and said she would lift it. After lifting it she didn’t apply any toner just started to blow dry it and asked if I was fine with it. My hair was straight up orange at that point and I asked if there wasn’t a brown she could use and she got angry and stormed off to mix the toner, at this point I’m crying and can’t even look in the mirror and she then began roughly applying the toner, tugging on my hair, slamming the products down, and barley rinsed it out, I asked her if she was going to blow dry it so I could be sure it looked fine and she said nope you’re done and charged me $200 even though it was originally $120 and kicked me out with soaking wet hair in the cold. I can’t call my salon until Monday since they’re closed but am I in the right to ask for a refund? I had to go to Sally’s right after and buy my own toner which I’m scared to use after all the toning and lifting done today. I purchased the ion Demi permanent medium neutral brown toner is it possible to fix this before i go on vacation Monday :/ ",

I've never posted something like this and am unsure. Last pic is from earlier in the year, and first 3 are from today.\n\nI'm looking for advice and feedback to improve the appearance and styling of my hair.  I always treated my hair like straight hair, using sulfates &amp; silicones and all that.  Recently I started the beginner routine from the wiki here, co-washing then conditioning with Garnier fructis pure clean conditioner.  After showering I put some curl talk brand \"activating mousse\" in and \"plop\" my hair up in a t shirt for about 10 minutes, then take it out and let it air dry from there. I don't understand \"scrunch out the crunch\" or maybe I'm using too much mousse?? My hair takes a long time to dry and it still often looks kinda wet even once it is dry.\n\nWould love feedback and advice, and open to new styling advice (but looking to keep the length).\n\nMy hair is fine but dense I think, if that makes sense.  I still don't understand porosity.\n\nThanks for your patience and help :)",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI had an accident about 10 years ago when I was a kid. As you can see the skin repaired but now that leg is discoloured/hyper pigmented in comparison. For those wondering never did anything about it because I was 1 young when it happened so I didn’t have a say, 2 it wasn’t something I really thought about later on nor I had the knowledge or money to research any possible treatments to better the appearance.\n\nNow that I am a bit older I have been wondering if there is any options out there to help me? I looked into micro peeling and I’m considering going for a consultation. I would like to say that I’m happy with my body (duh) but sometimes I overthink and makes me feel insecure. I don’t wear short stuff nor show my leg at all.\n\nI have not met many people that have had hot water accidents (2nd burn degree burns to be specific) or specially of darker skin that have left a noticiable scar. Happy to listen to any advice in order to brighten the area as much as possible.\n\nI know that it might not all go away but maybe just a bit. And if it is impossible happy to come to terms with it too! I’ll be reading.\n\nPlease be kind, and thanks in advance!",
