If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

What I’m unsure about is what’s actually recommended from a skin-barrier perspective when I shower again.\n\nIs it better to fully wash off all previously applied lotion each time, or is it okay to leave some residue on and only cleanse areas that need it (underarms, groin, etc.)?\n\nSince most lotions contain occlusives, humectants, and barrier-supporting ingredients, I’m wondering whether repeatedly removing them with surfactants is counterproductive for dry skin - or if leaving residue could increase the risk of buildup or body acne.\n\nCurious what’s actually better for skin health and what most people do.

      "content": "I’m 21 turning 22 later this year, and I’ve been wanting to start getting more into skin care. I don’t know if I have any specific issues, but i do have really sensitive skin and eczema (usually induced by stress or during colder months). (I also have a mass cell activation disorder, which means that my skin is just a little weird sometimes when it comes to products) so all this has led to me never really branching out and trying a skin care routine for most of my life\n\nMy current skin care routine is just to take off my makeup with a oil-based make up remover like micellar water, cleanse my face with the hydrating cereVe cleanser every night (and occasionally a few times a week with the salicylic acid cleanser as well), I then use the Bioma milky toner, and vanicream.  I currently don’t do skin care in the mornings. I know I really should but I’m a chronic over sleeper so I never have time. The only thing I use in the mornings is a hypochlorous acid spray before doing my makeup\n\nI’d say I have combination skin. There are parts of my face that are really dry and parts that are really oily. I don’t know what issues I have or I don’t know the names of them. I have occasional breakouts when it comes to hormones and they’re all usually located on my forehead or occasionally on the lower part of my cheeks. I have some acne scars. I’d say I probably have an uneven skin tone. I get a lot of sort of dry and rough, bumpy patches around my lips on my chin and around my nose. I don’t know what that is but it’s not like flaky just kinda dry. I also have pretty dark circles all I wouldn’t really call them puffy. Most of my acne is focused on my back, unfortunately which I don’t really know what I can do about that.\n\nI’m looking for a serum or something that can be used to help either even out my skin tone, or even on my skin texture since I feel like some parts of my face are really rough and some are really soft, same with parts of my face that feel really oily.\n\nI’m Looking for any products that might be good I’m really such a novice here. I don’t know anything about skin barrier or anything like that. I don’t know if I should start using retinol or if I’m too young for that. I realize I’m not giving people a lot to work on, but I was just wondering if anybody might have some suggestions. \n\nTLDR- what are your holy Grail serums or skin care products that can be used for general help with more than one thing in our sensitive skin friendly?\n\n\n(also no snail mucin I’m allergic to shellfish so I probably won’t tolerate it well)",

      "content": "Pics 1 &amp; 2 are my current hair\nPic 3 is a photoshopped dark, cool espresso brown \nPics 4 &amp; 5 are my recent pinks\nPic 6 was a thought I had—maybe some brown and pink mix like an ombre or brown with pink highlights—but instead I’ve been sticking to grown-out roots with blonde ends. It’s a way to give my hair a bleach break, let it grow, and get it healthier.\n\nFor the past seven-ish years, I’ve had everything from super short hair to shoulder-length, mostly in pink. Sometimes blonde, sometimes pink with hints of blue or purple—but I always came back to pink.\n\nI’ve often debated growing my hair out, but I usually kept it short because I liked it, and I stuck with pink because I was drawn to it and thought it looked good on me.\n\nStill, part of me wondered about trying brown—or just keeping it blonde. But brown? I’d think, no way, that looks bad on me. At least blonde is safe if I’m not going pink. (It's odd pink is my safe space and in reality brown should be haha) \n\nSo I added a dark brown blend at my roots to make the grow-out and blonde ends look less harsh.\n\nNow I find myself questioning the brown… while also missing pink 😔. Will I always wonder until I try it? I think I might like it—but I’m also worried I won’t, and then I’d have to bleach it out, which I’m trying to avoid while getting my hair healthier.\n\nSo here I am, debating: go for the dark espresso brown like pic 3, or stick with my safe pink that I’ve always loved? What do you think?\n\nAnyway thank you for any help (: ",

      "content": "hi everyone! i’m seeking some advice on my curly/wavy hair. i have normal porosity hair (a tad bit on the low porosity side) and medium texture. i live in a super humid area, which leads to a lot of frizz, but i’ve usually been able to keep it in control. right now, i use Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Conditioner and Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Activating Mousse. i apply this to my hair in sections, then use a denman brush and let it air dry. this hair routine was great for me for a while and left my hair looking like the first picture.\n\n\n\nrecently, my hair has been so undefined and frizzy (like in the second picture), even though i haven’t changed my routine. i assumed it was because of product buildup, so i started to use Suave Daily Clarifying Fresh Cleansing Shampoo, and it helped, but there’s definitely still buildup there. \n\n\n\ni also use coconut oil in my hair twice a week. the night before i wash it, i apply the oil and wash it out in the morning. then the day after i wash it, i apply Mielle Rosemary Mint Oil. i’ve been using these oils for over two years, so i don’t think the problem is from these products. i don’t use a bonnet at night, but i do sleep with a silk pillowcase.\n\n\n\ndoes anyone know what to do to fix this?😭 i hate having insanely frizzy, undefined hair all the time. thank y'all!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8mlxjpodvag1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f81f2c297ca71fad57395fe82f2c8160d2b52cc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4c2qipodvag1.jpg?width=739&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebaa3c8f0eb48bd1bbb2680299d1be1f8642c624\n\n",
