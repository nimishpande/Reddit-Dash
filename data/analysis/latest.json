The key with looking your best is always to take a step back and look at the whole picture.

      "content": "So… I’ve been scraping and aggregating user experiences from hair loss subs and forums, mostly to see what patterns show up when you look at hundreds of reports.\n\nSome of this lines up with what everyone already says. Some of it honestly surprised me, especially timelines and side effect frequencies.\n\n**Stuff that, umm, actually seems to work:**\n\nFinasteride (oral) + minoxidil is still the base for most people. When I looked at long-term success stories (like 5–20+ years), this combo is everywhere. A lot of people just maintain. Some even say hair quality got darker or thicker over time.\n\nRU58841 shows up a lot in aggressive stacks and usually with good stabilization. That said… the vehicle debate is real. PG versions seem to cause way more irritation and nonstop shedding for some people. Glycerin seems gentler but maybe worse absorption. Kind of a tradeoff.\n\nMicroneedling at \\~1.5mm weekly is almost universal in regrowth stacks that actually worked. The “it helps topicals absorb better” thing seems legit when you zoom out.\n\nOral minoxidil gets called a game changer constantly. But yeah, the early shedding freaks people out. Around 1–1.5 months a lot of users see nothing or worse and quit. People who stick it out usually see results around months 4–6.\n\nDutasteride is very much the nuclear option when fin isn’t enough. Switching often causes a shed first, then big improvement later. Also weirdly common to see people say their DHT stayed high despite being on it.\n\nLLLT laser caps show up in long, multi-year protocols. People feel good about them… but constantly debate whether the price is worth whatever they’re actually contributing.\n\n**Side effects that don’t get talked about much individually, but show up at scale:**\n\nFin sexual sides. Yeah, controversial. Aggregated, around \\~2–3% report persistent issues. Plenty of people run it for years with zero sides. Both things are clearly happening.\n\nOral minoxidil systemic concerns. Tons of people love it, but there’s always background anxiety about heart or BP stuff, even when users personally feel fine.\n\nRU58841 is not forgiving. Miss doses or stop and some people report rapid loss. This isn’t like fin where you can be casual.\n\n**Stuff that surprised me:**\n\nThe pumpkin / flax / sesame seed “natural DHT blocker” thing. Evidence is weak, community is skeptical… but one anecdote reported insanely low daily shedding and visible improvement. Worth a mention, not a recommendation.\n\nFluridil seems kind of underused. Shows up as a low-risk, entry-level topical anti-androgen with stabilization over \\~3–6 months.\n\nIntermittent fasting potentially triggering hair loss. Some studies suggest it may suppress follicle regeneration, and that actually lines up with anecdotes. Which is… not what you’d expect.\n\n**Quick reality check:**\n\nDoes this match what you’ve seen?  \nAm I missing anything big?  \nDo these timelines sound right?\n\nI’m doing this because hair loss marketing is pretty predatory, and clinical data is limited and sanitized. Aggregated real experiences are messy and biased, but maybe still useful.\n\nI’ve turned this into a [dataset](https://modernrelay.com/davidjohn10/hair-loss-insights), but wanted community feedback before sharing it more widely.\n\nAnyway… what am I missing?",

Burns, cuts, pimples—you name it. It works quickly and soothes the skin really well. Apparently, it can also be consumed for digestive or internal issues, but I haven’t personally tried that.\n\n2.\tBoronil – Super effective for dry or irritated skin. I like to keep it on hand; it’s like an Ayurvedic moisturizer with healing properties. I use it for face lips and hands.\n\n3.\tTup Anjan (ghee-based eye balm) – This one’s underrated! I use it for dry or tired eyes, and surprisingly, it helps me sleep better too.\n\nWould love to hear if others have discovered lesser-known Ayurvedic or traditional remedies that actually work for everyday use. What are your must-haves?",

I started seeing a dermatologist at 18, and while the acne has mostly been controlled, the pigmentation has never truly improved.\n\nWhat treatments I’ve tried\n\n\t•\tTopical creams prescribed by my dermatologist\n\n\t•\tChemical peels — they temporarily even out my skin for about 1–2 weeks, but the pigmentation always comes back\n\n\t•\tI’ve been prescribed Golite cream multiple times, but I honestly don’t see any noticeable improvement\n\nMy current routine (derm-prescribed)\n\n\t•\tAcne Moist moisturizer\n\n\t•\tGolite cream\n\n\t•\tEye cream for dark circles\n\nCurrent concerns\n\n\t•\tVery dull, oily skin (no glow or freshness)\n\n\t•\tDark circles (I know poor sleep contributes)\n\n\t•\tSignificant pigmentation, especially:\n\n\t•\tNeck (I was born with torticollis, which may have contributed)\n\n\t•\tFace (uneven pigmentation)\n\n\t•\tUnderarms\n\n\t•\tOverall tanning on my body\n\n\t•\tMy face looks aged and tired for my age\n\nSunscreen issues (major problem)\n\nAlmost every sunscreen I try pills or leaves a heavy white cast:\n\n\t•\tAcne UV — terrible white cast\n\n\t•\tAcne Wash sunscreen — same issue\n\n\t•\tMinimalist sunscreen — feels weird on my skin and doesn’t fully absorb\n\nBecause of this, I end up using far less than the recommended amount, which I know defeats the purpose.\n\nEven with moisturizer, my skin still looks flat, lifeless, and dull, not healthy or youthful.\n\nMy questions\n\n\t•\tIs repeated chemical peeling really the best approach for long-term pigmentation?\n\n\t•\tWhy might Golite not be working, even after consistent use?\n\n\t•\tWhat kind of treatment or routine actually helps with:\n\n\t•\tChronic pigmentation\n\n\t•\tDull, oily skin\n\n\t•\tEarly signs of aging\n\n\t•\tHow do I fix sunscreen pilling and absorption on oily skin?\n\n\t•\tShould I consider changing dermatologists or asking for different treatment options?\n\nI’m feeling quite stuck because I’ve been consistent and patient, but I don’t see real progress. I just want my skin to look healthy, fresh, and age-appropriate again.\n\nAny advice, experiences, or product/treatment suggestions would be really helpful.\n\nThank you in advance 🤍",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

La Roche-Posay Cicablast Baume B5+**\n\n**10/10 HG**\n\nI’ve been getting this product (incidentally, through a friend of my husband’s) for over a year now because I have very dry eczema prone skin. And I love this shit. my biggest gripe is that i run out of it so soon. It’s a thick THICK occlusive cream which I apply as the last step in my PM routine and wake up with “healthy” feeling skin.\n\n**2. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume**\n\n**8/10 Will always RP**\n\nThis one feels a lot more hydrating than LRP if that makes sense? So typically I use this in the mornings when I am not layering too many products and I need the same moisturiser to hydrate and seal\n\n**3. Skin1004 Centella Light Cleansing Oil**\n\n**8/10 Will always RP**\n\nSo I use this because my absolute holy grail Softymo Speedy is very hard to source in India. This one is lightweight though and smells really really good \n\n**4. numbuzin no. 2 protein creamy serum**\n\n**9/10 WRP**\n\nI am fairly new to this. But the texture of this has to be the best I have ever used and I have used a ton of milky toners. It’s actually thicker than milky toners/ usual serums, almost a body lotion texture if you will.  Thats why I love it so much for my DRY dry skin\n\nI am just not very sure if I absolutely need this in my routine given that I already use so many other barrier repair products all the time. But most likely will repurchase just to have it handy for extra dry days. \n\n**5. Skin1004 Centella Sunstick**\n\n**9/10 Will always RP**\n\nHeadsup: I don’t use it over makeup. I just reapply through the day when i am not wearing makeup using this because it feels like nothing on your skin. not sticky not heavy. Love it for that reason \n\nCiao✨",

I also need length to curl. When my hair is shoulder length, I don’t get ringlets. \n\nAlso, what’s my hair type? I think it goes from 2B-2C-3A as it gets longer. \n\nRoutine\n\n1. Shampoo: I’ll often use V05 to clarify and Pantene for regular shampoo. I’m currently using Not Your Mothers. I always shampoo twice. \n\n2. Conditioner: Usually Pantene but I’m currently using Not Your Mothers. Brush hair in shower. \n\n3. Styling: Add a small amount of Hask hair cream. Brush through. Add a ton of gel (LA looks, got2b ultra glued, or Rizzo’s Strong Hold - I value definition over volume) \n\n4. Use a knock-off bounce curl brush to style in sections then diffuse to around 70% dry. \n\n5. I wear a lot pony tail to sleep. I don’t bother refreshing my hair because I wear my hair in a bun for work everyday. I wash 1-2x a week. ",

In the am, I’ve moved my vitamin c right after I wash my face and giving it a few minutes before my toners and other serums. Should I do the same with my retinol at night despite it being a creamier texture?

Its current placement in my routine is right before my moisturizer after everything else. Any advice or help?",

From the derm, more doxycycline, clindamycin, and metronidazole. After the treatment from the dermatologist, my skin did clear for a while, but it all came right back.\n\nRedness, dry skin around my mouth, along with red tender bumps along my chin and nose. I’ll wake up in the morning with a bunch of whiteheads as well.\n\nBoth diagnosed me with perioral dermatitis. Is this really what I have? My mom and aunt deal with rosacea, and I was wondering if maybe this is a combination thing I have going on.\n\nI’ve tried both treatments listed along with salicylic acne wash, sulfur acne wash, Harlan MD smart lotion, and zero therapy.\n\nNothing has made any improvement. Anybody have a suggestion on what I should do next? And does this really look like perioral dermatitis?\n\nThanks so much!",

      "content": "For context I am 24F with sensitive/slightly dry skin. This year I decided to start using retinols and tried a few brands. Some were drugstore brands like CeraVe and some others that are a bit on the pricier side. Maybe because I have sensitive skin, none of them seemed to work for me until I tried Murad's retinol youth renewal serum. I got the second bottle now and I absolutely love it. My skin is glowing and I didn't have any harsh reactions to it so far.\n\nThe issue is, Murad doesn't disclose their retinol percentage and it is pissing me off. I thought about increasing the percentage of retinol I was using slowly but now i don't even know how I should gp about it. Some might say the non-disclosed percentage is a red flag (which I also do agree with) but my skin seems respond so well to this product I don't know what to do. Does anyone had a similar issue with Murad? or anyone who had a similer journey maybe figured out how to estimate the amount of retinol?\n\nI'd appreciate any suggestions here. Thanks!!",
