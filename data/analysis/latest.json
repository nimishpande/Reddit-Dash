      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I have v uneven eye brows. Alot of face hair and body hair.  The problem is because my mom and my sister never did any sort of such things.  I never learned.

I'm scared that if I wax my face and eye brows it will idk come back worst.  I got the Braun trimmer something for my facial hair but idk I feel extremely weird using it.  Idk if I should dye my eyebrows or wax my hands too. I feel idk.  Out of place.  Idk how to adapt to these things. And when I ask my mom about it she makes it a big deal honestly.\nSo I turned to the random mom's of the internet. What do you think I should do. Or start with. I want honest replies please.

      "title": "[Acne] [Routine Help] Reoccurring acne for two months, is my routine too harsh?",
      "content": "\nI (23F) have had reoccurring acne on my chin for more than two months now. I usually have some acne here and there, but this has just not gone away for quite some time, which is abnormal for me. The pimples that have been popping up have mostly been very large or a lot in one area at once. I also am prone to getting keratin plugs and sebaceous filaments around my chin and lips, which I am unsure of how to get rid of (any suggestions?). In the second picture you can see the blemishes left over from recent acne going away. \n\nI usually struggle a LOT with picking at my skin, especially those plugs/ filaments, which I had assumed is why my acne had gotten intense, but I've been very good about leaving it alone and just sticking to my skincare routine, and even so, it has been very very hard to get my skin to calm down. This has me wondering if my skincare routine is too harsh, and what I need to change about my routine to decrease my acne and clogged pores. \n\nAM:\n-splash of water\n-occasional Proactiv Emergency Blemish Relief on acne \n -occasional thin layer of lotion if skin is dry\n\nPM:\n-Cetaphil exfoliating SA cleanser\n-Proactiv toner (glycolic acid, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, witch hazel, etc.)\n-Proactiv Emergency Blemish Relief on acne\n-If acne is ready, hydrocolloid patch overnight\n-Occasional thin layer of lotion if skin is dry\n\nI feel like I am overdoing it with the exfoliating ingredients, but I don't know how else to handle these breakouts. I don't typically break out this much for this long, but clearly something isn't working. I don't really know much about skincare products or what my skin needs the most (dry skin, but occasionally oily on forehead and chin), and I don't have a fortune to spend on skincare, but any advice on what to change will be much appreciated.  \n",

Anyone used these? Also if you guys know any other under-eye product that actually works, isn’t crazy expensive, and is safe for sensitive skin, please recommend. I don’t want to accidentally burn my already dying eyebags 🥲 or trigger my already sensitive skin 🥹",

It’s been over a month and the tan is just stuck. My face looks reddish, especially around the cheeks, and there are some visible spots/textured bumps on my forehead that weren’t there before.\nI’m a lazy corporate majdoor so my routine is very simple and honestly inconsistent. Maybe that’s the problem.\nMy routine:\n\t•\tFace wash: Simple \n\t•\tSerums Dermaco\n\t•\t10% niacinamide \n\t•\tSalicylic acid\n\t•\tKojic acid\n\t•\tVitamin C (recently started)\n\t•\tMoisturizer: Aqualogica Hydrating Gel\n\t•\tSunscreen: Wishcare or Aqualogica\n\t•\tLip balm: Wishcare\n\t•\tI don’t use a toner\n\nEven after using serums for so long I genuinely don’t see any improvement. Maybe I’m mixing or overusing things? Maybe my routine is not consistent enough? I really don’t know anymore.\nI just want clear, bright, glassy skin with no bumps, and right now I look tanned, uneven and irritated.\nCan someone please tell me:\n\t1.\tAm I using too many actives?\n\t2.\tDo I need a toner?\n\t3.\tHow do I fix the tan + redness + texture?\n\t4.\tWhat should be the correct simple AM/PM routine?\nAny product recommendations or routine that actually works will help a lot.\nThanks in advance 🙏\n",

I don’t have active acne, but my skin definitely doesn’t look healthy and I want to give as much detail as possible about my face.\n\n* Noticeable redness around my cheeks and a few small marks that look like healed pimples.\n* Old acne scars  some small pits or uneven spots on both cheeks.\n* Overall uneven tone and skin texture, and visible pores, especially around the cheek and nose area.\n* A few brownish dark spots or slight discolorations from old breakouts.\n\nI’m not sure what kind of skincare routine. I currently don’t have any, so I’m open to starting from scratch. I’d say my skin is not very sensitive, but I’m not sure how strong it is either. I think I have an oily center face (nose, chin and inner cheeks) while the outer face is kind of dry (sides of cheeks and neck).\n\nI did a bit of basic research and made the list below, but as I said I don’t know much and I’m open to all suggestions. I would really appreciate specific product recommendations since I’m not familiar with the market.\n\nWhen Wake Up:\n\n* Cleanser\n* Niacinamide Serum or Hyaluronic Acid ?\n* Moisturiser\n* Sunscreen \n\nBefore Bed:\n\n* Cleanser\n* Azelaic Acid or BHA or Retinoid-based stuff ?\n\nAbout tret/retinoid products: I did basic research and found it might be better to start with non-prescription options first so I don’t harm my skin. I’m thinking of trying Avène Cleanance Comedomed Peeling Intensiv Anti-Pickel Akutpflege.\n\nI live in Germany and I can buy via online. Also I’m open to prescription medication, but I don’t want professional dermatologist procedures like laser treatments or needles. What would you recommend to me?\n\nThanks a lot in advance for your help!",

Cleanser\n2. Toner\n3. Vitamin C serum\n4. Moisturizer\n5. Sunscreen (SPF 50)\n\n**Evening :** (daily)\n\n1. Cleanser\n2. Toner\n3. Niacinamide serum\n4. Moisturizer\n\n**Once a week :** (different evenings)\n\n1. Retinol\n2. BHA exfoliant\n3. Clay mask (black clay)\n4. Hydrating sheet mask with serum ( in fact used only once but i planned to do once week )\n\n**Results after 1 month :**\n\nI'm really happy with the results so far. My milia have almost all disappeared, the blackheads on my nose went from \"a lot\" to maybe 3 at most, and my pores are still visible but less noticeable, I'm slowly starting to get the \"glow\", and I had 3 fine lines on my forehead, one of which has already faded a lot, My skin already feels a bit firmer, much more hydrated, and honestly, it's also given me a confidence boost. And, I genuinely enjoy doing my skincare routine.",
