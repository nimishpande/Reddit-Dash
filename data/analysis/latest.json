My curls feel way less frizzy in the morning now.\n\nPicture was taken 2 days after washing.\n\n**The Routine:**\n\n* **Wash:** Co-wash with **Hask Detangling Curl Care Conditioner**. I spend a good couple of minutes massaging the scalp to make sure it’s clean, then rinse.\n* Apply **Cantu Curl Cream** to soaking wet hair and scrunch them\n* **L**et it air dry\n* Once it’s completely bone-dry, I Scrunch Out The Crunch to get rid of the cast and make it soft.\n\nThanks to everyone in this community for the tips and the motivation to embrace the curls! I know it's a pretty basic routine and theres definitely space to improve but it works for me.",

I began treatment on September 8th, and as you can see, I’ve already had great results in just 3.5 months\n\nMy concern is the timeline: I’m getting married on September 2026, which is only seven months after the transplant. From what I know, seven months isn’t usually enough time to see the full results of an HT.\n\nRight now, I’m using hair fibers to cover the thinning areas, and it looks really good. So my question is - should I go ahead with the transplant in February, or postpone it and let the medications continue working (which would give me a full year of treatment by the time of the wedding)? Worst case, I could still use hair fibers for the wedding if needed.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Yo everyone, I’m making this post because 2026 is the year I finally stop hiding and get my life together.\nI’ve spent more than a decade being completely negligent with my skin. Years of constant sun exposure without a lick of sunscreen has turned my visible skin (face/arms) a deep, dark black. The contrast is crazy because my inner body is still naturally white. It’s a \"perma-tan\" that’s been baked in for ten years.\nI’m also dealing with oily skin and deep acne scars. To be honest, I’m way too introverted and under-confident to go see a dermatologist in person right now. I want to try and fix this myself at home first while I start my New Year's resolution of getting physically active.\nMy Planned \"Starter Pack\":\n * Glycolic Acid\n * Vitamin C Serum\n * Kojic Acid\n * Sunscreen &amp; Moisturizer\nCan you guys help a brown brother out with some guidance?\n * The Routine: How do I actually use these? I’m clueless about what goes first and what shouldn't be mixed.\n * The \"Decade\" Factor: Since this is 10+ years of neglect, how long should I realistically wait to see my natural skin tone start to peek through?\n * The Scars: Will these products help with deep scarring, or am I wasting my time without professional help?\n * The \"Gym\" Factor: Since I'm starting to work out, when should I do this routine? Before or after the gym?\nI’m tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. Any advice or encouragement would mean the world. Thanks, guys.",

      "content": "I used to struggle with cystic acne all over my body in high school, about 5 years ago I luckily went on Accutane. I haven’t had any acne in years (thank god). About 2 months ago I started having little breakouts; thought it was from my period. The last picture is from when I FIRST started to notice it. A few weeks ago I noticed it got worse and super itchy but I started using the Prequel spray with hypochlorous from Target which has helped the itchiness but it’s still irritated. It’s not dry but that’s also because I’ve been moisturizing twice a day and I wash my face at night. It’s mostly just raised skin with redness and some random pimples here and there which I can deal with, but the fact it’s itchy is what somewhat concerns me. I don’t eat red meat (no pork, beef, lamb, etc) and eat pretty clean foods for the most part. I’m very active and haven’t had any lifestyle changes in the last few months so I doubt it’s from stress, or dehydration, or anything along those lines. I am currently using the Prequel Glycerin Cleanser, then using Cocokind Ceramide Barrier Serum, when that dries I use Vanicream Moisturizing Cream for Sensitive Skin, and lastly spray the Prequel Hypochlorous Acid spray. If anyone has any suggestions, please help lol!!",

I feel like the reason why is my routine, which goes like this: As I Am rosemary shampoo, and run it through my hair loosely and scrub scalp, As I am rosemary conditioner, and loosely let it through my hair, and then wash through and air dry, and i think this loose washing is leading to the mildew, but if i rake my hands through my hair, it makes my hair frizzy and pulls apart the curls.

I've been using Aveda Invati that I purchased on sale, and while it's clearly high quality, it's also incredibly expensive...especially now that it's no longer on sale. That being the case, I'm looking for another natural shampoo and conditioner that work well for people with thinning hair. I will add the disclaimer that I'm well aware no shampoo or conditioner actually treat hair loss. That's not what I'm asking here. I just need a good natural (i.e., no SLS, etc.) shampoo and conditioner that aren't egregiously expensive but that are specifically not problematic to those with thinning hair. If they add noticeable volume and fullness that's great, but most important are the ingredients and overall quality. I realize every scalp is different so opinions are subjective, but it would be great to have some recommendations. Yes, I have looked through the wiki and tried to do other research in this sub. There are just so many products out there, new ones come out all the time and old favorites are sadly prone to formula changes, so any recommendations to help narrow the field would be much appreciated!",

      "content": "For context, I am a 21 year old female and have had acne all my life, but within the past few years it has been getting worse and is at the point where it can’t get much worse. I tried just about everything, including going to the dermatologist just to try things that made my skin super dry and irritated without helping. I had done just a gentle cleanser, hyaluronic acid (love), and moisturizer every day and sometimes the dermatologica milk-foliant but figured there would be no harm in my adding in salicylic acid or trying glycolic acid (both of which I had used before but still wanted to try again). Anyways, I have ended up doing cerave’s acne control cleanser (since it was new), dermatologica milk exfoliator, glycolic acid, hyaluronic acid, and cerave PM moisturizer and did this every 1-3 days. it has been two months and i don’t think there has been any difference. my skin has been getting super dry so i have been stopping the glycolic acid but kept everything the same. the hyaluronic acid works great for me and the dermatologica exfoliator is the only thing that actually helps with my skin texture (though still not great) but I am worried the exfoliator might not be helping since it is the only thing i haven’t changed in a while. the problem is that if i don’t use it, my pores are so clogged. should i try stopping it? is there another thing i should use for exfoliation? should i go back to using the glycolic acid every once in a while? any other suggestions or tips would be greatly appreciated. my goal isn’t even to get rid of the acne at this point but just to make it manageable or at least a little better. also not wanting to try anything expensive if i don’t have to. also have been relying on vaseline for my acne wounds and dry spots. thanks!",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",
