      "title": "My Naturally Curly Wedding Hair",
      "content": "Being able to wear my natural curls for my wedding was very important to me, but it was SO hard to fund images of curly wedding hair that was not curled with a curling iron. I really wanted to make a post with some images in case anyone is looking in the future!\n\nSome background: I was a bit disappointed with my hair trial. The HMU artist brushed through and re-curled each curl, which made my curls not only much looser, but they also did not hold for even an hour. I also think my hair did not like whatever hairspray was used. I don't have much experience having my hair styled so was not aware how this method would work on my hair until it was tried. No shade at all to the har stylist. My hair can be difficult... It's fine, low-density, doesn't behave like most curly hair, but also doesn't behave like non-curly hair. After agonizing a bit over it, I did some experimenting. I bought myself some CurlSmith hair spray which worked amazingly well on my hair. I bought a curling wand to match the width of my natural curls. I styled  my natural curls as I usually would (leave-in, curl cream, bowl method, plop 10-ish minutes, scrunch gently with microfiber towel, mousse, heat protectant, diffuse). I jazzed up any curls that didn't feel like cooperating with the curing wand. I did not brush or smooth them out, just re-wound them on the wand following the natural pattern and held for a couple seconds. I mocked up a very simple twist and sent her the pics. I asked her to let me style the curls myself, if needed she could re-curl pieces using the same method I did. Mostly she just needed to twist the front pieces and place the dried flower pins. I also asked her to use the hair spray I bought. She was super receptive and executed it so well on our wedding day. We recently got our professional photos back and looking through them I kept thinking \"damn, my curls look so good!\" for so many of the pictures! Long story short, I'm really happy I went with my gut and found a way to style my curls the way I wanted on our wedding day, and I am also so grateful for how flexible and understanding my stylist was.

      "content": "I’ve always had issues with acne. Up until about a year ago I never really tried to treat it seriously but I’ve been putting a lot of effort into making my face look nice. That said, not much progress has been made. I switched from an electric shaver to a razor recently (not Gillette, this really nice kind that does not make accidental cuts near as often. I can’t remember the name). After that, I noticed my face was breaking out bad. I was getting razor bumps all over my chin and jaw line and had no clue why. I asked my barber and he recommend a few products but I went to the store and the lady in the skin care dept. recommended a shave cream and after shave by House of Atlas, the razor I currently use, and then a rose petal toner by Thayers. I’ve been using that for at least a month (I think more) and my face is marginally better but I still get razor bumps bad under my chin and on my jaw line. Basically what I’m asking is, after all this time and effort, what could I be doing wrong? I should mention I have naturally oily skin. I sweat a lot easier than most people. There’s nothing I can really do about that, it’s just what it is.",

      "content": "I had a good routine going for a while but I guess something in my environment or my hormones changed cuz all my problems came back. My scalp keeps breaking out, especially if I use a gel or any sort of styling product, or if I don’t wash my hair for several days (exacerbated by the use of product). And any heavy conditioners do the same thing. But all the good cleaning shampoos make my hair feel awful. I asked a dermatologist about the breakouts and they recommended a shampoo that cleans great but now my hair feels like straw. This happened with ketoconazole shampoo a different derm recommended as well. It seems like anything that is good for my hair irritates my scalp and anything that calms my scalp ruins my hair. I’ve been trying a million and a half combinations of shampoo and conditioner and styling products and no dice so far. Anyone experience anything like this and have any advice? What worked for you?\n\nThings I have tried: Shea moisture castor oil/Apple cider vinegar shampoo and conditioner (this was working great for me for a long time until I added styling products, and then I started breaking out again) Not your mothers naturals shampoo and conditioner (the pink one) Straight up head and shoulders shampoo+conditioner 2in1 Nizoral ketoconazole shampoo L’Oréal clarifying shampoo L’Oréal moisturizing shampoo The ordinary shampoo and conditioner Vanicream shampoo\n\nThe latest thing I’ve been using is the vanicream based on the derm rec and trying it with the ordinary conditioner or the shea moisture conditioner. Neither have really helped a ton, and now I have both acne and maid hair feels like straw, so it’s lose lose 😂\n\nPlease help 😅😅😅",

Anyways, i met my partner and it made me want to improve myself a ton, shes was my main motivation so i started doing research, and fell into an adhd spiral of haircare. \n\nLurked on this sub a ton, read all the routines people did and slowly managed to get an understanding of what could and couldnt work with my hair. At first it felt like there was no progress at all but slowly id notice how much more volume my hair started to get and today i achieved a length goal i thought id never reach. Anyways you guys are great please keep yapping about your routines and advice its sooo helpful &lt;3 \n\nHoping to reach waist length hair… eventually haha maybe in a few years!! \n\nCurrent routine: \nHask curl care shampoo + conditioner \nGisou honey ceramide mask when i use my cleansing shampoo (kinky-curly come clean) 1-2x per month \nAG Care air light volumizing mousse\nAG Care Recoil \nAurill Gel \n\nGoing to try: Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum \n\nAny and all advice or feedback is welcome!! \n\n",

I loved how it felt before, was something I felt super comfortable with compared to any other sunscreen I've tried.\n\nThis has caused me to feel much worse, as I normally prefer gentler products(I use petroleum jelly and Nivea Creme/Men's Creme) and soaps in general to avoid issues. Looking for recommendations in the same vein as well, don't want to take too many risks with products that might react with my skin.\n\nAny sunscreen reccs that might help replace this one? Doesn't seem like it's a one off issue from my research online, so would love to hear about other products in a similar price range(500Rs for 50ml) hopefully, I'm a student and have to use it multiple times a day for commuting so definitely can't go for anything super expensive.",
