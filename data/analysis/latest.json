I use it after showering and I’m good for the entire day. \n\nEasily a 10/10 WRP!!\n\nNivea Pearl &amp; Beauty Roll On:\n\nVery average. It was the first one i used (canon event). formula feels slightly sticky for the first few minutes. No sweat control, it just mixes the smell with the deo’s. And no visible brightening. \n\n6/10 WNRP because there are better options now.\n\nRexona Shower Fresh Roll On:\n\ndecent for odour control but way too strong for sensitive skin gave me a slight burning sensation especially on freshly shaved days. works if you need something heavy, but it’s definitely not gentle. \n\n7.5/10 WNRP for me personally cause i have too sensitive skin.",

I’d also like my acne concealed better (I know makeup can’t hide texture, but the redness is still coming through the foundation near my chin). I plan to tell the artist to change these things for the day-of, but I’m looking for other opinions as well.\n\nI’m just looking for feedback on the makeup, since I can’t look at it objectively and am not used to wearing much makeup.

Other than these frown lines, I'm very happy with my skin.\n\nFrom my research, the most effective treatment is Botox, but I'm trying to get pregnant, so need to stay away from neurotoxins for now.\n\nI've already tried argireline peptides (didn't work) and Frownies (the adhesive irritated my skin and I didn't see results after a week, but maybe I need to use for longer).\n\nAny advice for what else I can try during conception, pregnancy and breastfeeding?\n\nFor context, below is my regular skincare routine. This works well for me and I'm not looking for advice on it unless it specifically relates to your recommendation for treating 11s.\n\nMorning: Vitamin C powder mixed with a basic unscented water-based moisturizer + sunscreen\n\nNight: Micellar water to cleanse/remove makeup + phyto retinol night cream\n\nA few days a week I use a salicylic acid moisturizer (I'll stop once pregnant), eye patches with hyaluronic acid, oil-based cleanser, and rosehip seed oil.\n\nThank you for any thoughts, community! &lt;3",

      "content": "Hello! First-time poster here. I would really appreciate some help with my skin. \n\nI’ve been dealing with stubborn acne along my jawline for years. I had normal acne as a teen, but as a 35-year-old woman, it rarely occurs above my cheekbones. As you can see from the photos, there are some clogged pores which I periodically get extracted with a good professional facial. The acne ranges from flat blemishes to raised pimples, only about 25% of which ever come to a head. I am pretty good about not picking or popping them. \n\nI try to take good care of my skin. Details on product and routines below. My lifestyle is pretty average - I mostly eat balanced meals but have a little bit of a sweet tooth. I’ve tried going dairy-free for about six weeks to no avail. I don’t exercise as much as I should, but I get plenty of walks and vitamin D with my dog. I try not to touch my face during the day and I also don’t frequently have a phone or something else touching my skin. \n\nAM Routine:\nWash with CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser\nApply CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Lotion (SPF 30) \nApply Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen\nI wear makeup most weekdays. Most days I just use Milk makeup primer, NARS concealer, Laura Mercier powder, Milk blush and bronzer. If I’m feeling fancy I’ll use Ilia cream or NARS liquid foundation. I use either clean fingers, clean brush or clean sponge to apply. \n\nPM Routine:\nRemove makeup with Neutrogena Hydroboost Hydrating gel Cleanser (w/ hyaluronic acid) \nDouble cleanse with CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser\nEight Saints Up the Anti night cream\nSmall amount of Clindanycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide (1.2%/5%)\n2-3x/week: Tretinoin gel microsphere (0.1%)\n\nI use Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant to exfoliate ~1x/week. About half of the time that I wash off my makeup, I use a soft washcloth to gently exfoliate. I was also recently gifted a set of products from Glow Recipe: toner, hyaluronic plump cream, recovery serum, eye cream, etc. I’ve been using those here and there since Christmas but I’m hesitant to throw even more into the mix here. \n\nI love my face, despite what we’ve been through. But I’d also really like to improve my skin. Any clues as to what I can do to clear it up? Thanks in advance for your help!",

And these pictures only show day 2 out of 3. My routine is below. Any ideas or tips are greatly appreciated.\n\nWash Day\n\n\\- at night, in shower, shampoo and massage scalp with Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo (every couple weeks I will substitute it for OUAI Detox Shampoo)\n\n\\- let shampoo run down strands to help wash out product\n\n\\- condition everything past my scalp with Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Conditioner by thoroughly using praying hands and squish to condition methods\n\n\\- use wide tooth comb to gently detangle my hair from ends to roots, rinsing conditioner in the process\n\n\\- out of shower, don't even touch hair with towel, keeping it consistently wet with continuing spray bottle during styling\n\n\\- use praying hands to apply Love Ur Curls Step 3 All-In-One\n\n\\- use praying hands to liberally apply Love Ur Curls Irish Sea Moss Gel\n\n\\- use Denman brush to simply divide hair into clumps-- not so much doing the entire rotation method but just using the initial side set of teeth\n\n\\- lean down and strongly scrunch my hair\n\n\\- let air dry completely into a gel cast\n\n\\- before bed, tie up into pineapple bun and sleep on satin pillowcase\n\nDay 1\n\n\\- pull hair out of pineapple in morning, scrunch and shake to loosen up the cast for the day\n\n\\- pineapple again before bed\n\nDay 2\n\n\\- mist hair with water to try and reactivate product, maybe throwing in a little diluted leave-in conditioner spray\n\n\\- pineapple again before bed\n\nDay 3 (wash day again)\n\n\\- mist hair again (usually needs it) and dream of when I get to wash it again\n\n\\- same routine as last wash day",

I’m incredibly self conscious about every single part of my body, but i do think if i lost my double chin i would be more confident. I already have guasha stuff, and do my best to remember to use it. I do need to drink more water, i know that’s something that would help.

I got another chemical cut, i had to cut my long blonde hair short. eventually i dyed it dark blonde light brown again but then i discovered the highlift color dye. i dyed it in nye of 2024 to 2025 and my hair was doing great. i dye the roots every month, but lately my hair has been feeling reaalllllly weird. like to a point that i feel guilty of even thinking about dying it more cause i seriously feel my hair falling off. my big problem is, i HATE seeing myself with any color but blonde. my natural hair is very similar to the color of sydney sweeney's roots, and what i have right now is whats in the first picture. i ve been feelin my hair getting thinner, having even more frizz, it feels dry but hydrated at some parts(?) idk i feel like im going crazy. my hair gets more sensitive in the winter but what should i do? any hairdresser can give me an honest advice? i have more pictures if needed for a more deep analysis but i kinda wanna hear opinions, what colour should i do? i was thinking in the last picture because she has \"dark\" roots but with the rest of the hair in that darker blonde, she still passes the blonde vibe(?) idk im so confusing and tired, i reallly wanna have nice, healthy and really big hair.

      "content": "I am someone with 3A curls who lives in the north. Where I live it is freezing cold and dry all winter and our summers are a dry heat.\n\nI travelled to a humid location a few years back and was completely at a loss for how to manage my curls and mitigate frizz. Also in the humidity my curl pattern intensified to a maybe a 3b.\n\nI am travelling to Mexico for a vacation in a week and this time I am looking for advice. What products should I buy and bring to make my curls thrive in the humidity? How do I manage the halo of frizz that instantly appears the minute I step off the plane? And if you’re feeling generous, tips for styling my hair sans heat because there’s really no point in trying to fight the curl in that kind of humidity 😅\n\nThank you in advance for all replies!\n\nMy usual routine on a wash day is shampoo and condition with television. Lightly towel dry. While still completely wet spray with IGK good behaviour 4 in 1 and brush through. Scrunch. Either diffuse gently or air dry. I don’t protect my hair while sleeping. I find the satin pillow cases too slippery 😩 but I will Mae the sacrifice if you all tell me this is what my hair needs. You will notice I don’t use any curl specific products, I have found them all too heavy and diminish my curls. But I also genuinely have no idea what I’m doing. ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Around 2-3 months ago, I started a skincare routine, which consists of using a water based cleanser, salyclic acid serum and moisturiser/spf. I cleanse and moisturise every night, and use the SA every 3 days at for the first month and a half, then I went to every 2 days, but it genuinely hasn't done anything except make me breakout the day after I use it. Even more blackheads and pimples are appearing now and I am so frustrated. Does anyone have a recommendation for a product that will help with getting rid of the blackheads and stopping pimples. I have a product list of what I use down below. I can provide more info if asked. Please be kind :)\n\nProduct currently in routine:\n\nArencia Fresh Green Rice Mochi Cleanser\n\nCetaphil DAILY FACIAL MOISTURISER\n\nThe Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution\n\nCancer Council Hydrating Sunscreen for Men SPF50+\n\nProducts I also have but don't use right now:\n\nAnua Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner\n\nMadagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil SKIN1004\n\nAnua Niacinamide 10% + TXA 4% Serum",

Routine: brush before shower, then used Maui brand in Coconut, the blue, moisture level 2 shampoo and conditioner. So far is the most satisfactory. Then wrung out my hair and put it in a turbie twist for a couple of hours, let loose and it air dried like this. I’m at a loss at what type curls these are (they are not trained, they have just been twisted in the towel and then air dried, my hair only does this in the front, meanwhile the underneath remains straight (always been told it’s because my hair is heavy, I do like layers however it doesn’t help the underneath parts). I don’t do anything special when sleeping, I’ve never had chemicals in my hair ever as well, no dye. \n\nSome background: as a kid I had pin straight, silky blonde hair. Enter puberty: my hair got coarse, thick, darker and was a frizzy, poofy mess when brushed. Neither parent has curly hair so I was never taught how to manage it, always took a brush to it and used the most damaging shampoo (Nizoral). I’ve spent probably over a hundred, maybe more on products. Tried Not Your Mother’s, Shea Moisture, Mielle. Shampoo/Conditioner has been so much I can hardly remember. Photo 3 is my hair when brushed out dry, and Photo 4 is after some salt-water at the beach a couple years ago for some variety. I guess my question is whether or not my whole head can be trained, or if I’m just unfortunate enough to have my front pieces curl and the rest (like the back) just isn’t. \n\nI’ve never posted anything on here so do correct me if I made a mistake or didn’t understand the rules correctly. I’m just very exhausted trying to figure out what direction I should go in after trying what feels like everything but curl resetting and training. ",
