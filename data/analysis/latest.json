I’ve spent so long trying to maximize definition and force my now- bigger, looser curls into a perfectly defined coils with no frizz. I’ve finally accepted my curls are what they are and that while I can encourage their natural curl pattern to shine, I can’t force each curl to be tighter or smaller so I’d better just embrace what I’ve got! \n\n This is day 4 hair, and it tends to get flatter/ loose its bigness/ volume each day post wash day.. even with a bonnet. \n\nRoutine: \n I use OGX clarifying strength shampoo, super cheap from Amazon, innersense organics color radiance condition (their thicker conditioner is just a bit too heavy for my hair and weighs it down), miss Jesse‘s pillow, soft curls, and a bit of mop, top curly custard, but not too much\n\nThis past wash day, I air dried my hair, but it certainly gets bigger and more defined when I blow dry it with a diffuser… Just requires more work and I am a bit lazy ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I want to keep my hair generally long all the way around but am open to adjusting layers and blah, also I wanted opinions on if you all think bangs could work for me and how to do them if I did? \n\nAs for colour, I'm considering the basic balayage (I know, shoot me) as I've done more adventurous hair colours before and I want something more down to earth. The question is, what colours or mix of colours do you think will suit me? I want something more natural and not terribly damaging for my hair. My hair tends to be quite voluminous and so along with my generally darker coloured wardrobe I feel like my face sometimes is obscured by my hair and outfits so I want something that will brighten me up.\n\nI'm including some photos so you guys can understand my hair texture and style a bit. Note the first three are right now from my work so I look a bit washed but some of the later photos let's you see what I look like when my hair is properly taken care of. Please help a guy out with some suggestions!!",

They are totally non-negotiable for me, it’s my time to relax, read, and destress after the craziness of full time job, parenting and all the other fun things life throws my way. I have yet to find a cap that keeps my hair dry, so wondering if there is a way to make this work.\n\nI bath at night and only wash my hair every-other day, so it’s less an issue of washing, not of getting it wet. I do use conditioner every day. \n\nRight now my routine is something like:\nWash (not every day)\nCondition\nTowel off gently\nAir dry for a bit\nPut in top knot to sleep\nWake up, spritz with heat protectant or argan oil\nBlow dry\nCurl (or just leave, if I’m not doing anything where I need to look nice)\n\nClearly I need to redo several of these steps, but mainly wondering how to incorporate nightly baths into whatever routine I do. Any suggestions?\n\nLove this group and love seeing all your amazing curls!!!",

I’ve tried sea salt spray and clay before, but I can never get the look I want.\n\nAlso, one side of my middle part (right side) is always flatter, and the left side is more wavy for some reason. My current routine is a sulfate and paraben free shampoo and [this](https://www.reequil.com/products/murumuru-damage-repair-hair-conditioner) conditioner.

I feel like such a freak.\n\nI have been on antidepressants since I was 11 and have been to many different therapists in this time and I still feel this way.

Moisturise semi-regularly and unfortunately don’t use tanning drops or anything. WOULD LOVE SOME TANNING DROP RECOMMENDATIONS!!\n\nNot a massive fan of Bondi Sands, though I have only used their Technocolour 1 hour express.

      "content": "Hi! \n\nI've never used press-ons before, but I really wanted to try them because of versatile they can be. However, I'm worried about the damage caused by the glue and the prep. I ideally would for them to last for at least a couple days, but be very easy and non-damaging to remove when I decide to do so. I currently use no products on my nails, and have only ever used air-dry polish and would like to avoid UV-cured gel on my nails. I wanted to ask a couple of questions:\n\n(1) How would I prep my nails? I would prefer not to scratch them up in any way, and would like affordable options for things like cuticle oils or tools (I have no idea what I'd need). I'm also not sure how to properly push back my cuticles, because some of them do go a decent way up my nails (1st picture)\n\n(2) Would the press-ons that I chose (2nd picture) work for my nails? Particularly for the size/shape of my nail beds, and the shape of the nails of my middle/ring fingers. (Also, do the nail tips need to be cured because one of the reviews gave me that impression)\n\n(3) What glue should I use and how should I apply/remove it? I'd like for the glue to be easy to remove with easily removable/no residue, but still stay on without suddenly popping off. Again, I would prefer not to use a UV-cured product.\n\n(4) Is it a viable option to put a base coat/peely base underneath the nail glue? Does it provide protection and easier removal with acetone? Any suggestions for particular base coats are welcome 😅. I am trying to prioritize nail health and don't want to peel my nail with harsh glue.\n\nThank you for reading and advice is appreciated! If I missed anything important, please ask more questions because I really would love to try press-ons without damage 💅",

I have 2b hair I believe and it has never ever been frizzy, always smooth! I wash it 2-3 times a week, use a lot of conditioner, use a curling/anti frizz cream after the shower when it's damp, and I hardly ever apply heat. I was using Dove's Daily Moisture shampoo &amp; conditioner for a couple months and when it became frizzy I was like maybe it's what I'm using? So I switched to Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine shampoo and still no improvement. For cream I use the Garnier Sleek and Shine Anti Frizzy cream.  For oils I switch off between &amp;honey Melty Moist Repair Hair Oil and OGX Argan Oil of Morocco. I apply the cream after I shower when my hair is damp and the oils when it's more dry. I also brush my hair before I shower. Here's my hair dry a couple hours after washed. ",
