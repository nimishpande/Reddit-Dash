      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "First things first. Lets talk about reset wash day. Saturday night or Sunday morning I do a total reset. I double shampoo using a regular moisturizing shampoo (amika for now) followed by mark anthonys daily bond and repair shampoo, then lay down a thick moisturizing mask conditioner. I do not do anything with my hair. I brush with a wide tooth comb and let it air dry. This is a rest day for my hair. No product, no styling, let it breath! (twice a month ill do the curl smith bond salve treatment and twice a month i do the maui cleansing shampoo on these days too.)\n\nMonday-shampoo with marc Anthonys daily bond and repair to get the oil of the deep conditioner off. Next is not your mothers (NYM) leave in conditioner and a light heat protectant. I let that sit and soak in while I do my other shower routine duties. I might mention I do all my styling in the shower. Get a mirror and shower organizer and bring all your products in there with you! Next ill apply a little bit of curl cream and rake that through with my fingers. I use cake beauty but I think any curl cream will be fine. Next, i section off my hair and ultimately do three sections, lower middle, and crown. Rake in NYMs defining medium hold gel. Brush through with the bounce curl brush. Repeat for the next two sections. The crown area is done with the \"no part\" technique and when I get to my bangs, I brush those forward. Now flip your head upside down and scrunch in the NYMs freeze 5 hold gel. Lots of gel! Gel is your friend!\n\nNow we are stepping out of the shower. Hair is dripping wet. Take a t-shirt, flip your head upside down, and scrunch out the excess water and product. \n\nThis next step has been whats the game changer for me: go in and scrunch with a gel to mousse/foam-the extra hold on not dripping wet hair has given me the definition dreams are made of. I use the AG gel to mousse.\n\nDiffuse with head completely upside down. Start with hover diffusing to get the cast going then start to cup dry and form the curls. 50% dry ill flip my head right side up (you're gonna look like you got electrocuted and this is a good sign! Trust the process.) and continue. This is the time to kinda lay down clumps in their spots so you dont have any wonky guys sticking out all sorts of ways. I dry to about 90% dry, break the cast JUST A BIT, continue cup diffusing to about 98% dry. I let them air dry the rest of the way to work and scrunch the crunch out and fluff at work, no oil, it weighs my the down. Voila. \n\nRefresh days: Even with all this work, these hardly last because I sleep in a loose pony tail on a silk pillow case. Refresh days are a lot easier as far as dry time and I get the same look. Dampen with a spray bottle, scrunch in NYMs curl cream (this prevents frizz!! I SWEAR BY IT!!), scrunch in the gel to mousse/foam, cup diffuse. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!!",

Years ago I decided I wanted to go my hair out. I dye my hair very often (my mother is a hair dresser, but I do my own hair) so I know that causes breakage itself with how often I color it. I have since stopped about 3 months ago to try to get my hair healthier. I have not cut my hair (other than a trim or 2) in about 6 years. It was right below my chin 6 years ago. And here we are today. I struggle with extreme breakage in the middle where it creates this \\^ shape an the outsides are very very thin. I work in a warehouse so I do wear a harness 10 hours a day with my hair down so I’m thinking that’s making it worse? I’m not sure what to do to help this. Is a hair cut a must at this point? I was washing my hair with native, joico, and most recently was using herbal essence which seems to be making it much much worse. Today I did buy wella repair shampoo and conditioner along with the hair masque. What should I do to help my hair? Also is braiding my hair at night also a must? ",

I’m looking for (1) my curl type, (2) products that may be worth trying, and (3) general thoughts and recommendations based on my current hair care/products below. \n\nIn the past I used Ouidad curl quencher shampoo and conditioner and liked it, but I just couldn’t keep up with the expense. I wonder if there’s any comparable products with a more manageable price? \n\nNow, I use Kristin Ess curl shampoo and conditioner, but I feel like it has so much build up. I don’t know how to describe it, it just feels heavy. I use their clarifying shampoo 1-2 times a week to try to help. \n\nI’m a quick routine kind of girl, so on wash mornings I will put Ouidad curl quencher curl cream in while wet and let it air dry. On non-wash days, I either claw clip it or rehydrate with Ouidad get hydrated splash mask. \n\nOther notes: I do wash my hair about every other day because I go to the gym often and get very sweaty (including my scalp). I also sleep with a bonnet every night. I use a very wide tooth comb (9 teeth) to brush my hair. \n\nThank you in advance!!! ",

My OB said it was okay if I used it still during pregnancy so I’ve kept up with both prescriptions. Started having some more acne so then started Azaelic 15%. Prior to that I was not using anything to control acne specifically, except I guess sulfur. \nCurrently routine:\nMorning: barrier balance cleaner, Azaelic 15% neutrogena hydroboost, tinted sunscreen\nNight: sulfur cleanser from derm, ivermectin 1%, hydraremedy, comfort cream \n\nI know hormones could be a factor, but I’ve always done better with high hormone birth control so I’m sort of surprised, and I don’t get cysts or acne in the typical areas, like chin or jaw. It’s really only like lower cheeks. I’m getting so frustrated because as soon as one cheek gets better, the other cheek breaks out, and vice versa and etc. Things seem to be clearing up and then I unexplained wake up with 4-5 pimples. They are mostly white heads, all in the same place. I’ve been using Azaelic for about 6 weeks once a day.\n\nIs this purging????? Especially since I wasn’t really using an acne med before??? I can’t find any good insight. Why don’t things seem to be getting better? Do I need more time? Or am I just messing my skin up by being on it, UGH. Self esteem already at an all time low with pregnancy so I’m just losing my mind. Can’t work, can’t go out, very depressed. ",

I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

She is always spending so much time taking care of her hair, and it takes hours to dry. She has a hair dryer of an unknown brand to me, but I think it's pretty basic. I want to buy her a nice one for Christmas that will help make her hair drying experience nicer, but I am looking at the Dyson website (I hear people like Dyson?) and I do not know what these things are.\n\nPlease help me, I may be a woman but I keep my hair so short it will dry in a stupid formation if I forget to comb it down within five minutes of stepping out of the shower. Budget is, say, $500?\n\nAlso I tried to ask her about it and she says that hers is fine so maybe I shouldn't get her a new one, but I also think that there are things in life that are fine until you get something better and you realize that, oh shit, that actually is better. Not sure if this is one of those cases, tell me off if I'm wrong.\n\n(routine - ngl I would probably benefit from a routine but this post is not about my hair)",
