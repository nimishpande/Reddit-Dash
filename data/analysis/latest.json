      "content": "Early male, 20s. I have two toned lips but nothing really helped with that pigmentation, so I'm not gonna talk about it and I made peace with it. I'll review the spf and non-spf ones separately:\n\n#SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Chaptex spf 15 🟢\n\n- My derm prescribed me this when I had extremely dry and cracked lips (turned out to be cheilitis)\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, no fragrance, doesn't taste bitter, has humectant (D-Panthenol)\n\n- Has only spf 15. I see most people suggesting to use at least spf 30 or higher. I wish they made a spf 30 version\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##2. NMFe spf 40 🟢\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, has slight fragrance (I like it), has humectant (aloe vera extract)\n\n- It tastes bitter, that's the only complaint I have\n\n- Overall: 9.5/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##3. Sebamed spf 30 🔴\n\n- Has slight fragrance (didn't like it), very expensive, wasn't that moisturizing\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##4. Minimalist spf 30 (not in the picture) 🟢\n\n- Super cute packaging (but the lid broke after a few months 🥲), fragrance free, has humectant (Hyaluronic acid)\n\n- it's waxy, not quite easy to spread\n\n- Overall: 8.5/10. Will probably repurchase.\n\n___\n\n___\n\n#Non-SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Vaseline lip therapy Creme Brulee 🔴🟢\n\n- The caption under it says *for deliciously kissable lips* which hurts even more because it reminds me I have no-one to kiss 😭💀\n\n- It smells exactly like the Vaseline lip therapy cocoa butter one, it's very hard to differentiate the smell. Quite moisturizing, love the smell obv\n\n- Little heavy on the pocket (probably because it's imported?)\n\n- Overall: 8/10 (subtracted 1 for the caption). WNRP\n\n___\n\n##2. Vaseline skin protecting jelly (indian version) 🟢\n\n- Almost every Indian household has it lol. It's good, does its job\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##3. Vaseline BLUESEAL pure petroleum jelly (imported) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT! I wish they sold this here in India everywhere instead of the skin protecting jelly\n\n- I bought it from Amazon but I was skeptical initially because of the picture the seller put on Amazon lol.\n\n- It's AMAZING! Seals the moisture very well and I also use it for slugging in the night. It's smoother and more buttery compared to the Indian version we get\n\n- I don't use it on the lips alone, I'll be mentioning my current routine which is helped me the most at the end of the post\n\n- Overall: 11/10. WRP! HG\n\n___\n\n##4. Nipcare 🔴\n\n- Bought it at the expense of weird looks from the pharmacy guy (didn't know it is used by lactating mothers for sore nipples)\n\n- It smells really awful (Lanolin, can't complain), didn't really do much for my lips and it's also not easy to spread it\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##5. Laneige Lip sleeping mask (berry) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT 🐐 helped me so much with my dry lips. Not a big fan of that smell but it doesn't bother me. Leaves a white film on lips and I rub the entire thing off in the morning after waking up and there you go, plumpy soft lips!\n\n- It's probably a little overpriced but it lasts really long so can't complain ig\n\n- Overall: 10/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##6. LRP Cicaplast B5 baume 🔴\n\n- I didn't know you can also use it as a lip balm until I read some of the comments here but it didn't do anything for my lips and they felt even more dry in the morning \n\n- it's good as a barrier repair cream tho, helped me with redness and irritation near nose corners when I increased my tret frequency \n\n- Overall: 0/10 for lips, 8.5/10 for barrier repair\n\n___\n\n##7. Vaseline lip therapy tin (cocoa &amp; original) 🟢\n\n- It was a pain in the a*s to open the packaging but I bought the original one recently and it was super easy to open. Glad they changed its packaging (not sure about the cocoa one tho)\n\n- It's thick, does its job as an occlusive\n\n- Both of them are good. The cocoa one smells heavenly but I personally found the original one to be better.\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##8. Vaseline lip care total moisture (tube) (not in the picture) 🟢🔴\n\n- I love the smell, it's amazing! Very glossy finish and hydrates well. Affordable!\n\n- Hard to apply with that spherical base and I don't like touching it \n\n- Overall: 7/10. WRP\n___\n\n##9. Nova ayurvedic cream 🔴\n\n- My grandma suggested me this one. It's good with the hydration part but the fragrance is veryyy heavy and the lips kinda burn initially after application \n\n- Overall: 3/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##Current routine:\n\nAM: NMFe\n\nPM: Laneige lip sleeping mask + Vaseline BLUESEAL \n\nThis routine helped me so much with dry lips. But not applying lip balm for even 1 day makes my lips dry again. My derm suggested that I use lip balm at least thrice a day and asked me to reapply whenever they felt dry. \n\n___\n\n##HONORARY MENTION: Brillare natural coconut lip balm \n\nWHAT DO I EVEN SAY? Hate is a strong word and I hate this lip balm with a passion. The texture of it is ugly af, it literally sticks to my finger. It smells like shit. I have tried applying it only once and was weirded out with the texture but still wanted to try and apply. This idiot doesn't even spread, it's that thick and sticky. THE WORST LIP BALM I'VE EVER SEEN 🏆",

      "content": "Hello my fellow curlies!  It’s been a long couple of years trying to figure out how to manage the chaos that is my curls, but I’m finally figuring it out!  The biggest thing I’ve learned is to not fight what your hair naturally does.  For years I was self conscious about how flat my cowlick is.  So I put way too much emphasis on volume and that caused years of bad frizz and was just way too poofy.  My hair dresser has helped immensely with figuring out my routine.  Chat GPT was also a game changer as well.  \n\nAlright so let’s talk about the routine.  I use Ouidad vitalcurl shampoo.  Right now I’m on day 4 without it, yesterday I used as I am coconut co wash and honestly I probably won’t need to shampoo for a couple of days.  When I shampoo or co wash; I use verb hydrating conditioner after.  And I’ve learned to always always always apply leave in conditioner while still in the shower.  I use Sheamoisture leave in conditioner with Jamaican black castor oil everyday.  I very gently detangle with a detangling brush when I use my leave in.  After that I take a handful of water and scrunch upwards.  The detangling brush just ensures that the product is evenly distributed, and be gentle when detangling curls, cannot emphasize that enough.  \n\nAfter the shower, I use a microfiber towel as little as possible.  I only use it when I have drops of water falling out of my hair while getting ready for the day.  So I’ll just lightly push upwards to give it a light scrunch as gently as possible to remove that excess moisture.  And then I just try to avoid touching my hair as much as I possibly can while it’s drying.  In the past I have used deep conditioner and olaplex no. 3; the routine I’ve had up until about a week or so ago was probably the only reason I needed that stuff.  I probably won’t need it anymore.  \n\nThe only hard part of my routine now is just trying to avoid getting the leave in into my roots, when that happens my scalp just gets kind of itchy.  \n\nNow I just need another year or two to pass to get my hair at the length I want.  Figuring out the right routine was the hardest part.  Now I just need to continue the good habits and I’ll have my dream hair in a matter of time, I’m super excited!  ",

      "title": "[Acne] AAS-Induced Acne Help",
      "content": "August I began administering \\~150mg/wk testosterone cypionate. By October for sure I started to notice 1-2 new pimples per week. This was particularly evident on my shoulders, back, as well as chest. I've been fortunate that my face has remained mostly clear, with only \\~1 pimple every few weeks or so. Beginning November, I added in 25mg/day oxandrolone (anavar), which is a mild DHT-derivative oral AAS. This seemed to slightly increase the frequency of new pimples--not to a great extent, but noticeable to myself. I've included some pictures of my back. Honestly, it looks worse IMO in person...but, if you zoom you should be able to see some bigger pimples on the lower back, and many small red bump-like marks around. I'm not sure how mild or moderate this would be considered.\n\n\\-Current Routine:  \nAM - Shower with Dial antibacterial soap on face, body (loofa brush for back), followed by 4% benzoyl peroxide creamy wash on face, shoulders, chest, back.  \nStridex 2% salicylic acid pads lightly on face, and over problem areas (shoulders, chest, back).\n\nPM - Shower with Dial antibacterial soap on face, body etc. Sometimes I will follow this with another 4% benzoyl peroxide wash if I think my skin can tolerate it.  \nStridex 2% salicylic acid pads again lightly on face, and over problem areas.  \nStarted to include aloe vera-based facial moisturizer on face and a little on shoulders, traps, chest, neck just to mitigate irritation.\n\n\\-My diet is PRECISE and very low-fat, \"clean\" food. I NEVER eat out. I NEVER eat any greasy food. I don't drink any alcohol. I eat plenty of vegetables, some fruits. I take a variety of health supplements (fish oil, curcumin, D3/K2, Zinc, Ubiquinol, Vit C, NAC, greens powder, L-Glutamine, Magnesium glycinate, Nattokinase, Astragalus). The only dairy I eat is fermented--i.e., fat-free greek yogurt. No cheese or anything like that in my typical diet. I sleep 7-8 hrs nearly every night.\n\n\\-2 weeks ago added high dose pantothenic acid (B5) at \\~2-3g/day, as this has been purported as sort of bro-science remedy for AAS-induced acne. Additionally, I ordered 3 months worth of 10mg generic Accutane from an overseas pharmacy source. This is to attempt a very low-dose isotrentinoin treatment, specifically if my acne progresses and becomes worse. Would likely start as low as 10mg every other day, which is a very low dose from my understanding. This is a back up.\n\n\\-I understand my acne is fairly mild at this point. HOWEVER, I don't plan on staying at 150mg/wk testosterone. My plan is to titrate my dosage to upwards of 300mg/wk, which I've delayed doing in fear that my acne will go full blown at that point. I'd like to get this totally under control before I begin increasing the anabolic load.\n\nIs there anything else you would recommend? I also don't know if using a moisturizer is actually a good idea considering AAS-induced acne is largely caused by increase sebaceous oil production; wouldn't that mean I'm over moisturized to an extent? Thus, wouldn't using stridex pads/benzoyl peroxide dry the skin out enough to bring it down to normal? Adding moisturizer back on top of that would seem to just add more of something to clog my pores? That's just my logic, which I admit could be totally flawed.",

      "content": "My natural hair color is a light brown. My skin tone is pale but warm/neutral, so for years I’ve been getting warm highlights and (I think) it worked well for me (photo 1).\n\nA few years ago my hair started getting very thin and weak, so I stopped doing heavy highlights. Instead, I started toning it to help hide my gray hairs and let my roots grow out closer to my natural color (photo 2).\n\nA few days ago I went to a new salon. I explained that I wanted to hide my grays and maybe add a few subtle highlights. I also mentioned I’m currently doing microneedling treatments to help with thinning and regrowth. The stylist suggested dyeing my entire head a warm tone instead of highlights, saying it would be better for covering grays and less damaging.\n\nPhoto 3 is the result, and I’m in shock. This is not what I expected at all. My hair is completely dyed, much darker and warmer than my natural color, and it doesn’t feel like me. I’m also terrified that fixing this will damage my hair even more.\n\nAll I wanted was a few warm undertones to blend the grays while keeping my actual hair color. Is athis fixable without destroying my hair? :( Any advice from stylists or people who’ve been through this would really help.",

They don't turn into massive pimples and don't last very long, but still extremely annoying as I can't seem to find a sunscreen that works for me.\n\nI also use 5% benzol peroxide wash and the \"Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Nourishing Cream\".\n\nI have also seen something that I should be exfoliating to avoid these kinds of pimples but not sure.\n\nDo you think it could be from this sunscreen?

Follow-up treatments, which she says I might need 1-2 of to treat rebound PIH, is $2000 each.\n\nOur in-person consultation was free, however, and I asked her plenty of questions, but I had plenty more after, which I am asking in the attached screenshots. I sent her pictures of my skin and this conversation ensued.\n\nI *really* don't want to waste more money and I *really, really* want the safest treatment (AKA, no sagging or burns or hypopigmentation!). I'm also not sure what she means by infiltration.\n\nAny red flags or misinformation? Any more questions that would be good for me to ask?\n\nOne of my concerns is that she is an esthetician who has done subcision before, but I read info that subcision should only be performed by doctors.\n\nAny insight appreciated!",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
