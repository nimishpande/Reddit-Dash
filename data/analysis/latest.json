      "content": "\nHi everyone,\nI’m a 26-year-old male and work in acting. I had early hairline recession but no major thinning or crown loss. Because of my profession, hairline design was extremely important to me. Almost every successful lead actor in India has a strong, well-designed hairline, and I wanted something similar—customised and slightly aggressive, while still looking natural.\nFirst surgery (top celebrity clinic in India):\nI initially went to one of the most reputed clinics in India that operates on many celebrities. The plan was hairline enhancement. However, the team mainly worked on the fronto-temporal angles and didn’t significantly improve the central hairline or peaks. The result was okay, but not what I had envisioned. It lacked personalisation and refinement.\nTo be fair, I fully understood their concern about keeping the hairline conservative in case future baldness progressed. Still, I felt the execution didn’t match my expectations, especially considering my case was mild recession and not active baldness.\nAfter around 6 months, once growth became visible, I decided to restart my research.\nSecond surgery:\nThrough Quora, I came across Dr Abhinav Kumar (Patna), an ex-Eugenix surgeon, repeatedly praised by patients for customised hairline design and attention to detail. After detailed discussions, we went ahead with a second surgery focusing purely on hairline aesthetics.\nCurrent results (5 months post-op):\nI’m sharing my current results—a Shubman Gill–style hairline (inspiration only, not replication).\nWhat I’m genuinely happy with:\nStrong but natural peaks\nFlat, well-blended temporal points\nVery fine, single-hair grafts in the hairline\nSmooth transition between hairline and temporal zones\nI’m honestly in love with the hairline. It looks natural, age-appropriate, and camera-friendly.\nFinal thoughts:\nThis is not an endorsement or advertisement. I’m simply sharing my experience to highlight that:\nAll hair transplants don’t have to look unnatural\nCustomisation matters a lot, especially for hairline work\nSurgeon’s aesthetic sense and attention to micro-details make a huge difference",

      "content": "My darling beautiful 4 year old has started puberty early (medically diagnosed) This of course is accompanied by body odour. It’s kinda hard to manage, she obviously runs around like a four year old but unlike a teen it doesn’t even cross her mind to re apply after becoming hot and sweaty. We try to shower daily but those with four year olds know the battle. I desperately don’t want her to be the smelly kid in school. (She also has autism and Poland syndrome so already has things to mark her as different, and now this 😭) \n\nI need a deodorant that seriously works, like will last all day without needing to re apply. Works after running around outside in SoCal weather wearing a polyester Spider-Man costume. \n\nIt also needs to look fun. Again getting her to wear deodorant is a serious battle, I can tempt her if it’s something fun looking. (Also I kinda hate applying something to her that looks like it’s marketed to 30 year olds women) \n\nFinally it needs to be “cool”. If she does have it in her school bag and another kid spots it the brand is considered “cool”. I don’t care if I have to spend stupid money. Even if it’s tried and true but it’s like old lady deodorant it’s no good. \n\nI feel sad and stressed about this situation. Of course I don’t let any of this on to her. We all remember we the stinky kid at school. She is the most beautiful being in the world to me and she is kind and gentle and sweet. I just really want to prevent this one other thing marking her out as different. \n\nAny recommendations will be greatly appreciated. ",

      "content": "I'm a 48-year-old architect with a classic style (shirt, blazer, pleated pants, tassel loafers). Currently, I have a classic short haircut (side part). For some time now, I've been thinking about a radical change to a curly style. I'm considering a perm, very tight, swept back, with lots of volume, like an old lady's perm. I'd like some advice on this radical change. Where should I go? What should I ask the hairdresser? My wife suggests I go to her mother's hairdresser because he's a women's hairdresser and is used to giving older women beautiful perms. She says he'll be able to give me a beautiful \"old-fashioned\" perm to suit my classic and refined style. What do you think? Is it a good idea? Next, I'd like to keep this curly hairstyle permanently (perm like an old lady), and I'm wondering if it will require a lot of maintenance to always have perfectly styled curls. I suppose the perm needs to be redone very regularly. In short, I'm a novice and ready for a radical and permanent change, and I'd like some advice because it's all very new to me, but I really want to have curly permed hair (like an old lady's perm). Thank you very much.",

      "content": "I’m looking for impartial advice about my curly hair.\n\nI grew up never being taught how to care for curls (I was always told to brush it), so I kept my hair very short most of my life. A stylist recently told me I have strong natural curls and recommended growing it out for \\~6 months. I’m about 4 months in.\n\nI’m having a hard time telling whether what I’m seeing now is a normal curly grow-out phase that just needs shaping—or whether my curl pattern/head shape genuinely works better with short hair. I’ve gotten mixed feedback in real life, which makes it difficult for me to evaluate clearly.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n1. Is this current length/shape a normal curly grow-out phase that will pay off if I keep going?\n\n\\- Or does my curl pattern/head shape honestly suit short hair better?\n\n2. If the answer is “keep growing”, should I be doing maintenance shaping (sides, neckline, around the ears) to keep it looking intentional?\n\n3. If the answer is “cut it”, is there a shorter curly style that still works with my natural texture rather than against it?\n\nPhotos are anonymized. I’m genuinely open to either outcome—I’m just looking for curl-informed, impartial feedback.\n\n**Routine**:\n\nI shampoo and condition daily using Paul Mitchell Shampoo Two and Paul Mitchell Detangler conditioner.\n\nAfter showering, I do not towel dry. I let my hair air dry.\n\nWhile my hair is still damp, I apply a light Moroccan oil and DevaCurl cream using my hands. I apply both by scrunching the hair upward while my head is upright, letting the curls form naturally as they hang.\n\nI live in a humid area, so the products are mainly to control frizz.\n\nI do not currently use any protection while sleeping (no bonnet, scarf, or satin pillowcase), and I do not have a refresh routine on non-wash days.\n\nIf there’s anything else I should include for routine context, let me know.",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I’ve been on a mix of topical min and oral min for over a year now. The first few months was just topical then I added in 2.5 mg of oral in the morning and continued with the topical at night. \n\n\nI feel like my face is slightly swollen and I now have much larger under eye bags. It seems like lately my friends, family, and coworkers are always telling me I look “tired” that cannot be good! \n\n\nAny tips here on dealing with this? Sticking my face in a cold plunge every morning sounds awful! \n\n\nAnyone deal with this successfully by maybe going every other day with oral, or even trying to cut the 2.5 mg pill in half?\n\n\nI’m currently stopping the oral min and just going to continue with the topical to see if my face changes at all. \n\n\n\nThanks for the help yall.

But it just happened yesterday. I had pimples and texture on my cheeks i couldnt stand. i applied 0.05% tretinoin , it dried and i saw whiteheads and prominent textire, i basically scraped the texture off. a while later, i did my Am\nroutine and slept and woke up and took these pictures, i believe u can even see the markings i left on my face in one of the photos. \n\nmy main concern is why am i not seeing results from niacinamide? isnt that the product for pore minimizing??\n",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\nI’m dealing with acne and post-acne marks mainly on my cheeks and beard area. It’s not severe acne, but it’s constant enough to affect my confidence. Small pimples keep coming back, and even when they heal, they leave dark marks that take forever to fade.\nI’ve been using tretinoin 0.05% for about a month now (3x a week), along with benzoyl peroxide (spot treatment), a niacinamide + salicylic acid face wash, and a basic hyaluronic moisturizer. I recently started taking Evion 400 as well. I trim my beard (don’t shave).\nI know tretinoin takes time, but honestly, it’s hard to stay patient when your skin looks worse before it looks better. Some days I feel like I’m doing everything right and still not seeing “clear” skin. The marks, uneven texture, and occasional breakouts really mess with my mental state.I’m not looking for miracle cures — just realistic expectations and advice from people who’ve been through this:\nHow long did it actually take for your skin to clear on tret?\nWhen did the “glow” start showing up?\nAny mistakes you wish you hadn’t made early on?\nWould really appreciate hearing real experiences.\n\nThanks for reading 🙏🏻 ",

My problem is that my hair is very long like, down to my butt it’s thick and wavy. I also have bangs that are currently growing out. If it weren’t for the bangs, I would chop it all off, but I don’t want a bob with bangs.\n\nThat’s where I had the idea of maybe getting a sew in, but I’m confused about what I should ask for because I know there are many different types of sew ins. I also really don’t want a closure for my first one, since I feel like I’d be bad at maintaining it. Anyways this was all over the place any suggestions would be appreciated!! ",
