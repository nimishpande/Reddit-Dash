It has been running for two months now.\n\nI always had a feeling that Chetali was carefully and smartly, putting in her paid promotions inside the reels while making it seem like a genuine informed information and today I got the proof\n\nProof number one in one of her recent videos, she has spoken about the best moisturizer for oily skin, and the Foxtale suncreen has been shown as a clear winner, however, if you have been following her series, you will know that she is dead against fragrance, and any other additives Foxtale moisturizer has both. \n\nIn her latest reel for dry skin moisturizer, she has failed Himalaya and Nivea because they use a particular ingredient that has been banned in the European Union because they use fragrance, however logic did not matter in case of Foxtale. \n\nLastly, if you see her reels, clearly she has done paid promotion for requil, formula RX and Be body wise without making disclosures by just making a point that she is giving them a higher ranking\n\nIt is very easy to figure out which product has paid in which product has not paid. If you just go and put a timer on the reel and see how many seconds she dedicates talking about a product that is paid versus what is not paid.\n\n Incase you don’t have context she has done it before in 2024 and 2025 always roasting products that have fragrance and then promoting the L’Oreal glycolic serum which also has fragrance but at that time it did not seem to make a difference to her because she was paid for it. Her values keep changing based on who’s paying her and who is not.\n\nI cannot believe she has come down to this. I was really liking her content, and it was seeming genuine and educated but now knowing what I know, it is terrible it really breaks my heart. ",

Even at the slightest brush of a sleeve against my face, a patch of skin will flake off but stay stuck onto my face. For context, once or twice a week I do apply Tretinoin 0.025% and Clindamycin- Benzoyl Peroxide (not on the same night of course) and I take a daily Spironolactone pill. I have tried the La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 cream, but I found it too heavy and greasy on my skin. Any advice would be helpful! ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

      "content": "**\\*Disclaimer: I'm speaking about my own unique experience and my results might not reflect the experience of others**\n\n\\- You really do have to trust the process. As hard as it is, you need to do your best to not let the obsessions of \"is it working? am I below baseline? etc\" takeover. You could take pics and stare in the mirror everyday and still be wrong about what you're seeing. Just let go, take the meds, and live your life. If I were to judge my progress based on my feelings throughout majority of treatment I would have said I was a non-responder. But in reality, it took me improving so well to a point that even my anxieties couldn't deny my progress.\n\n\\- Patience - You didn't lose all your hair in a year. It took years to get to where you are now, even if you're in the early stages of lose. Don't expect miracles in weeks/months.\n\n\\- Obsessing over shedding is (mostly) useless. Every shower I'd make note of how much hair I saw fall and think \"no hair fall = no more hair loss\". But every shower had my hands covered in so much hair which filled me with anxiety. Every time I run my hands through my hair at any point in the shower I'd see 10-20 new hairs fall and freak out as I'd be losing 100+ hairs at once. However, despite shedding that much, I was growing more hair than I lost.\n\n\\- Scalp health is important. Find products/shampoos/etc that take care of the skin as you would your face.\n\n\\- Dut + oral min is the god damn TRUTH\n\n\\- You really don't realize how long you've been going through hair loss. It takes a decent amount of hairline recession or significant scalp visibility for hair loss to really click in the minds of people. But by that point you're already a NW 3. It's genuinely fascinating what the mind will deny until it's too late. You'll look at old photos and try and pinpoint where you believe the fall off began and tell yourself \"signs started to show 2 or 3 years ago\". I have this one particular photo of myself in 2022 that I'd look at and think \"God, if I could ever get back to that point I'd be so happy\". No visible scalp showing and my hair looked great. I recently came back to that photo and was stunned. Comparing myself now to that photo, it's clear to me that I was already thinning. I had to go back 10 years until I saw a photo where I had hair similar to what I have now. It took 10 years for me to get to a diffuse NW3.5 when I originally thought it was 3.\n\n\\- Hair thickening is just as valuable, if not more, as regrowth. Thicker hair follicles can do wonders for coverage than obsessing over hair count. 100 thicker follicles can lead to better coverage than 150 thin hairs. A thick 2.5 can easily look like a NW1 - So don't get too heartbroken obsessing over your hairline not lowering.",
