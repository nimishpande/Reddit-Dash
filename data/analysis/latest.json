I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I have even done some hot oil treatments, professional mask with essential oils, cornrows as protective styles, now finger coiling (because i have not had definition otherwise) over 6 years now. \n\nNow, I have seen SOME progress. But my hair has been consitently dim, stringy, dry to the touch, hard to get my fingers through, and has really bad breakage at the front and crown of my head. I also struggle with definition most times.\n\nFor context, i had an active lifestyle: i did kickboxing, and i like to go out whenever i need to on short notices. And I chose to go natural for one reason - to get healthier hair. \n\nNow, i need 5 hours​​ to style my hair, lasts me all week - BUT when i workout (no,  pineapples do not help) my hair becomes a sticky frizzy mess. It feels like weekly torture, because through it all I walk with unhealthy hair and cramped limbs... \n\nProfessionals, even the curly natural ones, have failed my hair, they always say it is heat/chemical damage, but i have not been using heat at all and have not used done relaxers since 6 years. They reccommend treatments that broke my bank, but have not changed my hair at all (but 2$ DIY treatments helped???)\n\nDoubts and stress have been getting to me and am about to consider protein treatment/keratin/silk presses - at least I can stop worrying about styling. But I am SO scared of going through damaged hair rehab AGAIN. \n\nWhat would you suggest? Thank you so much for reading through this.​\n\nMy current routine:  \n\n1. shea moisture curl n shine shampoo \n\n2. Shea M manuka honey &amp; yogurt hydrate + repair  conditionner \n\n3. Shea M jamaican black castor oil strengthen and restore curl cream​ \n\n4. Flaxseed gel (DIYed). \n\n5. Sometimes i use grapeseed oil on my scalp.\n\n6. I clarify using a sulfate based shampoo occaisionally (Le petit marseillais force et eclat)\n\n7.I blow dry with cool air\n\n8.i sleep in with a silk/satin bonnet and a satin pillowcase \n\n[9.No](http://9.No) refresh routines, curls refuse to revive if manipulated after styling\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ichsjvejlcg1.jpg?width=3456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d49ef1a166910c5d8567ae53a172694b3cb412ff\n\n",

I have always known my hair was like a frizzy type of wavy but it has never looked remotely like this before.\n\nI sent a photo to my friend and she suggested I start a curly hair routine. Currently, I use Pantene rosewater shampoo and conditioner, and then scrunch it a bit and let it air dry. I wash with shampoo/conditioner every other day. My hair is dense and greases up easily, so I worry that heavy products like creams wouldn't work on it. Any recommendations from those with a similar hair type?\n\nThank you!",

I have rosacea and sensitive skin so want to make sure that I’m still looking after the area.\n\nOne of my main concerns is using CC creams and moisturisers. Is there a way to blend in a green based cream so that it looks consistent with the rest of my face? At the moment, it just clings to the hair and is only slightly helped by a makeup sponge.\n\nShould I also continue to use treatments like azelaic acid on the area? Is there anything I need to avoid? Have a decent amount of what seems like hormonal acne on chin and not sure how to manage otherwise.\n\nThanks :)",

It started on my forehead and around my nose, and now it’s on my chin and around my mouth.\n\nI’m traveling, so several things changed at once: very dry indoor air (heater + AC), worse sleep, heavier moisturizing (Cetaphil + occasional Vaseline), and one new product (Torriden Dive In serum). I also had a 6-hour Korean digital perm a few days ago—lots of time in dry heat and exposure to strong chemical fumes (nothing touched my face directly).\n\nMy skin is normally stable, not acne-prone, and low-maintenance. This texture is new for me. The bumps aren’t very red, but I can feel them spreading, and moisturizing + humidifier haven’t helped.\n\nThis feels more like irritation or a reaction than dehydration (similar to how my face reacts if it gets exposed to bug spray).\n\nWhat should I do next? Is this contact dermatitis, fungal acne, or something else?\n\nPLEASE HELP 😭",
