You can see exactly where it snapped in the pictures.\n\nI used to bleach my own hair before. It was never perfect, but it never broke like this. I always used cheap bleach powders (under $20).

I tried the slide test and it was smooth which would mean low porosity I guess. Some people said just doing an observation test is best so I tried that. It took about a minute to get fully wet with no manipulation. It takes quite a while to dry naturally too. It is also quite shiny so (I think?) it is safe to assume I have low porosity hair.\n\nRight now I use Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus curl and shine shampoo with the Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus curl and shine conditioner to tighten my curls and wash it about 3-4x per week. Now I want to grow my hair out more to shoulder length. The end goal is a wavy wolf cut style. The problem with my current shampoo is that it makes the curls too tight whereas I want something that will make my hair more loose and wavy to reach my intended style. After looking online I found the Bumble and Bumble Surf Shampoo &amp; Surf Conditioner however it is rather expensive and I don't know if its right for my hair.\n\nI saw some people saying I should be looking for shampoos that fit my hair porosity rather than style however I am seeing way too many opinions on this and I don't know which to follow. I don't know much about hair at all and no one in my family has hair like mine so it would be helpful to know what to look for.\n\nSome extra information in case it is required: my hair is longer on top ranging from 7-15cm and slightly shorter in the sides. The ends of my hair curl and coil whereas the the base of my hair is quite wavy and tends to sit. I'm 21 and male.\n\nI really don't know much about hair or what to do with it so any advice is welcome. If more information is needed then let me know.\n\nBased off of this What shampoo and conditioner would be best for me? Or at least what should I be looking for. ",

Currently, I am using the Eucerin Anti-Pigment products every day.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with similar post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and can recommend products, creams, or peels that help?\n\nHow long do you think it will take for the spot to fade?\n\nThank you very much and best regards",
