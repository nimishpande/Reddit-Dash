It might help someone.\n\nI attached a picture for reference as the final result, which is as accurate as possible. \n\nA few months ago, I started taking my health seriously. I began going to the gym and improved my diet. Skincare wasn’t even on my list, but as I focused on nutrition and fitness, my skin started improving automatically. Later, I wondered how much more I could improve it if I paid attention.\nPhysical activity helped a lot. I go to the gym, but you can do anything  running, sports, or any exercise that makes you sweat and pushes you a little. It contributes more to your skin than people think.\nI don’t go outside much, but for those who do, use sunscreen. Sun damage is real  I’ve seen it on my own skin. Prevention is always easier than fixing it later.\nI had blackheads near my nose and occasional pimples. During my research, I learned that excess oil can cause many skin problems. At that time, I was drinking over 500 ml of milk daily, so I reduced my fat intake. My thinking was simple  if I consume less excess fat, my body may produce less oil. It actually worked. Now I take about 300 ml of milk (mostly in tea) and roughly 35–40 grams of fat in total. Don’t reduce fat completely ,it’s essential just avoid excess.\nI also noticed that whenever I ate outside food frequently, I got pimples. So now I mostly eat clean home food and keep outside meals limited. Balance is important  you don’t have to eliminate it completely.\nI sleep around 7–8 hours, follow a high-protein diet with normal meals, and since I don’t eat many leafy vegetables or salads, I take a multivitamin to cover any gaps.\nMy theory was that the body can heal itself if you provide the right things and in my case, that turned out to be true.\nSo instead of spending too much money on skincare products to fix problems, try fixing the root cause first. Reduce excess fat, stay physically active, eat mostly clean food, sleep properly, and use sunscreen\n\n\n",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I know the directions are to use it twice a day but my skin is very sensitive and dry in that area so I’m scared to burn my skin.\n\nMy cleanser is the Iunik centella mild cleansing foam, and on days that I wear makeup or sunscreen I double cleanse, using the Anua heartleaf pore control cleansing oil. I always dry my face with paper towels\n\nAnother important factor is that I’ve recently started the Yaz pill (along with an existing implanon), about 2 weeks ago.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.

Was it really this simple?!” But now unfortunately it feels like a mild sunburn on my skin.\n\nI mentioned this in my last post that I had only been using adapalene twice a week and benzoyl peroxide for spot treatment, and then using other actives the other nights, and I was told “adapalene and benzoyl peroxide are well researched at being effective for skin turnover and ridding bacteria if you use it daily” and that it wouldn’t be effective the way I was using it. But my concern was that my skin is very sensitive, so I kind of feared this very thing.\n\nWill my skin just adapt to using adapalene every day if I just keep using it?

But either way I still comb my hair out if there is a alight bit of frizz at the top. I use a comb for curls and it works well! But my mum insists i need to brush it out. But today she did and now my hair is a frizzy mess. Theres a few curls but they aren't sitting right. \n\nSo recently ive started to treat my curly hair properly. For years I believed it was just wavy hair and had to keep brushing it because it was always so frizzy. Went to the hairdresser and they said I dont have wavy hair bjt curly hair and should start treating it better. So i started a routine:Tesco apple shampoo, Cien Uv protection ray shampoo, Cien conditioner hair mask, tesco apple conditioner. After I apply boots curl cream when wet and some oil before diffusing then I sleep with a microfiber cloth and my curls stay in. Everytime I wake up, my hair is still super curly and for once not frizzy but my mum goes on and on about how it is. She also brushes with such a force for some reason that I literally feel my head be pulled back. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice for this. Do I wait till the next hairdresser appointment and hint at it so she will listen to the hair dresser? She won't listen to me because im 17 and I apparently dont know better\n\n",
