      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "hi all!\n\nI need y’all’s help!! I’ve had curly hair my whole life (duh), but I RARELY wear my hair down (I’m talking like once every two months). My hairline is receding :( it is noticeable to literally no one but me (and secretly I think my husband but he’s too kind to say anything), and I have a lot of hair, so when I mention it to people they always roll their eyes. Regardless, I can tell a difference. Presumably, it’s because I pull my hair up. I do like my hair and think it’s very pretty. I even think I look better when it’s down. I cut my hair (waist length to chin length) in January with hopes that it would encourage me to wear it down more often and take better care of it. I’ve realized I hate it in my face though, and thats why I’ve always pulled it up. \n\nThe thing I’ve liked the most is wearing it down with sunglasses pushing it back. I think a regular headband makes me look like an egg, but the way sunglasses push my hair back is flattering. I did that a lot this summer, but harder to get away with when it’s cloudy and winter lol. Also! Whenever I wear my hair down by the end of the day, even when it was at its shortest, the underside is almost matted. Idk if I just need to be combing the underside throughout the day or what, but it’s crazy tangled at night. \n\nI don’t want my hairline to disappear, so please teach me how you wear your hair down everyday without going crazy. Will I eventually desensitize myself to it touching my face? Should I shave my head?? I need any and all advice pleaseeeeeeeee\n\n\nmy routine: (also I’ve included a pic of my hair if that helps) \n\nwash days (once a week-ish)\n-dove bonding shampoo and conditioner like normal (if my hair is really dirty I’ll do a round of head and shoulders first)\n-dove bonding mask for 5-10 minutes\n-cantu cream if I’m wearing it down  (prayer hands and scrunched) OR literally whatever gel my husband has on hand (same application)\n-air dry \n\nother days\n-bio silk in the mornings if it looks dry \n-rosemary oil at front of scalp usually 3x a week\n-just started viviscal  ",

In the past two years or so I’ve realized my hair actually is wavy and I’ve been looking into caring for my hair more. I have dyed my hair often since I was 16 (~10 years) but I am trying to grow out my natural hair, recently cutting 5 inches off, and seeing how I feel about my natural color since I haven’t barely seen it in a decade as well as trying to let my hair get healthier. \n\nMy current routine is CHI Luxary black seed oil shampoo and unwash conditioner but these were for vivid hair color care. Are either of theses still okay to use? I used a moisturizing cream for like two months which did help but it was super expensive for very little product. I then dry with a cotton towel and wrap it as I dry off then free my hair and let it air dry. I would love any advice anyone has for me. \n\nI have read through the beginner guide but do have some thoughts and questions. For example, I live at a very high altitude (~8500 ft) and it is super dry up here. Does anyone have any advice to keep moisture in my hair? I am also autistic and the thought of the crunchy gel sounds awful to me sensory wise. Is it needed or can I use just stay in cream or something else? \n\nThere was a brief few months where my hairdresser gave me a moisturizer that is not recommended here but that is some of the best waves I have had. Just any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\nPhotos:\n1) me at 12\n2) natural hair 3 years ago (only shampoo and conditioner)\n3 + 4) my hair with the same shampoo, conditioner, and a moisturizing leave in cream",

Between old scars, skin thinning and new scars from a previous moisturizer, and random flare-ups from trying “new” products, it’s been a rollercoaster.\n\nThen I stumbled upon this Derma Co 4% ceramide barrier repair moisturizer, and honestly? The redness calmed, my skin feels plump, and it’s finally hydrated without causing flare-ups. Before,my skin was rough and scarred in a way that make me cringe everytime I looked into the mirror, now it's noticeably calmer. The scars aren’t magically gone, of course, but my barrier is slowly repairing, and that counts for something.\n\nI feel like this moisturizer deserves more love because I literally can’t find a single post about it anywhere. It’s been the only good skin thing to happen to me this year, and that’s saying something.\n\nIf you have sensitive, acne-prone, or dehydrated skin, this might be worth a look.\n\nRating: 4.5/5 – would recommend for anyone looking to actually calm their skin without drama.",

      "content": "I recently started using **Adapalene + Clindamycin gel** for my acne and pimples. It’s only been a few days, and I’m trying to figure out how safely I can use it.\n\nI have a *lot* of blackheads on my nose, so I wanted to apply it there too, but I’ve seen a bunch of people online saying not to use adapalene on the nose because the skin there can get irritated or peel badly. Is that true? Is it unsafe, or just something that requires being careful?\n\nAlso, can this gel be used on the **entire face** (avoiding the usual sensitive areas like around the eyes, corners of the mouth, etc.)? Or is it supposed to be used only as spot treatment or only on certain zones?(also can it be used on areas with fine lines, for example the \"smile lines\" area, cause i read somewhere that adapalene aso help in removing fine lines by increasing cell turnover)\n\nWould appreciate advice from people who’ve used this combo or dermatology-knowledgeable folks.

Also, where I live, people act like it’s weird if someone uses sunscreen in public, so reapplying at school isn’t really an option.\n\nI usually apply around 2 fingers of sunscreen on my face and 1 finger on my neck in the morning.\n\nMy question is:  \nDo I actually need to reapply sunscreen before the 3 PM ride, or is the morning application enough since I’m indoors the whole day?\n\nAlso, if it helps:\n\n* It’s a mixture of chemical + physical filters.\n* I’m not sweating much during school.\n* I’m not rubbing my face a lot.\n\nWould love to know what others in similar situations do, and whether reapplication is necessary or not.\n\n\\[Edit: I forgot to mention that I use other actives daily.

      "content": "Ever since I graduated highschool I've been getting horrible break outs. I have no idea how I was able to pass that stage during highschool... And it seemed like I took it for granted.\n\nI came across this brand called Skalli Essentials. I found their content convincing and bought their acne bundle which included: Sulfur soap, rosewater, and black seed orange blossom moisturizer. At first my acne cleared up a bit due to finally cleaning my face. Now I keep getting breakouts randomly.\n\nI went to Sephora for a makeup appointment. The artist asked what I used for skincare and I told her my routine. She said the sufur soap is too drying and then recommended products $30-50 dollars each. I can't really afford those atm. Some of those were Exfoliants which I had ordered from Yesstyle for cheaper and had yet to come.\n\nI looked on Google and it said sulfur soaps don't cause acne? I'm a bit puzzled. I really want clear skin... Tbh the reason why I'm getting into makeup is part due to my acne insecurity. Any insight would be appreciated. I also use Cyperus Rotundus oil to prevent hair growth on my chin and neck, Green Tea and Rice PDRN serum, and Retinol every 3 days+ Cetaphil SPF 50 (tbh it does make my skin a bit oily) everyday. I use a clean skin club towel to wash the cleanser off.",
