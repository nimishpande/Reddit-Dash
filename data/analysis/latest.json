Hv approached many dermats as a kid n nothing helped. So I basically gave up on skincare n stuff. Only time has healed my skin. I still get acne. Like 5-10 a month including period acne) I randomly landed up on reddit skincare pages n was basically scrolling through it. Heard from some how micellar has helped them with comedones and stuff. Decided to give it a try. And ngl, with 2 days I could see drastic changes in my skin. The comedones have drastically reduced on my forehead. Micellar also helped me with acne. If there's any acne flaring up, I just use micellar on it and the next day the acne is gone pretty much.\n\nI used Garnier pink cap.\n\nHow do I use it:\nNight: I clean my face with micellar water using cotton pads or any clean smooth cotton cloth. Then I wash my face with a cleanser. Then proceed with my night routine. (Which is basically just applying moisturizer. I use ponds super light moisturizer as I hv oily acne prone skin)\n\nMorning: I clean my face with micellar water (my face gets all super oily in the morning) and then I wash with a cleanser. Apply moisturizer and sunscreen (I use solasafe sunscreen)\n\nPs: I still hv some comedones on my skin. But micellar has made a huge difference. Also it's been a week + since I started using it.\n\nI now hv to work on my skin texture too.",

So l stopped that completely, just resorted to water and it became way better.\n\nAlso I noticed, when in was on a vacation in South-Asia (more humid and hot) my skin was perfect! Literally perfect (only used sunscreen).\n\nMy skin is very sensitive, I easily blush and get red (especially now in the cold months -Germany+snow).\n\nMore on the drier side, but relatively normal.\n\nI would just love to know what this is called, it doesn't look like typical acne?, what I have so that I could research it myself.

      "title": "2 years on Dutasteride/Minox, so much hair loss, not sure where to go from here",
      "content": "10 years ago I started Finasteride and topical minox (rogaine) once a day. At the time I think I was a norwood 4 and now I believe a weird 5. Back then I had a huge bald spot on the crown with a couple hairs left, temples were receding, hair all over was thinning. But I still kind of had hair. I've been shaving my head for 20 years, but not everyday if I am lazy about it. Even with the receding temples I still didn't mind my head that much back then because I shaved it often and I could see that 5 o clock shadow covering a decent part of my bald head at least looking at me straight on. I guess that is what I mean by I kind of had hair. I wasn't happy, I was balding, but I had something. I thought I was doing something great for myself by starting these meds. I had high hopes for Finasteride and Rogaine. But it didn't work. I was very slowly losing hair. Not aggressively, but I could see it happening. I hung in there for years hoping something would change for the better or I would at least stop losing hair. Heard about Dutasteride 2 years ago and jumped on it. Slowly made the transition to Duta from Fin with advice from Reddit people. I really thought this would work. Still doing my topical minox. But in the past 2 years things have gotten worse. The crown's bald spot is getting bigger, my temples are really receding big time, and my hair is thinning out really bad especially in the front to mid scalp. The biggest change I have noticed on Duta is the receding hairline. And the thinning of the front/top. I should note I also tried microneedling when I first switched to Duta. Hoping between the switch to Duta and Minox and microneedling, I'd have a good chance. I'm honestly not sure if microneedling worked. It might have just a little bit. A little bit wasn't worth it to keep going because I didn't enjoy that at all. I did what I read on here. 1.5 dermaroller, once a week. I just can't see myself doing that forever. Lack of visual results is discouraging as well. I wasn't seeing anything new happening. So I stopped after about 2 months. \n\nSo nothing has worked and I'm depressed about it. Yes I shave my head. But I am not happy being bald. I'm just content with it if I have somewhat of a 5 o clock shadow there. But there is no question my hair has gotten much worse since starting Duta. I can tell when I am bald and when I grow my hair out a little. I can't say \"Duta cause this\". I just know hair loss accelerated once making the switch. That's all I know. I'm not sure if I should hang in there. I feel like I will be completely bald in a year from now at this pace. I am thinking of switching back to Fin because at least I was very slowly losing hair. But then I am switching back to something that wasn't actually really working. Fin wasn't stopping my hair loss. Just stopped it better than Dut. After 10 years of this I am just very annoyed. I can't give up though. I'm not okay being bald. I've looked into other stuff. The SMP I've thought about a lot but 99 percent of the ones I see do not look natural and I can't imagine it looking any better up close in real life. But, I still consider it because might be my only option. It's just, when I shave my head, there are no dots on my head, not even small ones. I'd want SMP to match my shaved head and I don't think anyone can pull that off. I don't want dots. I've never seen it in real life though so I have no idea. And then I could do Hair transplant - well what is the point if I can't even make these medications work right? I really don't want to spend the money on a transplant anyways. But I would to get hair. But all those doctors say you have to stay on Fin or Dut to make it work so what's the point. I believe oral minox would give me results. But, I just can't. I do not want more body hair or face hair. I have enough problems. I hate body hair and extra face hair. It's so crazy how to get hair back on my head I have to get hairy all over. I've read enough people saying they get really hairy everywhere. I guess that doesn't bother them but it bothers me. If I was guaranteed a full head of hair on oral minox, sure make me hairy all over. But with my luck. I'll just lose more hair on my head and gain more hair on my body. I saw one of those red light therapy baseball caps on Amazon tonight for under $100. Could that work? lol. I mean right next to it is the helmet for $800. So I guess that would mean the $100 is junk? I can't spend more than $100 to test one of these things because I have no idea if they will work. I do Keto, and take no vitamins. Maybe that would help? But I don't see that turning things around much at this point. I see the pills for saw palmetto but not sure. Biotin but not sure. I'm reading about topical fin and topical dut. But I don't know. How would I decide between the 2? Flip a coin. If the pills and minox don't work why would they though? Could taking 2 pills of Dut a day make a difference? Or one of those full 5's of Fin a day? I asked my derm and she said she won't prescribe that. When i first started this HIM's was not a thing. Now I see it everywhere. Should i be going through them for the same stuff? Maybe there is something magical in there? \n\nSome of you have great dermatologists. The derms I have gone to promote that they do hair help, yet seem to know nothing. It's as if they read an article or two. And I bring up what I read on Reddit and they say \"stop reading Reddit\" lol. The people on here know much much more than the derm's I have met.  I had an appointment yesterday and asked her what I should do and she just said it's up to me and rushed me out. Is there somewhere else I can go to talk about these medications? Bosley or something? I called them and they just wanted to talk about hair transplants though. I can sit on here and read every posting and in the end it's not really helping. This works for some people, and doesn't for others. I'm just unlucky. And jealous of those I see this working for. I want to fight for the hair I have left on my head but not sure what to do from here. ",

On the picture is my hair today as I washed it yesterday.\n\nWhen I was younger, I had very curly hair (around type 3B), but I only started properly taking care of it fairly recently. My hair is quite fine, I believe I have low porosity and medium density.\n\nI’m facing several issues:\n\n* I think the products I use might be too heavy for my hair. My curls don’t hold very well, especially in the lower sections that were bleached a few years ago.\n* I can’t seem to get curl definition at the roots. I’ve been using a claw clip technique for a few weeks now, which has helped a bit with volume, but not enough.\n* I feel like my hair has more potential, but I can’t find the right routine. My hair gets tangled very, very quickly.\n* I also think I would benefit from a haircut adapted to curly hair, but I’m afraid to go to a hairdresser. Do you know of any easy tutorials for trimming or shaping curls at home?\n\nHere is my current routine:\nI wash my hair once a week with:\n\n* OGX Coconut Curls Shampoo\n* A clarifying shampoo once a month\n* Aussie Bouncy Curls mask once a week\n* Kurl Nectar hair primer by Les Secrets de Loly\n* Skala Expert gel\n\nI use a heat protectant spray, diffuse my hair, then put it in a pineapple with a bonnet. In the morning, I scrunch and apply a bit of oil. I don't really refresh, just keep it in a bun until I have the energy to redo my whole routine.\n\nI often hear about proteins and other stuff, but I don’t really understand how it works or whether my hair needs it. Do you have any advice or product recommendations, preferably cruelty-free?\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to read all of this.\n",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "I just got my first curly hair cut experience. I’ve worn my hair curly for years but haven’t actually gotten a cut specifically for curls.  It was a salon that specifically does curly hair and I was sent home feeling like my hair wasn’t actually finished or done well. \n\nFirst she cut off like 5” instead of 2-3” like we had agreed upon. Then told me I needed to switch to a side part when I specifically said I’d like to keep my center part. It still had the gel cast when I left and wasn’t shook out so I couldn’t actually tell at the salon if I liked the cut or not. The stylist told me not to touch it till I got home so the style could set. In all of this I was skeptical, but thought, “Hey, she is the professional so maybe she knows something I don’t. Let’s see what happens.” Not even my bangs were curly when I left, everything was so flat. (Pic 1)\n\nI bring more waves/curls out of my hair at home than this lady did in the salon. I have 2c/3a fine hair but a lot of it. Their routine used Ouidad Advance Climate Control shampoo and conditioner and gel, scrunched it after, then diffused it dry downward the entire time. When I got home and oiled the gel cast out, I decided to also dampen everything down and sprayed curl refresher in, then scrunched more and that brought out curls that my stylist seemed to not be able to mange. (Pic 2)\n\nWhen I called to say I wasn’t satisfied with the cut (I wanted a butterfly cut with shorter layers but the stylist said she didn’t like doing short layers because the ends thin out too much), they said I could come back but they will only dry cut my hair and they won’t be shampooing/blow drying/styling it afterward. Is this standard? I have to come in with clean, brushed out hair. But when I leave it won’t be styled either so I’m trying to figure out how I’ll know I’m happy with the cut if I’m leaving the salon right after they just combed through my hair even more to cut the layers. It’ll be a different, younger stylist thank god. \n\nPlease point me in the right direction. I feel so sad about my first “curly hair experience”. I was really hoping to learn more about styling and caring for my hair and I’m disappointed I did. What should I be expecting or asking from the salon when I go back this week for the correction?\n\nPic 1 - Cashing out at the salon with gel cast\nPic 2 - At home after dampening and refreshing curls\nPic 3-6 references for what my hair has been",

I try to move it to the back but even with long hair it gets in the way and falls back. I swear every time I try and put it in a pony tail, it gets a ponytail dent and kind of clumps together. I hope this makes sense and I’m open to anything!\n\nHere’s my routine:\n1)detangle in the shower with ouidad curl quencher\n2)put in pattern moisture milk \nAnd not your mothers mousse\n3)use a curl comb (the one with ridges on the side)\nThat’s it (if you have suggestions please leave them!

My front pieces randomly coil and the top layer is wavy while the back of my hair is straight. I’ve attached a pic of it dry without any products or it touched (it’s not really a good one but it’s the only one where it shows kinda). Everytime I also try to brush it out, my hair it becomes all frizzy and poofy and looks dry. I’ve recently looked into how my hair could just be wavy, and everytime I try a routine my hair goes from looking dry, wavy-ish, and frizzy to oily, stringy, and still frizzy! I’m looking over my routine and I’m not really sure what I’m doing wrong.\n\nHere’s my routine:\n1. Cibu Repair + Protect shampoo and conditioner 1x (or if it’s been over a week and I’m sweating from the gym, I’ll do both 2x)\n2. Olaplex No. 6 BOND smoother leave-in style treatment. I basically rake it though my hair either using my fingers or a brush.\n3. Not Your Mother’s Activating Curl Talk Mousse. I section my hair into two (I have very fine hair) and I apply the mousse via the prayer hand method then scrunch until I see a pattern form.\n4. Miss Jessie’s Jelly Soft Curls gel. I use about a blueberry to quarter size and scrunch it like 1x or 2x. \n5. Usually I don’t diffuse (I air dry), but yesterday I had to because I had to go out. I do the cup method and I waited like 6-10 minutes for each section of my hair. I also started from the back because that’s the most pin straight. I don’t have a picture, but my hair looked pretty uniform for once. It’s only after I got up this morning it started to bend like it does in the pic &lt;/3.\n6. OGX Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco: Extra Penetrating Oil dry &amp; course hair. Like 90% sure this is the main cause because when I use it, my curls don’t feel soft—just oily and crunchy. I also scrunch it into hair.\n\nI’m not sure if it’s the brands or the amount of products I’m using that’s making my hair look this way—or if I just have really damaged straight hair. Please help I start classes tomorrow and I don’t wanna look like a mess 🙏.",

      "content": "Long post ahead. FWIW, I think my hair is probably more wavy than curly, but I definitely have some curly pieces and I figured it would be better to post here than [r/wavyhair ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wavyhair/)because this sub seems to have more activity. Images above are my hair after getting wet and then air-drying with some scrunching, but no product.\n\nFor some background, I used to have very curly hair as a toddler but then it straightened out somewhat as I got older. My parents never really knew what to do with my hair, as it’s always been very thick and unruly— my mom’s hair has only the slightest wave and from what I’ve heard, my dad‘s used to be pretty curly, like perfect ringlets, but he grew up keeping his short and now doesn’t have any, so not much help. Basically I’ve gone through my whole life with my hair looking like a puffy mess— I regularly attack it with a plastic brush, and sometimes I use detangler too, but still it’s pretty much a pyramid of frizz by the time I get home every day. It also has a tendency to develop snags and tangles in specific patches— there’s a pretty nasty one in the back that always seems to develop no matter what I do. I’ve grown up being told by stylists that my hair has some natural curl to it, but I don’t know how to treat it so I just default to the treatment I was raised with meant for straight hair, and the cycle repeats itself. Until very recently, my routine has just been whatever shampoo and conditioner we keep in the shower, then brushing my hair out once it’s dry, but clearly that hasn’t worked very well for me. For the past few weeks, I’ve been washing with Super Nature Aloe Shampoo (not specialized for curly hair, but the label says it is sulfate-free) and Aussie 3-Minute Miracle Moist Detangling Conditioner every couple days, going through with a wide-tooth comb in the shower, scrunching, and wearing a bonnet to bed, and that’s definitely made my hair easier to manage, but it’s still not quite where I want it to be. I just feel so overwhelmed with all the different products and routines and I’m not sure where to start.\n\nMy main goal is simply maintaining my overall hair health, as I think years of treating it like it’s straight have probably led to some damage, judging by how easily it gets frizzy and tangles. But I’m also hoping for a more defined wave or curl pattern. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to get it back to where it was when I was little, but as you can see from the pictures, it‘s pretty curly in the bottom layers and closer to my neck, then the outer layers are more limp, with just a few curly pieces. I’d like to get that same kind of definition on the outer layers too if possible, but I’m not really sure how to achieve this.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

The aquaphor isn’t helping either, it’s not absorbing anymore and stinging. It is winter time but this is the first time this is happening to me.\n\nI’ve also noticed eating salty foods makes them burn/feel even more raw and irritated!\n\nAnother weird thing, when I squeeze my lips together, they feel “damp” like some type of moisture it coning through them but it’s not enough. (This happens when they feel raw)\n\nIt’s getting to the point where they are always bothering me, I was thinking of using Jack Blacks Overnight lip serum but could there be potentially another underlying issue?\n\n(I’ve also tried Laneige lip masks in the last and they also didn’t work, they just irritated my lips/made them more dry)\n\nThank you!
