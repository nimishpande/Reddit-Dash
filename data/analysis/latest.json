      "content": "Hey everyone! I have been having a big issue with frizz for quite a while and I was wondering if anyone would be able to tell me why/give me some tips on how to fix it. My curls are usually shiny and decently defined in the front and then the back is almost always not defined and frizzy. The back of my hair seems to be more coarse as well. My routine is as follows:\n\n1. Shampoo with Tresemme Shampoo (it’s not always the same type but lately I’ve been liking the Keratin Smooth one in the red bottle). I use a silicone scalp brush to make sure I get rid of as much residue as possible from my scalp\n\n2. Condition with Tresemme conditioner as well (usually either the Rich Moisture one or the Bouncy Curls one). I comb through the conditioner with a wide tooth comb and then i usually do a loose braid and let the conditioner sit for a couple minutes\n\n3. For styling, I usually like to use LUS brands step 3 All-in-One leave in but I am currently out of that so for a while now I have been using Cantù Coconut Curling Cream. I use a brush to saturate it all in my hair. I use a microfibre towel to scrunch out excess water and then I use praying hands to apply medium hold gel (most of the time it’s Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel but recently I have been trying the Olaplex number 10 gel). \n\n4. I scrunch my hair again with the microfibre towel and air dry until almost fully dry and then I diffuse until it’s completely dry. After it’s dry, I add the Argon Oil of Morocco penetrating oil, scrunching in and loosening the cast of the gel. \n\nEven after all this, I almost always end up with frizzy hair in the back. I even try to take smaller strands in the back and spray them with more water and make sure they’re totally saturated with product but nothing seems to help. I can never get even definition around my head. Any help is welcome 💔",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I oil my hair one night before shampoo. I cannot use oil all day as it makes my hair very heavy and difficult to manage. I use coconut oil btw.\n\nOn non shampoo day i just use water and then the parachute hair cream. Recently I have started oiling my hair on non shampoo days and just wash it with water.

      "content": "Hi all, recently I’ve been paying more attention to my skincare. I’m mostly happy with the way I look, but wish that my skin looked less textured and dull and dry, and more glassy. I wear foundation, and don’t like the way the makeup sits of top of my skin, almost like it congeals on my face? I always have lines where I applied it with a brush or bright spots where the pigment collects in my pores. I think I have oily skin (but get flakey spots where pimples heal) but no matter what formulation of makeup I try (or what type of sunscreen/ primer combo I try underneath) I have the same issue. My routine is as follows: \nPM: double cleanse with garnier micellair gel (the charcoal one) and Cerave gel moussant anti- imperfections. Every two or three days I use the ordinary granactive retinoid 2% emulsion, and every night I use the Cosrx overnight rice mask. \nAM I use beauty of joseon rice and probiotics spf 50, and apply my makeup over top. \n\nThis is a very simple routine so I’m sure adding a few products could help, but I’m not sure what should go where. I use minimal products in the morning because it seems the more I use (moisturizer, primer) the worse my foundation looks, regardless of the formulation. Maybe I’m just using the wrong problems, or missing something?  I would appreciate any feedback, thank you in advance! ",

I use dove dragon fruit body wash and strawberry milk body lotion from a Japanese brand I believe. Unfortunately, my skin has been really dry and itchy after and I get eczema flare ups. I've only been doing this for 4ish days so far. On day 4 I got really itchy and started just showering in the evenings and I'm still itchy / dry and flaky.\n\nIs there anything I can do to continue this routine or do I have to change it? I love how it makes me feel and smell which is why I'm hesitant to go back to my original routine which was olay body wash and no lotion once a day or two. I really love the dragon fruit smell from dove. If I must go back to the way things were than I will, but I wanted to try here first to see if anyone had any advice.\n\nThank you!!",

My issue is that I'll be done with washing and have soaking wet hair (I don't use any leave in product as my hair is thin and fine) and I'm just at a loss with how to \"set it\" to make it look natural. After rinsing my conditioner out it's all plastered to my skull/face. I'll try using a wide tooth comb to maintain curl clumps and get it to stop sticking to my head/give it some lift at the roots, but it always ends up being obvious which directions I combed it in, and the roots will be a little straightened out. If I try scrunching it bunches my hair into different obvious \"zones\" and exposes my scalp more. I've also tried shaking out my curls but it always looks weird and frizzy that way too. The shaking out bit might work better with gel but I struggle to get it to disperse when I scrunch because there's so little length and I end up with the \"zones\" again...\n\nI'm at a loss, any tips are super appreciated! Thank you!\n\nWash routine:\n1. Clarifying shampoo (occasionally subbed for maui shampoo)\n2. Leave in maui moisture volumizing conditioner for 5min\n3. Wash out conditioner with a little bit of maui moisture volumizing shampoo\n4. Air dry (heat is too damaging)",

Every time I accidentally touch or rub it, I go into a full anxiety spiral.\n\nThe worst part is that when I get anxious, I end up doing the same thing over and over again, touching and checking the skin to “see” how much I might’ve stretched it. It just makes everything worse, but I can’t seem to stop.\n\nI’m honestly exhausted. I feel paranoid almost every day and I hate living like this. I know I probably need mental health help, but that’s just not possible for me right now.\n\nAnyway, yesterday I felt a bit of pain on the inside of my mouth while eating, and since then I’ve been obsessively pushing my tongue against my cheek, pressing food or water against it, and just constantly checking it. Now I’m terrified I might have stretched my skin and its going to sag now.\n\nplease be honest, have i done any significant damage by doing that yesterday? and does anyone else struggle with something similar to this?",
