I get ropey waves\n\nSeparating them does nothing other than turn them in skinnier ropes waves and it just looks like I have dreads.\n\nI know my hair can not do this, as it's happened before, and that's because it was the 2nd day, I steamed my curls in the shower and ran my wet hands through them. Unfortunately no photo since it was a once in a lifetime experience I'm sorry.\n\nI don't know why we need to submit a routine just for basic help considering nobody knows wtf products we use if we're not from the US but hey! here you go:\n\n1. Sulkin volumising conditioner (protein) or garnier watermelon conditioner \n2. Redwon teatree shampoo (clarifier) or garnier watermelon shampoo\n3. vo5 megahold gel\n4. sometimes a leave-in conditioner on the ends\n\nOther methods I've tried:\n\n1. Scrunching conditioner in the shower upside down (no)\n2. Only using gel on the ends/mids (no)\n3. Not diffusing my hair (no)\n4. Diffusing my hair (no)\n5. Deep conditioning my hair (no)\n6.

Huge mistake. \n\nFirst of all, nowhere on the packaging have they mentioned that this is a tinted sunscreen, I went and bought this completely unaware of this. \n\nSecond, once you apply this on your face it will give you the worst white cast you've ever seen, it might put Casper the ghost to shame, it's so hard to blend and it will take you a very long time to get it to settle down. You have to pay attention to areas like your eyebrows and the corner of your lips to make sure this is blended otherwise someone might mistake it for unblended concealer.\n\nAfter probably 20-30 minutes it will start looking somewhat normal on your face. \n\nI would not recommend this to even my worst enemy. \n \n",

      "content": "Whenever I get my hair cut the hairdresser will pretty aggressively comb my hair beforehand causing a bunch of breakage usually, in order to prevent this I started to carefully dry comb my hair before going so that it's easier to get through but there would still be a bunch of hair snapping when they go through it again.\n\nMy hair is pretty tough to get through since I have very dense but fine hair with 3a curls, I get a bunch of snapping when I comb it too just a lot less, is that normal?\n\nThe last time I went I washed it the night before and put conditioner in and then they said my hair was greasy and washed it again in the salon, are you not supposed to put conditioner in? Do you just wash it with shampoo and let it dry right before going? My hair is like ultra dry so that really only makes it worse usually.\n\nI've been to a couple hair salons but usually it's the same issues and my hair always comes out in much worse shape than before.\n\nMy current wash routine once a week:\n\nWet the hair thoroughly, put in shampoo and rub the scalp, wash it out, put it conditioner, wait 5-10 minutes (sort of a hair mask light honestly), comb it with a wide toothed comb while the conditioner gives it slip getting some breakage often due to knots, wring it out a little, put in a leave in conditioner while still wet and comb it out again this time I don't get any breakage, put a tshirt on my hair but I don't tie it up or anything it's mostly just to keep my wet hair off my body while I do skincare like lotion and also my face, then I take the tshirt off and put argan oil in my hands and run them through my hair to coat it and then I let it air dry.\n\nDaily I wet my hands with water and my fingers through my hair to wet it a little and then I do the same with argan oil to coat them again. Getting some snapping the process too.\n\nAlso my hair really sucks like it's always frizzy and dry no matter what I do, So I guess general help would be appreciated too.",

I‚Äôve decided to skip the polynucleotides for now but am keen to go ahead with HydraFacials and microneedling.\n\nHer plan was: HydraFacial followed by microneedling 2 weeks later, for 4‚Äì6 cycles. That would take me roughly to March, after which I‚Äôd need to maintain.\n\nI‚Äôm committed for the long run and happy to sustain treatments as needed, but I‚Äôm conscious of budget (wedding expenses!) and want to avoid overcommitting to something that could snowball in cost.\n\nMy question: Does anyone have tips for streamlining this approach while still getting excellent results? For example, spacing treatments out more, reducing the number of HydraFacials early on, or any other strategies to get some great results.

      "content": "Curious as to what our thoughts are on this as curlies. Given that dry brushing is verboten, how would we have dealt with our hair back then? And is there something we can learn from the Victorian routine that would help increase our hair health today in general? We all know that washing regularly isn't good for the hair, but it's the detangling part that needs to be done, when wet and with a ton of conditioner.\n\nDiscuss!\n\n----------------------‚Äê----------------\n\nVictorian Hair Care: Why They Washed Less‚Äîand Looked Incredible\n\nFlip through any 19th-century portrait and you‚Äôll spot it immediately: women with thick, mirror-like hair twisted into gravity-defying styles. Waves that fall just so. Shine that almost glows through sepia. The twist? Most of them weren‚Äôt washing their hair very often‚Äîsometimes not for months.\n\nThat choice wasn‚Äôt laziness. It was strategy.\n\nBack then, the soaps on hand were heavy-duty, made with lye‚Äîthe same harsh alkali used to scrub floors and clean wool. Great for grease; terrible for long hair. A single wash could strip away protective oils, leaving hair dry and fragile. For men with cropped cuts, the damage was tolerable; you could trim and start over. For women whose hair often reached the waist or beyond‚Äîand who were expected to keep it for life‚Äîrepeated washing was a recipe for breakage.\n\nSo Victorian women built a different routine.\n\nNightly brushing wasn‚Äôt a romantic myth; it was a rule. About a hundred deliberate strokes with a boar-bristle brush. That brush choice mattered: the slightly rough bristles lifted dust and flakes while sweeping natural scalp oils‚Äîsebum‚Äîdown the entire length of the hair. Instead of shampoo doing the conditioning, biology did. The result was cleaner roots, nourished ends, and a consistent, natural gloss without water or soap.\n\nThe famous volume and architecture of their hairstyles wasn‚Äôt smoke and mirrors either. They used ‚Äúrats‚Äù‚Äîsmall pads made from saved hair combings or soft fibers‚Äîto create lift and fullness. Styles were not only pretty; they were protective. Pinned up, hair was shielded from soot, smoke, weather, and friction, which helped it stay healthier longer.\n\nActual washes were occasional and intentional‚Äîmaybe monthly, sometimes less. On wash day, water had to be heated; rinses might include eggs, beer, herbs, rainwater, or vinegar to soften and add shine. Drying waist-length hair took ages and care, often by the fire or in sunlight, because wet hair is at its weakest. No wonder wash day was an event, not a routine.\n\nPeriod beauty guides treated all this like science. They detailed how to section hair, the angle of the brush, the pace of each stroke, and‚Äîcrucially‚Äîhow to keep the brush clean. In a world where a woman‚Äôs hair was rarely cut and was bound up with ideas of health, status, and respectability, hair care wasn‚Äôt vanity. It was social currency.\n\nSo they brushed. Every night. For years.\n\nIf that sounds surprisingly modern, it is. Today‚Äôs dermatologists often suggest easing up on shampoo frequency, and the ‚Äúno-poo‚Äù crowd argues that over-washing fuels oiliness by stripping the scalp. Victorians got there by observation: you can‚Äôt change the chemistry of your soap, but you can change your habits. They chose a method that worked with natural oils instead of fighting them.\n\nThe Victorian playbook in a nutshell:\n\n Fewer washes with gentler rinses.\n Consistent, thorough brushing with boar bristle to redistribute oil.\n Protective styling to reduce daily wear and environmental damage.\n Patience and ritual over quick fixes.\n\nNot dirt. Not neglect. Just a different kind of wisdom‚Äîone that trusted routine and nature to do what a bottle often can‚Äôt.\n\nTheir hair was their crown‚Äîand they learned how to keep it shining.",

And now, at 12pm it looks like this... so in around 4h it loses all curl, what am i doing wrong? Do i have wrong products or too much?\n\nWhen i curl with curling iron they hold longer, but also i feel like i barely have any curls in the evening.",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
