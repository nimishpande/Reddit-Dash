The hair distribution is noticeably sparser than my other brow and no hair at all grows where the scar is. Right now I’ve just done a quick tidy up with the tweezers, and brushed some of the longer hairs over the scar to cover what I can. \n\nI don’t wear makeup a lot these days, and I’d prefer not to get any tattooing/ microblading done. I have used a brow pencil or powder to try and cover the scar in the past but the skin texture there is more shiny, and it’s difficult to make it look natural; it tends to really stand out especially under fluorescent or natural lighting.\n\nI’d like to know:\n\n1. How obvious is it to the casual observer? What do you think when you see my brows?\n\n2. Could I be shaping my brows differently or using a different technique to minimise the contrast in brow density and hide the scar a bit more? I have pretty much just had the same bare minimum routine for 10+ years (plucking the strays in the middle and on the forehead area plus a few from underneath). \n\n3. Has anyone had a similar issue and used any sort of hair growth product they could recommend to successfully grow hair over scar tissue, or at least increase density of hair distribution?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice 😄",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I’m trying to see if a protein treatment would help restore my curls. I find myself washing my hair more because I can never refresh my curls after sleeping - after two days, my hair is very dry/coarse,frizzy and greasy (even if I put my hair in a bonnet or a pineapple bun). \n\nMy daily routine:\n\noccasionally use Olaplex Bond Maintenence shampoo/conditioner as clarifying \n\nswitched to NYM naturel curl defining shampoo and conditioner when not clarifying (not a huge fan so far- used to use ouidad moisture lock s/c)\n\nbrush when wet, then Ouai leave-in conditioner\n\nMiss Jessie feather soft curl cream or davines curl serum\n\nsometimes use Ouidaid gel cream in substitute of a curl cream\n\nscrunch and diffuse, then add a hair oil \n\nany type of mousse or gel leaves my hair so stiff and even after I scrunch with oil. My curls get really greasy if I apply too many products or do the CGM. \n\nWith my latest routine, tried to restore my curls by using a deep conditioner mask for 5 mins, then leave in and mousse while still in shower but my wet hair was still straight even after scrunching - it was only when diffusing that some of the curls/waves arrived. \n\nI’m trying to see if I have moisture overload. I used to do the LOC method (leave in, oil, curl cream) and my curls were great! But my hair is not curling even when wet so I am at a loss of what to do. Please let me know if a protein treatment would help or am I due for a trim?\n\nThank you!!!",

In my head, this would be far easier to maintain but it’s stressing me out slightly. \n\nMy hair routine currently looks like this: \n\n\\- wash (Monday hair care shampoo) \n\n\\- comb hair into correct parting etc\n\n\\- spray sea salt into hands and run through hair\n\n\\- finger comb and squeeze curling jelly (Umberto Giannini) into hair \n\n\\- comb brush through to separate curls \n\n\\- scrunch moisture out of hair with a t shirt \n\nNOW HERE is where the problem arises. When my hair is wet/damp, I absolutely love it! However, as soon as it dries and I break the gel cast, parts go flat. I know this is partly (or mainly) due to the fact that my hair is very short and therefore won’t curl, but it’s extremely annoying. \n\nI have tried diffusing it but the curls were too defined (I prefer them loose) and it still didn’t change the flat bits of my hair. I have also bought a silk turban which I will wear at night to see if that can help me out. \n\nToday, I didn’t break the cast and I hair sprayed on top of the gel (just as an experiment) and I really liked the look of it.\n\nSorry for the extremely long posts but does anybody have any advice for me? Here are photos of my hair either damp, or with the cast still on. \n\nThanks so much in advance! ",

I don’t know what it is caused by, I change my pillowcases weekly and disinfect my phone. \n\nMy current routine is as follows, it’s very simple for now. It’s been this way for about 6 months. At one point I was using more actives (azaleic acid, niacinamide, lactic acid) but I decided to stop as i didn’t see any significant improvement and they tended to irritate my skin. \n\n*am:* rinse face with water, celimax dual barrier creamy toner, sometimes cerave facial moisturizing lotion, beauty of joseon spf50\n\n*pm:* oil cleanser, if active acne benzoyl peroxide cleanser, 1x a week celimax cica bha blemish toner pads, celimax dual barrier creamy toner, sometimes cerave facial moisturizing lotion, differin adapalene gel 0.1%\n\n*spot treatment if active acne:* sulfur powder from the ordinary \n\nI welcome any product suggestions, advice, or thoughts about the products I am currently using. \n\nRegarding the actives cited above as irritating to my skin, I would be willing to try them again,\n\nmaybe introducing them more progressively. \n\nThank you all for your time !",

Now you’ve taken it to a whole new level.\n\nI’m curious who thought it was a good idea to utilize a 6-month-old baby in an ad called “slow hair growth” and showcase that same baby at 17 months with beautiful hair as though the baby’s hair actually flourished because of your oil?\n\nChildren grow. Their hair grows. It’s called science. You didn’t invent evolution.\n\nLet’s talk about your lack of common sense - you aren’t even a brand that specializes in children. What was the reason you used an infant in an advertisement, in order to have parents feel that their child is growing at an unacceptable rate?\n\nThis isn’t marketing, it’s desperation and to do so using an innocent infant.\n\nShould you, instead of using infants to gain emotional sympathy, focus your time on developing a solid product for adults? You already have a damaged reputation.\n\nSome brands really will stoop to any level to sell.",

Anyone else have this experience with Ouidad products? \n\nBummed bc I liked the way my curls turned out. Please share suggestions on products to replicate this look and will help with longevity!\n\nRoutine: washed with Ouidad clarifying shampoo and Ouidad moisturizing conditioner, cut while damp, styled with Ouidad moisture lock whipped curls daily co &amp; primer, Ouidad leave-in conditioner, and Doux mousse def texture foam, dried with diffuser almost fully but semi/damp strands and roots when I left\n\nI use a satin bonnet with sleeping, but it slips off often from tossing. I usually try to go 2-3 days without restyling my hair and don’t normally use any products other than oil to touch up between days. ",

Over time, it has slowly expanded and now covers a larger part of my back and slightly towards my shoulders. It doesn’t itch and usually feels smooth, not rough or painful. Its mainly a cosmetic issue (colour/texture change).\n\nI have been to three different dermatologists and got different opinions:\n\n* One diagnosed it as lichen amyloidosis\n* Another said its chronic inflammation\n* Another said its something that can’t really be “fixed” and is cosmetic\n\nI have been using prescribed creams and moisturisers, but I am not sure if its helping much. It seems to slowly expand over time, which worries me.",
