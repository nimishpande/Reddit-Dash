My hair is oily at the root and dry at the ends. I used to use the Maui shampoo and conditioner for the longest time but about a year ago I started using redken all soft shampoo and conditioner, then for about the last 5 ish months I switched to the redken extreme length shampoo. I think it damaged my hair I use no heat on it. It has white dots on the ends and it looks like split ends all around my hair. I am hoping to get a haircut this weekend. I just got the purology sheer shampoo and conditioner and the clarifying shampoo buttt I am not sure if that will fix my hair. Any help will be appreciated:) it is making me go crazy lol",

He also started to read from his computer, “you should keep taking dutasteride and do prp to help with hair loss” before sending me on my way. \n\nI see lot of posts of people saying “my dermatologist told me this or advised me this”, but we lack those options here and merely have to use forums and peoples experiences to help us.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Recently I went down the curly hair rabbit hole, and after 31 years of life I’m wondering if I could be missing out on my hairs full potential.\n\nFirstly, I wonder how most of you would describe my hair? I honestly don’t know if it’s curly or wavy, sometimes I get ringlets but they are usually underneath, so I think I must have an uneven curl pattern? \n\nSecondly, I wonder if some of you will have some tips and tricks for me based on my hair type. Here is what I have found so far: my hair seems to be softer and look less frizzy with less product. It gets poofy when I brush through it, so I avoid brushing when between washes. Plopping and air drying seem to be better for definition than diffusing. I have a lot of hair (length and thickness), which might be weighing it down, but honestly I don’t think I want to sacrifice my long hair. \nCurrent routine: wash 3x a week, using it’s a ten shampoo and conditioner, brush in the shower, apply ouidad mousse, brush again, plop and air dry, then oil.\n\nAny advice is welcome.\n\nThanks all!!",

I want my skin to be calm, smooth, and makeup-friendly, and I'm worried that continuing these products might make things worse or affect how makeup sits on my skin.\n\n* ﻿﻿Should I continue using these new products, or would it be better to simplify my routine?\n* ﻿﻿Is 6 weeks enough time to calm my skin and improve texture?\n\nI asked my dermatologist whether I should use these new products or any products with active ingredients before my wedding, and she said yes, but I don't fully understand why, given the redness I'm experiencing.\n\nAny advice or personal experiences would be really appreciated. I'm honestly feeling a bit stressed and scared that it might be too late to get my skin in good shape before the wedding.\n\nThank you",

I’ve noticed that a lot of the breakage is from my scalp. Super long pieces of hair will slowly pluck out throughout the day. And it’s really bad in the shower. I’m pulling out a lot of hair. \n\nAdditionally, my curls have begun to lose their pattern after the first day of showering. They scrunch up and stay pretty curly for the first day. But starting even the second day they start to straighten out now about halfway through my hair length. My scalp has also started to get greasy and my hair by my scalp gets flat way sooner than it ever did, infact, hair grease altogether is a super new change to my routine. Everyone has hair grease. But for really my whole life my hair never got greasy to the point i even noticed it. And now it is starting to happen even 2 days after showering. \n\nAny suspicions on what this could be? Are not your mother’s curls really rich in protein? And while my hair is clearly thinning and falling out maybe it’s too much? Any ideas would be appreciated. This is really taking a huge blow to my confidence and I’ve been super depressed about it. ",
