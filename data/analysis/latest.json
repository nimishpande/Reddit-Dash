      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "3 months progress on 1mg Oral Finasteride and 5ml Topical Minoxidil. I micro-needle every 7-10 days or so. I also take cheap vitamin tablets: biotin, vitamin D, iron and zinc (have no idea if they do anything).\n\nBalding slowly since my late 20’s diffusively and never did anything about it until now.\n\n1st pic (wish I’d taken better pics) is the evening after I’d micro needled earlier in the day ready for the first minoxidil application. I went pretty hard, that’s why there’s loads of tiny scabs. I don’t really get scabs like that anymore, my scalp must of gotten used to the abuse.\n\n2nd pic is earlier today in bright sunshine. My hair’s a little greasy from min still but thought it was good light.\n\nAs you can see I was pretty far gone, probably Norwood 6/7. I didn’t really expect any kind of result but had nothing to lose. I was kind of amazed to see loads of tiny hairs pop up within probably the first 12 days. I never expected to get much regrowth due to my age and how long the hair had been gone, let alone as much as this in the first 3 months. I just hope the progress continues, the new hairs are small and fine like a new born baby’s but I have coverage over the entire scalp where it was practically slick bald. Best case scenario is that they continue to mature and I start to have the near appearance \nof a normal head of hair (though reminding myself to be positive yet realistic). Wish me luck and I hope this gives someone as far gone as me a little hope that some progress is possible, like so many other peoples posts have given me. Wish I’d known about these meds when I was younger!\n\nWill probably do an update later down the line.\n",

I do have some layering which hasn’t seemed to help much. \n\nRoutine:\n\nI washed my hair x2 (kinky curly clarifying shampoo or Nizoral when needed) and no conditioner because sometimes I feel like it just looks better without? Then I sectioned and brushed in Rizos Curls defining mousse with my bounce curl brush. After I scrunched in four pumps of Innersense I create hold gel and then plopped for a bit. I then did a bit of air dry and then went in with a diffuser. I slept with it in a banana clip on top of my head and my satin bonnet.\n\nOther info about my hair:\n- I would say I have a lot of very fine soft hair\n- It starts to get frizzy pretty quickly out of the shower\n- my hair appears to dry fast but still takes hours for it to fully air dry\n- my hairdresser said I have low porosity very healthy hair and just recommend an air dry cream but the cream doesn’t help with the hold/definition at all (R+Co air dry)\n\nAny help/recommendations would be greatly appreciated! 😊",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?

Any idea how to make my hair softer or more prone to styling? It's pretty straight and I always wanted wavy hair, but no matter what I do it doesn't do anything.

I have oily skin, and I want to understand all possible causes — even the most remote — so I can tailor my routine better.\n\nHere’s what I currently do:\nMorning:\nMinimalist cleanser during bath\nMoisturizer\nSunscreen over moisturizer\n\nEvening (when I have time):\nCleanser\n10% Niacinamide serum from_____ (applied on slightly damp skin)\nMoisturizer\nSleep\n\n\nLifestyle notes: I drink 4-5 cups of chai daily (sugar varies)\n\nConcerned about possible impact of chai on skin. \n\nOily skin prone to uneven texture and tone.\n\nI recently came across some tips on using Vaseline in skincare routines, mainly as a hydration sealant on clean, damp skin, but I’m worried about using it with oily skin. I want to know the best way to add Vaseline without worsening oiliness or breakouts, and which parts of the routine it fits into.\n\nMy main queries:\n\nWhat can be the causes of uneven skin tone, including less obvious or remote reasons?\n\nHow can I improve my routine specifically for uneven tone with oily skin? \n\nWhat key steps might I be missing?\n\nHow should I incorporate Vaseline into my current routine without causing excess oil or clogged pores?\n\nDoes drinking multiple cups of chai a day affect the skin significantly, and should I be adjusting anything because of this?\n\nAre there any other lifestyle or skincare factors I might be overlooking that could contribute to persistent unevenness?\n\nAny advice, product suggestions, or insights would be hugely appreciated! Thanks in advance.\n\nPS: The query was initially asked to an AI, since I'm not a one directional dude, I decided to ask those at reddit too. The wording are though from the ai. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone, apologies for the long post but I'm very new to this subreddit as I have recently discovered I have curly hair and have lots of questions. After years of not being able to dry brush and constantly frizzy hair, you can imagine my realization when I find this sub.\n\nAnyway, I read through the 80 page google doc wiki and still have a few confusing questions about curly hair maintenance. For reference, I'm 25m with medium length, fine texture, medium density, high porosity hair. I *think* my hair type is 2C but I'm not 100% sure.\n\n\n\nHere's my current routine before getting into the questions:\n\n1. SHAMPOO: kristen ess clarifying shampoo 1x a month, otherwise shea moisture intensive hydration shampoo 1-2x a week as I feel like I need it\n\n2. CONDITIONER: shea moisture men avocado butter &amp; manuka honey deep conditioner daily. I also co-wash on days I don't shampoo and fully rinse this out. I use a wide tooth comb to brush my hair in the shower.\n\n3. LEAVE-IN: after I get out of the shower, I use about 6-8 sprays emulsified in my hand of shea moisture hydrate + repair multi-action leave-in.\n\n4. CURL CREAM: shea moisture coconut &amp; hibiscus curl &amp; style milk, I put about a penny sized drop into my hand and emulsify before scrunching into my hair\n\n5. OIL: if my hair feels dry or I shampoo'd, I use 2-4 drops of cliganic argan oil. after this I just let it air dry, which usually takes \\~1hr\n\n\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. am I really meant to only \"wash\" my hair every 3-4 days? I go to the gym 4x a week and sweat profusely in the summer, I feel like I absolutely need to shower and at the very least condition my hair daily.\n\n2. the wiki says NEVER brush unless we are applying conditioner in the shower, but then there's a section on brush styling which also confused me. I've been styling my hair with just my hands when scrunching my products in, but once it dries it looks really messy like I just got out of bed. It's sitting the way I want with no crazy flyaways, but it doesnt have a \"clean\" or neat look, I suspect I need to brush but in my experience brushing has always made my hair frizzy in the past when I've used a standard hair brush.\n\n3. the wiki recommends just styling with gel, but there's also a section talking about LOC (or LCO), when are you meant to use which? My guess is that when you're doing a \"refresh\" such as getting ready in the morning you do the LOC method without gel? or is it more of an alternative to using gel instead?",
