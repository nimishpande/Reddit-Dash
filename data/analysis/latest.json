      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoeâ„¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

This has made me so insecure I feel so ugly everyday and I've been trying so many skin products and regimes for at least 2 years and nothing has really worked. I'm hoping that with my current weight loss that will target some issues( currently 155 trying to get down to 130) and please if anyone has any pictures or experiences of having my type of skin then losing weight and it improves please share. I just really don't know what to do I'm at my wits end and seriously just considering a facelift. Please give me your much needed advice about what you think I should do involving my skincare.",

I've found that most products that are marketed to us typically just use the same \"natural\" ingredients (Shea butter, thick oils etc) while all other hair care brands use science backed ingredients with years of clinical studies to assert their claims. \n\nHair products marketed towards curly and coily hair never endeavour to use cutting edge hair science in their products and tend to just use the same rudimentary ingredients in their formulations. Why do you guys think the divide exists? Do you think theres a stigma towards innovation within black hair care vs what we've always used? Do you think this mindset does more harm than good for black hair?\n\n(routine)",
