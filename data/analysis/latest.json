      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

This is something to the point where often people can't tell I even have curly hair because of how often it's straight and sometimes people are shocked to find out my hair is naturally curly. That itself,is an issue of its own. I know the only way to work against that is to minimize heat damaging my hair but aside from this, what can I do to take care of my hair better? The most recent photo of my hair is with the red ends! \nWhen I wear my hair curly I feel like the shrinkage is so bad and I lose so much length and my hair gets so puffy and frizzy. Im also confused on what curl type I have, where Im on the scale between a,b,c and 1,2,3,4. I know due to damage my curls aren't as bouncy and spiraled as they really can be. It's like I can't get the right product ratio when styling as well. ONE time in high school I got it perfect and I can't imagine ever experiencing that again😭. \n\nThe hair 'routine' I usually use is I wash it about maybe once a week, for shampoo/conditioner I use Native or Monday generally. Sometimes Dove or Herbal Essence. I normally don't put much product in my hair, generally  leave in conditioner and maybe a little gel. I used to go crazy with it and do a whole hair cream, conditioner, mouse, gel, the whole nine yards and I felt it didn't make much of a difference. I also do sleep with satin pillow cases if that's important and have considered getting a bonnet. ",

This redness won’t go away, it’s been like this for months, and the skin won’t heal! It feels scaly and dry now all the time. I also have acne all along my jawline.

Comb (but only on wash day) then scrunch, and finally \"scrunch the crunch\" a few hours later.\n\nI am aware that SheaMoisture and Cantu are bad brands for my hair type (unfortunately both of which saturate my \"cabinet\", due to \"advice\" from people other than me...), but I cannot just change them now as some of them were recently gotten (although recommendations for the future would be very, very welcome).

I use my hands to splash it off.\n\nMoisturize with Cerave moisturizing cream.​\n\nPut Vaseline on lips.\n\nVery simple. I repeat this every morning and night. I should add that I also shave my peach fuzz whenever it grows back.\n\nI'm not sure how to tell if my face is oily or dry, but I have very dry skin and eczema everywhere else on my body. Because of this I assume the skin on my face is also dry and sensitive.\n\nShould I exfoliate, start using retinol, use different products? Everyone seems to have a different answer to every problem.

      "content": "I’ve been noticing a lot of consumerism, marketing gimmicks, and wrong skincare trends especially things like topical glutathione, 7-step routines, and overly hyped beauty serums. So here’s some simple, dermatologist-backed guidance based on personal experience and expert advice:\n\nA basic routine will always beat a complicated one. It saves money, protects your barrier, and gives long-term results.\n\nSunscreen: Use it daily (preferably a pharma-clinical grade sunscreen with a blue-light protection filter) and a lip sunscreen. If you have active, inflamed acne, avoid applying sunscreen directly on top instead use shade, or stay indoors.\n\nCleanser: Use a gentle cleanser. Double cleansing is recommended on days with heavy sunscreen or makeup and its encouraged to do so if you have oily skin. You don’t need morning cleansing cold water is enough unless you’re producing too much oil. keep the Cleansers with actives on your skin for 45 seconds before washing it off.\n\nMoisturiser: Choose one according to your skin type. Ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramides are helpful.\n\nThat’s all you need. If you have skin concerns, choose one active only. Get a dermatologist assessment and lean towards pharma-grade medicated products, staying consistent with one routine for at least 3 months before changing anything.\n\nRetinoids: Tretinoin is a holy grail as retinoids help with cell turnover and target many major concerns. Glycolic acid , adapalene, and azelaic acid also work well when used correctly (start slow, sandwich method, apply in moderation).\n\nExfoliation: Avoid physical scrubs and herbal DIY remedies. Only use chemical exfoliants like AHA/BHA (salicylic, glycolic, lactic acid, etc.) and use them sparingly.\n\nSheet masks: Expensive and wasteful; the fiber isn’t great for skin or the planet.\n\nToners: Mostly unnecessary. Just dampen your skin with rose water or plain water before applying products to improve absorption. All products like snail mucin, peptides, ceramides, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid should be used on Damp skin while \npotent actives should always be applied on dry skin ideally 10–15 minutes after washing.\nWhen the skin is damp, absorption increases too quickly, which can push strong ingredients deeper than intended and lead to irritation, or burning.\n\nEye creams: Often unnecessary. Under-eye darkness is mostly genetics, sleep, lifestyle, and makeup (some studies show kajal contributes to darkening).\n\nTrends: Don’t blindly follow trends like slugging with Vaseline. It only works if done properly because petroleum jelly is an occlusive  it must be layered over good hydration and only if your skin type suits it.\n\nK-beauty: Korean skincare products aren’t automatically suitable for everyone. Their products are created for Korean climate and skin, and true “glass skin” is usually genetics + aesthetic procedures.\n\nHyperpigmentation in brown skin: Brown skin produces more melanin when healing. So if glycolic acid, shaving, or any method “darkened” your skin, it’s usually because: • your barrier was weak • the product was overused • sunscreen wasn’t applied properly Barrier repair + fewer actives + gentle care is the real solution.\n\nHair removal: Face shaving and laser is usually gentler and better because they don’t pull hair from the root, unlike waxing/threading. (If you have PCOS or hormonal issues, treat the root cause first.)\n\nVitamin C: Not every active is essential. Vitamin C is helpful but potent having the ability to damage your skin instead. improving your diet with these nutrients is often more effective than relying solely on the serum.",

I wash my hair once a week (any more and my hair might suffer) I have fine thin hair, although apparently I had a ton of hair when I was younger (puberty ig) I use the Not your mothers defining curl talk cream and curl talk sculpting gel. I use hair growth and thickening oils. Such as cliganic jojoba oil, Moroccan oil treatment in light, Bur Bur and go lab beauty oils. I oil my air everyday and since it’s pretty light it never wears my hair down. I typically air dry but I thought a diffuser (which I’m returning it sucked half of my hair into the back of the fan and I had to yank my hair out…all that progress to keep my hair healthy out the window) \n\nNow the issue is, my whole life…my hair has always been curly, thin and stringy. Bad combo. Unless I used 0 product and my hair was frizzy, which in then my hair looked awful but it at least looked huge with volume. I’ve tried routine after routine. I’m just exhausted I can’t wear my hair any way and I don’t apply heat. I think I have high porosity hair, mousse weights my hair down, so does most leave in conditioners, I spent so much money buying products I just leave those two out of my routine. Idk what to do. My hair dries fast. Maybe less than an hour to an hour? When I was younger it used to take FOREVER for my hair to dry. But my hair was also severely damaged back then. Even if I do finger curls it just separates into stringy bits. Any advice? \n\nTLDR: my hair is thin and super stringy, finger coiling doesn’t work. Any advice? ",

I use MCT oil after the shower on my scalp/face to also keep it at bay. \n\n**Thank you for your help in advance!**\n\n",

I stripped my routine in the start of the year to literally just cleanser and moisturizer and my skin cleared up well but there are still some concerns I have aside from acne now.\n\nI added the retinol back in only two weeks ago and am not super consistent with my oil cleansing and really only use it on weekends when i wear makeup.  \n\n1. my skin is very dehydrated but I need a moisturizer that won’t break me out \n\n2. my black heads on my forehead, chin, and cheeks and closed comedones on my chin really bother me \n\n3. I have some minor red marks left from old acne \n\nAny suggestions welcomed! ",

If so, is there an alternative I can use? Thanks!!\n\n(skincare routine on second slide)",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

I’ve changed my skincare routine a loott months, it feels like, because nothing seems compatible with my skin. I went to a dermatologist and she basically just told me to use retinol. It does help, because when I stop using it I break out, but everything else she recommended wrecked my skin since it’s super sensitive. Right now I’m using a really simple routine, and honestly I don’t think it’s working at all. My acne is inflamed with tiny red bumps under the skin and a few on top. In the morning I use Purpose Gentle Cleansing Face Wash and Dr. Althea 345 Relief Cream. I can’t find a sunscreen that doesn’t break me out, so I don’t wear any even though I’m very pale. At night I use the same face wash, Differin adapalene gel, and Pond’s dry skin cream (I know… but people recommended it). That’s it. Feel free to roast me.",
