For the last few months they have been so limp and lifeless. I finished my bottle of expensive curly conditioner and just could not afford another $40-$50 for a small tube. \n\nSo off I went to Walmart and picked up *Tresemme Botanique Nourish &amp; Replenish* for $6. I've done 2 washdays with it now and the difference is incredible. I haven't changed anything else in my routine and my curls haven't looked this good in forever! \n\nJust goes to show that more expensive does not always = better. We don't have to spend hundreds of dollars to have our dream curls. And don't be afraid to try things even if they aren't marketed towards curly hair.",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I am including a before photo of what it normally looks like. \n\nMy hair isn’t super curly, but it’s also not pin straight so I went to a stylist so see if she could help. She cut some face framing layers and showed me how to do the scrunching with gel and leave in conditioner. \n\nMy problem, I feel like it looks terrible. I can’t tell if it is the haircut, not doing the curls correctly, or me just not used to it. I feel like the curls themselves look okay, but it feels like my face shape looks really weird, and the short bits are blocking my face. \n\nAlso, it seems incredibly messy when I look at the top of my head, with chunks going in multiple directions. \n\nI will provide details of exactly what I did today as it is drying, and any help would be appreciated, trying not to freak out about if I made a mistake with this cut 😅\n\nRoutine\n\n1. Pantene multitasker shampoo and 5 in 1 conditioner \n\n2. In shower, brushed hair, then with soaking hair flipped it and applied as I am coconut leave in conditioner upside down, scrunching. \n\n3. Then applied Marc Anthony strictly curls curl envy cream upside down while scrunching. \n\n4. Plopped my hair in a long sleeved t-shirt and let sit for 20 minutes. \n\n5. Took out the plop and re arranged curls, letting air dry. \n\n6. No silk bonnet yet, one is in the mail. \n",

When wearing makeup I use the skin1004 oil cleanser.\n\nIn all honesty, my diet isn’t good because I’m living in a college dormitory with no fridge meaning I can’t eat vegetables or healthy gut foods like yogurt because they require a fridge and purchasing food everyday isn’t an option as I’m budgeting. I eat rice everyday and I can only eat canned goods like meat loaf, corned beef, and vienna sausages— however, I also have eggs and instant noodles. I try my best to cut the sodium and sugar, but living in a dormitory means that I have no fruits because most need to be refrigerated and the fruits in the supermarket are expensive.\n\nMy sleep schedule is also really messed up. I sleep at around 4-5 am, but I have silk pillow cases and I always change them frequently.\n\nI always stay hydrated, I always wear SPF even if I’m at home, and I’m taking pro and prebiotic supplements for my gut. \n\nSo why is it still there? It’s getting harder to look at myself everyday and I’m unsure which products to get too. I was thinking about going into accutane, but I know it has a lot of risks and I think my acne is still salvageable. I just need tips man, I’m trying to fix my sleep cycle but I physically can’t sleep. I’ve really tried my best to do everything I can to get rid of my acne.\n\nWhat do I do? 🙁\n\n",

I'm experimenting w/ my styling routine right now, but that isn't what this post is abt, I might make a separate post abt that some other time\n2. I only put any of these products in my hair maybe 1x/mo\n3. My hair sees NO heat or chemical treatments like hair dye.\n4. I sleep with a satin pillow, but with my hair down because I don't know how to braid, and I'm not even sure if that would preserve my curls or not.\n5. I only wash my hair every 3 days or so, otherwise it dries out my hair/skin.\n6. I don't clarify bc I rarely use any products in my hair and I'll dry out my hair/skin if I do it as often as people say to (1x-2x/week). I currently don't even own a clarifying shampoo lol\n\n# Actual Post:\n\nI need help asking my hair stylist how to cut my hair! I've only ever been to the salon one time (in May), and I didn't like how it turned out in the end. I also wanted to know what it was that my stylist did to my curls to make them... do... that... This is my hair before the cut, then right after the cut (pls read the pics' captions):\n\n[No styling, no products or leave-in, air dried, before the cut](https://preview.redd.it/ysskux9eu3wf1.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0da6ce18ac7f1a7e1de56380374c28d8c87a3ca9)\n\n[Air dry, styled using products that I don't remember, right before my haircut](https://preview.redd.it/dtdnvznku3wf1.png?width=1415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11e4899abcd67317b80c28c612790fada6ba76ae)\n\n[This was IN the salon while I waited for my uber home AFTER the cut](https://preview.redd.it/c9exuwppu3wf1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee4267d725e603f5acc0c2ebc6670f32bc7b4a26)\n\n[This was when I got home from the salon in my bedroom](https://preview.redd.it/w6mmrufxu3wf1.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e90d4dd397a22a8e94f67f0fd24a7d7e6bf777f6)\n\n[This is the same cut, a few weeks later, using all the products I listed all at once and finger twirling, up in a ponytail for the wedding, so this is just my bangs. This is usually how I style my bangs, even if not with all the product all at once.](https://preview.redd.it/nurvqs40v3wf1.png?width=1239&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff703d7de00f8ae89a6c0718525b063d98822b91)\n\nI haven't been keeping up with the haircut (other than cutting my bangs and dead ends at home) because **I... REALLY don't like how the layering somehow made it look mullety :(** I asked for short layers because my hair before, as you can see, was really flat on the top then curly at the bottom. We focused on the bangs more than anything because the reference photos I had focused on girls with bangs and I didn't have bangs before.\n\n**I wanted basically the same hair shape as I already had, but cut in a U at the bottom, add layers to give myself more volume and to make my curls curl more and sooner on my head, and add bangs. Not a shag/mullet/triangle cut.**\n\nBut I honestly can't tell if this was on my stylist or if it was on me not knowing how to ask for a cut or knowing how haircuts work. I liked how my bangs turned out, I just didn't like the shape of the rest of my hair--how it looked like a shaggy mullet.\n\nAnd now that my hair is growing out, the layers and shape of it looked CHOPPED. The layers don't blend and the shape just seems kinda all over the place? Idk, I feel like it looks bad, but it's probably just part of the growing out process.\n\n[This is after using the \\* products listed in my routine. This haircut looks CHOPPED, bro 😭](https://preview.redd.it/9zvivob7v3wf1.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf71c0ec5a8273a4b51463c4e1b5c2fabae57204)\n\n**So, how do I ask for a proper haircut/style?** I keep seeing everyone's cuts and they end up GORGEOUS. Is my hair just not curly/full enough for it to look the way I want?\n\nI don't want to **not** go back to her because she was ***so*** sweet and cut me a deal since I'm no income and this was for a wedding I was in (I don't expect that every time and I DID still tip, dw), but idk, She didn't style the individual curls or anything like what I see in videos all the time.\n\nMy gf said that the mullet look came with asking for short layers, but like... I see everyone else getting layers and NOT getting mullets. So what's going on? **What went wrong?** What do I ask for to ensure I get the look I want? **U shape, only cut off the dead ends, bangs, convex layers, and ???** Am I just having unrealistic expectations because of my curl type vs. what I see?\n\nThis is more of what I had in mind for the shape of my hair outside of the bangs and what I was hoping for in terms of styling:\n\n[My hair has LOTS of spirals naturally, and spirals super easily with just finger twirling, I do it all the time. Granted, she has more hair than I do, for sure, but I was still hoping for something similar to this.](https://preview.redd.it/5um79rohv3wf1.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c672d1563c3bf2b898d9529beba58be915d8d096)\n\n**This is my current hair (please read captions):**\n\n[My hair is half dry here. No products, no leave-in, air dried. It frizzes out WAY more when it's fully dry and my curls\\/waves start slightly higher on my head than they do in this picture here. This is just a good shot of my natural curl pattern.](https://preview.redd.it/w6dmm8zpv3wf1.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=733548702c485f14e3efb93fdf49b4c2d0d7310d)\n\n[This is my hair with no products, no styling, not even finger-twirling my bangs like I usually do \\(see wedding photo\\), no leave-in, completely air dried. The frizz is INSANE.](https://preview.redd.it/vgpuqwmxv3wf1.png?width=1261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0abf43fe179705fa12875e2bed9d2c1e1f02bfdf)\n\nI'm really desperate because I'm at a point where I just really don't like my hair right now :( **Mayhaps I've been influenced,** but I'm just not feeling like it's not at its full curl potential and I thought a cut would help that but it didn't seem to and now I'm scared to go back.\n\n**Like, how do I find people with my hair type?** I feel like I can't find anyone that has hair very similar to mine, only kinda similar. This way I can find more realistic expectations of what to... expect from a style/cut?\n\nAn important part of the haircut that I want is that my curls start earlier on my head without looking like a shag/mullet cut or triangle shaped.\n\n# TL;DR/My Main Questions\n\n1. Pls read **all** image captions first\n2. WHAT did my hair stylist do to my curls!? They've NEVER looked like that before or since. Was this because she blowdried them??? I don't remember if she diffused or not :(\n3. How do I ask for a cut where they honor and cater to my individual curls? How do I make sure it adds volume without making it look shaggy or like a mullet or a triangle? (U shape, long and convex layers, bottleneck bangs, and what else?)\n4. Am I just being influenced? Do I have realistic expectations for my hair, or is this just how my hair is? Can I even achieve my goals with a haircut, or is this a matter of product/styling?\n\n# Thank you so much for all of your help!! 🥰🥰🥰",

      "content": "Hi there! \n\nI am getting married next october but working to book all my vendors now. I am struggling to find the right stylist for my hair. So I have a few questions for everyone! How did you juggle the cost with your preferred style? I have been quoted upwards of $300-$400 for bridal hair, but I want to wear my hair down mostly. That feels like a lot of money for not-an-up-do. \n\nDid stylists start with your hair wet and use their own/your products or did you do your own curly hair routine and then the stylist worked with it dry? \n\nI think ultimately I would love to have my hair mostly down and with my natural curls, but a few of the wonky or frizzy parts corrected with a wand. Then maybe some sort of hair piece that stays in all night like a fancy headband or something. Something where I feel like the most elevated version of myself! \n\nI have considered doing my own hair but that feels like SUCH a gamble and I would only wear it down with no styling and I think the look would feel incomplete. My bridesmaids also have requested a hair stylist and I think it would be challenging to find someone for just them and no bride where a stylist can make the most of their money! \n\nHere's a picture from a photoshoot I did from an album photo shoot (I'm a musician) that I think shows off my curls and currently hair style pretty well! \n\nWould love any tips and tricks from the brides here! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jg7tqdnkk2wf1.jpg?width=4527&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b65cb765b26098c6f13ebb8c985b0e6a6966c86e\n\n",

This is the first time it’s been reasonably clear. I still have some pigmentation but it looks pretty good (for me!) with some makeup on. I’ll post some before &amp; afters if anyone’s interested.\n\nA couple of questions:\n\n\t1.\tI’m getting married in 9 months – is this a bad time to switch to tret? Worried about potential peeling/purging before the wedding.\n\n\t2.\tI know I should start tret slowly (probably once a week to begin with) but should I keep using retinal a few nights a week as well to maintain results? For example: tret on Monday, retinal Thursday + Friday?\n\nAny advice from people who’ve made the switch would be really appreciated!",

      "content": "I have always had dry skin - I very rarely broke out, had pimples, and people always said I had beautiful skin despite my not doing shit to care for it. \n\nI do not wear foundation or any of that, just maybe blush/highlight and eyeliner/mascara. I currently use a generic gentle foaming cleanser when I shower, and Happy Skin by Lush to exfoliate. I attempt to exfoliate twice a week. I use soothing/gentle exfoliation makeup wipes to remove makeup (I’ll add a pic) but I’m not going to lie, it’s usually in the morning after I sleep when I remove the makeup. I have Skin Drink moisturizer by Lush, which I would normally use in the winter as my skin always leaned incredibly dry and flaky. Again, if I’m being honest, I rarely moisturize either. \n\nMy pores are so bad - I feel like the “beautiful skin” people always said I have is gone. I feel gross all the time. I sweat SO MUCH now, I am always drenched. This is the second morning I have woken up with angry pimples that just appeared overnight and are more than ready to burst: I try not to pop, I use pimple patches (pictured) but idk if they’re doing anything. I tried the pore strips (pictured) but they are garbage compared to charcoal ones I’ve used in the past. \n\nI’m not sure if I forgot anything, please feel free to clarify or ask for more details. I need a routine that is inexpensive- times are tough and I am dealing with health issues that made me cut my hours at work. Also as low-effort as possible as I do have chronic fatigue/pain. ",
