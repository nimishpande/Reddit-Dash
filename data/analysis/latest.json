      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

My skin tone is uneven because I’m outside a lot, and I just want healthy skin not to look lighter but my mom keeps insisting I use this “skin lightening oil” that she and her friends swear by.\n\nShe says it’s “all natural” and that everyone in her friend group orders it through random online stores, sometimes even sites like Alibaba, apparently. I looked at the ingredients list, if you can call it that and it’s just a mix of oils and a few mystery additives. No brand name, no proper label. When I told her that might not be safe, she said I was being dramatic and that “we used this kind of stuff long before these Western brands existed.”\n\nI tried using it once just to make her happy, but it made my skin sting and left me with small bumps for days. I told her I’d rather stick to my regular moisturizer and she got upset, saying I’m “too influenced by the internet.”I don’t want to disrespect her but I also don’t want to ruin my skin.",

I’ve also been using Acne Star face wash with Bioderma Moisturiser, but that hasn’t helped either.\n\n(Also, does eating fried foods (junk food, chips, Coke) affect this? If so, I’ll stop eating them right now.)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. ",

      "content": "I have some sort of wild mix of 2a-2c hair. Sometimes I get really cute wrapped curls, other times it loose and frizzy. Most of the time it’s a mix of both. I would love some advice on how to make it more consistently lean into the more wrapped/defined curls.\n\nI believe I have medium porosity hair, as water does bead up some when first getting it wet. Takes a good couple minutes to get it fully soaked. Here are the products / routine I am using currently.\n\nI am washing my hair every 3-4 days depending on what’s going on/ how it’s looking.\n\nStep 1- Get in the shower, soak my hair and use a light detangling spray. Currently using the Marc Anthony Grow Long spray. Brush out my hair completely with a denman type wet brush.\n\nStep 2- Shampoo and condition hair. I was using the Kristin Ess curly S &amp; C, but recently just switched to Rizos Curl Biotin S&amp;C\n\nStep 3- Still in the shower, apply Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Cury Envy Cream. Brush through my hair, and then while under the water scrunch my hair with a bit more cream in my hands.\n\nStep 4- Get out of the shower, get dressed, and scrunch some of the excess water out of my hair with a micro fiber towel.\n\nStep 5- Prayer hands apply Cantù Wave Whip Curling Mousse. Scrunch in if needed but usually try to avoid that.\n\nI do not do any diffusing / drying of my hair, which I know I’ll get some flack about. But I’m a working mom of 2 and never have the time to do it given how thick my hair is.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions on what I could do differently without adding a ton of extra time to my routine that would be amazing. Open to product recommendations or answering questions to help determine what I should do.",

But somewhere between the checkout button and my half-asleep scrolling spree, I must have clicked on the wrong product. Fast-forward two weeks, and a package labeled “Skin Lightening Oil Premium Glow Formula” shows up at my doorstep.\n\nI laughed at first, the kind of laugh that hides mild panic. I mean, what does lightening even mean anymore? I wasn’t trying to alter my skin tone; I just wanted hydration, not a personality shift. Still, I unwrapped the package. I tested a tiny drop on my arm, and while I didn’t turn into a fairytale ghost, the scent alone could resurrect the dead, sharp, citrusy, and oddly confident.\n\nNow the bottle sits on my dresser like a cautionary tale of late-night online shopping. A friend suggested I check Alibaba because apparently, they have every version of this stuff ever made. Honestly, I came to ask for advice from this subreddit before I make any other decision. Please which moisturizing oil can I buy without losing my melanin? I don’t have any skin allergies so I’m open to exploring.",

      "content": "So here's my problem: I've been struggling with my curly hair my whole life, was never taught how to properly care for it, and every advice I've gotten hasn't worked. I've been recommended wide-tooth combs a lot, but I can't even pass fingers through my hair. It gets tangled and matted so fast! \n\nMy living conditions are also far from ideal. I work in wildland fire in the summer, and chainsaw work in the winter. So I wear hardhats all the time, in very hot and very cold conditions, I always end up with twigs and branches struck through my hair, which end up damaging my hair when I try to pull it out. \n\nI also live in a dry cabin with a woodstove, so its very dry inside in the winter, and I don't have a regular access to a shower. (I setup a camping shower in the greenhouse this summer and it's been awesome, but it's now winter and I'm not showering outside at -30 😅)\n\nSo far, my routine has been to shampoo, condition and use a detangle brush every time I shower, then air dry. It varies from everyday up to a week between a proper overhead shower.

I want to try to use this as a healing restart to finally learn how to care for my 4C Haitian hair with love and patience.\n\nI was adopted by a white family when I was a baby, and never really learned how to care for my afro. My family learned how to do box braids, so I’ve just rocked those my whole life. \n\nBut now I could really use some help building a daily/weekly/monthly routine, with affordable product suggestions. I’m also open to beginner-friendly protective style recommendations. \n\nThank you all ahead of time for any feedback.",

I did use AI to help me look more in-depth into reviews and products for my skin type (combination skin I \\*think\\*, with closed comedones, blackheads, cysts here and there, and intense picking at any bumps). I'm currently trying to use up what I have before replacing certain steps in my routine, but otherwise I'm really keen to get started. \n\nTo try to keep myself excited I made a cute little notion page that outlines the order of my routine steps, and which days to focus on which actives. In the next section I have my current products, and my wishlist products (crossed out ones are the ones that will be immediately replaced once the bottle is finished, and pink products are ones that will be added into the routine, not replacing any current product). Further down I have a new routine section (not pictured) that will come into effect once I have all of the highlighted wishlist products. \n\nOverall I'm very excited, and hope I can stay consistent!",
