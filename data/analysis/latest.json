      "content": "Helllpp pls\nI started Accutane in early March and now it’s October. At first everything was great — my pores and blackheads disappeared, I had some small breakouts but nothing major, and after that my skin looked amazing. But around July things started to get worse again: lots of texture, a lot of inflammation, and honestly my skin now looks even worse than before.\n\nAccording to my dermatologist, my treatment could have ended in July since I barely had any acne left on my face (most of it was on my body). So we began tapering down the dose: first three times a week, then once a week. But that’s when things really got worse. I went back to her, and she said she’s not entirely sure what it could be — it seems like follicular acne, not fungal, because there’s no flaking or signs of a compromised skin barrier. Her advice was to go back on daily Accutane and wait to see how things progress.\n\nShe even told me to buy two more boxes for the next two months. In total i have 2 months and 15 days of medication left. Do you think this will eventually resolve? I’ve already tried ceramides (thinking it was barrier related), azelaic acid to reduce redness, light moisturizers, heavy repairing moisturizers… but nothing seems to help.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar?\n",

I’ve struggled with skin picking my whole life (getting better though!) and made it a long time without getting serious scarring, until this year when the texture of my skin got horrible, and I started getting scars even from pimples I let run their course without touching at all.\n\nSo I’ve never had big blackheads before, especially not on my face, and would like advice on how to get rid of this without leaving permanent damage. The blackhead has been here for about a month and it seems to be loosening up, but I’m worried that even if it comes out naturally it will leave a crater :( I’m not great at routine but I currently wash my face with Target’s Oil Free Acne Wash with Salicylic Acid 1-2x a day, and I’ve started applying Clean &amp; Clear spot treatment as well. I moisturize cautiously as I have yet to find something that doesn’t make me break out.\n\nAny advice about my skin in general would be helpful too, as I know I probably need a better routine. The texture, scarring, and CONSTANT irritation has been awful. Planning on seeing a dermatologist next month. Thanks everyone &lt;3",
