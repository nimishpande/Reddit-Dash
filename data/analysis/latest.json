How can I fix it, the bottom bits seem straight?? It’s also dyed now and it’s way too dark for me 😭😭😭😭\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. I’m not even sure what products they used though they said they used a treatment?!  I think it was something like Pure (goddess)\n\n2. They dried it with one of those heat dryer things you sit under \n\n3. scrunched some mousse in my hair. \n\n4. Silk pillowcase and I wear a bonnet which hairdresser pointed out my husband must not like?? 😭\n\nIt cost me $300aud",

My doctor has looked at it and said that it’s likely not cancerous, but I would really like to get it removed for cosmetic reasons.\n\nIt casts a shadow on my face when I take photos in the sunlight and I end up photoshopping it out of all my photos.\n\nI’ve tried to look for before and after photos online of people with moles similar to this one, but I haven’t had any luck. I’m nervous that getting it removed would leave a scar or mark that’s more noticeable than the mole itself, especially because it’s in my smile lines.\n\nI’m also not sure if it would be better to go to a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon.\n\nI would really appreciate if anyone with experience in this could help me. I also don’t need any reassurance that moles are beautiful and that I need to love myself how I am. I’ve wanted to get this removed my whole life, self love will not make me want to keep it, lol.",

After years of constant breakout my skin finally became acne free with only a few acne scars on my face. VERY UNFORTUNATELY the company has discontinued this and I’ve frantically searched everywhere online and it’s out of stock everywhere. I had no other option so I bought minimalists salicylic acid and a tranexamic acid serums separately, but ever since then a pimple or two repeatedly. I know it doesn’t sound like a huge deal after years of acne and being taunted for my skin, im extremely insecure of my skin and this has been bothering me way too much. PLEASE GUYS SUGGEST ME AN ALTERNATIVE, what do you think could be possibly breaking me out? I would’ve visited my dermatologist but im in college in a different city currently, please please suggest me alternatives, should i stop using tranexamic acid? or salicylic? ive posted the formulation of the serums in the succeeding slides.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I live in an area where it seems like a lot of girls are a lot more high maintenance about their hair (blowouts, daily heat-styling, lots of product etc), and I am pretty aware that wherever I go my hair is the worst-looking in the room my far unless I’m in a Walmart or something.\n\nThere’s also people who assume that I don’t know how to take care of it, and will give me unsolicited tips that I’ve already tried or are not helpful advice for my hair (for example lots of people think my hair is thick when really it’s just high-density). But i also understand that when I wear my hair this way, yea, it looks like I don’t know how to take care of it.\n\nSo here I am I guess looking for advice and reassurance.. not sure what kind of advice but does anyone else wear their natural frizzy hair out and about, and is not actively trying to fix it? Really really frizzy? What do people say about it? How do you deal with it in academic/professional settings? I have seen people say on here that they are embracing the frizz but where are y’all in real life lol!!\n\nRoutine: (it wouldnt let me post without this so just shampoo and conditioner",

These tiny red bumps have been appearing over the middle of my forehead, nose, and cheeks. This has never happened before, as I usually just get big whiteheads and they go away on their own. Besides for that and my acne scars, my skin is usually relatively clear.\n\nI have combo skin. I've noticed dry patches under my nostrils and beside my chin which is really irregular for me. The actual spots of acne are dry and itchy, and feel really rough. Not sure what to do about it. Some are just bumps, and some are whiteheads that are really tiny. My whole face really just very slightly stings and looks red and irritated everyday.\n\nWhen I do my regular routine, I notice the skin around my nose and my nose itself burns, like i've scratched those areas and then squeezed lemon juice on them or something LOL. I use the niacinamide and salicylic acid serums from The Ordinary and they've never done me wrong.\n\nPlease help?",

I’m posting because I’m trying to better understand what’s going on with my hairline and would really appreciate hearing from others who’ve dealt with something similar.\n\nOver the past months, I’ve noticed progressive thinning along the frontal hairline, mainly at the temples. It doesn’t look like generalized shedding; instead, it feels more like the hairline itself is changing. Some areas still have fine, short hairs, while others look noticeably sparser.\n\nFor context, I’ve always had an M-shaped hairline since childhood, so temples aren’t new to me. What’s different now is that there’s actual loss and progression, which never really happened before.\n\nAnother thing that really worries me is the asymmetry, the left side is significantly thinner and the right side stayed almost unchanged until recently, only starting to thin in the last few months\n\nThat asymmetry is what makes this harder for me to interpret.\n\nI’ve already seen a dermatologist and had a trichoscopy, and I was told the pattern didn’t suggest scarring alopecia. While that was somewhat reassuring, I’m still unsure because the frontal area keeps changing, and I’ve read that conditions like frontal fibrosing alopecia or other cicatricial alopecias can be subtle early on.\n\nIn terms of treatment, I’ve only just started:\n\nFinasteride 0.5 mg (about a week in)\n\nPumpkin seed oil as a supplement\n\nI know it’s far too early to judge effectiveness, this is more about understanding what I might be dealing with.\n\nI’d really appreciate input from anyone who:\n\nhas had mostly frontal or asymmetrical hair thinning\n\nhas experience with frontal fibrosing alopecia or early scarring conditions\n\nwas initially told it wasn’t scarring but later got more clarity\n\nmanaged to stabilize something similar with treatment\n\nI’ll continue following up medically, but hearing real-world experiences would help a lot in deciding next steps (monitoring, second opinion, further exams, etc.).\n\nThanks in advance to anyone willing to share their experience or thoughts.",

      "title": "[Routine Help] Oily skin + Tretinoin",
      "content": "Oily skin + Tretinoin routine advice\n\nI struggle with oily skin and a strawberry seed nose because of my sebaceous filaments.\n\nI'm also curious if it's ok to just keep this routine and let the tretinoin work and have all these hydrating steps support it to balance out how the tret would dry me out.\n\nI was looking for advice on how to adjust my skincare routine.\n\nI asked AI and I got this response and was wondering how legit it is.\n\nQuestion: I want to check the products I use for compatibility with each other and also my oily skin.\n\nIn the morning, I use TIRTIR original milk toner, Aestura Atobarrier365 Hydro Essence, Aestura Atobarrier365 cream, and Skin 1004 Centella sunscreen.\n\nAt night, I double cleanse with Manyo pure cleansing oil, isntree yam root milk cleanser, then use the same toner and essence I used in the morning, then put cosrx snail mucin after that, then sandwich method .05 tretinoin gel with Real Barrier extreme cream, then after sandwiching I apply Aveeno Eczema Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Cream, La Roche Posay Cicaplast Balm B5, then slug with aquaphor at the end.\n\nAnswer: This routine contains some \"Hall of Fame\" Reddit favorites (Aestura, Cosrx, La Roche-Posay), but for oily skin, you are running a high risk of clogging your pores.\nYour routine is essentially designed for someone with extremely dry, dehydrated skin living in a desert. Since you have oily skin and concerns about \"strawberry nose\" (sebaceous filaments), this routine is likely working against you by trapping too much oil.\nHere is the breakdown of compatibility and risks.\nThe Major Flags\n1. The \"Lasagna\" Problem (PM)\nYou are applying 5 different moisturizing layers in the evening:\n * Real Barrier Extreme Cream (Under Tret)\n * Real Barrier Extreme Cream (Over Tret)\n * Aveeno Eczema Therapy\n * LRP Cicaplast Balm\n * Aquaphor\n * The Risk: This is total occlusion overkill. While \"sandwiching\" is good for Tretinoin, adding Aveeno + Cicaplast + Aquaphor on top creates a greenhouse effect. This traps heat and bacteria, which can actually worsen acne and prevent your sebaceous filaments from clearing out.\n * Tretinoin Gel Compatibility: You are using the Gel formulation. Tretinoin Gel is famously finicky; it forms a film. Layering heavy creams under it (like Real Barrier) significantly blocks absorption. Layering 3 heavy occlusives over it often causes the gel to \"pill\" (ball up like eraser shavings), meaning it isn't absorbing properly.\n2. The Strawberry Nose Conflict\n * Slugging (Aquaphor) on Oily Skin: While great for healing, slugging is the enemy of sebaceous filaments. Petrolatum traps the sebum in your nose pores. If you want your nose to look cleaner, stop slugging your nose.\n * TIRTIR Original (AM): As discussed, this is very rich. Using this + Essence + Aestura Cream in the morning is likely why you might look greasy by midday.\nOptimized Routine (Using what you have)\nYou don't need to throw these products away, but you should subtract steps to let your oily skin breathe and let the Tretinoin actually work.\nMorning: The \"Lighten Up\" Strategy\nGoal: Hydration without the grease.\n * Rinse with Water (Skip cleanser if you aren't sweating; your PM cleanse was heavy).\n * Toner: TIRTIR Original (Apply a light layer).\n * Essence: Aestura Hydro Essence.\n * Moisturizer: SKIP THIS.\n   * Why: The TIRTIR toner and Aestura essence are already moisturizing. Your sunscreen is the final layer. You do not need the heavy Aestura Cream in the morning for oily skin.\n * Sunscreen: Skin 1004 Centella (This acts as your AM moisturizer).\nEvening: The \"De-Clog\" Strategy\nGoal: Barrier support without suffocation.\n * Oil Cleanse: Manyo Pure Cleansing Oil (Great).\n * Second Cleanse: Isntree Yam Root Milk Cleanser.\n   * Note: Since you have oily skin, make sure you rinse this very thoroughly. Milk cleansers can leave a residue.\n * Hydration: TIRTIR Toner OR Snail Mucin.\n   * Why: You don't need Toner + Essence + Snail Mucin. Pick one or two. The Snail Mucin is great for Tretinoin hydration.\n * The Sandwich (Modified):\n   * Layer 1 (Buffer): Apply a thin layer of Aestura Atobarrier Cream (lighter than Real Barrier) or the Aveeno.\n   * Wait 10-20 mins: Let it dry.\n   * Layer 2: Tretinoin 0.05% Gel.\n   * Wait 20 mins: Let it dry completely.\n   * Layer 3 (Final): Real Barrier Extreme Cream.\n * STOP HERE.\n   * You do not need to add Aveeno OR Cicaplast OR Aquaphor on top of the Real Barrier. The Real Barrier cream is already an intense occlusive.\nWhen to use the \"Extras\"\n * LRP Cicaplast B5: Use this only as a \"spot treatment\" on nights you are not using Tretinoin, or if you have a specific irritated red patch. Do not use it all over your face every night; it is very pore-clogging for oily skin.\n * Aquaphor: Use this on your lips and around your eyes/nostrils (to protect them from Tretinoin migration), but do not put it over your T-Zone.\nSummary of Changes\n * AM: Drop the Aestura Cream. Rely on Toner + Essence + Sunscreen.\n * PM: Choose one final sealant (Real Barrier is the best one you have). Stop layering Aveeno + Cicaplast + Aquaphor on top of it.\n * Nose: Avoid putting the heavy creams (Real Barrier/Cicaplast/Aquaphor) directly on your nose to help with the filaments. Just use the toner and a light layer of Aveeno there.",

I haven't trimmed the ends in almost 2 years, and I'm thinking about trimming them, but I'm very afraid of leaving the salon with a much shorter length or with my hair having a different shape than before. How can I trim the ends myself at home? I'm terrified of cutting my hair and seeing a difference in length. I've always hated cutting my hair since I was a child, so my confidence in salons or barbers is very low. I would like some tips on how to trim the ends at home.\n\nNote: The hair in the photos is not in the best condition because I'm spending my vacation in a city that is dry and hot.\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. Wash and detangle on the same day (1-3 times) a week.\n2. Shampoo: Neutrox \"Curls and Waves\"\n3. Conditioner: Skala Curl Styling Cream\n4. Oil after washing: Salon Line \"S.O.S\" Curls\n5. Drying: Using a regular towel for a few minutes on the hair and then air drying.\n6. I don't use a satin bonnet before bed.\n\nThis is the routine I've maintained for a few years.\n\nBetween washes I don't do anything to my hair, I don't do any kind of styling.",

I started using SA cleanser (2%) about 2-3 years ago just once a day after getting up (I only wash my face one time, because I have seen better results with it), and it changed my life. I almost stopped getting acnes and my skin started getting clearer and smoother. But nowadays, I am seeing some acnes, and also although it almost stopped the acnes, still I get acnes every now and then and they leave scars that are getting harder to get rid of. I heard that BHA helps preventing acnes and getting rid of them, but AHA is better for getting rid of the scars. I was wondering if I can incorporate a Niacinamide+ Glycolic Acid serum to my AM routine immediately after washing my face with SA cleanser, or it will overly irritate my skin. Looking forward to hear about everyone's experience and suggestions.",

I've recently switched to HASK shampoo and conditioner with tea tree oil and rosemary, hoping that it might help. I also started showering and rinsing my hair in lukewarm water rather then the hot water I used to. \n\nI shower at night, before bed.\n\nI wash my hair (shampoo, then conditioner) about twice a week (every 3-4 days). On a daily basis my hair tends to be quite oily, while my scalp tends to be quite dry. I only condition when I shampoo. \n\nI work from home, so I'm inside most of the day, in air conditioning.\n\nAfter my shower, I pat my hair with my towel and then let it air dry (sometimes I get in bed/lay down while it's still damp if that makes any difference).\n\nAbout a year ago, I used to shampoo and condition every day and this was never an issue, and I'm wondering if it's possible that I should be washing my hair MORE frequently, rather than less frequently. My hair used to be soft and full, and now it's almost always greasy and oily.\n\nI'm honestly at a loss here, what am I doing wrong? Why has this started, and how can I remedy it? \n\n",

I currently have long hair - I got it cut into a non-layered bob in May of 2023 and have been getting trims every six months since then. I’ve been getting really sick of my length and I want to get it cut short into a more androgynous style.\n\nI think I have 2a-2b fine, thin, low porosity hair. In 2018, I cut it super short without a plan and felt like I didn’t know how to style it, so I was hoping to get some direction this time around about how to cut my hair short and make it look good and wavy.\n\nCurrent routine: wash with Trader Joe’s tea tree shampoo and condition with Trader Joe’s tea tree conditioner. Once a week, I clarify with V05 clarifying shampoo instead of the Trader Joe’s shampoo. Then, I put in curlsmith curl defining styling soufflé with prayer hands, scrunch not your mother’s curl talk mousse in the roots, and comb in a very light amount of curlsmith in-shower style fixer gel. After the shower, I plop with a microfiber towel and sometimes air dry, sometimes diffuse with medium heat and low air. Overnight I put my hair in a very loose, high ponytail with a silk scrunchie and sleep on a silk pillowcase.\n\nThese pictures span 2019-2025 - I tried to pick both good and bad hair days and varying lengths to represent how my hair acts. Without styling my hair is flat and frizzy with no curl definition.",
