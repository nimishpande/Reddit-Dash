I use it after showering and I’m good for the entire day. \n\nEasily a 10/10 WRP!!\n\nNivea Pearl &amp; Beauty Roll On:\n\nVery average. It was the first one i used (canon event). formula feels slightly sticky for the first few minutes. No sweat control, it just mixes the smell with the deo’s. And no visible brightening. \n\n6/10 WNRP because there are better options now.\n\nRexona Shower Fresh Roll On:\n\ndecent for odour control but way too strong for sensitive skin gave me a slight burning sensation especially on freshly shaved days. works if you need something heavy, but it’s definitely not gentle. \n\n7.5/10 WNRP for me personally cause i have too sensitive skin.",

      "content": "Hello there!\n\nLongtime lurker and first time poster via this throwaway. I am looking for any tips, product/routine recommendations, and/or just words of encouragement from all of you beautiful and lovely people.\n\nSo unfortunately I made a problem worse… significantly worse. I’ll start from the top and work my way to present day.\n\n12/25 - noticed the main large red and swollen area on the right side of my face. I thought it was going to be one of those deeper pimples and so I put a blemish patch/sticker on it over night. First time using one of those…\n\n12/26 - i removed the patch and noticed the area was much larger and made the mistake of trying to squeeze it. I broke the skin and basically just got some clear liquid out (I know, absolutely terrible and should not have done this, I’m sorry!! 😣😔) i think i then also picked at the area under my nostril and my upper lip.\n\n12/27 - swelling and redness continued. I then tried a new product for the first time, Neutrogena Stubborn Acne Spot Drying Lotion - Sulfur Acne Treatment. It’s 10% Sulfur + 4% Niacinamide. I followed the instructions and left it on overnight (despite feeling some pretty intense burning when I first applied it). Fairly certain this is what caused the ulcer like wound followed by the scabbing.\n\n12/28 + 29 - area is not looking great, so I’m washing with Chlorhexidine soap in the shower\n\n12/30 - made appointment to see PCP. Got prescribed doxycycline 100mg twice daily plus mupirocin ointment and instructed to only wash with soap and water and apply ointment twice a day. Discussed possibility of it starting as a cat scratch made worse by my picking and/or allergic reaction to the blemish sticker.\n\n1/6 - taking prescriptions as directed, redness and swelling are improving, but the scab on the main wound came off today, which is Pic #3.\n\nI know this is all pretty horrific and I’ve definitely made things worse. Just wanted to check in with you all to see if anyone has had a similar situation and could shed some insight on what to do/use/etc. and if there is any hope for this to heal without scarring too badly.\n\nMy usual skincare routine is: La Roche-Posay Hydrating Gentle Cleanser in the shower (whenever I shower, either AM or PM) Followed by La Roche-Posay Double Repair Matte Moisturizer after shower I use La Roche-Posay Double Repair Face Moisturizer UV Broad-Spectrum SPF 30 if I know I’m going to be out in the sun a lot that day\n\nThank you for any info and help you can provide, I appreciate you all! And I’m sorry!!!",

In the 10+ years I've been hyper-fixated on skincare, I've seen so many studies, reviews, etc. about the wonders of vitamin c for brightening, lightening dark spots, and generally evening skin tone. When I tell you I have tried every single derivative from the Mississippi to South Korea though...\n\nI've gone expensive (SkinCeuticals). I've gone mid-range (Timeless). I've gone single-ingredient derivatives from TO and others. I've tried pure ascorbic acid powder mixed with serums, I've even dabbled in DIY skincare with multiple formulations from classic recipes to full-blown science experiments with trademarked vitamin C matrixes. Once a day, twice a day, thrice a day even (not my best idea.\n\nI truly don't think I've ever seen a benefit. My main issue is sun damage (le dark spots) and I know that's a fickle problem to work with, however at this point I know how to spot when an active is working because I've seen it happen with other ones. But zilch with Vitamin C.\n\nI feel like I'm crazy. This is one of the most studied actives in OTC skincare. I believe the science. And l've seen the results people have, which I'm extremely envious of. So l've kept using it...all this time. But I think I'm finally at a point where it just feels unnecessary and pointless for me.\n\nIs there anyone out there like me? What is wrong with my skin???",

      "title": "At my wits end with my hair",
      "content": "This is a repost since I used incorrect terminology. \n\nHi so i'm at my wits end with my hair. Its velcroey most of the time and it dries very inconsistently, sometimes it will have great 2C-3A curls but most of the time it just looks like this stringy clumpy mess. Testing products is very overwhelming for me because everything i've tried in the past has given me inconsistent results if any. I really don't know what my hair wants. This week I straightened it and felt so jealous of people with straight hair cause it was so manageable but I don't have time to do that often.\n\nI recently got a pretty big haircut after having layered hair for a long time because layers just weren't working either, my hair would get suuuper tangled. Here are some routines and products I use/have used in the past:\n\nThrough 2024 I did this about once every 5 days:\n\nShea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine shampoo\n\nShea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine conditioner (leave in 3 minutes)\n\nShea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie (scrunching)\n\nPlopping for about 30 mins\n\nAir dry or (if I had time) diffusing\n\nThe first 2 times my hair looked amazing, I had an old tester of these products and my hair looked so good that I decided to buy them. After using them a few times it started to become clear that this was too heavy on my hair, particularly the Smoothie. The Smoothie would usually (though not always, as I said my hair does whatever it wants) leave my hair clumpy and almost sticky. If I slept on it it would just become this huge clump or mass even if I used an extremely (and I mean extremely) small amount. So I stopped using it. Then I continued using the same products but started using the Garnier Fructis Pistachio Cream as a leave in instead. The same thing happened to a lesser extent. It wasn't so much that my curls were weighed down, it was more so that they would stick to each other.\n\nI stopped using that too after trying to apply it on wet, damp and dry hair with no success.\n\nAfter this I became sorta apathetic, I bought a shampoo and some conditioner in bar format from an artisanal soap maker due to environmental concerns about plastic. I just use the shampoo twice and the conditioner for 3 minutes and that's it. I started doing this in hopes that a more simple routine would be better for my hair, I even tried co washing to no avail. As with the shea moisture products, my hair looked great the first day and then started looking bad again. I can post the ingredients of these products here cause they aren't from a big brand:\n\nThe shampoo contains:\n\nCoconut surfactants, silk protein, peruvian ginseng, castor oil, indian gooseberry, moringa, bhringaraj, vegetable inulin, pink clay, cosgard, d-panthenol and salvia and rosemary essential oils.\n\nThe conditioner contains:\n\nCocoa and coconut butter, jojoba oil, cetylic alcohol, vitamin E, d-panthenol, silk protein and lavender and lemon essential oils.\n\nIt's also important to mention that in the past, I have tried oiling my hair for about 2 hours before showering, using olive oil and castor oil. It didn't make much of a difference.\n\nI've also tried sleeping with a silk bonnet but my hair still looks super deformed and squished the next day, if I use a curl cream and sleep with the bonnet it looks even worse because it just becomes a huge mass as i mentioned before. It's also worth mentioning that diffusing, even in low heat and low power still makes my hair very frizzy.\n\nAfter the shea moisture issue I'm scared of buying expensive products that don't work for me and since I live in Europe some of the products recommended here are unavailable. I'm also boycotting amazon so I have a smaller window of affordable options.\n\nI struggle a lot with sensory issues pertaining washing my hair so I hate having too many products in it. I'm seriously at my wits end, I know I haven't done everything I can but I've had days where I spend so long on my hair just for it to look like this that t I just can't be bothered.\n\nI want some advice or success stories since finding products feels overwhelming, I don't know what to use or what my hair needs and everyone talks about so many things like amino acids and proteins and butters and oils that I just don't know where to even begin.\n\nSorry for the wall of text and for the rant I just wanted some advice.\n\n",

      "content": "So i bought the ordinary peeling solution in November 2025 first week and when I used for the first time.....I was like, yes I found the one product which i can use of I want a instant glow, because it made my skin very clean. For context, I have normal skin with oily t zone and didn't have any pimples that time, but my face wasn't clear either. It had some small acne marks, and pores. I'm not saying peeling solution removed any of that, but for that week after using it, my face was brighter and it had that healthy glow. It was like an upper layer of skin of dead cells got removed (I know peeling solution is supposed to do that),I was so happy with it. And I used it after 10 days, the same thing happened, it gave me a glow. \n\nFast forward to the next time I used, nothing happened after I used it. I still got that tingling sensation the first time I used it, but there was no glow in my face. So i thought maybe it's because I was over exfoliating. So the next time I used was more than 2 weeks later. But still the same, there was no visible glow or any change at all. \n\nSo i want to know, what is actually happening here? Now all that peeling solution does is it kinda kills my one or two pimples which comes during periods. \nI searched in the internet for similar experiences, but found none. So if anyone have any idea regarding this please do share🥹\nI'm also attaching my skin right after I used the peeling solution for reference.",

Also if someone could tell me why type of hair I have because some is relatively straight, some is wavy and I get some curls? Backstory with more info below\n\nAs a kid (probably started from 11) I had thick, long hair. It didn’t look thick but there was more than anyone thought. I danced growing up so always had tight hairstyles but my hair was generally still in good condition. At 16 I was put on lithium (medication) and this started the decline of my hair. It thinned quite quick and bad, falling out non-stop and it started to look visibly damaged. I tried nioxin shampoo and conditioner with little improvement. About a year or so later, had a few issues with malnutrition which probably contributed. I’ve never had any bald spots which is a genuine shock with the amount of hair I drop. I’ve had schwarzkopf semi-permanent dye in it on a few occasions (red, blue, purple, pink). \n\nI’m currently alternating between Redken all soft shampoo + conditioner and olaplex No 4 + No 5, using almost cold water. I put Olaplex No 6 on towel dried hair after brushing. I’m using a wide tooth comb to brush, only after shower when wet and starting from the bottom. I do straighten it once or twice a week but will always straighten the front pieces as they are opposites and don’t look good. I’ve gotten different info from different people and I’m just looking for the most effective way to reverse as much damage as possible. I’ve trimmed and cut over the years and the length doesn’t seem to change the appearance. My hairs the one thing I like about myself and I’m quite conscious of how it looks and how damaged it is. \n\nPoint is, I’m after recommendations for routine and products to start somewhat restoring my hair and at least minimising frizz. I have attached some photos but they’re not the best. \n\nTia x",

I have had one of these before as well and after doing some research I found that both my old lip balm and the Laneige one have pore clogging ingredients, which I think is the reason for the pimples.\n\nPlease please please could anyone recommend me a nourishing lip balm (preferably in stick or tube form) that doesn't have beeswax, shea butter, or any oil and comedogenic ingredients? I have also always avoided lip balms with petroleum so if there are any without petroleum and the other ingredients I have mentioned please let me know!!! However I am willing to use one with petroleum if I have to.\n\nAlso if anyone has any advice on how to get rid of lip pimples quickly then that would be really appreciated, like any treatments/ingredients etc!!!\n\nThank you!!!!!!!",

Then I started wondering if maybe it’s just time for a retinal.\n\nIn my teens, I had acne, but that was back in 2014, when skincare wasn’t what it is today. I’ve also learned that less is more sometimes, and surprisingly, I think my hard water does wonders for my skin. A year ago, I moved to a different house in the same area, but now I don’t have a water softener, and my skin is the best it’s ever been.\n\nCurrently, I use the CeraVe SA Cleanser and La Roche-Posay Lipikar Body Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin in the morning. At night, I use the same cleanser along with Honey Bee Hippie California Sunrise Tallow. I used to use Bio-Oil but recently switched to Honey Bee Hippie because I wanted to try it—both seem to work great.\n\nI first discovered Bio-Oil years ago when my face felt painful from using harsh cleansers to get rid of acne.
