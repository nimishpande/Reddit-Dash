      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Over the course of the past two years looking online about hair care and hair types I think I’m somewhere between a 2C and 3A. The reason I’m not sure is because my hair gets tangled and matted so often that I can barely see its natural shape outside of the breakage and frizz. \n\nMy hair routine is really basic as it stands:\n\n•In the shower I use an off brand oily scalp shampoo to clean up any buildup I have. Occasionally I’ll use Rizos Curls Apple Cider Vinegar Scalp Rinse if I want to go for a DEEP cleanse \n\n•After two washes, I go in with Pattern Medium and try to coat most of my hair. After the first rinse with Pattern, I go in a second time and brush my hair while it’s still wet. \n\n•I air dry my hair. Once it’s sufficiently dry I tie it in a pineapple bun and put on a silk bonnet before going to bed. \n\nI thought a bonnet would help with having so much “webbing” my hair does when it gets tangled, but it’s always so intense and I don’t know what additional steps I should be adding to my routine. I just feel like every wash day is a battle to make my hair cooperate and last. \n\nHoping to get any advice from the wonderful people of this subreddit!\n",

I’m noticing lines between my eyebrows and above them, wrinkles near my eyes and very quick filling pores, they almost appear over full like a cup with too much water reaching the circumference. \n\nI have had pretty, relatively smooth skin for the last few years after a long battle with acne, with a hormonal breakout or a random bump here or there. Recent stress has adjusted my routine (forgetting, depression and not doing it, excessive tears and half butted routine ie just moisturizer or something like that) and caused a lot of texture and wrinkles it seems, my neck has also presented a few odd bumps that I definitely try to pop or scratch off and do not go away. My only consistent problem since I went through puberty is nose pore size, so this is all new to me. Can someone give me advice? \n\nMy face, neck, ears and décolleté are included on 1, 3, 5 and 6. my eyes only get caffeine, eye cream, meds and castor. \n\n1. Wash face cerave cream to foam with silicone brush\n2. Ordinary toner with hands\n3. Ordinary hyaluronic acid \n4. Ordinary caffeine on eyes\n5. Ordinary retinol 1% patted into skin\n6. Cerave moisturizing lotion combined with aloe \n7. Laneige lip treatment\n8. No 7 retinol eye cream\n9. Bimatoprost and castor oil on lashes \n\n(Photos are at the end of the day, before night routine. After routine pores are less full but still.. pretty full. Plus, cat tax) ",

I have had really bad acne after getting off of the pill before and am planning to get off the pill again soon. I'm wondering if starting Spiro before I get off will help fend off post pill acne.\n\nI know that this is self-medicating- but my idea is that maybe if I start Spiro a month or so before I get off of the pill and then wean myself off of Spiro over the next year, I can avoid my androgen levels spiking. I feel like this could work, because, unlike birth control pills, Spiro can be taken at many different dosages and so you can lower your dosage over time (not just go cold turkey)\n\nHas anybody ever tried this before? I saw once that someone's derm recommended this but I don't want to believe something I just saw once.",

      "content": "Hi all, my hair takes 2-3 hours to dry on its own and I finally want to learn how to blow dry it. I tried to look through posts here but got kind of overwhelmed since I don’t even know the basics (aside from needing a diffuser). Some common brands I’ve seen are Dyson, Shark, Laifen, and Curlsmith. What are the differences between them? How are they not all doing the same thing? \n\nI would consider spending a bit more on something that works quickly, reduces frizz, defines curls, and does not cause damage. I have mostly 3b hair, pretty thick, no idea about porosity. My hair takes about 2-3 hours to fully dry and I’m getting sick of that lol. \n\nWhat’s best for beginners? Any old hair dryer + a good diffuser? A specific brand of both? And what’s a good heat protectant spray (and does that go on your hair after your regular styling products)? \n\nAnd any technique tips for the actual drying would be helpful too! \n\nThank you!! \n\nMy routine: I’m experimenting lol. Right now I’m using the Evolvh SmartCurl shampoo with Ouidad Anti Frizz conditioner and Ouidad Moisture Lock leave-in conditioner. For styling I use the Loma Curvy Creme and Loma Firm Hold gel. I also have some argan oil but idk how to use it. ",

Does anyone have a good replacement? I've seen a few threads from a year ago asking this, but there's not a lot of recommendations on them. I'm so sad, my hair loved that product, and it wasn't $30 a bottle. I have a lot of wavy, fine, low-porosity hair; my routine is that I wash with Suave Daily Clarifying, then condition, then use the Curlsmith air dry leave in with praying hands and scrunching, then Kinky Curly Curling Custard with praying hands and scrunching, then plop, then air dry. I need something lightweight and low to no protein. Please hit me with your recs!",
