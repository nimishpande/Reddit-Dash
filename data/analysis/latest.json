      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Like, I grew up believing that if your skin didn't feel dry and stretched, the facewash wasn't working. \n\nTurns out... that's just my moisture barrier slowly crying in the corner. \n\nFor context: \n\nMy skin is normal-dry, but also dramatic for no reason, gets irritated around the nose, mouth, basically anytime I breathe wrong. I always assumed that was just me. So my whole routine was basically me trying to fix the dryness I caused during step one(cleansing).\n\nThen a few weeks back, I had this mini identity crisis likee...... why does washing my face feel like a battle? Why do I moisturize like my life depends on it the second I step out of the bathroom?\n\nI still like a lil bit of foam, so I started hunting for something gentle but not boring. Ended up trying the biome gentle gel facewash because it talks about microbiome balance and has hyaluronic acid, ceramides, glycerin aka the trio that usually keeps my skin chill. \n\nGuysss the difference is like OMG.......\n\nno tightness, no wierd itchy mustache area, no redness clown nose momebt, no sprinting to my mositurizer like it's an emergency. \n\nHonestly feels like my skin has been beefing with me for years and I finally stopped giving it reasons. \n\nIf anyone else switched to a gentle cleanser and suddenly understood life, plssssss sharee it here guyssss.

Initially, I thought it was just purging that's why I continued using it not until I developed some deep painful cycstic acne that made me stop using it. I also incorporated some spot treatments on the active pimples that time that i didn't know had salicylic acid on it and ended up making my skin worse.\n\nI instantly dropped all the products I was using and switched to a gentle cleanser, ceramide moisturiser, and sunscreen for a week. Right now, I'm trying to slowly introduce cosrx salicylic acid daily gentle cleanser by using it every other day (I've used the said cleanser everyday a year before and never had any problem with it, it also made my comedones on my foreheads before disappear). Also, I use a serum that focuses on fading dark spots/scars, which have worked on some of my scars and I use a 20% azelaic acid on both of the deep cystic pimple that left a brown-reddish bump on my skin (right cheek and left cheek).\n\nFor AM I Use: Cosrx Gentle Cleanser Soul Apothecary Radiance Boost Serum Ceramide Moisturiser Non comedogenic Sunscreen\n\nFor PM I use: Celeteque Gentle Cleanser 20% Azelaic acid (3x a week) Ceramide Moisturiser\n\nWill this routine help me address my skin concerns? This is my worse acne breakout yet and it's been messing with my confidence :((. I've always kept my skincare routine simple, but now I just don't know what product to use anymore and i think experimenting with different products just irritates my skin even more.\n\nPlease do suggest some ingredients or products I can incorporate if the products I'm currently using is not advisable or appropriate for my concern!

It used to only be on my hairline, and now it’s on my forehead.\n\nI switched shampoos, and it helped for a while, but then the hairline acne came back after I washed it with shampoo that had sulfates and it just never went away.\n\nOver the past few months, I’ve developed forehead acne.\n\nI’ve tried Pan Oxyl creamy wash, dove beauty bar, Cerave, and several other washes and skincare routines. I even tried head and shoulders and ant fungal cream, in case it was fungal, but I think it may have made it worse.\n\nIt’s just really aggravating. I understand that it could just be normal teenage hormones, but if anyone has any advice on how to clear this acne, it would be very appreciated. Thank you! :)",

I do get highlights every 7-8 weeks.  I don't ever blow dry my hair.  For the last year or so my under  hairs have not grown like at all, I finally had my hair lady chop my hair because it was looking so dumb to have top layer so long but I HATE it so short. I need to learn how to take care of it so it will grow! my semi-routine so far is this as follows:\n \n1. wash 3 times a week with Oui Fine Hair Shampoo (some days use GROWTH BOMB brand)\n2. use a silicone massage tool on scalp daily\n3. Condition daily with Oui Fine Hair Conditioner, while conditioner is in, I use a wide tooth comb to brush\n4. usually use a little of the Oui leave in conditioner (some days use GROWTH BOMB brand)\n5. most days I do not add any product\n6. Once a week I've been using a clarifying shampoo, currently have a morrocan oil brand\n7. I towel dry with a thin turkish towel, usually with head bent over and just patting it dry.\n8. I use a silk bonnet by Blissy to sleep because I also have to wear a horrible huge hydrating sleep mask for dry eye.\n9. I never use a blow dryer\n \nIf I do use product I've been using Pacifica brand curl cream\n\nAt the moment I'd love for my curls to look great, but I also care more about ensuring its healthy and will grow!\n\nI need a good defined routing, I love rules and lists and do well when I know exactly what I should do! I feel overwhelmed trying to read other stories trying to figure out what to do!\n\nI have no clue what curl type I have or what porosity I have! :(\n\none pic is the old “length” that barely grew….. and other two pics are current short length.  would love my hair to be well past my shoulders.

      "content": "Hello, my brother (6M) has always had curly hair just like mine (kinda between 2C/3A), his hair was always incredibly soft and it grew at a normal pace for a boy his age. \n\nEarlier this year he got diagnosed with a rare cancer and he started chemo from late January until late September. We shaved his head before chemo and his hair only started growing back in October. \n\nThe issue is that after chemo, his hair grew incredibly quickly (which is not an issue) but now the hair on his head is extremely straight despite being long. It's silky smooth but incredibly straight, almost as if it's glued down with hair spray despite being quite long. I can't explain it any other way. Pre chemo, his hair was not as smooth but it was soft. \n\nRecently he started asking when his hair would be curly again because he misses it and he hates looking different to us. Every single person in my family has very curly hair except for him after chemo and it's starting to upset him. \n\nAlso: my brother did not have a hair routine before chemo. He usually washed his hair with whatever shampoo my mom used on him and we always let it air dry because we live in a hot country and it dried quickly. \n\nAnyway my question is, is this normal? Is this forever? Or is his hair going to grow curly again later on? Is this a temporary thing caused by chemo? Please help. Thanks. ",

      "content": "Hi! I just wanted to give some background first:\n\nI’ve struggled with VERY bad hormonal acne ever since I first hit puberty. When I was 17, I took Accutane, and it helped a lot. My acne calmed down and stayed away for a while, but now that I’m 21, I feel like it’s coming back again. Before considering Accutane for a second time (since I know how harsh it is on the body), I really want to try a proper skincare routine.\n\nThe main problem I struggle with is dark spots after the pimples. Even when I don’t pop them, they turn into hyperpigmented marks, and it’s so frustrating.\n\nThis is the skincare routine I’m thinking of trying:\n\nMorning:\n• CeraVe Blemish Control Cleanser\n• Vitamin C serum (sometimes)\n• Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n• Kojic acid &amp; turmeric soap\n• The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA\n\nI don’t want a heavy routine because I’m generally a lazy person and I don’t like layering too many products on my skin. My skin type is combination but leans slightly toward oily.\n\nCould you please let me know if this routine is good, or if I should change/add anything? Thank you so much!",
