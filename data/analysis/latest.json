      "content": "I live in San Francisco, we have tons of options of nail salons - from low to mid to high range. \n\nFor the past ten years, I’ve begun doing my own manicures, including builder gel. I think I do a pretty great job However, I still go get pedicures. I think I can do a great job at home but it does hurt my back 😅. \n\nI just feel like no matter where I go, the pedicures I get are such a disappointment. Am I a perfectionist? Not exactly, but I would hope you’d do a better job than me. \n\nEvery single time: \n- Cold water\n- Cut, scraped, or pinched\n- Polish on my cuticles\n- Constantly fixing the paint job after the fact\n\nI’m always polite and tip well. $10 for a $50 pedi. I never say anything about this stuff. But like - come on? I hate shelling out my hard earned bucks for such a consistently awful experience. \n\nIs it that the people can’t see? They don’t care? \n\nI’m literally currently leaving an appt with a scrape on my toe from the nail file… I think that’s the third appt in a row where I’ve left bleeding. \n\nI’m about to buy some of those magnifying glasses so I can start doing my pedis at home. \n\nAnyone else???",

      "content": "I'm physically disabled with full body chronic pain from CRPS. I can no longer keep up with a normal hair routine,  Brushing my hair, applying product and diffusing all causes me too much pain now.  i had to find a better way that was easy, accessible, affordable,  and maximized the beauty i wanted.\n\ni decided to experiment and this is the routine  that created  the hair above, the hair i have wanted for literal years:\n\n dry brush and detangle (my dad helps me with this)\n\n Shampoo really well\n\n Conditioner in mid section and ends, not roots\n\n Squeeze out excess water and blot with the towel\n\n Take a curl brush with slightly damp, NOT REALLY WET, hair, brush upward against the grain of your hair from the underneath brushing up, this is done to create curl sections\n\nflip your head upside down, gently loosen your roots with your fingers so your roots are not stuck your  head, and then scrunch all the way to the root\n\nflip all your hair forward infront of your face. air dry like that, you basically have to look slightly down till its dry.\n\nonce fully dry flip upside down, fluff the roots, then spread your fingers wide, slip your fingers in the mid section of your hair, and shake. do not brush out  the curls with your hands, just shake.\n\nflip right side up, fiddle with it for i minute, fluff where you need to, and your done.\n\ni know this wont work for everyone, for some this will dry out your hair too much, but i did everything the beauty industry tells you not to do with curly hair and my hair has literally never looked better. i don't  care if this is somehow unhealthy for my hair, im simply too disabled to do more effort than this. maybe if it gets dry I'll do a night with coconut  oil to rehydrate, but this is my routine  forever  now.\n\n I wasted so many years thinking there was something wrong with me or my hair or that the way I wanted my hair wanted to look was not possible,and it was just lies. the thing that was making my hair look bad was product. my hair has always been hypersensitive  to product, even a half dollar size of mouse weighs down my hair. with nothing my hair is so soft, light, and fluffy. i have the volume i want, the definition, everything.  And I do not care if I was possibly using the wrong product and different product would help my hair more,  Like I've said I'm too disabled for a 5 step product routine these days. this routine  is what I've  needed. its perfect.\n\n Maybe you don't need 5 different $30 hair products, maybe  the issue isn't  the wrong product, its product at all. maybe with no product  but the right styling  method, you can have what you want ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯. maybe try going no product and air drying, then slowly incorporate each product to better understand your hair, idk. \n\ngood luck to all others on your curl journey. im very happy i finally  figured  this out. oh also please do not give me any advice, im content with what im doing! &lt;3 i just wanted to share this success in hopes it can help others.",

The biggest and most difficult change to my routine is trying to quit picking. I am constantly and unconsciously scanning my face for something to pick at.\n\nI’m hoping to get some advice or ideas on how to stop myself, especially because I usually don’t even realize I’m doing it until it’s too late.\n\nOne struggle is that I feel like my white heads refuse to go away unless I pop them. No matter how many hydrocolloid patches or salicylic acid patches I use, they continue to fill back up over and over. Eventually I break down and squeeze the hard little root of the white head out, and only then do they scab over and heal without filling back up.\n\nI’ve had a white head sit on my face for a week with no change, no matter what sort of spot treatment I use, and it only goes away after I finally pick at it.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this or any advice? How do I get my face to heal without picking?",

I want more volume and definition if possible. \n\nThis is Day 1 hair, freshly washed and diffused. \n\nI have wavy hair, but still haven’t found the best routine or products that work for me. I tend to have oily scalp even when I only wash every few days, especially now that I workout regularly. \n\nWhat has worked best for definition so far has been bleaching my hair. Not sure why, but maybe damaging it helped with the texture? \n\nRoutine:\n\nRight now I use Garnier Fructis leave in conditioner and Curl Smith Hydrostyle Flexi Jelly. I either then air dry or diffuse on warm with my hair upside down, and I add a bit of oil for frizz and heat to my shaft and ends. Shampoo and conditioner is Redken Color Extend Magnetics. \n\nCurrent method for sleeping I am trying out is using a silk/satin scarf for a makeshift bonnet. This stays in for a few hours at night but by the time I wake up it’s fallen off. ",

This generally makes me look much older and more worn than I actually am. I’m wondering if people have any general tips to bring the light back to my eyes and face that I had before?\n\nAdditional info about what changed:\n- way less sunlight exposure (UV is always 0 here)\n- diet changes – I honestly eat higher quality food here but way less variety\n- I’m drinking less than I used to and sleeping more, but definitely could use more sleep in general\n- I changed my facial products. I use the most basic sensitive cleanser and moisturizer and home and I’m doing the same here. Have been experimenting with different products to try to reduce the acne but it hasn’t helped much\n\nI’m looking for general tips, nos super interested in expensive facial products and whatever because I’ve never used them. Are there vitamins/foods/strategies or more basic products I can use to look less tired and withering? TIA!!",

      "content": "This year I have finally mastered how to detangle and wash my hair, and since then my hair has gotten much longer and denser. It’s been over 5 years since I grew out my hair from literally 1 cm and it is now just past my waist when stretched. This routine has been optimized for fine textured, dense, 4a-c hair:\n\n1. The most important step— I detangle with african pride pre poo AND aussie miracle moist conditioner. The combination gives INCREDIBLE slip that is akin to detangling in the shower, but without wasting all that water. I finger detangle, then use the tangle teezer for fine and fragile hair, as well as the unbrush (depending on how fine textured the section of hair is). I twist my hair in 8-9 twists to prep it for washing.\n2. Im currently using Donna’s choice moisturizing shampoo and deep condition with TGIN honey miracle; both are amazing for winter haircare. I shampoo and deep condition my hair while is in twists. The trick is to twist it so that the twists are loose in the roots, but firmer in the mid shaft and ends.\n3. I towel dry and apply camille rose butter gel and chebe-infused hair grease (I literally mix a chebe pomade I found on etsy with Softee hair grease).\n\nChebe is works wonders length retention and is a ritualistic beauty practice for women in Chad.\n\nI braid my hair in a couple braids overnight, then two strand twist it (about 12-16 twists) the next night so I can have a bomb twist out. The key is to keep your hair tucked away most of the week—claw clips, twisted/braided up dos, ponytails, buns, etc. I take style inspiration from African beauty bloggers. \n\nDaily— I spray my hair with either water, Oyin juices and berries leave in, or a fenugreek and rosemary spray from etsy (Queensanity). It depends on the humidity in the air, because glycerin and dry winter air doesn’t always mix!\n\nMonthly—I do a protein treatment with Curlsmith bond repair and clarify my hair with the Strands of Faith clarifying mask. I’ve also started using Pattern clarifying shampoo, which works pretty well.\n\nQuarterly—I trim my own hair after using the Revair to stretch it. Staying out of the salon helped my length retention exponentially because these stylists have zero patience for coily hair and sky high prices. ",

      "content": "I have always been a clean girly; I've loved all things makeup, skincare, haircare, and nailcare since middle school, and by college, I was good at it.  A month ago, I was diagnosed with severe allergic contact dermatitis to methacrylate (acrylics) and propolis (bee pollen) through a patch test. At the time, I had no idea that this would mean replacing every daily product I have ever had. This is my story.\n\nIt all started during COVID... I had a severe reaction on my lips that I won't get into. But I was misdiagnosed as having an infection. About a year later, I went to college and had the same outbreak but slightly less severe. It happened a few times that first year when I was living in the dorms at college, but I was able to hide it under my mask, as it was always on my lips. I was also never able to see a doctor during an outbreak because I didn't have a car, the onset was so quick, and COVID was still strong. Sophomore year of college, I moved out of the dorms and got an apartment. I had replaced all my lip products, but because I thought I was dealing with a bacterial infection, I was still using the new ones. This year, I had more outbreaks, but they had months in between, and again always on my lips. The outbreaks were downright awful, but I'm not trying to focus on the bad at the moment. Finally, by Junior year of college, my outbreaks were about every 3 months, and they became more and more severe as time went on. At the end of that year, it finally spread from just my lips to all over my face, and yet I still could not find a doctor to help. I went to at least 3 urgent cares and the ER once, and no one specialized in skin. After that outbreak ended, I threw away all lip products and was able to meet with my doctor, but she was not specialized enough to diagnose me. She gave me a referral to a dermatologist, which took several more months to schedule. Eventually, all the outbreaks would heal (because, unaware to me at the time, I had removed contact with my allergens during the breakouts), even if it took a few months, because I had been given countless antibiotics. In my last year of college , I finally got in contact with a dermatologist in my area and told him about my lip products. It took at least 3 outbreaks, a few misdiagnoses (stress, eczema, and atopic dermatitis), me repeating every appointment that I was reacting to my products, and almost a year, for him to refer me to a patch test, along with a neurologist, because he did not believe me that it was the products!! Last time I ever saw him.\n\nThis patch test took a few months to schedule, but by the end of the summer after I graduated from college, I finally had my diagnosis and a new dermatologist. But what I thought was the end was only the beginning of my journey. I was finally able to sift through my products and begin removing allergens. After conducting some research, I discovered that I was allergic to almost every product I used. My allergy to propolis (bee pollen) was so severe that I was cross-reacting to every fragranced product. Plus, because my skin was so sensitized, I also had to avoid common irritants, like citric acid. I started easy, replacing body wash, shampoo, conditioner, face wash, face moisturizer, and facial serum with safe products, and immediately had softer skin. I'm talking baby's bottom skin bodywide overnight! It was clear my shower products had been allergens, but what else? After removing the bodywide allergens, I could focus on the body parts that hurt during a future outbreak in order to narrow down what products had made contact with it. This helped me discover my toothpaste had \"flavor\" I was reacting to on my lips, my towels had fragranced dryer sheets (safe laundry detergent) on my face/lips, and odor control chemicals in pads and tampons. I even started to notice less centralized reactions to airborne products like air fresheners and scented trash bags. I still find new products every day, and have a lot to find replacements for. But I had to throw away almost every product I have ever used to define the way in which I present myself within the last 2 months. All that I kept was my hairbrush and micellar water.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
