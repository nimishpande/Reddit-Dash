But recently, I have been pushed to watch these curly hair “influencers”. \n\nThis channel, for example, already has several videos and pictures depicting a girl who “rates” curly hair products. Which is basically an AD for this oil.  No real person is using this product in the ads. \n\nAs AI keeps advancing, more videos of these “influencers” will keep popping up. So be hyper vigilant out there. \n\nPost asked for my hair routine. I wash and shampoo with Shea moisture products, use a denman brush and then use Pattern Beauty leave in and curl cream. Air dry. ",

At 36, I started finasteride 1mg daily and stayed on it for about three years which stabilised my hair loss. Switched to dutasteride, moving straight to 0.5mg daily for around a year and noticed healthier-looking hair, with thickening at the temples and hairline.\n\nI added oral minoxidil 1.25 mg daily two years ago. I think there has been a decent improvement but nothing dramatic.\n\nSorry the hair length differs between photos but hopefully the progress is still clear. Overall, I’m happy that the hair loss has stopped. I’ll probably consider a transplant within the next five years as I’m not completely satisfied yet. My biggest regret is not starting sooner!\n\nNo side effects from any medication. No microneedling and no topical minoxidil.",

Last two is when i left the salon after she styled it\n\nHate this haircut so much, especially the bangs i feel they look stupid, like i have a bowl cut :( idk because of the brown vs blonde, or they are too long maybe? Maybe my angle-y face doesnt suit it? Idk what to do, help.\n\nI asked for a shag with bangs- the hairdresser dry cut it. I told her i mostly wear it straight, but now this only looks decent when its curled. Im already upset at the fact the bangs and overall length and layers are uneven. I cant even put up my hair nice because the sides on the left and the right are completely different framing wise. My bangs are more choppy on the left making it harder to blend and i already trimmed the right side of my bangs and they still feel longer on that side, as well as the ends of my hair, but im scared to cut anymore at this point incase i make it worse. I just want to grow them out as fast as possible. I was thinking about contacting the girl who did it but i already fixed some of her mistakes and worried she will roll her eyes at me or something ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

What about highlighters?\n\nWhat are we using to make our eyebrows more defined in 2026?\n\nAre creamy eyeshadows easier to use than powdery ones?\n\nMy skin is really fine, but well…please note that I’m not in my 20s anymore 😅\n\nI have so many questions and I would be really thankful for some help 🥹!",

I have never had trouble with curls staying until about 2 years ago. I’m using all of the same products, but all of a sudden they’re falling out within 2 hours compared to how they used to stay all day. This is both in humid weather and dry weather, so it’s not the weather or humidity that’s doing it. \n\nI’m doing the same techniques I’ve used for a decade. Currently I use Kenra’s Heat Block Spray before curling and their medium hold hairspray after. I let the curling iron set for about 10-12 seconds and don’t touch them until after they’ve cooled. Sometimes I let them set pinned in curls if I’m going to an event for extra staying power. When I use hot rollers I also won’t take them out until they’re cool. I wash my hair every 3 days, but only curl on day 1 or 2. \n\nAny advice or products I can use to help? Is this something that happens when you turn 30? I literally cannot figure out why this is. ",

My skin was super duper red and dark red and damaged but after a few days it got better, all because of EGF (epidermal growth factor). This ingredient is my holy grail till now.\n\nEnough with the yapping, here's my routine.\n\nMorning: wash skin with water only, preferably lukewarm water cus it washes off the products on my skin easier. Then I'll apply sunscreen ONLY and go on with my day.\n\nNight: double cleanse, toner, EGF serum, anua azelaic acid 10% (sometimes), moisturiser.\n\nDouble cleansing I'll use micellar water then go with a sulfur amino acid cleanser. I use a spray toner then PAT it into my skin and immediately use egf serum because it's better on damp skin.\n\nOverall it took 2-3 months to get rid of most of my marks and redness. \n\nSorry if this was confusing lol im sleepy ",

I’m on the hunt for a great body wash and body oil, but the second I started researching, I got bombarded with ads and now I can’t tell what’s actually worth it. I don’t want to waste my money on hype.\n\nThese are the five brands/products I keep seeing on repeat:\n\n•\tBesque\n\n•\tSaltair\n\n•\tIota\n\n•\tBeauty From Bees\n\n•\tOsea\n\nHere’s what I’m looking for:\n\n1.\t⁠Clean ingredients\n\n2.\t⁠Smells and feels luxurious\n\n3.\t⁠Reasonably priced (doesn’t break the bank)\n\n4.\t⁠Body oil that’s not super thin/watery\n\n5.\t⁠Dries fast and doesn’t leave a sticky feeling\n\n6.\t⁠Helps with crepey skin, especially around my knees and décolletage\n\n7.\t⁠Bonus: the scent lasts and I still smell good after\n\nIf you’ve tried any of these (or have better recommendations I’m missing), I’d love your honest thoughts — what’s worth it, what’s not, and why.\n\nThank you so much in advance.",
