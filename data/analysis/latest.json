      "content": "Hi everyone!\n\n I joined this community about a year ago when my hair started growing back after chemotherapy. Since then, it has grown quite a bit, although it’s noticeably **finer than it used to be**. I’m very grateful for it and now trying to fully **embrace my natural curls** as it continues to grow.\n\nI’ve always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with my hair. It was wavy when I was younger and became curly in my 20s, but I struggled with frizz and lack of definition. In the past, I often kept it short, but this time I’d like to let it grow and learn how to take care of it properly without relying on heat.\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n1) Cleanse\n   * *Cantu Sulfate-Free Cleansing Cream Shampoo*\n   * Alternated with a hard water shampoo (used occasionally for buildup)\n2) Condition\n   * *Acure Smooth &amp; Shine Conditioner\n   * Applied mainly to mid-lengths and ends, then rinsed out\n3) Styling (on soaking-wet or very damp hair):\n   * *Cantu Curl Activator Cream* **or**\n   * *SheaMoisture Curl Mousse* (lighter option)\n   * *Aveda smoothing cream used in the past, not very effective.*\n4) Application technique:\n   * Products applied with hands using light raking, followed by scrunching\n   * No brushes used for styling\n5) Drying:**\n   * Air-dry in summer\n   * In colder months, partial dry mixed with diffusing\n\n The photo I’m referencing is a day post-wash and my curls still look messy and undefined to me.\n\n**Hair &amp; Lifestyle Info**\n\n* Fine, curly hair (post-chemo regrowth)\n* Side sleeper\n* Full-time job + kids\n* Prefer a **simple routine under 20 minutes**\n\n**What I’m Looking For**\n\nI’d love recommendations for:\n\n* Products that give **better curl definition** for fine hair\n* Lightweight gels, mousses, or creams that help reduce frizz\n* Tips for improving **day-1 and next-day curls**\n* Low-effort nighttime protection options\n\nThank you so much in advance — any advice is truly appreciated 💛",

      "content": "Before I get into the routine I’m basically looking to start completely new. I don’t think our routine is working and I feel like I’m doing things wrong. I use to keep my daughters hair mostly in braids to prevent tangles/matting and she would like to wear it down more so I’m trying to find what works best for wearing it down most the time. \n\nSome things to keep in mind: she has fine hair and a lot of it. Her hair is very dry and tangles and gets matt’s within hours of being down. Her head is very sensitive and the detangling process is very draining for us both filled with lots of tears and breaks because it hurts. \n\nThe routine: I aim to wash it once a week but if she wears it down we have to wash it again in order to get the tangles out. I get it soaking wet and shampoo and condition it with aussie miracle curls. I let the conditioner sit and start detangling with a detangling brush. I have to rewet it several times during this because it drys so fast and takes so long. Then we rinse and wring it out and spray it with the shea moisture leave in detangler. I then detangle it again and braid it in a simple braid to prevent tangles until we are going somewhere. When it’s time for school I rewet it and add in a light hold gel. I buy a different drug store one every time in hopes something works better. At night we put it in a satin bonnet and rewet in the morning to refresh it. By day 2/3 the mats have gotten so bad that I have to wash and do the detangling process again and we end up braiding it because she doesn’t want to do that again in another 2 days. I feel bad because she wants to wear it down all the time but the detangling process is so horrible for her. One question I do want to know for sure is should I be detangling it everyday? I’m just worried about damaging and drying her hair out more. \n\nMy detangling process is in the bath hair soaking wet with conditioner in it we start on one side working from the bottom up in small sections. She unfortunately just gets such bad mats so quickly it’s a painful process for her and I’m hoping with the correct products or routine this could be easier? \n\nAny help or input is so appreciated. \n\nThe first picture is how it looks when rewetting to try and refresh on day 2. The second picture is how it looks day 1. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m new here and I need some advice. I started my curly hair journey around 6 months ago and I’ve been experimenting a lot, but I’m still struggling with the same issue:\n\nMy problem\n\nThe top and mid sections of my hair curl okay, but the lower parts and ends always stay straight.\n\nMy hair history\n\nDuring my teenage years, I didn’t know how to style my hair, because as soon as I brushed it, it would turn into a lion’s mane. So I used regular keratin treatments to straighten it. I stopped doing keratin 2.5–3 years ago. Since then, I’ve cut my hair multiple times, but the ends still look straight and weird, whereas the roots come out curly, so it means the keratin isnt the problem as I have chopped off the part that was straightened by the Keratin.\n\nI also haven’t used any heat styling or straightening in over 6 months.\n\nMy current routine:\n\nShampoo/Conditioner: Head &amp; Shoulders \n\nLeave-in: Garnier Method for Curls mask\n\nCantu Shea Butter Wave Whip Curling Mouse\n\nCantu Shea Butter Moisturizing Twist Lock &amp; Curl Gel\n\nMethod: Scrunch, then use a microfiber towel to scrunch more\n\nDrying: Air dry a bit, then diffuse\n\nFinishing: Aussie Work That Curl lightweight oil\n\nMy question\n\nWhat can I do to help my ends curl?\n\nDo I even have curly hair, or is it hopeless?\n\nWhy do the ends stay straight even after months of no heat and regular cutting?\n\nAny help or suggestions would be amazing. Thank you!",

      "content": "So background: I have super sensitive skin + PCOS, along with a bunch of other pretty severe health problems. I try to care for my skin how I can, but tbh, I've been slacking because of the health stuff which hit hard in my early 20s and has been a big problem since (late 30s now).\n\n*But* I just want to look nicer, even if I'm stuck at home most of the time.\n\nMainly I'm worried about how dry / frail my skin looks, if that makes sense? I have combination skin, but it just doesn't look nicely hydrated (no matter how much water I drink). I do get acne from the PCOS, but thankfully it's mostly under control nowadays.\n\nI'm also broke as a result of the health stuff, so looking for budget-friendly recs that could help. I know this might be a tall order.\n\nHere's what I currently use:\n\n* Paula's Choice exfoliant 3x a week, right after showering when the steam has opened pores (right? I really don't know)\n* Blume meltdown oil also about 3x a week, about 40min after the PC exfoliant. Sometimes I use it extra if I'm dealing with breakouts.\n* Etude SoonJung Relief Toner every morning. Started using this in Dec after seeing it on this sub. Honestly, first thing that ever truly helped minimize pore size on my nose, and it does a great job preventing my skin from getting oily throughout the day.\n* Nip/Fab glycolic exfoliating makeup remover wipes — most days that I don't use the other exfoliant, especially if I did wear makeup that day.\n* Neutrogena skinclearing foundation with salicylic acid, if I do go somewhere and want to wear foundation, so pretty rarely.\n\nIn the past I also used the Fresh Kombucha essence, and I did like it, but it's so expensive and I seem to get better results from the Etude toner.\n\nI tried the Paula’s Choice Oil-Free Face Moisturizer for Acne-Prone Skin, but it made me break out (maybe because of the blueberry, as I also can't eat those right now due to MCAS).\n\nI recently tried the e.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter, and it seems fine I guess? Just kind of settles into my skin highlighting all the dryness/problems, but does reflect light.\n\nTo be clear, I'm hoping for skincare recs, *not* makeup recs, but I wanted to share some of the makeup I use for reference.\n\nI just saw this moisturizer recommended in another sub, by someone who tried it: JUMISO D-Panthenol Barrier Soothing Cream — does it seem like it would be a good option in my case? Other moisturizing/hydrating ideas, that won't feel sticky or thick? Other products I should try to stop looking like my skin is decades older than I am?\n\nPlease rescue my skin! And thank you for all your suggestions",

      "content": "Growing up, I naturally had soft, manageable 2a/2b wavy-curly hair that was healthy and mid-back length. But I was always insecure about it for no reason and wanted straight hair like girls on tv, so I’d beg my mom to straighten it. But my hair still stayed healthy and didn’t change its curl pattern. \n\nIn middle school, after a very short haircut I hated (the girl cut my hair to my ears I had a bob), and would straighten it myself out of insecurity. At the same time, frequent chlorine exposure from swimming without proper care caused dryness and damage.  I began straightening my hair improperly using high heat on damp/oily hair and sometimes with chlorine residue still in it (since I straightened it by myself, I didn’t know how to care for it properly and didn’t know about heat protection. My cousin told me if I drenched my hair in heat protectant and then I straighten on top and if I hear sizzling, that meant the protectant is working. So I would always aim for the sizzling sound because I was stupid) . Over time, the more heat I used, the more my hair became frizzier, drier, and curlier, eventually turning into tight, hard-to-manage curls (around 3b/3c texture) that didn’t behave like typical healthy curls.\n\nIn high school, I continued straightening daily. Later, I tried to repair the damage by avoiding heat, using oils, masks, trims, and growth routines (especially during COVID). While my hair grows, it still feels dry, frizzy, and inconsistent, with recurring dead ends. Even curly hair routines haven’t helped, and defining the curls isn’t what I want anyway. I miss my old soft, loose waves, not tight curls.\n\nI’m 22 now and it’s been years since I started handling my hair with better care. I now use heat more responsibly, but my hair still doesn’t feel like my natural texture. I don’t believe this change is hormonal, it feels like long-term structural damage from years of chlorine + improper heat use, and I’m exhausted from trying products and routines that haven’t restored my original pattern.\n\nMain goal:\nI want my hair to return to its original soft 2a/2b wave pattern, not tighter curls, and I don’t know how to achieve that after years of damage.\n\nRoutine: I’ve used so many different products over the years from cheap to expensive. I’ve used all the famous ones and even the normal ones. They’re all eh. I don’t diffuse, my hairs already so curly and coily and frizzy the last thing I want to do is define them and scrunch them, it will turn into a big bush. I\n\n",

      "content": "Product and Technique Advice?\n\nI currently use SheaMoisture manuka honey and yogurt shampoo and conditioner, but I’m pretty sure it’s way too heavy for me since I have fine and I \\\\\\*think\\\\\\* 2B ish hair. I’m a guy and wouldn’t really be all that concerned about my hair, but most drugstore shampoos (dove, pantene, head and shoulders, etc.) obliterated my hair and scalp, so I’m trying to dial in my shampoo and conditioner picks, frequency, and products if any since I don’t use any styling products, I just comb my hair while wet and move on. I currently use a Kent saw cut comb but not wide toothed, and on days I don’t shampoo I still wash my hair thoroughly with cold water. I do have super light flakes, but it doesn’t bother me at all as long as I shampoo my hair every 2-3 days, so I haven’t bothered with actives like pyrithione zinc or Nizoral since those \\\\\\*also\\\\\\* obliterated my hair in the past. The only product I’ve tried in the past was Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk leave in conditioner which just got super dry and crusty in my hair, I’ve never done gels or clays or pomades or sea salt sprays or anything like that before, so I’m more or less going into this totally blind.\n\nOr, tl;dr\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. Shampoo: SheaMoisture Manuka Honey and Yogurt, thoroughly scrubbed into scalp and washed\n\n2. Conditioner: SheaMoisture Manuka Honey and Yogurt, small amount spread on hands, which are then ran over my hair, then washed less than a minute later\n\n3. Other Products: as of right now? None\n\n4. Drying: excess water dried with towel, hair then combed, then hair wrapped in towel again for a few minutes, towel then removed for the rest to be done air dried, then hair lightly scrunched with fingers\n\n5. Misc. Info: pillowcases 400 gsm sateen cotton, comb is Kent saw cut but not wide toothed ",

She didn’t share any alternatives which I thought was odd but I’m curious about trying 0.3% or adding other ingredients into my routine.\n\nMy primary concerns are acne (not cystic) and PIH. I see some small changes but I’m looking for something stronger. I have not tried other retinoids.\n\nRoutine\n\nAM: \n\nUsually salicylic acid face wash up until a couple of weeks ago. More common now is water or straight to sunscreen. Adapalene occasionally if I forgot to apply the night before. \n\nPM: Dermasil oat cleanser, Adapalene (4-5 days a week), the ordinary HA moisturizer.\n\nI’m also going to be in Mexico soon and would like to purchase whatever I decide while I’m there if possible for a fraction of the price.\n\nWhat retinoid or other treatments do you recommend I look into possibly trying next?",

      "content": "I've been going to my hairdresser for a few years now. Back in december 2024, she tried a new process with bleaching my hair and my hair started to break off at the crown so it was only like 3 inches high. That's fine. After 10 years of bleaching it, I figured it was gonna happen eventually. So I went in a few weeks later and asked her to give me pixie, and she gave me a very short one to help mask the breakage. Between maintenance cuts and shaping cuts. It took me a year to get my hair down to my earlobes. One thing she always did that I didn't like is she leave the back long. It made me feel like I was growing a mullet, and when I went in this time, I said I would like an undercut and and I was trying to grow out my hair. So i would like it long on top. She asked, how much I would like taken off, an inch and i agreed. She asked me where I want my bangs cut and I pointed to the edge of my eye, cause they are side sweatbangs, and that's typically where I have them. She turned me away from the mirror cut my bangs, then grabbed the very top middle section of my hair and cut, then spun me around and started cutting the rest. She didn't cut an inch off. Instead, she cut 7 inches off. I couldn't stop her cause. It was the dead center in my head and for my bangs, she cut them above my eyebrow, which I despise bangs that short. So now I'm back to where I started in January 2025. And for the first time ever, I am very upset with my haircut. I've never once been upset with a haircut or hair color that has gone wrong. And this time, I am. I know there's nothing that can be done. I just have to grow it out again. But what can I do in the future to make sure she doesn't do this again.\n\nIt was supposed to be this https://pin.it/22yniDNkI and came out like this Charlize Theron in this photo https://www.redbookmag.com/beauty/hair/advice/g2109/iconic-pixie-cuts/",

      "content": "I'm looking for an affordable mineral sunscreen that I can apply daily and is mostly invisible. Chemical sunscreens do this, but they irritate my skin. I have pale skin, but mineral sunscreens still leave a white cast, and my skin looks wet and caked, since it doesn't spread that well. My dermatologist gave me a sample of Neutrogena Mineral UV Tint (SPF 40), and it's a bit better, but it still doesn't quite match my skin tone and is very noticeable. Some women just apply makeup on top of the sunscreen, but I'm a man who doesn't want to start a makeup routine just for that. Any brands you'd recommend or tips to apply it better?",
