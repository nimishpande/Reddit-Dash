It’s frustrating cuz well.. it looks curlier but it doesn’t last very long (have to rewet it all the time) versus if I put product in it, I like how defined it looks near the ends and how long it lasts but the roots feel flat. the first image is right after a wash\n\nAny advice here?\n\nUsually when i’m doing a routine with product in it, it’s-\n\n1x a week full hair wash with curlsmith shampoo, then shea moisture conditioner, then shea moisture curl cream, some gel or mousse, curlbounce brush and then air dry or diffuse (it rlly depends on the day)\n\ni went a while without using shea moisture products too (mielle leave-in and ouidad gel) and it still looked similar, if not worse (ouidad gel did not leave a gel cast on my curls unless i dumped like 2 pounds of it, which caused it to frizz early)",

A week ago today, I had clear skin 🥲 compromised yes but clearish.\n\nI want to cry, I’ve developed a million tiny pustules - all red and irritated. Especially around my temples for some reason. I had around 20-30 whiteheads all across my eyebrows and forehead - fortunately they’ve cleared up now.\n\nBut it seems as though my cheeks are worsening. I use the Ego QV Gentle Wash cleanser and Cerave Moisturiser.\n\nI did switch from the green hydrating cerave cleanser to the Ego QV cleanser about a week before coming back to the UK for 2 weeks. Should I go back?\n\nI’ve also worn the Beauty of Joseon suncream the past 2 days and I’m debating removing that from my routine as well.\n\nI’m wearing sudocreme and benzoyl peroxide to bed, letting the benzoyl sit for 15 mins before applying the sudocreme.\n\nI’m at a complete loss as I feel out of control with my skin for the first time in years 🥲 I did take these photos straight out of the shower so that might’ve increased the redness but the texture is just as bad as it looks - it’s a mental challenge washing my face at the moment and just feeling it.\n\nAny help would be greatly greatly greatly appreciated, this has been a huge knock on my confidence entirely.",

I had been straightening it for about 7-8 years and only a few months ago decided that i want to go natural. I practically shaved my head off and now only have 2-3 inches of growth.\n\nI live in Japan so its a bit harder to get products for curly hair. I think i have a good routine but i still have no idea what im doing. Whenever i look up videos to help they are all of girls with long curls and i cant do the stuff that they do yet.\n\nBecause of this I often leave the house with a lot of frizz, at first i was just so happy to finally have my natural hair I thought my frizz was cute and natural but many of my friends or people say stuff like\n\n“define it!”\n\n“It looks goofy when its frizzy-“\n\n“you dont know how to take care of your hair do you?”\n\n“You should use gels.”\n\nAnd because im a beginner i dont wanna just ignore them but they all have straight hair with little to no experience with hair like mine and often times it just feels like criticism without actual advice. It makes me irrationably angry sometimes.\n\nIve seen many people talk about frizz and i know that its normal and i see posts with girls with long curly hair with comments like\n\n“Love the normalization of frizz!”\n\nBut my hair isnt long. Its really short. I dont know if im allowed to have frizz.\n\nThis isnt a post asking for advice to get rid of frizz i just wanna know if you guys deal with this too. Do people often comment about your hair? Try to subtly touch your hair? Try to tell you how to fix it when you didnt even ask? Am i going to have to get used to these things?\n\nOf course any tips on taking care of hair is MORE than welcome too tho!\n\nMy routine..(if you can even call it a routine) 3b-3c\n\n1. Wash twice (dove shampoo intense repair)\n2. Rake Leave in through curls. (African pride olive miracle from amazon)\n3. Rake coil sculpting custard and finger curls some parts of the head (Mielle pomegranate and honey custard)\n4. Put bonnet on and sleep\n5. Wake up and shake my head a bit to loosen curls.\n\nPLEASE help. Anything. Tips on haircare, how to deal with people touching, if frizz is unhealthy, funny stories with your curls, im just so lost right now.",

I have since then prescribed it to friends and family and achieved amazing results. Friends of friends have found out about it and asked for treatment too. The drugs are quite cheap in my country. My consultation fee is at the average lowest. And the hair/dermatologic market space is saturated of expensive treatments that just milk money from patients with zero to minimal effect. Its just that people are not well informed on fin/min.\n\nI would like to reach more people and help them regain the hair they love.\n\nI am not sure how to proceed, since I currently have almost no advertising of this treatment. Also, the drugs can simply be prescribed by any other doctor too. How should I go about this when marketing? I am not sure how to proceed.\n\nHow did you find out about it? How do you think I can reach more patients and help?\n\nThank you!",

After rinsing the conditioner off, I use 1-2 pumps of the Super Rich serum and then use the Leave-in Conditioner on my ends and scrunch them. I then leave it to air-dry or either just clip it up.\n\nI usually protect my hair while sleeping by wearing a silk bonnet but other than that everything I've mentioned above is all I do to my hair currently.\n\nCan you guys help me with a routine, the right products and what method I can do to fully bring my curls out?

Sharing my Jan &amp; Feb empties.\n\nSkin type: Acne-prone combination\n\nSeason: Winter (my skin becomes dry)\n\nDuring winter, I focused more on hydration and barrier repair while slowly targeting acne\n\n• COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Essence\n\nUsing this for the past 3 years and always keep it stocked. Great for hydration and calming acne without clogging pores. A solid staple for my winter routine.\n\n• L’Oréal Glycolic Bright Serum\n\nUsing regularly at night for pigmentation. It works gradually acne marks fade with consistent use. Needs patience.(WRP)\n\n• L’Oréal Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\nOkay-okay hydration. Lightweight, layers well, not sticky. Nothing extraordinary, but does the job. I personally prefer this over The Ordinary one. (WNRP)\n\n• L’Oréal Eye Serum\n\nBetter for puffiness. I mainly have dark circles (no puffiness), and it helped slightly but not dramatically.\n\n(WNRP)\n\n• The Derma Co AHA-BHA-PHA Peeling Solution\n\nFirst time trying it. Helped with texture and mild acne marks but caused some irritation. (WNRP)\n\n• Earth Rhythm Phytoceramide Moisturizer\n\nReally helpful for winter dryness. Texture is similar to CeraVe or Bioderma — creamy, barrier-supporting, and nourishing without clogging pores. Worked very well for my dry skin during winter. (WNRP)\n\n• Moody Sunscreen\n\nVery lightweight and great for humid weather. My tube was close to expiry, so I finished it during winter. Texture-wise, better suited for summer. (MRP)\n\n• Deconstruct Sunscreen\n\nGood for winter, slightly heavier. Budget-friendly, but I don’t think I can use it in summer. (WNRP)\n\n• Parachute Body Lotion\n\nBasic winter body lotion. Does the job for dryness.",

      "content": "[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Addiction/?f=flair_name%3A%22Routine%20Help%22)Hi all! I have very dry, reactive, sensitive skin with rosacea. I switched from bioderma micellar water to LRP dermo cleanser (I can’t tolerate even gentle regular cleansers, before bioderma I used vanicream cleanser which felt super stripping as well). The LRP cleaner is the first one I’ve ever tried that doesn’t leave my face feeling tight. Before my face would be tight 24/7. Now it actually feels calm. I also had some itching due to the dryness and inflammation, which I don’t get anymore. Before I’d have to use two thick layers of cream and sometimes a third during the day, now I just do one. However, my face looks worse than before. I’m not breaking out or anything, but it just seems less smooth, although it feels soft to the touch so idk. I am tempted to go back to micellar water just bc my face looked better, even though my face felt worse. Maybe it was due to the drying effect that made my pores look smoother before, like astringent toners?\n\nIs this temporary? It also isn’t severe at all, probably just like 2-3% less smooth. Any insight?\n\n  \n",
