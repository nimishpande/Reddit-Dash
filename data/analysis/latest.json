      "content": "I have noticed that a lot of brands are reformulating their cool toned products lately, and the new formulas all end up pulling super warm. A few examples:\n\n- Nars Orgasm is now just orange/peach glitter with no pink color base\n- Mac reformulated lipsticks such as Angel, Creme Cup, etc. that now are warm nudes that pull orange \n- OPI just completely discontinued Russian Navy (we ride at dawn) \n- No new eyeshadow palettes include a shade/shades of blue or emerald green like they did in the 2016 eyeshadow palette era \n\nThe excuse being given a lot of places is that there is a blue pigment shortage or an increase in costs of blue pigments in the cosmetic industry, so they are reformulating their cool products to no longer be cool. Anyone who loves a baby pink lipstick or gloss can feel my pain in that I can spend 45 min in Sephora swatching all the pink glosses in the store and can’t find a good frosty baby pink like the ones I loved years ago. \n\nI even saw a TikTok recently of a girl who pulled some 90’s L’Oréal lipsticks that were all super cool funky 90’s style cool toned browns and nudes, and purchased the modern day versions which were the exact same shades. She put the OG on half her lip and the new one on the other half, and the new versions were all almost totally sheer and orange as hell. \n\nSo what’s really going on? I’ve seen articles saying there is in fact NOT a shortage of blue pigment. These are multi-billion dollar corporations for God’s sake, are we supposed to believe LOREAL can’t afford the color blue? \n\nI’ve tried to deep dive to see what I can find about who owns these pigment companies and can’t find anything meaningful, but all I can say is that I’m pissed lol. \n\nDoes anyone have any insight here??

I apply it before shower and I leave it on for at least 10 minutes. 3 times a week. Started ketoconazole on the first of December 2025 and it really improved the crown area. Sometimes my scalp gets itchy and I stop the nizoral for a couple of days more till I feel comfortable starting again.  \n- 50 micro grams of vitamin d a day, since the first of October 2025. I took a blood test July this year and I had 20 ng/ml. I booked another blood test in February. Around the same time I integrated iron for the same reasons but I don’t remember dosages. \n- 2ml of castor oil a day since the beginning of December. I don’t really know if it had an impact but I’ll include for anyone wondering. It’s really cheap and I thought it was worth a shot. Orally. \n\nI had no sides. \n\nI’d like to specify that I don’t use toppik. The pictures you see represent reality as it is. No products, no density boost, no fibers, no nothing.

      "title": "[Product Request] Affordable ($30 or less) everyday facial sunscreen for really sensitive skin and eyes?",
      "content": "I’m looking for recommendations for an affordable (under $30 a tube) daily face sunscreen that won’t burn my eyes. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and eyes, and some undiagnosed skin condition that is probably eczema. I need something 50+ SPF or higher, preferably not drying, strongly scented, tinted (I’m really pale and tinted sunscreen oxidizes orange on me), no oxybenzone or other common allergens, and not overly oily.\n\nIdeally I'd like it to be moisturizing enough to not need a separate moisturizer underneath, with a dewy or skin-like finish, as I get dry, flaky spots with matte formulations.\n\nI’ve tried a TON of sunscreens, as I use tretinoin. I’ve only found one sunscreen that doesn’t burn unbearably AND feels okay on the skin- Trader Joe’s Enrich Moisturizing Face Lotion with SPF 15. But SPF 15 is too low.\n\nThree other sunscreens don’t burn, but I hate how they feel: Vanicream Facial Moisturizer for Sensitive Skin SPF 30, Eucerin Gentle Protection Daily Lotion &amp; Sunscreen SPF 30, and Abib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar SPF 50++.\n\nI’m going to offer a lot of information that I hope helps, but I’ll have a TLDR too.\n\nFeel free to critique other parts of my routine- I’m always looking to improve it.\n\n**Skin Type:** I have pretty dry, mildly acne-prone, and flaky skin that gets irritated extremely easily. I react really poorly to most skincare- I get dry flaky patches, redness, itchiness, tightness, painful burns, or I break out. Sunscreen is the worst culprit of all- not only does my skin react (usually with itchiness or stinging), but most sunscreens sting my eyes unrelentingly, no matter how far away I keep the product from my eyes.\n\n**Current Skincare Routine:**\n\n**Night:**\n\nCleanser: Either La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser or CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, if I’m wearing light makeup I remove it with water or argan oil, if heavy makeup (almost never) I’ll double cleanse with Ponds Cold Cream.\n\nActives: Tretinoin 0.025% Cream every 1-2 nights (this is new, started about 6 months ago). I wait about 10 minutes after washing before putting it on, and then about 20 after putting it on before moisturizing.\n\nMoisturizer: I mix Egyptian Magic with Vanicream. I put extra Egyptian Magic on my eyes and lips.\n\n**Morning:**\n\nCleanser: My skin doesn’t react well to over-cleansing, so I usually just do nothing or rinse with water and pat my skin dry.\n\nSunscreen: I follow up with my current pick (that I don’t like), Abib Quick Sunstick.\n\n**Sunscreens I’ve Tried (and why I hated them):**\n\nTrader Joes Daily Facial Sunscreen SPF 40: burns eyes, formula sucks, so oily and drying at the same time.\n\nTrader Joes Daily Facial Mineral Sunscreen SPF 40: burns eyes, formula sucks, oily and drying.\n\nVanicream Facial Moisturizer for Sensitive Skin SPF 30- doesn’t burn but formula sucks, thick and oily, never dries down.\n\nByoma Ultra-Lightweight Face Fluid SPF 30;’ I like the way it looks on the skin, and it didn’t break me out in scales, but burns my eyes.\n\nEucerin Gentle Protection Daily Lotion &amp; Sunscreen SPF 30: doesn’t burn, but I’d like longer-lasting hydration, the formula enhances my dry patches by 1000x.\n\nCerave Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50: burned a bit but tolerable, way too greasy and has a strong blue tint, even on pale skin.\n\nNeutrogena Ultra-Sheer Dry Touch : This hurt my eyes so badly, they were red and teary for hours.\n\nAbib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar SPF 50++: The best so far! It’s a little too greasy, but I liked the stick application, it didn’t burn my eyes or accentuate my dry spots.\n\nRaw Elements Face+Body SPF 30: I liked the tin, but the formula was thick and greasy.\n\nSun Bum SPF 50: Burned my eyes.\n\n**TLDR;** Looking for a semi-affordable face sunscreen for very sensitive skin that is natural or dewy finish, moisturizing without being too greasy, SPF 50 or higher, not tinted, and won't burn my eyes.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

The last few haircuts I've had have been really bomb!! Despite this, my hair always looks so bad. It's not damaged, I never use heat or straighten my hair, I don't colour or bleach it. So it should be very healthy but it's always frizzy af!\n\nI have always just let my hair air dry, or blow-dried it with a regular hair dryer on low (which is terrible), because I could never figure out how to use a diffuser!! I finally decided to invest in the shark flexstyle hair dryer and it comes with a diffuser attachment... Omg it's a game changer. My curls have never looked better! Air drying always left my hair so flat and simultaneously frizzy, and now I have nice juicy voluminous curls! It's amazing. I definitely recommend the shark or whatever kind of fancy diffuser you're looking at getting! People complain that the shark is loud, but honestly, as a sound-sensitive person, it really isn't that bad as long as you're not aiming it directly into your ear haha.\n\n*(Routine: shampoo (Ouai detox), conditioner (AG curl fresh), out of the shower I spray the innate life's neroli primer on my hair, then used the mielle Rosemary mint cream, and AG CARE mousse-gel. Then diffused with shark. Amazing)*",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

On the hunt for a new, non-comedogenic moisturizer for my dry ance-prone skin but it feels like every time I find something I might like it has niacinamide hidden in there which my skin hates for some reason. I recently tried out the Sofie Pavitt omega-rich moisturizer which I really loved but it’s pretty pricey and there isn’t enough product to justify the splurge every other month, so looking for some more budget-friendly options that won’t leave my skin feeling angry and irritated.\n\nFor reference, my skin is definitely on the drier side and I do struggle with mostly hormonal ance, which I’m currently trying to rectify with a low dose of spironolactone - also just started Differin Adapalene gel a few times a week which I know can be quite drying as well. I’ve been focusing on barrier repair lately so really trying to find a great moisturizer to add to my super simplified cleanser/moisturizer/retinoid routine - any help/advice is so appreciated!!",

InnerSense I Create Volume serum - rake\n6. InnerSense I Create Curl Memory gel - rake\n7. BounceCurl EdgeLift brush - sections \n8. Biosilk Rock Hard gelee - glaze &amp; scrunch \n9. Laifen SE diffuser \n10. Righteous Roots hair oil- scrunch out the cast  \n\nTonight it was just shampoo, conditioner (rinsed well) and BounceCurl brush, and diffuser. \n\nWhat I think this affirmed for me is that:\n1. My many curly-hair products do not \"weigh down\" my wavy-curly hair\n2. My hair without products still looks much better and less frizzy than it used to when I brushed it after towel drying because I'm treating it like curly hair and not defective straight hair.\n3. With products and styling, my hair is glossier, shiny-er, curlier, and more defined.\n4. Instead of looking great with a little refreshing, my hair will be a frizzy bush tomorrow and the days following, and will go up in a silicone curly tie and stay there until I feel up to (or be allowed to) take a shower and do my full routine \n5. And most importantly, that there is immense value in my twice-a-week routine that makes my time &amp; money well spent.\n\nI love my wavy-curly hair!!!!",
