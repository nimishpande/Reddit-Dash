      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "title": "Recommendations for top of hair?",
      "content": "Hello there!! I’m hoping to get maybe some tips or advice for the top of my hair because I’m kinda stuck. \n\nMy hair routine so in the shower includes: \n- Eufora urgent repair (a clarifying shampoo- product buildup loves me) \n-Eufora aloe therapy shampoo after that for moisture (I’m considering dropping these bc they’re expensive so if you have any store bought recommendations lmk)\n- if I wash my hair more than once a week, I use the L’Oréal Elvive Hyaluron+Pump - I bought this specifically bc I think I have low porosity hair? I get confused bc in the shower my hair gets wet right away but when I’m starting w dry hair &amp; spraying it with my continuous misting sprayer, I really have to spray a lot and do praying hands over my hair or else it just sits in beads on top of my hair.\n- Mielle Babassu &amp; Min Deep Conditioner OR \n- Not your mother’s Tahitian gardenia flower &amp; mango butter conditioner \nProducts out of the shower include: \n- Not your mother’s nourishing curl talk leave in (my hair loooooves this) \n- For gel, I’ll use either Miss Jessie’s Jelly Soft Curls or just straight 100% natural aloe Vera gel (my hair likes the aloe better) \n- if I use a mousse, it’s going to be the Herbal Essences Curl Boosting Mousse in the purple bottle \n\nI get my hair trimmed every 8 weeks &amp; i get my roots touched up w/ a brown-copper every 16 weeks. I do sleep with a silk bonnet and if im wearing my hair up, it’s always with a banana clip or a claw clip. \n\nNow, my main problem is the top of my hair, from basically the tops of my ears and up. It’s super flat and just doesn’t want to curl. I used to get my hair bleached (highlights) so normally I’d say that was the issue but it’s been so long that I don’t have any left in my hair. The bottom of my hair is super curly. Everything above that, I basically have to force to somewhat curl with a comb (I’ll brush it and twist it around the tail end of a rat tail comb like one would with a denman brush). A few months ago, I cut my hair up to my shoulders and got a lot of layers to see if that would help the top of my hair curl but alas, it did not. \n\nI’ve attached photos just to show exactly what I’m talking about. The non-collage one best represents what my hair looks like after my full routine and you can see the top is just meh and ive sorta forced it to curl (btw im a natural sandy-blonde and when im outside a lot, the top of my hair gets a lot lighter - that’s why i stopped bleaching my hair). I understand that I could just have different curl types and it can truly be that drastic of a difference between the curl types on one person’s head, but the top front of my hair near my face just started to curl up right at the root (it’s never done this before- image of this also included) so I think there’s potential and I’m not sure what else I can do to bring those out. \n\nAny help or recommendations is greatly appreciated 🫶🏼",

I now look at my old photos and miss the skin I used to have and think it wasn’t even that bad before 😭\n\nI’ve now been trying to clear it up by simplifying my routine with just micellar water, gel cleanser, hydrating serum, and gel moisturiser but I’m generally just really lost. I assume I have closed comedones but it looks nothing like the photos I’ve seen when searched. Please help me 🙏🏼\n\nNote: these were all taken with makeup on!!

My acne hasn’t seemed to improved. Also not sure why I’m starting to flake again from tretinoin when I’ve been using it since 2021.\n\nCurrent routine: Monday, Wednesday, Friday mornings: Wash with Roundlab dodko clenaser currentbody acne led mask Skin1004 Madagascar centella ampoule Numbuzin no. 5+ vitamin c Serum Illiyoon ceramide lotion Roundlab birch juice SPF\n\nThursday, Saturday mornings: PanOxyl wash Skin1004 Madagascar centella ampoule Numbuzin no. 5+ vitamin c Serum Illiyoon ceramide cream Roundlab birch juice SPF\n\nSunday morning: Wash with Roundlab dodko clenaser Skin1004 Madagascar centella ampoule Numbuzin no. 5+ vitamin c Serum Illiyoon ceramide cream Roundlab birch juice SPF\n\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday night: Wash with roundlab dodko cleanser dr G R.E.D. blemish clear soothing cream Tretinoin .05% Illiyoon ceramide cream\n\nTuesday &amp; Thursday night: Wash with roundlab dodko cleanser Paula’s choice azelaic acid Illiyoon ceramide cream\n\nSunday night: Wash with roundlab dodko cleanser Illiyoon ceramide cream\n\nI was thinking to add the Biodance PHA toner once a week, maybe switch the tretinoin on Saturday night to that?",
