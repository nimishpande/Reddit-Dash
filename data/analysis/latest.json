      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

(An hr or so after gettin home)\n\n• Azelaic acid (Aziderm 10percent) - Bcs i’m a girl and eventually get a pimple or two😔 so so so,this product really really helps with scarsss!! (Alternate day with tret)\n\n• Snail Mucin (cosrx) - I need ample hydration in winters so this helps with it (usage - am n pm) \n\n• Sunscreen (derma co n foxtale) - spf 50+ sunscreen bcs all the products i use require sunscreen and also u anyway have to use it if you get tanned easily (everyday,am n afternoon/anytime before goin out in sun) \n\n• Hydrating agent (Boroplus)- tret is infamous for causing dryness,i highly recommend sandwich method while applying tret and i use Boroplus (whose hydration imo is unmatched)\n\n• With Rogan Badam Shrieen , i do a monthly massage which keeps the skin plump and supple, u can do the same with coconut oil too\n\n• Snail peptide under eye cream - since initially i didnt use tret on under eye area,i used to use this to keep the under eye,fine line free (on the day of azelaic acid)\n\n• Vaseline Lip therapy (rose tinted) since ive very very very dry lips,this has been the Holy grail for my lips  (everytime i feel dry lips+right before bed)\n\n• Rice toner (the face shop)-didnt think it helped really,so not anymore. \n\nThis has been a journey of 4months + ive combination skin (highly influenced by seasons )\n\nHappy to answer more Qs in comments and incase u made it till the last🧃!

This skincare routine is for treating dark circles, and I started it a week ago. I've seen minor improvements but today the cerave burned quite a bit at night so I stopped there. I'm a noob to this stuff\n\nMorning:  \n  \n\\- Wash (CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser)  \n\\- 1 drop of \"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5%\" under each eye  \n\\- 2-3 drops of \"La Roche-Posay Mela B3 Serum\" under each eye  \n\\- A tiny fingertip of \"Dr. Reju-All Advanced Retino-Mela Serum\" under each eye  \n\\- A dab of \"medicube No Cast Just Glow Collagen Sunscreen\" on both sides of face  \n\\- Seal under-eye area moisture with a little vaseline\n\nNight: \n\n\\- Wash (CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser)  \n\\- Aeryea Under Eye Patches with Vitamin C &amp; Caffeine for 15 minutes  \n\\- 2-3 drops of \"La Roche-Posay Mela B3 Serum\" under each eye  \n\\- A tiny fingertip of \"Dr. Reju-All Advanced Retino-Mela Serum\" under each eye  \n\\- Seal under-eye area moisture with a little vaseline\n\nI gently rub this off before going to bed with a cool wet wipe.  \n  \nWhat should I change? My skin isn't usually extremely sensitive and none of this makes me break out (I don't really break out at all, just trying to do something about the dark circles). I suspect the under-eye patches might be damaging my skin because they make my face tingle, but I want to see what you guys think in case I'm committing some kind of skincare sin and don't realize it.",

She asked me what I thought when she dried it and I said it looks a bit brown? She told me after 4 weeks of washing it should be the blonde I asked for but I don’t want to wait that long. I only wash my hair once a week as it’s naturally quite dry so I really don’t want to be washing it all the time… She told me not to dye it or bleach again so i don’t know what to do. I’m used to doing my hair icy so I’m not sure how to actually get warm tones back without making it too warm.\nI picked a colour specialist salon with loads of 5 star reviews and all these rewards they won so I’m so disappointed.

      "content": "Currently on vacation in Puerto Vallarta. Two days ago, I was in the pool on a floatie for a good few hours. I noticed mildly burnt my chest and my stomach - despite applying high spf sunscreen. The following day, I wore a one piece bathing suit all day to keep the areas covered. Upon waking up this morning, I noticed my chest redness had faded substantially but patches around my stomach are now raised and tender (pictured). It almost feel like a burn you get from a curling iron or touching a hot pan. My boyfriend thought maybe spilleda drink with lots of lime on myself while in the floatie and accidentally gave myself a citrus burn... but it's hard to know for sure. Not sure if should seek medical attention. \n\nGenerally, feel ok, but I'm also on day 6 of an all inclusive vacation so obviously a little run down. lve never had anything like this happen so I'm a little concerned. It's not super itchy per se, but it's def tender to touch. What should do? Keep it dry? Keep it lubed up with aloe? Or should just bite th bullet and call in a doctor? Any help (or maybe reassurance!) would be so appreciated.",
