      "content": "\nWhen I first became aware of all the ‚Äúdrugstore is bad‚Äù and ‚Äúsulfates and silicones ruin your hair‚Äù stuff, it was around 2016. I was 15, and honestly all the info being thrown around online back then confused me sooo much. From like 15‚Äì19, I was using natural or sulfate/silicone-free hair products because I thought that‚Äôs what I was supposed to do. My hair was always dry, frizzy, tangled, it was a mess. I figured ‚Äúwell, i guess this is just how my hair is.‚Äù Then around 2022, thanks to abbey yung and labmuffinbeautyscience I started actually learning more about hair science, ingredient functions, and how insanely misunderstood sulfates and silicones are. Now I‚Äôm 24, and after a ton of trial and error, I‚Äôve finally found what works best for my hair and it‚Äôs all drugstore stuff with silicones and sulfates. i use products from a few different brands (Garnier, Dove, Pantene,H&amp;S) and all the hair issues I struggled with for years are completely gone!! \n\nAll of this just makes me so mad because there was SO much fear mongering and misinformation floating around for years. Idk it makes me sad and mad thinking about younger me being so lost and confused when it came to my hair and what to use‚Ä¶ meanwhile all the products were right there the whole time but i avoided them like the plague üò≠!!! Tbh the fact that most of it is exaggerated, taken out of context, or totally depends on your hair type and routine‚Ä¶ is crazy to me. Anyone else have this same experience?! ",

Blood tests show no significant testosterone difference between hairy and bald men.\n* **Prolactin and Cortisol Drive Hair Loss**: He points to elevated prolactin (the ‚Äúmolting hormone‚Äù in animals) and cortisol (stress hormone) as key players in hair shedding, affecting both men and women.\n* **Testosterone Helps Hair Growth**: Contrary to popular belief, Peat says testosterone promotes thicker, faster-growing hair.\n* **Thyroid and Metabolism Matter**: Low thyroid function and poor energy production shift the body toward cortisol over hair-friendly hormones like progesterone and DHEA, worsening hair loss.\n* **Stress Links to Other Issues**: Peat connects baldness to heart disease and earlobe creases, suggesting stress hormones like prolactin and cortisol are the common thread.",

I feel like this whole combination hasn't been working for my skin though (i tried it for a month - is that not enough time?) and i've stopped using it (stopped maybe two weeks ago). I think my skin might be combination skin since it's pretty normal on the sides, but my nose gets oily and maybe my forehead too? I don't really mind having a bit of blackheads and what not, but i just wanted to see if there's anything i could do to improve my skin. :)) Maybe i started off with too many products? I want something simple to start off, but i'm looking for suggestions that won't dry out my skin, but also something to help with my acne, which i think might be hormonal. I'm thinking to start off with a simple routine of cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen and slowly add some acids as i've heard that is the smartest thing to do - what do you guys recommend/think?\n\nSorry for the really messy post ü•π",

I tried posting about this early on in my treatment but the post was rejected. (Hoping this one isn't...I read a lot in this group but don't post much.)

(I put pictures for reference I don‚Äôt have any good ones tho)\n\nI started a routine:\n1. wash hair two times with the neqi moisture mystery \n2. conditioner (Jean and len smooth me now keratin conditioner) \n3. let hair sit in towel for like 5 minutes before flipping all my hair upside down and putting a moisture leave in conditioner in my hair (German brand, people on tiktok say it‚Äôs good and I like it too) the brush my hair \n4. got2b curl mousse (it‚Äôs called lockmittel in German) \n5. heatprotectant that also gives a lot of hold by invisibobble\n6. hair gel for curly by Bali curls\n7. diffuse head over (as close to 180 degrees as I can get) (I put my hair into the diffuser thingy all at once because my hair is quite thin and I also had an undercut that I‚Äôm currently trying to grow out)\n8. scrunch out with oil \n\nNow my problem: \nI dry my hair the way I do because it gives me the most volume and looks the best this way from all the methodes I‚Äôve tried so far. \nHowever no matter what I do the hair at the back of my head is always straight and I basically have to make it wet and diffuse all over again because it looks aweful otherwise. (Picture for reference when its freshly dried)\nAlso I have to wet and diffuse my lengths in the morning because I can‚Äôt make them stay over night. I don‚Äôt sleep with a bonnet because i try to live vegan and I have yet to find a good vegan bonnet, any recommendations are welcome (but keep in mind that I‚Äôm from Germany)\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for me on how I can resolve the problems?

Its not super demanding physically, and climate controlled, so I'm not sweating much.\n\nAll I'm currently using on my head is a Cetaphil low oil wash. I used to use moisturizers as well that said they either reduced oil buildup or had a matte finish, but I feel like they always made the issue worse so I just stopped using the ones I have and now just use the Cetaphil daily. I'm getting discouraged throwing money at products that don't end up working for me, but if anyone has any success stories with a certain product I'd love to hear about it!

Her hair is so fine and brittle, that when I try to put it up, it will often break off.\n\nWe've had it cut a couple times, because the back was just completely damaged. Now her bangs are getting in her eyes, and I'm not sure if she needs another cut, or if we should let it grow out.\n\nLast time my mother in law came to visit she kept saying it looked like she had a mullet.\n\nWe only wash it about once a week, then heavily condition it. I use de-tangling spray on it, then brush it with a gentle de-tangling brush. She sleeps on a satin pillowcase. But every morning it's still a tangled mess.\n\nThe main issue is that she's beginning to take notice of her hair. A few times she's looked in the mirror and said sadly, \"I look like a boy.\" Which is not something I've taught her. She's also asked me to make her have pretty princess hair, and I just don't know what to do.\n\nAny advice on care, cutting, or styling is very much appreciated.",

      "content": "I know that immediately sounds terrifying, but hear me out. I have been using nair for years on the under side my chin/neck area. I have PCOS and grow a palm sized patch of long hair there. The bottle says to not exceed 10 minutes but I knew I had some tough hair so I let it go for the full 10 minutes. Nothing happened. I wiped it off and not a lot of hair came with. I put it on according the the instructions, I left it alone, didn't rub it in, etc. So I started letting it stay for longer and longer. I now leave it on for an entire hour before wiping it away, and even then I still have to do a second coat as there's still some left. I've never gotten a burn or pain, at most it will tingle and then be slightly red after for only a little bit but not hurt. Does anyone else relate or know what is going on here? Is my skin odd? Is my hair tough? Any suggestions or ideas would be appreciated",

I only air dry, I don't have a diffuser. just a dryer with no attachments. if I gel I will put it up in a cheap bonnet for 10-15 so I'm not dripping water everywhere.

I also seem to completely miss the back of my hair when I make extra sure I get gel back there... I wonder if I'm doing it wrong or if my bonnet is absorbing it? \n\nI also have autism and the feel of gel in my hair makes my skin crawl. so I don't usually gel. \n\nis there anything I can try doing different? my budget is insanely tight so I can't spend more than $15-$20 on products. \n\nthanks in advance.",
