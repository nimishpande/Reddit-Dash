Yeah so Tretinoin really does work if used according to your skins needs. (If you want to ask about peeling, then yes it peeled for first one year and now also it peels but significantly low peeling, and strangely the peeling kinda reduced when I jumped from 0.05% to 0.1%, so yeah it might take different durations for your skin to adapt to the peeling). If you have acne like me just know that tret can fix this, you just gotta trust the process.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Turns out that’s where the real headache starts😅\n\nRight now I’m trying to decide between Estenove (Dr. Zafer), Fuecapilar (Dr. Turan), Pure Line Clinic (Dr. Mesut) and Dr.Serkan Aygin. My budget is limited, which makes this even harder\n\nEstenove keeps popping up in ads. Their videos look solid and they have tons of positive Google and Trustpilot reviews, which is reassuring. Fuecapilar gets recommended everywhere, but it’s a bit expensive. Dr. Turan seems very legit, but I’m not sure if the difference is worth going into debt for. I’ve also seen some mixed Google reviews, even though the good results look really great. I had a video consult with Dr. Mesut and everything felt very positive. I like that it’s a boutique clinic and they only do one operation per day and I’ve found some positive real patient reviews online. On the other hand, Estenove and especially Dr. Serkan Aygin have thousands of reviews, which feels safer in a different way. With Dr. Serkan Aygin there’s so much content out there that my brain is kind of fried at this point.\n\nI really don’t want to add more clinics and confuse more. Any honest advice?",

      "content": "Hello. A few years ago I decided to finally resolve an issue I had concerning cherry angiomas on my skin. My mother mentioned a skincare clinic she had heard about and I ended up scheduling an appointment there. In hindsight I should have done more research on the topic as well as clinics because I ended up paying 600€ to have just a few of them removed via electrocautery treatment, resulting in large burns which then left scars. They aren't terrible looking scars or anything but I was left with small white hypopigmented, slightly raised bumps on my chest. Oddly enough I had two removed from my scrotum and while they appeared hypopigmented at first the scars ended up fading away.\n\nI was wondering if there are any products or treatments that can improve the appearance of these scars? To my understanding if I get any cherry angiomas removed in the future I should apply silicone scar tape to help prevent the appearance of any scars, but what can be done to fix the appearance of already developed scars? As previously mentioned they are small bumps which makes me wonder if that means they can actually be fixed so as to not have any volume and match the rest of my skin tone.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions I'd be glad to hear them! Thanks!",

      "content": "Natural ingredients aren’t bad. They never were. The problem started when “natural” began to be used as a marketing method to quietly position “chemical” as something harmful.\n\nOver the last few years, “Natural” stopped being a description and became a value judgment. It began to mean safer or better, while “chemical” was framed as harsh or artificial. \n\nThat contrast sold products, but it also created a false divide\n\nIn reality:\n\n• Even plant-based ingredients go through extraction, purification, stabilisation, and preservation. \n\n• Without this, they wouldn’t survive storage, transport, heat, humidity, or daily use, especially in warmer climates.\n\n• Some people do well with mostly plant-based formulations. Others need lab-refined actives when dealing with concerns like acne, pigmentation, barrier damage, or ageing.\n\n• Often, “chemical” ingredients simply help speed up or target a process that would take much longer otherwise.\n\n• What often gets missed is that many ingredients people trust today are still labelled “chemical,” even though they’re derived from nature.\n\n• Retinol is derived from vitamin A. It’s refined to work faster and more effectively than its natural forms. \n\nIt comes with guidelines (like using sunscreen everyday) not because it’s harmful, but because it’s powerful. Chemicals need more understanding, not fear.\n\nSkincare doesn’t fail because ingredients are chemical. It fails when ingredients are poorly formulated, or marketed through fear instead of outcomes.\n\nCurious, how do you decide what works for your skin – ingredient labels or actual results?",
