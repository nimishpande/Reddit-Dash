I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast.

I think I need to take care of it differently\n\nthe current routine:\n\n\\- vichy dercos sensitive shampoo\n\n\\- the ordinary behentrionium chloride 2% conditioner\n\n\\- harologi rebuild spray, every third wash for 5 min\n\n\\- hask curl defining cream, scrunched in\n\n\\- air dry or dry with diffuser\n\nthe pictures have been taken on wash day after diffuser drying and brushing once completely dry\n\nI suspect that this routine is drying out my hair a bit too much and I think the curl cream is too heavy. I‘m not sure whether the uneven curl pattern is due to my products not being ideal (the top layer is quite dry) or if that‘s just naturally what my hair does now\n\nI‘d like to try new products and techniques but am having a hard time navigating the sea of options. Any advice I can start researching from is appreciated :) I kind of don‘t know where to begin, that curl cream belonged to my ex and I just stuck with it lol\n\nalso… please be very honest, I feel like the back of my hair looks tragic ;-; do you think I should cut it shorter? I love the way it curls in the front at this lenght but whenever I see a picture of me at a slight angle or from the back I feel pain\n\nthank you!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Almost everything I use regularly at home, and the travel sizes are stuff I've used fine at home and at my daughter's house. \n\nIs the water in the hotel too hard or soft?\n\nThis was my second wash at this hotel. First was fine, not exceptional, but fine. Second wash, hair washed fine, suds were normal. \n\nThe InnerSense Conditioner is amazing, normally, but this time my hair tangled badly, and the wet frizz was off the charts when I rinsed it out. Usually, I have soft seaweed hair after rinsing. Not this time. So, I put extra EcoSlay cream (normally use AG beach bomb sparingly at home), and it felt sticky, so I added more water, and \"squish to condish\" without improvement. \n\nI loaded up my hair with InnerSense I Create volume, that I normally I use for slip while brushing, and it was better, but my hair felt WEIRD. \n\nSo, second wash I left the gel off. Tried a little InnerSense I Create Lift foam to help with definition. Diffused, and I guess it'll stay in a pineapple until I go home. \n\nRoutine (travel kit)\n1.

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m hoping to hear from others who have dealt with something similar or have any suggestions. Any advice would is appreciated!\n\n**Background**\n\n• I have a small, circular, raised hypertrophic scar on the back of my upper thigh near my hip.\n\n• I see my dermatologist regularly, about four times a year, mainly for Tretinoin management\n\n• About two months ago, I had this spot evaluated in person, and had a follow up appointment last week.\n\n• I regularly exfoliate and moisturize the area, but never shave (completed a full course of of Laser Hair Removal sessions on my legs about a year ago).\n\n**What We’ve Tried so Far**\n\nMy dermatologist initially recommended a corticosteroid injection to reduce redness and flatten the scar.\n\nI previously had two steroid injections for a small hypertrophic scar on my chin last year, spaced six weeks apart, and that treatment worked extremely well. This time, the injection did not improve the scar on my upper thigh at all. There has been no flattening or reduction in redness.\n\nBecause of this, I was prescribed a 0.05% corticosteroid cream to use one to two times daily for a couple weeks.\n\n**My Current Concerns**\n\n1. The area still looks red and raised, and I am worried it could be slowly getting larger.\n2. My dermatologist mentioned that if there is no improvement with the topical steroid, a biopsy should be the next step, (I understand biopsies can be routine, but I’ve never needed one before, and I don’t know enough about them).\n\nHas anyone had a hypertrophic scar that did not respond to steroid injections or topical steroids? If so, what ended up helping, or what was the next step in your treatment process?\n\n**TLDR:** Hypertrophic scar on upper thigh did not respond to steroid injection and now using 0.05% steroid cream. Biopsy was mentioned as a next step and I am wondering if others have had similar experiences.",

      "content": "Hi I recently bought the medicube night wrapping mask, collagen jelly cream and triple collagen serum and i also bought the pdrn peptide serum and medicube booster pro. I was using these for a couple of days and no reaction at all. I then bought the triple collagen cream, exosome shot which i used once and zero foam cleanser and i pdrn toner and since yesterday no matter what i use my skin is burning? only my cheeks though. I have attached pictures for you to see and if anyone can help me it’d be appreciated. The burn isn’t necessary horrible it’s slightly stinging but bearable. Idk why but i feel like it’s the toner but im not sure. Should i give my skin a break and then try figure out what’s going on or just chuck away. It’s a shame cos my skin was quite glowy. \n\nThe first two pics are my skin just after and the rest are my skin once it’s cooled down. I’ve always had acne on my chin and have recently started to get it on the side of my face, does anyone have any recommendations? ",

I’ve struggled with a very oily scalp forever, while my mids and ends are super dry. The longest I can go without washing is every other day. If I wait even two days, my hair gets very oily and I start getting itchy spots around the back of my head.\n\nI’ve tried everything. I did the whole Head &amp; Shoulders thing and it made my scalp feel very dry and worse. I tried the salicylic acid drops from CVS, which helped a little, but my roots are still oily and the rest of my hair is dry. I’ve tried masks for my dry ends and leave them on for 1–2 hours, but it seems to only be a temporary fix. I know people who shower once a week and I’m so jealous because I could never.\n\nHas anyone been in my situation and can offer me any advice? Here are some more details about my hair:\n\n• I have slightly wavy hair\n\n• I get full highlights twice a year\n\n• I curl my hair 3–4 times a week for school and always use heat protectant",
