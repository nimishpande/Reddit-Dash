The Japanese FDA determined that the starting dose of dutasteride for treating androgenetic alopecia should be 0.1 mg and that, if necessary, doctors can titrate up to 0.5 mg.\n\nhttps://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(13)01171-7/abstract\n\nOne study used as the summary basis of approval for low dose dut in Japan suggests that one may expect slightly better hair growth with 0.1 mg oral dutasteride compared with 1 mg or even 5 mg oral finasteride; Harcha et al. randomized 917 men with androgenetic alopecia to dutasteride 0.02 mg, 0.1 mg, or 0.5 mg daily, finasteride 1 mg daily, or placebo for 24 weeks. They found dutasteride worked in a dose dependent way, and the 0.1 mg dose produced higher hair counts and thicker hairs than placebo, with results that generally trended better than finasteride 1 mg, even though the clearest and most statistically robust superiority over finasteride showed up with 0.5 mg.\n\nIt may be that this lower oral dose of dutasteride is intended for someone who wants to further reduce scalp DHT but doesn’t want to fully commit to the 0.5 mg dose, or for someone who doesn’t tolerate 0.5 mg well and still wants to use the drug to some capacity.",

      "content": "\nHOW TO KEEP THE FOOF BUT ALSO HAVE SOME DEFINITION, I AM DYING OVER HERE. I don't want to use the BounceCurl method for forever. Maybe special occasions. It's long, tedious and I just want a quick routine for during the week.\n\nI hate that unless I do my usual routine to an exact T, I look wavy at best.\n\nListen, I don't know who to go to in regards to this. I am very self conscious about my curls. Honestly, I found a routine and pairing with the bounce curl brush that makes it look \"good\" mostly but I am constantly fluffing it. I find the bounce curl brush leaves me with a lack of volume. (I have tried both brushes) My hair is thin and low porosity. The bounce curl defines my curls but just lacks the volume I want. Even after separating they always go back to that form and ends up looking flat. If I have the proper volume my hair doesn't look as thin. When I brush out my hair it goes full poodle. I want like a semi controlled poodle look but also something that has a little definition. \n\nAnyways, I saw a routine that said Low Porosity hair needs to be more on the damp side in order for our curl type to soak in the products. Otherwise the hair is to full of water to soak up everything you use. My brain immediately was like oh this checks out maybe. So this morning I decided to try it. (Now I did not was my hair, just rewet it, I have strands on the back of my neck that straighten out quickly as they are more wavy, so by day 2-3 it looks ridiculous next to my curls) I squeezed out excess water. Got dressed. Came back. \n\nPer video instructions I did:\n\nApply leave in conditioner on damp hair (I used curlsmith light leave in cream)\n\nBrush through with a regular brush\n\nApply gel (I used innersense gel)\n\nFlip head over, comb hair with fingers longways going down the hair shaft, hold the bottom of your hair and \"wobble\" (aka shake) as she says, once completed take your fingers side ways through your hair then \"wobble\" at the ends (I don't think I wobbled enough idk)\n\nOnce done it said brush again once more with head flipped over (said with a wide tooth this time but I can't find mine) \n\nThen apply the oil to help seal in the moisture which makes sense to my brain\n\nThen diffuse (with the styling on damp hair, it made the process much quicker to diffuse at least)\n\nUsually I use a mousse then put gel on last but I decided to follow instructions. I think I failed at the wobble wobble part? Idk. But I'm going to throw in a picture on what my hair looks like during my weekly weekend wash vs what it looked like today lol. 🥲\n\nDoesn't help that my husband was like you look good, and I was like really? Sarcastically of course. To insinuate that my hair obviously looks different than what he is used to and he played dumb like he had no clue what I was talking about until I said something and then he was like it doesn't look bad. As if that's a compliment 🥀 I am very much self conscious about my hair on a day to day. If my hair doesn't look how I want it to look then I generally don't have the best days because I will keep trying to fix it throughout the day.\n\nAnyways. Any thoughts behind the theory? Anyway I can keep the foof without loosing my definition?\n Obviously this way was way easier on all sides of the spectrum, no sectioning, no bounce curl, just gel and raking through. Even drying was nicer because it didn't take as much time.  I would like to just mix these two pictures together somehow lol. Would adding the mousse before gel help potentially? \n\nFirst picture is of today's routine\n\nSecond picture is my usual weekly wash and style. Help",

I knew of one girl who got her curly hair cut by her and it was really pretty so ! felt comfortable asking her.\n\nI didn't exactly expect the best haircut but what I got was really not what we talked about.\n\nThe first three pictures are the haircut I got last March and even then I thought it was super short but I ended up really liking it. Then the next two pics I took after coming home from getting my haircut. It's so fucking short and choppy and I don't know much about curly haircuts or haircuts in general but I really don't think the layers are blended and the bottom section has much less hair compared the rest. The last three pics are after I finished styling them. It does look way more curlier which is what I wanted but I did not want it this short. She has curly hair and has dealt with curly hair so she knows it shrinks up, we even discussed the longest layer and it shrunk up beyond that, even when she cut it dry it was past the point we agreed on. It was obviously too late to say anything so I just let it be and came to terms with it.\n\nI'm so used to having long hair and this is the shortest I've ever gotten. I don't really think it's hit me completely, I'm trying to tell myself it looks good and it's a good change but I feel like it makes my long and big face pop out more than I want it to, and it makes me look so much bigger. I feel like the haircut looks more like a bob than layers. I can't even put it up in my bonnet how I usually do.\n\nI don't plan on going back to her or asking her to fix it because that would just mean going shorter.  She suggested doing different hairstyles but I think it’s too short for that, plus, my back is way more exposed than I’d like so likely no. I don't really know what type of help I'm asking for. Usually my hair grows a bit fast but I go back to school tomorrow and I'm really dreading it. This is so different from what I'm used to and I find it hard to see me getting used to it. I really hope she doesn't have Reddit or is active on this subreddit be that would be really embarrassing.\n\nRoutine: (apply products all together then section and brush style)\n\nNYM curl talk bond shampoo\n\nV&amp;Co curly hair conditioner\n\nRizos curls refresh and detangle spray\n\nNYM curl cream\n\nMarc Anthony strictly curls curl enhancing styling foam\n\nPineapple method then bonnet\n\nNo refresh routine",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I'm looking for some insight before my dermatologist appointment tomorrow. The Backstory: About 2 years ago, I \"nuked\" my skin. I was stupidly using a high-strength AHA/BHA 25% peel and Retinoids at the same time. I'm certain I broke my skin barrier because I developed insane cystic acne immediately after. Current Situation: The \"Hard\" Acne: I have deep, cystic-like lumps that have been present for 2 years. They have become hard to the touch and haven't budged or come to a head.\n\nNew Breakouts: I'm still getting new acne in the same areas. Texture/Scars: I have significant PIH (dark marks), PIE (red marks), and what looks like ice-pick scarring. Current Routine: For the last 2 years, I've stopped all actives. I only use Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. Spf sunscreen. Location: I'm currently in Delhi and using tap water to wash my face. I suspect the hard water/chlorine might be making things worse.",

Including all the damaged hair, and now its taking shape into what seems like waves. \n  For context, even when I was young with longer hair it was always frizzy and I just followed the family routine of essentially a 3 in 1 shampoo and I straightened my hair a lot.  Now that im trying to avoid heat, anytime I shower it forms like a wave but theres still always frizzy. Most products are to heavy for my fine hair so I use usually some sort of loreal shampoo and conditioner, the miracle 8 water (love) and after the its a 10 lite leave in.  Sometimes ill use the glycolic loreal gloss leave in serum or the redken leave in bonding serum or argan oil but it gets ratty and dry looking most of the time.  I want to have just smooth waves if possible but I always take a brush to my hair and im not sure what lightweight products I can use.  Im not afraid of sulfate or silicone, usually it helps smooth my hair considering all the dye damage.  Its just been very ratty lately.  (Those last 2 photos are the exception. Thats a good hair day)  \n First photos- after a wash day.  2nd- after a silky bonnet and brushing.\nThe third photo is more of what its like most of the time with that frizz and lack of definition.

      "content": "Ever since I was a teenager, I have dealt with severely oily skin and stubborn hormonal acne. But since I have gotten older, and since I’ve gotten medical help to fix hormonal balances, my skin has changed drastically. I think it’s now more of a combination skin type? But I feel like I’m starting from scratch. I don’t know how to tell when my skin is dry, dehydrated, or actually nourished. So I’m just feeling a bit lost. And I’ve been trying to learn online, but all of the advice is “ if your skin is X, use Y.” but I don’t know what my skin is anymore. So I could use some help on which products I need, which products I don’t need, which ingredients might work for me, and which ingredients I should avoid.\n\nThese pictures are about two hours after I cleansed and moisturized. I’ve listed all of my products below, but I only used the first two this morning. I am only wearing lip stain and mascara, no other makeup.\n\nDifferin Daily Deep Cleanser (5% Benzoyl Peroxide)\n\nElf Holy Hydration Hydro-Gel Moisturizer\n\nCerave Ultra-Light Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 (used on days when UV index is above 0)\n\nElf Holy Hydration Thirst Burst Drops (used at night only when my skin is feeling particularly dry)\n\nDifferen Resurfacing Scar Gel\n\nDifferin Acne Spot Treatment (used on incoming acne spots only)\n\nDr Melaxin Peel Shot Black Rice Exfoliator (used 1-2 times per week)\n\nNote on the Millia on my eyelids: I’ve never gotten it before, and I’m pretty sure it was caused by an eye cream that I have since stopped using. So it’s not something I’m worried about.\n\nAlso, I don’t usually have this much RBF 😂",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

My face was itching and irritated, and I almost threw the bottles in the trash. But I decided to stick with it.\n\nNow, 25+ days in, the irritation is totally gone. My skin actually looks bright and has a healthy glow I haven't seen in years. It’s a huge confidence booster before meeting new people next month.\n\nIf any of you guys are clueless about where to start or have a big event (or marriage talks) coming up, let me know! I can suggest a simple plan or share what worked for me.",

I was using it along with a few other Minimalist products, and my skin was honestly in great condition.\n\nI eventually got lazy and stopped doing skincare for a while. A few days ago, I decided to restart my routine and went back to this cleanser since it used to be my go to product.\n\nBut now it feels completely different. It is drying out my skin much more than before and just does not feel the same overall. My skin feels tight and slightly irritated, which never happened with the older version.\n\nSince Minimalist was acquired by Unilever, I am wondering if the formulation has been changed.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this cleanser feeling more drying or different recently?",

I think what he totally missed is to add more layers. \n\n So I got this shortish bang section and then a long layer and a very long layer. I think he already did that last time and I was not happy either but somehow after about four weeks it got better in terms of shape (?). \n\nMy curls are fine on the first day of wash (i.e. today) but from tomorrow on the long layer will be hanging and no longer hold the curl. I think it would benefit from more layers but want to avoid a triangle shape.\n\nI called him today and scheduled a correction for this Friday\n\n\nAny advice on what to tell him exactly what I want?\n**\n\nToday's routine (washed approx 12 h ago, pls ignore the frizz we have very humid and stormy weather today and I came from the office)\n\nWashed without shampoo\nRossman (German drug store) curl conditioner\nThen on wet hair \nJohn Frieda curl cream\nDM (German drug store) curl gel\nScrunched\nAir dried for 10 mins or so, then dried with diffuser\n\nI usually wash max three times a week, once or twice thereof I use Bali curls shampoo (don't like i but will use it up)  and usually air-dry only if time and weather allows\nSleep on a silk pillowcase, no bonnet \nRefresh is dampen hair with a dollop of curl cream throughout\n",
