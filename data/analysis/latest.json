I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

Even though I’ll get 5 compliments a day about it at work, they refuse to believe it and tell me that people probably make fun of me. Obviously I don’t agree with them, but I feel like both myself and them would be happier if I found a different way to take care of my curls or a different length layout to make it look a little more styled, as well as stopping some of their comments. Longer bangs are non negotiable, and I also don’t want any fades or tapers because I’m so bored with getting those over and over again. I just want something that can keep some length on the sides and back, while also feeling a bit more tidy or clean. I’ve tried looking all over Google, but nothing really seemed like it would suit me or my head shape. Any ideas?\n\nCurrently, my routine is using a nizoral shampoo and frizz ease conditioner, as well as a Bb curl cream for after I shower. I gently dry with a towel but mainly rely on air drying.",

      "content": "Took me a while, but I think I’ve finally figured out how to make my Dyson styling actually work — especially on my curly (2C/3A) hair.\n\nThis is the exact order I follow:\n\n• On damp hair, I apply a damage-repair leave-in. Currently using the Redken ABC leave-in.\n\n• Then I layer a small amount of L’Oréal Paris Hyaluron leave-in for extra moisture and the L’Oréal Extraordinary Oil serum for smoothness and shine.\n\n• I let my hair air dry a bit before using heat. If I’m in a hurry, I rough dry slightly first.\n\nFor styling:\n\nMost days, I either use just the round brush attachment for a simple blowout, or just the paddle brush if I want it straighter and sleeker.\n\nToday, I first used the paddle brush attachment to smooth everything out and create a base. After that, I switched to the round barrel attachment for volume and a soft 90s-style blowout.\n\nI work in smaller sections — around 3 seconds on high heat, followed by 4 seconds of cool shot to set.\n\nThe most important step: hairspray after finishing each section. I used Schwarzkopf Taft Ultra. That’s what actually makes the style last without making it stiff.\n\nPeople at work have been asking if I style my hair every day, but I don’t. I do this once a week and it lasts till my next wash.\n\nSharing pictures because this might be my best Dyson day so far.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

Any advice/tips on a low effort routine? Or help to figure out my curl tupe so i have a starting place? Does hair get curlier with age? \nI'm wearing my hair in an almost permanent bun because i have no idea how to style it. 🫠\n\nI bleached the sh*t out of my hair a few years ago and while I was trying to focus on repairing my hair and scalp health my previously thought wavy-ish hair is growing back in a defiant spiral/ringlet pattern, that is refusing to be or stay straight. My baby hairs are like springs sticking out from my head. The slightest moisture in the air and the hair body developes really loose sprial waves and the baby hairs are ringlets again. \n\n**the photo is from a wash day, after wrapping my hair, bowdrying upside down then sectioning. This is the level of curl I am getting when activly trying for straight hair.\n\nI go to gym 3-4 times a week. Currently I wash my hair once a week with the Dr. For Hair Folligen Silk shampoo and Treatment. I use the UNOVE Heating Guard before I blowdry my hair. I will also use hair oil the Mise-en-scene Perfect Serum is the best ive found for my hair in terms of both mousture and reducing frizz.\nThe way I currently dry my hair is wrapping my hair in a cotton hair wrap, after that flip my head upside down dry till 90%, then flip upright section my hair and round brush straight. This is what i was taught growing up. \n\nI sleep with a silk bonnet but I move around a lot so it often slips off. I have found it useful because the hair at my neck is extremely fine compared to the rest and used to break a lot. \nOtherwise my hair is both thick in volume and the strands, to the point where I warn hairdressers, they initially dont believe me and then are making surprised remarks are the shampoo bowl. \n\nI have tried to do a curly routine before the bleach issue but I know I was doing something wrong because after sleep and gym it loses it's shape, it didn't really feel clean and was generally super frizzy. I was trying to do a hair cast thing?¿ There is noticeable shrinkage when I previously tried a curly routine, like below shoulder blade length becoming collarbone length.\n\nTLDR; Please Help! I am clueless about my hair. After decades of styling my hair straight and damging it, my hair refuses to be straight.\nWhere do i start? \nHow do i make a low effort routine?\n\nThank you for any help!!",

I’m the past I never took care of my hair, and ended up dying and bleaching it at home a lot. Because of this, I hadn’t seen my natural hair since I was a young teenager, and even then it wasn’t taken care of well. In the past year I chopped it all off, and have been growing it out and trying to actually take care of it, but have no clue what I’m doing. For context, I feel like my hair may be 2C?\n\nI have dry hair that gets frizzy easily, so a lot of what I use is focused on that. I use Aussie miracle moist shampoo and conditioner every wash day, which is generally every 2-3 days, since more than that makes my hair feel dryer. However, every third shower I replace the conditioner with Shea Moisture hair masque. After showering, I put Not Your Mother’s leave in conditioner, and then Aussie hair oil on the ends when I need to refresh it the next day and tame the frizz. The first picture is before I cut it, and the next few are my hair currently after drying naturally and with no product besides leave in conditioner (Although it’s a bit of a mess since the pictures are after a night out) \n\nAll feedback/advice appreciated!

Any advice would be appreciated, I use botana/castor oil on it at least once a week, sometimes a deep hydration hair mask and I try to keep it braided whenever I can. I usually use the blow dryer but I usually leave it a bit damp so it doesnt burn (idk if that helps).

My last stylist really botched my hair and was kind of inexperienced.\n\nNew stylist came highly recommended, however, when she styled my hair curly for the first time I was kind of in shock. It didn't seem like she had any idea of what to do? She towel-dried my hair kind of rough and then added product and sent me on my way. No attempt to maintain curl clumps or provide definition. I'd spoken with her prior about past experiences and the salon assured me this is their most experienced person and they're comfortable with different textures.\n\nDedicated curly stylists charge upwards of $500 in my area and I haven't had a good experiences with them either! \n\nI've been avoiding haircuts until I find someone I trust. What red flags / green flags do you look for? I definitely check reviews but that's kind of all I've got. \n\nHair is thick wavy curly, low porosity.\nRoutine: \nSection and rake through:\nLeDoux foam on wet hair followed by Camille Rose curl maker.\nPrayer hands.\nDiffuse.",

I just want it lightened but not platinum blonde or anything. Please help with any suggestions or what I should ask for if a partial balayage was not the right option.
