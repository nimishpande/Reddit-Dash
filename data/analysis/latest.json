I have naturally curly hair, usually straightened, but I've learnt how to manage my curls. However, for as much as the blonde hair looks great straightened, it looks terrible when it's natural. I look like a popcorn flower or a poodle. Every time I try to to curl it with my diffuser, it barely curls and it just frizzes.\n\nWhat is some advice you could give me? Any recommendation for any purple/toning shampoos and conditioners that could help? My hairstylist bleached it yellow, but she told me to use toning shampoos, but I don't know which one to buy. Any good deep hydrating masks?\n\n  \n",

If I scratch myself it produces histamine and awful red lines that look scary but don’t hurt.\n\nSunscreen is hot or miss for me. I mostly use Neutrogena 70 spf or a 50 spf Bullfrog with insect repellent. I also wear spf shirts, a fishing hat with ear and neck covers, and shorts. It doesn’t matter how much I reapply, even every 30 minutes and waiting for it to dry, my face burns. I have gotten fluid filled blister burns as well. The fishing hat and sunshirt really help, but my cheeks/nose get pretty burned every time I spend 20+ minutes outside.\n\nNormally aloe vera promotes healing, limits scarring, and cools off sunburns. It does not do that for me. An aloe vera gel burns like fire on a sunburn until it is washed off, and it still hurts a bit afterwards. A straight aloe leaf cut in half and applied to a sunburn tingles, burns a little, and gives me slight hives.\n\nIs there anything that can help with sun damage that isn’t aloe vera? Preferably for sensitive skin?",

As per my estheticians suggestion, I started using Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel + Dermalogica Active Moist. The cleanser feels great on my skin and doesn't dry me up but is too expensive! I also really started flaring up after using it but it might be the moisturizer, it doesn't offer the kind of moisture my skin needs I think.\n\nSo I started using La Roche Posay Toleriane cleanser and moisturizer which my derm recommended but the cleanser is giving my skin a burning sensation which I've heard some people on here talk about. The moisturizer is like meh, worried it's also contributing to that sensation..\n\nI'm at a loss right now and need help and cheap recommendations because I can't keep buying and returning products!\n\n",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

After conditioner has been in hair for a few minutes, I brush out the knots in the shower with conditioner still in.\n\nRinse out conditioner and keep hair pretty wet. Flip hair upside down and Spray hair with leave in and brush again. \n\nPrayer hands in some mousse and then scrunch with hands. Prayer hands in some gel (like a big glob of gel) and then scrunch with microfibre towel to try to get a lot of the water out.\n\nHover diffuse focusing on the roots till they’re pretty dry (which probably takes the longest but it’s worth it because it gives you that root volume) and then move on to pixie diffusing sections for 1-2 mins on med-low heat and  speed. \n\nFlip the hair back up and finish pixie diffusing until hair is like crunchy I move my head and hair side to side here too. \n\nScrunch hair with hair oil and voila! \n\nI also sleep with a pineapple hairdo in a silk bonnet at night and with diffusing I was actually able to have decent curls for 3 days!

      "content": "Hi everyone! Sorry for the long post. These pictures were taken on the third day after wash day. I haven't looked after my hair well by not treating it as curly/ wavy (not sure what the type is yet), but l'd love to start and get my hair looking healthy again. I've tried reading how the curly girl method works and other people's routines, but it's a lot of information and I can't tell what would be good for me anymore. So l had a few questions to ask and am open to any tips you all have for me!\n\n1. I usually have a bunch of split ends. I'm going to get my hair trimmed in a week, but unfortunately a curly hair specialist is out of my budget. Is there anything I should specifically ask the hairdresser for to help accommodate my hair well? I usually get layers and a U-cut which I think has been alright so far. I want to grow my hair out but the split ends keep me from doing so.\n\n2. Along with the split ends, my hair feels extremely dry, especially at the scalp. This leads to too many painful tangles if I leave my hair unbraided. If I detangle my hair, wear a low ponytail and leave the house, my hair gets tangled in less than 10 mins and shrinks to a little ball of fluff. Can you recommend any products like deep conditioners or leave-ins that can prevent this? I know people say to not brush your hair when dry, but it always felt like I needed to with how instantly tangled my hair gets.\n\n3. What l've picked up as the most basic steps to care for curly hair is shampoo &gt; conditioner\n&gt; detangle &gt; leave-in conditioner &gt; a styler &gt; dry. And product selection, moisture or protein ingredients, product application all depend on the hair characteristics? Do you have any recommendations for products I could start with that suit medium porosity and medium thickness hair? I've heard people say that their hair loves protein but I don't know if mine needs that more or moisture or equal quantities anymore 🥲\n\nMy current routine is just:\n1. Detangle with comb before shower\n2. Shampoo: Crème of Nature Argan Oil Moisture and Shine shampoo\n3. Conditioner: Crème of Nature Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment\n4. Air dry\n\nI realised later that the shampoo and conditioner were not CG approved. So I’d love to get some recommendations!\n\nI have tried detangling in the shower a few times but I didn't notice any difference as it gets tangled immediately. Probably because I don't use a leave-in yet maybe?\n\nAdditional notes: 1. I had used the Crème of Nature Argan Oil leave-in conditioner spray on dry hair once and it made my hair extremely stiff. I couldn't comb my fingers through my hair without it hurting. I haven't tried it ever since but l'm guessing it might be a different story if used on wet hair l've iust been scared of trying it. 2. I wash my hair twice a week. \n\nSo if you guys have any advice on how I can start looking after my hair well, make it look not as dry, reduce the tangles, or anything related to how to choose my products, let me know! I'd be really grateful, thanks &lt;3",
