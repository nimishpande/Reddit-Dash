      "content": "Started my natural hair texture journey like a month ago. Every day is a different look—volume/definition/softness/shininess—it all differs! I just wanted to share my like day 3-4 hair maybe! I know the curls are not defined on this specific day of my hair wash schedule by any means, and I have not perfected my refresh routine, but I want to say that I really dig voluminous hair looks. I want to look like a 🦁 haha! \n\nRoutine: Wash with Mielle rosemary shampoo and random generic Pantene conditioner. \n\nIn really wet hair, rake either Mixed Chicks Curl Sculptor thinned out with water and Aussie gel on top and scrunch. Try to comb crown of head backwards/horizontally and apply those products and scrunch for more volume. Avoid middle part as much as you can. Then, for this look in particular I guess: mix just a little bit of the The Doux Texture mousse/foam, The Doux Honey mousse/foam, Herbal Essences mousse, John Frieda mousse, and Dollar Tree Spa Luxury extra hold mousse. I mix them all together and rake from roots to end and then diffuse however I want, especially upside down for more volume. \n\nAnd then I actually ended up putting my hair in a curly bun with a side part. And the next day after when I took it down, I retouched/rewet my hair leave in conditioner from Dollar Tree and put some The Doux texture mousse around face framing and Dollar Tree coconut hair oil and CHI hair oil and hairsprayed with some Aussie hair spray for hold!\n\nMedia: 1) Hair down after refresh 2) Curly bun with side part before hair refresh day (ignore crusty ass makeup hehe)",

Now it looks like the hair of an angel!\n\nI'm still having issues though, since the mousse I use requires me to only put in a small amount of it, (lest my hair get weighed the hell down) I end up not being able to actually form a gel cast on my hair. Despite a good chunk of my routine being hover diffusing on low heat.\nI feel like I'm missing out on some definition by not having a gel cast.\n\n\n\nAnother problem is that Im not actually sure how to use hair oil? The benefits of protection from dryness and less moisture loss are super enticing though.\nI just put a bit on the ends of my hair after putting leave in conditioner to hopefully preserve some definition. \n\nBut some people say you're supposed to scrunch out the cast with oil? I can't exactly do that in my situation.\nAnd others say doing this actually evaporates the oil when it comes in contact with the heat of the diffuser. So I'm kind of at an impasse.\n\n\n\nRoutine: After soaking in the shower, spray a bit of Camille rose leave in conditioner and scrunch the ends with a tiny amount of hair oil (not sure if I should use it before or after) \nthen apply Pattern mousse only on the ends and mids so the hair isn't weighed down.\n\nFollowing this, begin hover diffusing on low heat to hopefully make a cast. As well as gently cupping the roots to make some lift.\nThen afterwards, begin hanging head upside down and swaying to all different sides while cupping on medium heat.\n\nEither dry completely or leave semi dry to air dry the rest.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "Hi! I have been trying to figure out what to do with my sometimes-straight-sometimes-curly hair for years and I feel like I have reached a point where I might go insane soon so here I am desperately asking for some help. \n\nMy hair behaves differently depending on where I am (probably has to do with humidity? dry air = flat and staticky hair). No matter what though, it is always completely flat around the crown of my head. I got deep layers in hopes of getting rid of this issue but surprise: it didn't work. Here is my routine:\n\n1. Wash daily with a sulfate-free shampoo (once a week I do a harsher cleanse with a drugstore shampoo with SLS)\n2. Apply conditioner (right now I'm using the Garnier papaya one but I constantly try different ones)\n3. While my hair is dripping wet I gently rake my fingers into my roots and shake the hair so that it clumps together\n4. Then I flip my hair upside down and scrunch the water out with a microfiber towel\n5. Plop for about 5-10 minutes\n6. Let it air dry\n7. Put it in a pineapple ponytail with a silk scrunchie when I go to bed\n\nI attached pictures of what it looks like in the morning. As you can see I don't use any styling products because my hair is already so thin that it gets weighed down extremely easily. Also since I have to wash my hair daily because of how quickly it gets oily, I would prefer not to have a 10-step routine to follow everyday 😭. But I am open to suggestions! Any tips on what I could improve or change would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I'm able to apply it 5 to 6 nights out of the week without any drying or obvious irritation (I think). The breakouts I can live with, but the little pink spots I get on my face that don't go away bothers me more than anything. I've been on Azelaic Acid for a while now, before I started the adapalene, but I feel like nothing is happening.\n\nI've heard about Vitamin C being useful for this, but how would I use it? Is there something else I should do? I'm pretty desperate for any help. Here's my routine:\n\nAM\n- prequel SA gleanser \n- peach slices Azelaic Acid 10%\n- byoma moisturizing gel cream (has Niacinamide too)\n- CeraVe SPF 50 \n\nPM\n- prequel’s cleansing oil \n- prequels SA gleanser \n- adapalene 0.1%\n- byoma balancing face mist \n- the ordinary’s hyaluronic acid 2% + B5\n- byoma moisturizing gel cream\n\nAdditionally, I have oily, acne-prone skin. I'm only 21 so I started adapalene for help with breakouts and old acne scars. It’s pretty defeating to have my concerns be perpetuated instead of fixed, so far. \n\nThank you so much for reading and any advice or experiences you can offer.",

Would it be reasonable to use that temporarily while I wait for my Epiduo to be delivered, or could that mess things up / cause irritation or a setback? Has anyone been in a similar situation or switched between these before? I’d appreciate any advice or experiences.\n\nThanks!",

This being said, I still have some closed comodones on my forehead plus I do break out on my jaw and cheek area still a good amount especially near my period. Can someone look at my skincare routine and see if there’s any products I need to change or anything I can add to help clear my skin fully?\n\nMorning: I have combo skin so I just use sunscreen (Etude Sunprise Mild Waterly Light SPF)\n\nNight: Every evening I double cleanse my face with micellar water and vani cream cleanser. I also use haru haru wonder black rice toner, Anua 7+ rice ceramide and Heartleaf My type calming cream. 3 times a week I use differin and twice a week I use the Natrium BHA salicylic toner. The other two days are my rest/recovery days.\n\nAny input or advice is appreciated!! Thank you!",

It would clear just to come back.\n\nFinally in December of 2023, my derm put me on spironolactone (50 mg) because topicals (I tried 4 or 5) were not cutting it. \n\nThat really helped!\n\nBut, in June of 2024, my periods started to get very PAINFUL. Lots of pinching feelings. Cramps were an 11 out of 10 and my acne started to ramp up.\n\nMy derm upped my spironolactone to 75mg but my goodness things got even MORE PAINFUL. SO, I went back to 50mg.\n\nThen the acne got SEVERE, no longer mild and able to be treated. \n\nThen! My periods went RAMPANT. \n\nI had my period every weekend. Truly, every week I had a 3 day period for about 4 or 5 months.\n\nSo, I started accutane (hubby has vasectomy and we use condoms, tmi but wanted to add) and a few weeks later my gynecologist prescribed me Slynd to help tame my periods.\n\nAnd then!!! the acne got EVEN WORSE (even on accutane!!!). I was on Slynd for 3 to 4 months.\n\nSo, my PCP said, stop the slynd and get the IUD removed.\n\nSo. Stopped the Slynd in March (and found a new gynecologist) and got the IUD removed in April (2025).\n\nThe accutane FINALLY started to work. \n\nAccept I tried to come off Accutane twice (once in November and once in December), only for the acne to reappear in 6 days. Less than a week. Each time. Acne came back, but not as cystic or big. But the matter is, its back. On my jawline and forehead.\n\nSo, Im on accutane still. After a full year.\n\nAnd Im crushed.\n\nAny thoughts? Advice? Etc?\n\nFurther, I use distilled water and dont eat dairy or high glycemic foods, also to help my skin.\n\nThanks!",

I'm just looking for a place that's trustworthy and does good, natural work.\n\nMy budget is mid-range, I guess? I know you get what you pay for, but I also don't need the most famous celebrity doc.\n\nHas anyone actually gone through with this locally and have experiences to share? Which doctors or clinics in LA would you actually recommend? And maybe more importantly, are there any I should definitely avoid?\n\nWhat was the consultation process like? Did you feel pressured or was it informative?\n\nHow did you decide between FUE and FUT?
