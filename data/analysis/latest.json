I’m trying to achieve even 10% of what she has.\n\nI am currently on day 3 after washing. My current routine for this week was: I shampoo with moisturizing curl talk shampoo, then I do Mielle rosemary mint strengthening hair mask. Then I do 3-in-1 Curl Talk conditioner and don’t fully wash it out and squish in a bit to my ends before exiting the shower.\n\nThen I praying hands Pattern styling custard and drag it through a bit on top.  I then use them bounce curl clips while diffusing on warm setting for heat and low intensity with minimal movement to set the curls. I fluff out the roots after dry with the bounce curl volume comb. I scrunch in Ouai hair oil once dry.\n\nToday I sectioned my hair out while using tresemme keratin smooth weightless anti-frizz finishing spray at the roots and using the bounce curl volume comb diffusing where I sprayed after using the comb on low cold setting to set the spray.\n\nI’m pretty happy with the results, but looking for more tips if anyone has any? \n\nI may just need a hair cut. I just can’t seem the back to achieve the same volume at the back that I get around my face. At the side part it seems flat as well.  Amy other hair spray, how to cut the hair (I just cut my own hair how I feel like, so I’m not scared to try), or technique tips?\n\nI also want to understand how they do her lazy messy updo (see photo)??? I’m totally lost on how that is achieved.\n\n\n",

I know all about the pros and cons but I'm just a bit nervous, **with my features will I look more or less feminine? Do I have the features to pull it off?

I’ve been using 1 mg finasteride for 3 months, and I just started using the (cheap) Kirkland 5% minoxidil solution once a day.\n\nI started on the recommendation of a trichologist, and she did a baseline evaluation with a trichoscope.\n\nAll the vellus hairs you can see in the images are brand new—similar length, very tiny, but pigmented.\n\nThe images cover a 4 mm × 7.5 mm area (about 0.3 cm²). The white patches are residue from the cheap minoxidil/vehicle.\n\nI know these vellus hairs most likely won’t become terminal, but I’m impressed by how quickly minoxidil can push hairs into a growth phase and make them sprout so fast, seemingly all at the same time. It gives me hope it will positively impact my terminal hairs too (I’m currently around \\~30 follicular units per cm² on an NW7 pattern, with a lot of thin single-hair follicular units), so I can eventually go for a transplant.\n\nI’ll keep updating this.\n\nCheers.\n\n",

My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily.\n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Remember that [consistent lighting is extremely important](/r/tressless/comments/fxb0xn).\n\nAge and family history are worth mentioning.\n\n## Just starting out?\n\n1. Read the [beginner's guide](https://tressless.com/learn/beginners-guide)\n2. Read the [\"learn\" section](https://tressless.com/learn) section with different treatments\n3.

I got it cut to around shoulder-length (with shrinkage: a little bit past my chin). \n\n**Important context though** my hair changes a LOT! My hair routine involves wash days, so on Day 1 I have less volume and more definition (as seen in pics 1 &amp; 2) but around Day 3-4 I have a LOT of volume (as seen in pics 3 &amp; 5). I also learned it can turn into an afro the first month after my haircut because it was short enough and cut into a round shape (pic 7)\n\nI'm getting another haircut soon and would love to get a pixie this time (reference pics 8-12), but I'd like to get some advice from my fellow redditers. I know all about the pros and cons but I'm just a bit nervous, **with my features will I look more or less feminine? Do I have the features to pull it off? I won't lie, these things are important to me.** Lmk what you think I included pics with and w/o makeup &lt;3\n",

I told her before I left the chair and she gave me toner to leave with and said it should help. I reached out and she did a root smudge and proceeded to tell me she’s never see this and told me I was overthinking my hair. She tried rebleaching it to get it out. I told her we can tone it way darker to hide it and she didn’t wanna make it less blonde. She told me she’s doing me a free service to help me. I’m noticing after 2 weeks the orange hue is coming back. I’ve NEVER had this happen with highlights. I affirmed her service and I honestly feel like it WAS NOT worth the price at all. ",

Idk, I'm bad at judging these things.  \n2a wavy if that matters at all.  \n  \nIt's obviously in need of a colour touch up (I'm going for the mahogany/wine look again).\n\nOther than that, I'm not sure what to ask for. My original plan was blunt bangs again purely because I like them, but now that I'm looking at these side-by-side I'm thinking sideswept bangs or maybe even no bangs at all would look more flattering on me? Bring the focus up to my eyes instead of my wide nose and mouth?  \nAs for style I was thinking either a textured bob, lob or a wolf cut. I would love a wolf cut but I have no idea if that would look good on me.  \nI'm sure the hairdresser will help me find something that suits me best either way, but I thought I'd try to go in there with at least some idea of what I wanted.",
