I've been over the moon about how good my hair looks now. I did want a haircut, just to clean up the sides. \nBut my hair was absolutely butchered. First pic is right before, second is when I got home from the curly hair salon. It looks awful, and barely curls anymore. She thinned out the top a ton, and my volume is gone. No point to this post other than just sharing my pain. Right back to insecure about my hair.\nRoutine is simple. Just shea moisture conditioner in the shower, then not your mother's curl talk cream then gel immediately after I get out. Then scrunch and let it air dry. Now that's not working anymore because of how she cut my hair",

So I’ve basically been spending the last year trying to reverse the lines without using Botox.\n\nI’ve been using this product for about six months. I think it’s supposed to be like a reusable version of Frownies stickers. I wear it every night and during the day if I’m going to be home for some hours. I use Earth Harbor siren silk deep moisturizer then let it dry before I pop it on for the night. It stays in place throughout the night 99% of the time. Take it off in the morning, wash and air dry, then put it back in the tin it came in. I’ve been using it for 6 months and I’m just now going to replace it as it’s starting to become less sticky.\n\nA lot of the reviews were stating that the effect “smooth effect” is temporary and is gone within the hour. I think maybe they didn’t try long enough or weren’t consistent because I only notice the lines coming back if I go days without use or if I’m super dehydrated.\n\nWho knows how it will continue to work in the long term, but for now I’m super happy and it works for me.",

That's literally another full-size Minimalist product just... sitting there for free if you're smart about where you order.\n\nWhat I was buying:\n1. Minimalist 8% Glycolic Acid Toner (150ml)\n2. Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Serum (30ml)\n3. Minimalist Vitamin B5 Moisturizer (50g)\n\nThe shocking price breakdown:\n\nTIRA - ₹1,186 (THE CLEAR WINNER)\n1. Cheapest price\n2. FREE Minimalist tote bag as GWP\n\nNYKAA - ₹1,441\n1. ₹255 more expensive than Tira 😬\n2. Zero freebies but you'll be paying for lice pink packaging??\n\nMYNTRA - ₹1,321\n1. ₹135 costlier than Tira\n2. No GWP either\n\nBLINKIT - ₹1,428\n₹242 more than Tira BUT delivers in 14 minutes (see screenshot lol)\n\nAJIO - ₹1,546 💀\n1. Most expensive by FAR (₹360 more than Tira!)\n2. Had random GWPs like travel vouchers??? (for skincare???). There was a coupon but it straight up refused to apply\n\n\nThat ₹360 difference is literally the price of another Minimalist product. Do. The. Math. It took me 10 minutes to check all these apps and I basically got a free product out of it. Also I'm attaching all my cart screenshots because I know the skincare community loves RECEIPTS 📸\nIs anyone else this obsessive about price-checking or is it just my broke millennial energy?",

      "content": "Hi y'all! I just recently started looking into how to properly take care of my hair and began trying out a curly hair routine a couple days ago. This is how it looked this morning after showering, putting in products, and diffusing. I know that it takes time for curls to reach their full form, but there's definitely room for improvement and I need some advice from the experts! First, here is my current routine/products I use:\n\n1.\t⁠Kristen Ess Extra Gentle Shampoo and Conditioner\n\n2.\t⁠Detangle with Wet brush, apply Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream\n\n3.\t⁠apply Curlsmith Hydro Style Flexi Jelly, flip head upside down and scrunch\n\n4.\t⁠apply John Frieda Frizz Ease Curl Reviver Mousse to roots and scrunch again\n\n5.\t⁠plop hair in t-shirt for a few minutes\n\n6.\t⁠diffuse until mostly dry, scrunch to break the gel cast, and put the hair near my part in a claw clip for a bit for volume\n\nSo far, I'm happy with the results of this routine, as my curls held their shape throughout the day, though my hair got a little less voluminous as time went on (and there wasn't too too much volume to begin with). The biggest thing I'm concerned about is that my hair looks dry and a little frizzy, especially towards the ends where it's more damaged, which I think is affecting the definition of my curls. I believe hair oil is a possible solution, so if you have any brand recommendations (preferably on the affordable side) or other ideas on how to fix it, let me know! Here's a list of other things I would love some advice on:\n\n\\- My roots and front pieces seem to have a very hard time curling, should I use more product there or a different method when applying product?\n\n\\- What's the best way to refresh curls after sleeping on them? There are a lot of contrasting opinions whether or not you should wet your hair and what products to use, which makes it very confusing!\n\n\\- I believe I have medium-to-high porosity hair. Should I use oil, and if so, when should I use it (before bed, to refresh hair, on wet hair, dry hair, etc.)?\n\nOk-- question tirade is over. Thank you in advance for your time and suggestions :)",

I put a mask from garnier and leave it on for 5 minutes\n\n3. After i wash it i detangle it with a gentle brush, and spray in a leave in conditioner from Schwarzkopf (the purple one)\n\n4.

      "content": "Hi everyone. I’m a 27 year old woman who stopped taking hormonal birth control after \\~10 years of use in May 2025. \n\nI can no longer take hormonal birth control OR SPIRO, as they caused me to develop Hormonally Mediated Vestibulodynia. My total testosterone levels currently are 25 ng/dl and my free testosterone is only 0.4 ng/ml. \n\nThis also means I cannot take Accutane (but if someone thinks it’s worth it to get a copper IUD to go on accutane…I’m all ears). \n\nLike many other experiences posted here, the acne started at 4 months on the dot, first just on my chest and back, and then quickly following on my face. It’s a mix of angry pustules plus nodularcystic acne that never comes to a head and leaves behind dormant lumps for weeks. \n\nThe cyst on my chest, for example, has been there since mid December 2025 and will not respond to any topical treatments. \n\nMy insurance changed and I’m on a high deductible plan with only $500 in my HSA. I’m not sure I can afford a dermatologist. I’ve been to a gynecologist and got a full work up for PCOS which set me back a lot already. Everything came back fine. I’m a healthy weight and eat healthy + exercise. \n\nI’ve tried the following topicals with no response:\n\n\\* Salicylic Acid\n\n\\* Benzoyl Peroxide (5% and 10%)\n\n\\* Clindamycin 1% \n\n\\* Zinc Oxide 40%\n\n\\* Sulfur 10% \n\nKnowing that there is realistically nothing that will stop this is the worst part. I have zero control over it and I just have to suffer through it, probably until menopause, as it seems for many that the acne never really goes away. \n\nI am truly at a loss and in the deepest depression I have experienced in a long time. I do not ever leave my house except to work in my office 5 days a week, which is humiliating as I can barely speak up in meetings anymore as I’ve caught people looking at my acne quite a few times. \n\nIt’s really really difficult to accept the only things that would stop this cause another extreme end of pain that I can’t imagine enduring again. \n\nAny advice on how to lift myself up a bit is welcome, or cope with the hopelessness of this type of acne.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I took a strand of my hair and pulled from both ends, and it stretched a bit before snapping.\n\nMy current routine (I currently stay in Bengaluru, India):\n\nManetain Clarifying Shampoo (every 3 washes aka every 3 weeks)\n\nBare Anatomy Curl Defining Shampoo\n\nFix My Curls Deep Conditioner\n\nFix My Curls Leave In Cream\n\nFix My Curls Flaxseed Gel\n\nI double shampoo, condition and detangle and leave it in for two minutes and then rinse. I then section my hair, rake through emulsified curl cream and curl train with a brush handle, before applying a coin sized amount of gel to each section. I then let it air dry. I currently stay in dorm and cannot afford a diffuser (besides, we have to pay to keep a hair dryer in our rooms).\n\nI tie my hair into a loose low bun at night and sleep in a satin bonnet on a satin pillowcase. If I refresh, I dampen my hair until I can detangle it easily and once again section it and rake through a little emulsified curl cream.\n\nI used to live in the Middle East, where Pantene has a curly hair line (Curlastic). Those products really seemed to agree with my hair, especially the curl cream, which was very lightweight. However, the line is not available in India and my curls haven't been as consistently defined with these new products.\n\nAdvice on how to repair moisture overload (if that is what I'm experiencing) would be extremely helpful. I'm especially stumped on whether I need a protein treatment and if I do, which one to use (available in India).\n\nThanks so much!",

It moisturizes the lips well, gives a subtle pink tint, and stays on for a few hours if left untouched. When used overnight, it leaves my lips feeling soft by morning.\n\nPigmentation:\nI don’t think it’s effective for reducing lip pigmentation. I haven’t noticed even a slight improvement in my lip color. If it were working, there should have been at least a minimal visible difference by now but unfortunately, there hasn’t been any even after consistent use.\n\nBecause of this, I’m considering switching to another lip balm specifically for pigmented lips. I already use the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which offers similar (or better) moisturization and also heals my lips overnight. So it makes more sense for me to continue investing in Laneige and look for a different product to target pigmentation.\n\nIf anyone could suggest some other quicker effective options for lip pigmentation... please feel free to drop it in comments.

I’ve tried almost every OTC product that’s supposed to help with acne and in the past they’ve worked some but not enough to completely get rid of my acne. I also went to the dermatologist in 2023 and tried clindamycin, doxycycline, and Epiduo Forte which worked for a year or so but then the breakouts came back. For the past year my skin has actually been doing pretty well with minimal breakouts and I think it is because of differin. However 2 months ago my skin started breaking out despite not changing anything about my routine and my skin has just gotten worse since. I don’t know what to do or what could cause it. I have been using panoxyl 10% twice a day with differin which I know is harsh but I am scared to stop actives. Could it be my skin barrier? Any advice would be really appreciated. ",

      "content": "I know this is a bit of a silly question as I'm not putting either product on the same place, but I have patches of eczema on different spots on my body (upper lip, neck, one elbow) and I found that when I used tretinoin more regularly than I do now, my eczema on my upper lip and neck would worsen even though i'd take a lot of care to make sure the tretinoin never touched that area (like i'd wash my hands after every step and if I touched the area where i applied tretinoin)\n\nI also saw a derm who prescribed me the tretinoin and was aware of my eczema and said it was fine and advised me to stop using it so regularly, and that's when the facial eczema flare ups stopped. I've heard a lot about not using AHAs and retinoids together, and given my previous experiences using tretinoin I'm mildly worried about having a reaction somewhere, somehow. If anyone who's had similar experiences/knows more about skincare than I do could give some advice that would be a big help!! Thank you all :)",

I don’t mind growing older but if I can look as young as I feel then why not?!?\n\nI have fairly even skin tone. Some wrinkles and puffiness around the eyes.\n\nCan get a little oily around the nose by the late afternoon. Not really prone to pimples except the occasional something in my hairline. Ouch!\n\nI have all this random stuff and I’m not even sure what half of it actually does! Some was given to me and others purchased on a whim.\n\nCould use some help on a routine. Like what order, time of day (morning or evening) and if there’s anything I’m missing. Trader Joe’s had a lot of interesting looking stuff yesterday so I grabbed a couple.\n\nIs case you’re reading on your phone here’s a list.\n\nNeutrogena Night Pressed Serum\n\nThe Ordinary :\n\nNatural Moisturizing\n\nFactors + PhytoCeramides (lotion)\n\nMulti-Peptide + HA Serum\n\nMulti-Peptide Eye Serum\n\nGF 15% (what is this?!)\n\nBalancing &amp; Clarifying Serum\n\nTrader Joe’s :\n\nRetinol Night Serum\n\nNight Cream\n\nDaily facial sunscreen\n\nThanks in advance for any advice here.",

My hair is still frizzy after so I go over with straighteners/curling iron.

Is my hair actually wavy/curly (sorry if saying curly isn’t appropriate!!)\n\nPics attached of my hair when I left it to air dry. It just has smoothing serum in it I put on while wet and then I brushed through after with tangle teaser and this is how it looks. No scrunching or anything involved. Last pic is how it looks when wet after I take the towel off my head. Some places I think aw yeah I can see potential waves but others are straight so I’m stumped. \n\nI have recently become a mum for the first time and man it would be lovely to not have to do the longggg hair routine I currently do. It’s also a pain in the ASS on holiday. \n\nOr am I just a frizzy bish.",

      "content": "I’ve been seeing a lot of people talk about that tight feeling after washing or halfway through the day, so I wanted to share a quick breakdown that helped me understand what was really going on.\n\nCommon reasons your skin feels tight:\n\n1. Dry air\n\nCold weather, AC, or heaters pull moisture out of your skin. This usually shows up as flaky patches, rough texture, and that stretched feeling by midday.\n\n2. Over-cleansing\n\nWashing too often or using strong cleansers can strip your natural oils. Signs are redness, tightness right after rinsing, and skin that feels squeaky clean (which is actually not a good thing).\n\n3. Barrier fatigue\n\nToo many actives, exfoliating too much, or switching products a lot can weaken your skin barrier. This can lead to sensitivity, tiny dry lines, and uneven texture.\n\nWhat helped me personally is I started focusing less on fixing everything and more on just keeping my barrier calm. Gentler cleansing, fewer actives, and layering hydration before sealing it in made a bigger difference than any single product.\n\nHow do you guys deal with tight or uncomfortable skin?",
