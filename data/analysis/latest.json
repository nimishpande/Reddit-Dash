      "content": "So, this might seem seem stupid to some but since it seems to work for me I am willing to bite the bullet and share with you.\n\nBackground:\nI first noticed thinning around my temples about 8 years ago. I immediately got on dutasteride and minoxidil. The side effects from dutasteride started to kick in around week 2 and they forced me to quit. Took a good few months to get my libido back and clear the brainfog. I stuck to topical minoxidil for a few years but it did not yield enough results and unfortunately causes some side effects too (nocturia, sleep apnea type sleep disturbances, issues with blood pressure, heart skipping a beat etc.)\n\nThis summer my temples became pretty much bare. I thought I would give treatment one more chance so I could hold out until something that works and won’t nuke my balls or libido.\n\nTwo months ago I decided to be wild and buy the spiciest red chilis I could buy and began rubbing them on my scalp. I cut the peppers in half lengthwise and rub them until I have a nice red coating on my scalp. At first it felt like it was scaulding me but now, I would call it an intense warmth that I can ignore. It does lead to redness that persists about an hour after washing off.\n\nI keep the liquid on my head for anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer. About halfway through I rub some coconut oil on my temples and massage, this helps exfoliate and I guess drive some more capsaicin into my scalp. Afterwards I wash it off using Alpecin shampoo and am extra careful to make sure it does not run into my eyes.\n\nEvery 2-3 days I apply a very small amount of minoxidil foam as to avoid side effects. \n\nEvery 2 weeks I use a 0,25 mm dermapen and on that day I skip everything besides shampoo.\n\nAfter every wash I use a lightweight beard and hair oil to keep my scalp moisturised.\n\nThe difference has become noticeable in person and somewhat in my close ups. My temples seem to be somewhat closing in now. Try to use the red points as a point of reference. First image has hair length at 2mm, second closer to 3mm. The first was taken a month ago, the second today.  Unfortunately I forgot to take one when starting out. Ill try to keep documenting further down the road with more standardized documentation.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I leave the conditioner on for a few minutes. I also detangle with my fingers in the shower.\n\nI just started using the Odele clarifying shampoo which I will use once a week. \n\nRinse out shampoo and conditioner \n\nThen I towel try my hair and with a paddle brush, brush my hair \n\nI use the Miss Jessie’s “Leave In Condish” product. This product is actually a 2 in 1 because not only does it soften your hair it does shape your curls.\n\nAfter that I put on curling gel, I specifically use Marc Anthony Strictly Curls gel. \n\nThen I diffuse. First I use the highest heat possible then when my hair is half dry I go to medium heat. This is to prevent my hair from getting too dry from being exposed from the highest heat for too long.\n\nThen to break up the case made from the gel I use Ciliganic Moringa oil. On the bottle it says\nIt’s for face and body, but it can absolutely be used for hair. \n\n\n\n",

My washing routine every 3-4 days consist of the following: (please keep in mind every single product I use is from the regular Cantù line of products, specifically the shea butter line)\n\n1- Cleansing shampoo.\n\n2- About half my hand worth of conditioner about brow level and all the way down to my ends. I scrunch and also run my fingers through my hair. \n\n3- I let the conditioner sit on my hair for about 5 mins then I use a wide tooth comb to untangle it and once I have gone through it all, I rinse.\n\n4- I use about the same amount of leave-in conditioner and mix about half a finger’s worth of styling gel and once again go from about brow level all the way to the ends, scrunch and then run my fingers through my hair.\n\n5- I allow my hair to air dry, I have never used a diffuser.\n\nMy refresh routine consist of using a spray bottle, once my hair is almost dripping wet, I scrunch and let it air dry. \n\nTo protect my hair at night, I use a satin bonnet, I’ve tried doing a pineapple knot and putting it inside the bonnet but next morning, I look like Sideshow Bob so I’ve settled into simply putting my hair inside the bonnet. This causes some curls to flatten and hairs to become loose.\n\nMy main question is essentially related to this last part, is there any way to help prevent this? I’ve considered using hair gel in between washes but I don’t want to damage my hair by being ignorant and using way too much product on it (assuming that’s even a concern, I honestly don’t know) just because the loose hairs stress me out.\n\nHere are some pictures for reference of my hair.

I don’t know why, but my skin reacted amazingly to it my active pimples completely cleared up within ~15 days, and no new breakouts came during that time. I wasn’t using any actives or serums alongside it.\nAfter coming back home and switching to my regular cleanser, my acne has started coming back 😞\nUnfortunately, the product doesn’t seem to be available anywhere in India.\nI’ve attached a photo / will attach ingredient details if needed.\nI’d really appreciate help finding it.\nOr recommendations for similar gentle, non-stripping cleansers that worked for acne-prone / sensitive skin\nThank you so much in advance 🤍\n",

The replies to that post were very helpful and I wanted some help on choosing some alternate products or sticking to this routine.\n\n- Moisturizer: should I stick with the ponds or switch to minimalist b12 since I'm using niacinamide and need to protect my skin barrier?\n\n- Sunscreen: this is where I am facing the biggest confusion (so are others when I searched this sub lol), I initially decided to go with the regular minimalist spf 50 but then I found out it has retinol in it (seperate thread on that later, because that makes no sense) which is a big no no with the other actives I'm using so decided to switch to the light fluid one instead. I've also heard korean ones are good as well as reequil ultra dry matte but there's so many choices and not enough budget to go around so please help me choose one :\")\n\nI hope y'all can provide a overall verdict on my routine, I'm scared and excited to be starting this journey for the first time after decades of tanning and negligence of my skin \n\nSee you on the other side 🤎",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

No reaction, no breakouts.\n\nBUT I didn’t love the finish (a bit too shiny/gelly for my liking), so I thought I’d try others.\n\n\t•\tDot &amp; Key SPF &amp; Aqualogica SPF – BIG mistake. Both gave me dermatitis. Burning, irritation, texture — the whole nightmare. This really shook my confidence in cosmetic brands.\n\n\t•\tWent to a dermatologist:\n\n\t•\tSuggested Venusia sunscreen → made me extremely oily, felt heavy and uncomfortable and also i felt it didn’t work much i felt my tan increased with the use\n\n\t•\tThen suggested Acne UV.\n\n\t•\tAcne UV (50g) – LOVED it. Blended well, no irritation, skin was happy.\n\nSo I confidently bought the 100g version and… it was HORRIBLE.\n\nThick, doesn’t blend, terrible white cast, stays patchy on the skin. I don’t know if it’s a batch issue or formulation difference, but it was unusable.\n\n\t•\tUV Doux – Tried this too and it felt good on my skin. No immediate reaction.\n\n•\tBoj OG Sunscreen — Too heavy, felt like a moisturizing blanket for dry skin — not for me.\n\nNow I’m thinking: Korean sunscreens?\n\nI’ve seen people rave about them, but they’re costly, and I’m nervous because:\n\nI apply sunscreen properly (2–3 fingers) every day, so cost matters — but if something is truly worth it, I’m open to trying.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n\n\t•\tSafe for very sensitive skin\n\n\t•\tNo dermatitis / irritation\n\n\t•\tPrefer matte or comfortable, slight dew is okay\n\n\t•\tWorth the price for daily use\n\nIf you’ve had similar skin issues and found something that works (especially Korean or pharmacy sunscreens), please share 🙏\n\nI just want sun protection without my skin panicking .",

My hair is quite fine strands-wise, but I have a LOT of it. For a while I was having to have it thinned out a bit. When my hair is wet/damp it’s typically quite wavy, with some curls. I’ll occasionally have one perfect little curl on its own. As it air dries without product that definitely falls out. Sometimes with product like a curl cream and/or gel I can kind of get a little wave to stay (image attached in black t-shirt with blonde hair), but otherwise air dried my hair gets quite flat. If I blow dry it, it’s pretty well pin straight (image attached with brown hair). \n\nBasically what I’m trying to figure out is:\n1. If a perm would potentially work well on my hair type. \n2. What type of upkeep/maintenance it requires.\n3. What type of routine i’d have to follow to really make the curls set nice (I’ve seen videos of girls doing the whole curl cream/gel/plop method).\n4. Also just hoping it would look good to be honest 😅 my hair is only about the length of the photo with the brown hair but I am progressively growing it out. \n\nPlease be kind 🙏🏼 just trying to do my due diligence and research and be responsible with my hair before jumping into any quick decisions!

      "content": "This is mostly a post for anyone looking up \"does nicotine cause hairloss\" or looking for reasons it might be happening to them because BEEN THERE and I know how much sometime all you want is a single person who can confirm your thinking.\n\nThis experience is definitely anecdotal, though I have seen some scientific support to the correlation between nicotine and hairloss. I also know people who have smoked a pack a day for decades and have full heads of hair, so it won't be true for everyone.\n\nI vaped for 4 years, coinciding with the start of my hair loss. I did NOT make the connection (and basically refused to haha). I tried EVERYTHING from oils to minoxidil, and blamed everything from COVID to weightloss (5 lbs weightloss mind you) and only when I had exhausted all options did I decide to quit vaping. I had gone to my doctor even, who basically shrugged once all my labs came back mostly normal (I have anemia but thats always been true).\n\nWhen I quit, it took a bit of time to notice but my hair eventually went back to normal. Woo! Did I make the connection? Nope, I assumed it was other things (I moved, I used certain supplements, etc.) \n\nI then started nicotine again (this time just Nicorette gum, not inhaling anything). Guess what? Hair loss!!! I then STOPPED the gum (I do 0mg nicotine vape now, not seeing any issues so I truly think it's just the nicotine) because I came to my senses and finally admited that there was a connection, and now have hair sprouting everywhere. \n\nI know this won't be true for everyone, but if you consume nicotine in any form and have tried EVERYTHING maybe try quitting nicotine.

I only realised the connection after the course ended, when I finally began to feel like myself again. At the time, I was assured by the dermat that the acne would not return.\n\nHowever, it has come back, and this time, it feels worse. It seems hormonal, especially since I also have PCOS. I recently sprained my ankle as well, so my regular exercise routine has been disrupted, which may have contributed to the flare-up.\n\nRight now, I’m using the Effaclar serum from La Roche-Posay at night, along with a few topical creams prescribed by my dermatologist. She is now suggesting a chemical peel as the next step.\n\nTo be honest, I’m feeling quite exhausted and overwhelmed by the process. I double cleanse at night, religiously follow AM-PM skin care regimes - will this never go away?\n\nWhat has worked best for you if you have faced similar issues?\n\nTL;DR: Acne has returned after isotretinoin (which caused severe depression), likely hormonal due to PCOS. Current topicals aren’t helping much, dermatologist suggests a chemical peel. Feeling exhausted and unsure how to proceed.\n\nPS. Clicked this picture on one of the better days unfortunately ",
