      "title": "Had curly hair all my life but now it’s straight?",
      "content": "So like the title says for some reason my hair has gone from a frizzy Hermione Granger mess to basically straight. Even when I use heat to curl my hair the curls fall out after a few hours and by the end of the day it’s basically straight with the absolute loosest of waves.\n\nUp until a few years ago I never did anything with my curls to enhance them simply because I didn’t know how and didn’t want to make my hair crunchy like when my mom would put product in my hair when I was little (I have what many hair stylists have called “baby fine” hair and I honestly love the softness that comes with such fine hair, so I don’t like the crunchy/texture/feeling that a lot of hair products give)\n\nFor a couple years I tried many products and tried the whole curly girl routine to try an enhance my natural curls but I could just never get a curl pattern that I actually liked. So I gave up maybe about a year ago now and figured that maybe the next time I have money to actually get my hair done by a stylist that I would go to a curly hair specialist that could actually teach me what I can do with my specific hair/curls that I have obviously not been able to understand yet.\n\nAfter giving up on the curly hair routine because it just felt like a lot of work for hair I didn’t even like I just started focusing on hydrating/healing/protecting my hair. After a few months I started noticing a difference in my hair feeling healthier and smoother, and then a few months ago I noticed that my hair is just basically straight now. I can still get it to curl when it’s still wet directly after washing it and scrunching so it will have same wave once it dries but the curls will always fall out later that day.\n\nAs for damage/protecting my hair, as evident by the pictures of my hair I obviously dye my hair which involves bleaching my roots every 3-4 months. Since my hair grows very slow and my hair holds onto the semi-permanent red/oraunge dye very well so I don’t need to touch up my hair very often, I also rarely use any heat on my hair, and I sleep with a bonnet+silky pillow case every night.\n\nI wash my hair every 1-2 weeks with Heritages shampoo and conditioner from Walmart and then I sometimes use OGX coconut milk serum if my hair is feeling a little extra dry and frizzy, I’ll apply it directly after washing my hair and while my hair is still damp and I’ll focus primarily of the ends of my hair. But that’s the only products I ever use on my hair besides a heat protectant when needed (and of course whatever I use to color my hair)\n\nIs it normal for hair to go straight after 39 years of curly hair? I’ve had no other life changes or new medical issues. Was my hair just never truly curly and just dried out? Was my hair maybe over hydrated? The only other thing I can think of is that this is the longest my hair as ever been and maybe because my hair is so incredibly fine it just can’t support the weight?\n\nAs an additional note, I lived in Utah in a dry climate for most of my life, but  now I live in Texas with a humid climate. I’ve lived in Texas for several years now so I don’t think it’s because of the climate.\n\nIf anyone has any insight to what’s going on I would also it ❤️",

      "content": "I fell in love with the Bounce Curl Brush when I purchased it for the almost perfect ringlets it gave me. But over the maybe 3yrs I've been using it, my hair has not grown an inch.\n\nI don't like the hair typing system, but just for reference:\nI have around 3c-4a hair.\nMedium density\nMedium porosity\nMedium strand thickness, although I've found some thicker strands &amp; some thin strands of hair in my head.\nMy hair is all Virgin, no dye or bleach. (Pictures I post with hair color is hair wax, which is an product overlay, not a dye)\n\nWhen I use the brush, I make sure my hair is FULLY DETANGLED with a wide tooth comb &amp; Tangle Teaser before styling with it. I'm positive it's not user error that there's lots of hair stuck on the brush &amp; that my ends are splitting. I find myself having to trim more often than most because my hair starts feeling rough.\n\nI only straighten my hair approximately 1-2xs a year in the Winter because I live in the South. I straightened my hair for my birthday in January &amp; decided since it was straightened, it would be easier to see any damage. I used the search &amp; destroy method to go through as many sections of hair as possible &amp; snip off damage. The amount of single strand knots, split ends, breakage &amp; even keyhole splits I had in my hair was insane.\n\nKeyhole splits in particular, I read, are mostly caused by mechanical damage, i.e. brush styling, high tension, pulling &amp; playing in your hair too much, etc. I'm almost certain most of this damage &amp; the breakage is coming from the Bounce Curl Brush &amp; I'm going to stop using it to see if this is the cause of the breakage. \n\nRoutine &amp; Products:\n\n1) Pre-wash detangle using a wide tooth comb on damp hair &amp; a light leave-in conditioner to provide slip.\n2) Shampoo with Tresemmé Rich Moisture. Clarify 1x a month or as needed with Paul Mitchell's Shampoo 2.\n3) Condition with the Tresemmé Rich Moisture &amp; on Clarify Shampoo days, I use Ouidad's Coil Infusion Triple Threat Deep Conditioner. \n3) On wet hair, I apply Camille Rose's Curl Love Moisture Milk as a leave-in in sections using my fingers.\n3) I section my hair and apply Camille Rose's Spiked Honey Mousse with my fingers. Then I take smaller sections that I want to style, make sure it's fully detangled with a pass through with a Tangle Teaser, then do one pass with the Bounce Curl Brush, using the tension &amp; tilt the brush into the divots as it's supposed to be used.\n4) I scrunch in a little bit of the Ouidad Curl Quencher Gel on styled sections (I didn't care for this too much but I'm trying to get rid of it lol).\n5) Hover-Diffuse blow dry my hair for about 20-30mins. Let the rest air dry.\n6) Scrunch out the crunch &amp; separate curl clumps with Mise En Scene Perfect Serum.\n\nFor bed, I pineapple with a scarf &amp; put on a bonnet.\nIn the mornings, I let my hair get some steam in the shower, take off the bonnet, shake, use a little serum, finger coil a few wonky strands if needed. I wash 1x a week.\n\nTL;DR: I feel like the Bounce Curl Brush's high tension styling causes breakage &amp; other forms of mechanical damage.\n\nWanted to know if anyone else felt the same way!",

Some things helped a little, but nothing really worked for long.\n\nFor a long time, I didn't think about how food affected my skin. It sounds silly now, but I just never connected the two.\n\nThen I started reading about how some foods can make your skin worse or better. The food I ate every day was either helping my skin or hurting it, and I had no clue.\n\nAt first I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to do a crazy diet, so I just made small changes:\n\n\\- ate more healthy food with fiber\n\n\\- less processes or sugary food\n\n\\- drank a lot more water\n\n\\- stopped snacking throughout the day\n\nThe big improvement came when I started checking all my meals for acne triggers before eating (I use nutriskin but there are many other acne food scanner apps too). It helped me see things I never would have noticed, especially with sauces and snacks I thought were okay.\n\nAfter a few weeks of paying attention to diet, my skin got so much better. It was less inflamed, and I stopped getting those painful breakouts. I finally feel pretty again after years of struggling with my skin 😭🥰",

Since these are all properly tested this is more about texture finish and whether I’d actually want to use them daily. This is just my personal pref sharing here for girlies looking for some advice and honestly some feedback from the more seasoned players so here goes\n\ndot &amp; key vitamin c sunscreen\n\nThis is easily one of my top picks. Lightweight, spreads nicely, no white cast, and gives that fresh finish which already puts it above a lot of sunscreens. This is def my daily go to hg. \n\nderma co 1% hyaluronic sunscreen\n\nA really great option! v lightweight and hydrating especially if your skin tends to feel tight with sunscreens. Personally, I find it a bit too slippery on hot days. Not bad at all just not my fav\n\naqualogica glow+ dewy sunscreen\n\nThis is cute if you love a dewy look. Def my go to if i’m indoors but too precious to use daily. \n\nfixderma shadow\n\nv lightweight and disappears quickly which I like. But after using it for a couple of weeks it dried my skin. I always used a moisturizer before so it felt a bit weird but maybe its just me 😕\n\nlakme sun expert tinted \n\nI know a lot of people love tinted sunscreens, but I’m picky with them. The tint is fine I just dontt always want that extra layer on my skin. Not my cup of tea WNRP\n\n\nBioderma Photoderm Creme\n\nTHICC AF. I’d save this for extreme sun exposure (if I ever visit the beach ;_;). Feels a bit too much for everyday use\n\nAGAIN THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL PREF. Please don’t attack me in the comments i’ll cry. Would love to hear your thoughts and which one you use on a daily basis",

My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I have low porosity, thick hair, coarse hair. \n\nSo my hair has looked pretty dead for a while. I got a curly haircut 2 years ago. It looked amazing for a rlly long time but since I haven’t cut my ends, I have broken/split/damaged/dead strands throughout my hair, not just ends. I was gonna get a haircut from that place again but they’ve upped their prices since then and my partner thought I should invest in products instead. \n\nFor the last year the only products I used were the kinky curly cleansing shampoo, shea moisture curl and shine conditioner and curl enhancing smoothie, and a wide tooth comb. I’d only ever air dry my hair. It’s not like my hair look terrible but it looked damaged. \n\nSo I got a detangling brush, a bootleg bounce curl brush, hair dryer with a diffuser, and the fenty curl cream to replace the shea (all cheaper than the haircut somehow). The difference between the creams is massive. \n\nMy routine for this wash was, adding an egg, some olive oil and honey to the shea moisture conditioner and brushing that in and leaving it in with a plastic bag for 30 minutes. Then I used my usual shampoo and conditioner after, and then sparingly used the fenty curl cream, brushing it through sections. I diffused with no heat (10-15 seconds of heat for the rlly wet sections). My hair has never looked so defined, especially for this many days. I also slept with my hair pushed over my head (no hair tie or bonnet). I smell like a grandma which I honestly love but I don’t wanna make a concoction every time I wash my hair, and I can tell the conditioner without the stuff i add makes my hair feel worse. \n\nWhat products (deep or regular conditioner) would you recommend as a replacement? NEEDS to be available in Canada and not overpriced. My options are Amazon or Sephora. I’m considering Pattern/Fenty/Curlsmith (whichever is cheaper honestly) but idk which exact product will be right for me. I’d appreciate advice from people with similar hair!! I’d also like to know if I’m missing anything in my routine? (the cream acts as a slight gel as well, so maybe mousse or oil but it doesn’t feel as urgent)",

I wear makeup everyday (besides these last few days) so I have to wash my face, but maybe morning AND night is too much? \n\nAM routine:\n\nGood Molecules Azealic Acid cleanser\n\nGood Molecules Brightening Toner\n\nGood Molecules Hydrating moisturizer with enzymes\n\nImage Matte Sunscreen \n\nMakeup\n\nPM routine:\n\nRemove makeup with Thayer's witch hazel rose petal\n\nGood Molecules Hydrating Facial Cleansing gel followed by the Azealic cleanser\n\nGM Brightening toner \n\nGM Yuzu eye gel\n\nGM hydrating enzyme moisturizer \n\nYes I love good molecules lol. It's been the only skincare line that hasn't made me breakout, dry out, or sit on top of my skin or feel sticky all day. It's helped my oil production slow down a bit as well.\n\nBack story: My t-zone hasn't always been oily. I actually used to have normal to slightly dry skin with minor hormonal acne. My skin only changed after a prescription gel my dermatologist gave me that wrecked my barrier. Ever since I've had skin issues: oily, adult acne on areas I've never had it before, reactive...\n\nSooo what do I do? Not wash my face in the morning? I only do it so I'm not applying more product on top of last nights product. Maybe I'm doing too much? I'll take any advice but I can't stop wearing makeup as I've got hyperpigmentation I hate, some slight dark circles, and powder helps me not look shiny.  ",

I worry people perceive me as dirty, even though I clean my face twice a day.\n\nMedical stuff: I do get hormonal acne, I have been on Accutane, I’ve tried spironolactone, and I can’t be on estrogen (immediately causes blood clotting for me). My dermatologist of 10 years has effectively given up on me. I don’t have any other skin condition as far as we can tell.\n\nI have combination skin, sensitive. I have huge pores that clog up over and over again. I get really sweaty in the summer and really dry in the winter.\n\nHere’s my current routine - no difference in AM/PM so maybe that’s part of my problem(?):\n\n\\- Wash with Peach Slices Acne Clarifying Cleanser - most salicylic acid stuff has been meh, but this might be the best one I’ve tried. Not sure if too drying?\n\n\\- Sometimes I double cleanse with Bioderma Sensitive first but idk if that’s too much \n\n\\- Good Molecules Hyaluronic Acid Serum - I spritz my skin with Avene Eau Thermale first because I heard you should have your skin wet for this to work effectively?\n\n\\- fwiw most exfoliating acids dry me out too much\n\n\\- Sometimes I also use Good Molecules Niacinamide but sometimes it burns \n\n\\- Sometimes I spray on some Magic Molecule Hypochlorous Acid - works well on my body, dk how well it’s doing on my face\n\n\\- In the summer I’ll moisturize with La Roche Posay Double Repair Matte, but since it’s winter I’ve been trying Byoma Moisturizing Rich Cream - however, I think Shea butter may be clogging me so I’ve switched off and been trying Peach Slices Oil Free Moisturizer (salicylic acid) but maybe too drying?\n\n\\- Twice a week I use Differin Adapalene Gel, other days I spot treat with 2.5% benzoyl peroxide\n\n\\- I put on Naturium lip mask at night but am meh about it - most lip stuff causes me to break out around my lips but I need something for these chapped bois\n\n\\- I wear a silk bonnet at night because I add jojoba oil to my hair; I clean my pillow case once a week\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Always feels like I’m either too dry (and that causes closed comedomes and cysts) or too oily (and that causes black heads)",

      "content": "Hello! I have been looking for a new daily moisturizer to use. I am currently using the Peach Slices Snail Mucin Deep Moisture Cream (I believe that's the full title), and while it feels great at first, shortly after applying, my skin feels tight again. I have an oily t-zone, although the creases around my nose are always dry no matter what. I want something to use all year round, because I value keeping a concise routine without introducing any new products to my skin too frequently. This is because I am currently taking spirinolactone to manage cystic acne I've had in the past, and while my skin is clear now, my skin is very sensitive. My current routine includes:\n\nAM: Vanicream facial cleanser, benzoyl peroxide (although I don't have any active breakouts right now, so I may stop using it as I don't want to damage my skin barrier and use a product if I don't have to), peach slices moisturizer mentioned above, and Blue Lizard Baby Sunscreen as its the only one to not make my skin burn\n\nPM: Vanicream, adapelene gel, peach slices moisturizer \n\nI want a moisturizer that is good for sensitive skin, not too expensive (not willing to spend over $25ish, especially for a small bottle), lightweight (many moisturizers make me look greasy, Peach Slices doesn't so far), and keeps the crease by my nose moisturized. For whatever reason, I am ALWAYS dry there lol, it ends up itching and getting irritated but nothing helps.\n\nFor reference, I have used CeraVe and Cetaphil moisturizers in the past, and I did not fall in love with them.\n\nThank you for reading and please suggest any moisturizers if you know of any! I am also thinking of incorporating Vitamin C into my morning routine to replace benzoyl peroxide, so please take that into consideration as well. Thank you!",

      "content": "I have what I think is somewhere between Type 2a and b hair (or S-shape, relatively fine, normal density, medium-high porosity hair with loose waves to be more detailed) that I've been trying to tame for some time now. My hair is probably somewhat damaged as permanent hair dye was put in it about 3 months ago, but the colour isn't very noticeable now.\n\nPicture by picture: \n1: Hair washed and air dried with Aveeno clarifying shampoo and Aveeno damage repair conditioner \n2: Hair washed with the above Cantu shampoo and conditioner, followed by Umberto Giannini leave in cream and curl scrunch jelly, and diffuse dried\n3: Typical \"Next day hair\" \n4: The products I regular use\n\nGenerally, photo 2 has been my \"main routine\" for about two weeks now, and I plan to use the clarifying shampoo every two weeks, and I also try to use a Garnier Hair Food Coconut hair mask once a week for deep conditioning.\n\nI typically shampoo my hair twice, with a scalp massager, and shampoo and condition with my hair too the back of my head as I've found this avoids my fringe getting too weighed down. I do scrunch while conditioning but find my hair gets very flat while washing so it doesn't scrunch that well. \n\nFollowing a shower I will then squeeze excess water from my hair, comb out my fringe, apply either the leave in cream or Boots curl cream, and the curl scrunching jelly. Sometimes if it's really wet I will plop/microplop with a microfibre towel but my preference is to go straight to diffusing.\n\nWhen I'm going to bed I put my hair in a loose ponytail with a scrunchie and wear a satin bonnet.\n\nInvariably I have found that my hair looks like that of photo 3 the next day regardless, I have started dampening it and applying the Cantu comeback curls next day revitaliser spray, with a little bit of curl cream, which I find helps for a short while but it frizzes up within a few hours of being outside. Find my hair generally absorbs products pretty quickly in this way. \n\nI have been tempted to cut my hair as I eventually want to get it to shoulder length but if I can do something to correct my routine and tame it while it grows that might work for me better.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated! I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with any of the products I've been using, but maybe there are other techniques I should be trying.",
