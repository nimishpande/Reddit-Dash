      "content": "1 - Stick to a routine. Doing CTM daily will give you better results than buying a 3,000 rs serum you use once a week.\n\n2 - If a product suits you, don’t switch just because some influencer said so. I’ve stuck to Clinique moisturiser for 5+ years and it still works.\n\n3 - What you eat shows up on your face. Avoid sugars and oils as much as you can.\n\n4 - CTM (Cleanse, tone, moisturise) is the best advice for most people. You don’t need 10 steps unless you're a professional whose career or work depends on having perfect skin. \n\n5 - Don’t fall for hype. everyone went crazy about that Dot &amp; Key Vitamin C serum and then forgot about it in 2 months? So stick to what has been working for others for years and not stuff that is trending.\n\n6 - Use sunscreen daily. SPF 30+ at least. The minimalist or Re’equil sunscreens are best.\n\n7 - Scrubs are not essential. and you should definitely not use them twice a week. Once every 8–10 days is enough unless you have blackhead-prone skin.\n\n8 - Buy for your skin type, depending on whether it is oily, dry, or a combo. Just because someone on Reddit said snail mucin is great doesn’t mean it’ll suit you.\n\n9 - Go for small sizes. Most people don’t even finish their products before they expire or oxidise which will do more harm than good (those damn vitamin C serums).\n\n10 - IMPORTANT: Don’t store skincare in the same bathroom as your regular shower. heat + steam is really bad for the shelf life of those products, if you must, keep them in a locked cabinet.\n\n11 - Mild cleanser &gt; harsh actives, unless you’re using something prescribed like AHA/BHA. Cetaphil and Simple are safe bets.\n\n12 - Drinking water is good, but it won’t clear your acne. That happens only with skincare + diet + hormones.\n\n13 - Don’t layer 6 products, the actives can clash. Stick to 3–4 max. Example: cleanser, serum, moisturiser, sunscreen.\n\n14 - New products take 3–6 weeks to show results.\n\n15 - Never sleep with makeup, not even tinted sunscreen. Just double clense and go to bed.\n\n16 - KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF YOUR FACE. Girl, you have no idea how dirt your phone is.\n\n17 - Sleep matters. Netflix binges will def show up on your skin.\n\n18 - DIY masks with lemon, toothpaste, or haldi ARE A BIG NO. Ayurvedic stuff is good but only in moderation, most natural chemicals are really bad for your skin because of how little you've been exposed to them.\n\n19 - Don’t blindly follow someone else’s routine. Make your own after experimentation and consultation from dermats.\n\n20 - Good skin isn’t flawless. it’s healthy, hydrated, and consistent. Stop chasing “glass skin” filters. That's marketing and especially for Indians, VERY HARD to achieve. Koreans can get that effect because of genetics and diet much more easily. Keep your peace girls, no need to obsess over something that's not right for you in the first place. \n\nHope this helped!!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "I went into a grocery store I don't usually go to, so of course the conditioner selection they had is different than what I usually find. They had Not Your Mother's Kids curl conditioner for about $5, when the other conditioner options where all at least $10 (including the regular not your mothers). I grabbed it since it was cheap. I've used NYM in the past and while it's not my favorite it is usually a good option for me when I can't find my usual options (Pattern, Sun Bum, or Cantu). I've used it once and it seems to work fine for me, so I'm wondering if there's any reason not to regularly use a kid's conditioner as an adult, or if it's just some marketing gimmick. It's half the price so I figure if it works just as well, why not use that instead?\n\nI'm not sure how relevant my routine is for this post, but for reference here's what I usually do:\n\n* shampoo once a week or so with a homemade shampoo bar\n* conditioner every time I shower (products mentioned above)\n* wring out and tshirt plop to dry slightly\n* scrunch in curl cream or mousse (Pattern is my go-to. Lately I've been using mixed chicks but I don't like it)\n* About once a week I'll use sea salt spray (Sun Bum)\n* use a hair drier with a diffuser until just damp, air dry the rest of the way.\n* My hair is shoulder length, 3C",

      "content": "1. I use Amika Hydro Rush Intense shampoo and conditioner, but travel a lot, so I can't take my big bottles, so honestly, I use many different brands. Although any brand I use has to be something that is actually quality.\n2. I use Redken Leave-In Deep Conditioner on my ends. I use many brands of mousse, sometimes Redken gel if I'm using my Denman brush. Sometimes I use oil on my ends, but I don't know the brand.\n3. I try to put products in, then put on a hair wrap for 15-30 min, then I'll usually let it air dry, because I don't have time to diffuse.\n4. I try to wear a bonnet to bed, but often forget. No satin or silk pillowcases because I don't like the way they feel.\n\nAlso, I don't have many good pictures of my hair, I'm sorry. But you can also see that towards my ends, I hardly have any hair. ):\n\nI have Irish curls, but most of it is a 3a curl pattern. My natural hair color is a medium auburn-tinged brown. Texture is dry, my hair follicles are thin, but I don't have thin hair in general. I'd say it's medium, but when I do wash my hair, SO much falls out. \n\nI have tried a million hair products, deep conditioners, serums, masks, prenatal vitamins, but my hair will not grow long. I was told that frequent trims help hair growth. All they did was cut the progress I made since the last appointment. I've seen multiple hairstylists hoping someone could give my hair the help it needs to grow. Not enough to think it's medical, but I just don't know where to turn. I've always wanted longer hair, especially with how pretty my curls would make it. Anyway, how much hair falling out every shower is considered normal??? lol Also, I feel like it's important to mention that I don't deal with a lot of split ends. Just my hair being dry. I did a porosity test with some of my hair, and the hair floated on the top, meaning low porosity. Does anyone have my same type of hair, and know products they LOVE?\n\nLong story short, I want long hair and healthy curls. Obviously, the curls won't get to perfection if I continue to get highlights, but I feel like my hair could still be SO much better and reach its full potential while still being blonde. I just don't know what to do. I would appreciate any and every advice I can get. Feel free to suggest any routines, products, hairdressers, etc.!!!! I'm located in North Fulton County in Georgia.\n\n  \nThank you so much!!!",

      "content": "I’ve been on tretinoin 0.1% for cystic acne for years, so this isn’t the purge phase. My skin’s always been a bit dry and I have seborrheic dermatitis, but lately the dryness is next-level to the point where my face starts flaking within an hour of moisturizing and it literally snows onto my clothes.\n\nI’ve tried layering two rounds of CeraVe moisturizer, sunscreen, and Vaseline to seal it in, but it still dries out fast. Out of desperation, I used Jergens Ultra Healing lotion, which weirdly helped for a few hours.\n\nAt this point, tretinoin doesn’t seem to be preventing breakouts much either. I’m wondering if Accutane might help my acne and reduce this flaking, or if it’d just make the dryness worse.\n\nAnyone dealt with this kind of chronic dryness while on tret? What actually helped?",

      "title": "Hair is too soft??",
      "content": "TLDR: got a big hair cut and my hair is now completely undamaged, making it so soft and fluffy that none of my products or techniques are working. How do I get it to curl nicely again and not be fluffy and light even after using heaps of heavyweight gel? \n\nHello, recently I had a bad hair cut experience that took me from armpit length hair to chin length. I’ve come to terms with this and I do like my hair short, just wasn’t expecting it at this time. Since so much length was taken off my hair is now realllyyyy fresh and new and clean and undamaged. Normally I’d consider that a good thing but it’s making my hair very difficult to style. It’s been a few weeks since the cut so it’s not just my hair rebounding after that at this point. \n\nMy hair is medium all around, density, porosity, and texture. My hair ranges from 2c to 3b, with the bottom most layer more a 2b. I have a pretty blunt cut that is one length all around just under my chin, and a few face framing pieces. \n\nRoutine: I clarify with the Aveno ACV clarifying shampoo, then Aussie miracle curls shampoo and conditioner. I’ve tried just doing the two shampoos and no conditioner but it didn’t make much difference. \n\nI’ve put gel on soaking wet in the shower then scrunched, sometimes adding more and sometimes not. I’ve scrunched my hair drier and put on mousse or gel in a damp state. Tried just about every combo I can think of with the products listed below. \n\nI’ve tried eco curly gel, aunt Jackie’s don’t shrink flaxseed gel, not your mothers curl talk, and herbal essence curl mousse and they all look okay on day one, usually, and especially if I have time to let it air dry fully or diffuse. If I sleep on it damp at all it’s a mess. Even sleeping on it dry and complete ruins the look. \n\nIt’s all just too soft. It will hold a bit of a cast while drying, and when I scrunch it out a bit at that point the products seem to completely vanish and the hair gets so so soft and looses its definition and frizzes out. But if I don’t scrunch it my hair looks wet and crunchy from the product. Re-wetting it later doesn’t reengage the cast at all, and if I apply more product at that point it gets sticky. \n\nI don’t use a defining brush, I comb it in the shower with conditioner in. I’ve done some manual finger curling clumps but they usually get lost and the strands end up small, isolated, floofy, and frizzy. I do use a satin pillow case but not a bonnet. \n\nMy instinct is to go for heavier product, something with a more extreme hold that will create a cast that builds curls that last more than a few hours after scrunching the cast away when dry. Weighing it down to be less foofy and lightweight, and holding my hair in a more consistent curl pattern rather than letting it fall to barely wavy in most spots. \n\nShould I try a denman brush? A less moisturizing shampoo and conditioner? It’s like I feel like if I dyed my hair a shade lighter and damaged it all a little then it would hold shape and product better. But I’m not interested in dyeing my hair. Does that mean I’ve moved into low porosity? \n\nMy hair previously had been at its best when short, less weight of hair made better curls. But this time it is just not doing that and I can’t understand why. These other times I’ve had my hair short I had been dyeing it lighter? I live in Colorado where it is pretty dry, but I’ve had this short curly cut here before and it was fine. \n\nAny product or technique suggestions? Is it crazy to think about purposefully damaging my hair so that it styles better? Is there a way to do that without actually changing the color? I’ve got a nice blend of grays mixed in at this point that I really like and don’t want to cover up. \n\nDo I go lighter on conditioner and heavier on gel products? Any advice or insight appreciated. \n",

Any time ive had hair extensions and the stylist goes to thin them out/blend them so they look as natural as possible, they end up thinning my real hair too (which is already thin hence why I use extensions.) The last time I had k-tips installed a stylist went to blend them and they did need some blending because they were a bit too thick vs. my real hair...my own hair got thinned too....badly.  When i removed the extensions the ends looked crazy. I basically had a rat tail looking thing and you could see the exact point where the stylist had thinned it. Above it was thicker and everything below came into a \"V.\" Its awful. \n\n I have a new set in now and probably do need a bit of blending but im terrified to let anyone near me with scissors for fear my real hair will get cut again too.\n\n  \nIs this just inevitable because once installed you cant really separate out the real hair from the extension? Or is there a technique that can be done to both help blend the extensions but also avoid my real hair?",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I(20F) have been thinking about this for years. When I was 7, I had a fire accident I was trying to surprise my mom by lighting a candle after she gave birth and a tiny spark from the match fell on my skirt. It caught fire and I ended up with thick burn scar on my right upper thigh.\n\nIt’s something that’s really held me back from things I love, I’ve always dreamed of modeling (I have the height and proportions) but the scars make me feel disqualified right away. I also avoid wearing certain clothes or swimsuits because they’re so visible. There was even one time I said I’ll be careless and went swimming in a bikini, the people kept staring at me up down the whole time.\n\nI’ve been considering cosmetic or plastic surgery for a while I don’t even know if it is too late for me but I keep hearing different things some say it can be improved or resurfaced, others say it’s permanent. Has anyone here had burn scar revision or laser treatments that actually made a visible difference? I’d love to hear real experiences or any advice on what options are worth looking into.\n\nThank you so much in advance 💛\n",

      "content": "Hey SCA,\n\nI'm deep in an ingredient list rabbit hole and need your help. I'm trying to pick an eye cream with a solid anti-aging focus (targeting fine lines, prevention, the whole deal) and I've narrowed it down to these two from Océane.\n\nBoth formulas look pretty stacked, but I'm having trouble figuring out which one is actually the better long-term investment for anti-aging. I'd love to get your thoughts before I pull the trigger.\n\nHere are the formulas:\n\n**Oceane Ultra Repair Eye Cream**\n\n&gt;\n\n**Océane Eye Rescue Night Cream**\n\n&gt;\n\n**My thoughts so far:**\n\n* Both are absolutely packed with peptides. I'm seeing **Copper Tripeptide-1, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 (Argireline, right?), Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4 (Matrixyl?),** and the **Matrixyl 3000** combo (Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1 &amp; Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7) in both, which seems wild.\n* The **Eye Rescue Night Cream** has a great mix of nourishing oils (Squalane, Shea, Jojoba, Rosehip) plus **Niacinamide** and **Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**. This one feels like it's targeting photodamage and barrier health.\n* The **Ultra Repair Eye Cream** seems to be all about hydration and repair. It has a massive **multi-hyaluronic acid complex**, **Ceramide NP**, and a ton of ferments (**Lactobacillus, Saccharomyces, Bifida**). The \"Soluble Collagen\" seems like it's just for surface hydration, but I'm not sure.\n* **The Dilemma:** The Night Cream has the Vitamin C and classic nourishing oils, but the Repair Cream has that insane peptide list, ceramides, and a focus on ferments/microbiome which I know is also great for long-term health. Which formulation strategy do you think is more effective for anti-aging?\n\nSo, what do you all think? If you had to pick one purely for anti-aging, which one would it be and why?\n\nThanks in advance!",
