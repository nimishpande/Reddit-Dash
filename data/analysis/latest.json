      "content": "Hey all,\n\nI'm 33m and I have lived in Florida my whole life. I've done basically no intentional skincare outside of sunscreen when I go to the beach. All of that neglect has finally caught up with me and I had a potential melanoma scare on my nose (lab results were negative, all good).\n\nBut, that scare got me to really look at my skin for the first time in my life, and I want to try to take better care of it and hopefully (though not likely) reverse the damage.\n\nI have freckles (not from birth but sun exposure), enlarged pores on my cheeks leading to my nose, some slight divots from acne scarring on my temples, but most distracting are my heavy under-eye bags.\n\nThe bags are genetic, been there my whole life. Some days are better or worse, but they always there. The bags are somehow both sunken in and puffy at the same time. They also have raised dots on the more loose and darkened skin.\n\nI do my best to be hydrated and I track my sleep to make sure I get at least 8 hours consistently. I have a fairly healthy mediterranean diet and I exercise at least twice a week.\n\nIs there anything that can be done about my skin after it has been damaged this way? I don't want to go down the makeup route, not because I'm insecure, but because I'm trying to treat my skin issues and not cover them up.\n\nAnd what about the under eyes bags? I've heard of PDO under eye threads solid but temporary procedure (once every two years) that help. Filler are sketchy and even less permanent, imo.\n\nThe only current skin scare I'm doing is putting on some 50 spf sunscreen face lotion every morning before going outside.",

      "title": "First Curly Cut Advice",
      "content": "Hi everyone \nLooking for advice on a haircut. My last haircut was in April 2024 and the last time I colored it was May 2023 (I have only dyed it a handful of times over the years). The ends are so dry and damaged and are in need of at least a trim. \nI am postpartum so my hair care is pushed aside most of the time (and going through postpartum hairloss üôÉ). I have no set daily routine. It all depends on how much time I have.\nHere is a general routine. \nShampoo probably once a month and whatever Shampoo happens to be in the shower at the time. Honestly, just Shampoo once my hair is feeling gross. \nConditioner every shower with either dove/Pantene or shea moisture conditioner.\nFinger comb my hair in the shower\nScrunch some water out\nSometimes I use Not Your Mother's Mousse other times I use just their curl cream. \nJVN Air Dry Cream\nAny product I use is scrunched in while my hair is flipped upside down.\nIf I have time, I will diffuse. Sometimes only half dry just depends on the day. If I have no time then I skip this and just let it air dry. \nIt is usually frizzier and less volume when I air dry. (I do live in high humidity).\nSometimes I use Tresseme or Not Your Mother's Hairspray. \n\n\nI want to go to a curl specialist for the first time and get a haircut (no color). I have no idea what I should ask for though. I used to always get a Bob cut then let it grow for a year and then repeat (pretty much since elementary school and I am approaching 30 now üò±). I kind of want something new. And now having a baby, I want to be able to put it up on the days when I just don't have time for myself.\n\nAlso, I am in the medical field and like my curls to be pulled back/out of my face when working. Any ideas for a cute hairdo other than a high bun using a scrunchie?\n\nThanks for reading this and for any and all advice\n\n",

I wanted to first say that I understand there are likely lots of posts like these, but I wanted to ask myself, for I cannot find any posts or resources that are helpful.\n\nA few years ago, I began to transition from male to female. Over time, my mom has accepted me more, and she tries to support me in my endeavors, but she isn't the teaching type. Basically, I'm a girl with little to no real girl \"experience.\" I have no clue where to start with makeup, I don't know what I should mess with and try out to practice, and any attempts to search for beginner guides online results in more advanced concepts and hard-to-understand videos.\n\nI was hoping you guys could give me some assistance in finding some basic \"how to girl\" \"how to makeup\" guides or starting points.

I've never had great skin, but it started worsening with jawline/neck acne from end of September until now (pictured). \n\nIn the beginning of September, I updated my routine to be:\n‚Ä¢ Morning: Wash with warm water, occasionally use Vitamin C Serum, daily Cetaphil Daily Face Moisturizer w/SPF\n‚Ä¢ Night: Double cleansing with Burts Bee's Facial Cleansing Oil w/ Coconut &amp; Argan Oil and Cetaphil Daily Face Wash OR Cerave Acne Face wash (Salicylic Acid), prescription Tretinoin &amp; adapalene, Cerave Moisturizing Cream\nThe main change from before is adding the oil cleanser &amp; CeraVe Cream.\n\nAround the end of September my skin started worsening, so I stripped back my routine to try to calm things down: \n‚Ä¢ Morning: Cetaphil Daily Face Wash &amp; Daily Moisturizer w/ SPF ONLY\n‚Ä¢ Night: Cetaphil Daily Face Wash &amp; CeraVe Moisturizing Cream ONLY\nI also started 400mg daily of Spearmint capsules around this time.\n\nMy skin kept worsening, so mid October I switched the night CeraVe Moisturizing Cream to Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion (as the CeraVe Cream I read can sometimes clog pores), went back no cleanser in the mornings, and kept the rest the same. I stopped taking the Spearmint on October 22nd. This is where I'm at now, and the photos are from last night. Any advice is appreciated :)\n\nOther things to note: I've been in 100mg of Spironolactone since April and none of my other medications have changed. I also have PCOS. Lately, the areas under my neck/jawline have been itchy as well.",
