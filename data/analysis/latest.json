I applied a generous amount of mayonnaise in my hair as a protein mask which felt not as illegal as it sounds. I have a history of using acv for my hair so it might just be me lol \n\nI’m trying to add roughness to my hair as it falls flat so easily so I gave the hairspray method a chance. I applied the spray on wet hair after scrunching and after diffusing. I feel no difference in softness but my hopes are up that my hair will be as curly in the next days.\n\nalso, last pic is from 3 months ago. no trims in between. I’m trying to grow out my hair to at least mid back but it’s taking forever 😭 am I growth blind or is there literally no difference?\n\nroutine:\n\nwash with ogx biotin&amp;collagen shampoo, mayonnaise mask for 20mins, onlycurls moisturising conditioner\n\na little conditioner as leave in, neqi heat protector, moroccanoil curl foam, taft 14 gel one after another applied by raking and scrunching it upside down in the shower\n\nplop for a few minutes, apply loreal hairspray, cup diffusing and hairspray when it’s dry\n\nleave it a few minutes until the hair is cold and clap out the scrunch (without my beloved balea plex oil which felt so wrong)",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "I have extremely dense, thick hair that is wavy rather than curly. I've recently started trying get it more curly and wavy and less one solid block of frizz. However, most of the advice I can find on here and elsewhere for people with wavy hair is for hair that is much thinner than mine or for hair that is similarly as thick but much curlier. My hair is dense enough that I could stick a pencil in it, shake my head around and it would probably not fall out, but it's also not really curly. I rarely wash my hair with anything other than water and didn't previously have any other hair care routine. I have recently started using Give Me Four Curls leave in conditioner. The conditioner sometimes works quite well, and my hair will even start to form ringlets when I use it, but it's also quite inconsistent. My hair also takes an entire day to dry when I use it, and when I wake up in the morning I basically have to start the process again. Not really sure where to go from here?",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nI have read other posts on here which has helped some, but I'd still love any input around how to prevent my skincare products from pilling. I'm going to list my routine and my products, and I'm open to new product suggestions, changing what I'm doing, you name it.\n\nAM\n\nSplash my face with water and dry it, do red light therapy.\n\n[The Ordinary Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Solution 20% with vitamin F](https://theordinary.com/en-us/ascorbyl-tetraisopalmitate-solution-20-in-vitamin-f-vitamin-c-100406.html) \\- I wait 5-10 minutes for this to soak in.\n\n[Live Clean Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.liveclean.ca/products-liveclean/live-clean-after-sun-aloe-vera-gel/) and The Ordinary Matrixyl 10% with HA - I wait 5 minutes for this to soak in.\n\n[CeraVe Moisturizing Cream](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream#key-ingredients), I wait another 5 minutes after this.\n\n[Pipette Mineral Sunscreen](https://www.pipettebaby.com/products/mineral-sunscreen-lotion-spf-50) with Squalane.\n\nI don't wear makeup or put anything else on.\n\nI haven't been sure whether to use The Ordinary AT first or after aloe vera, or somewhere else since it's an oil? But if I forget to put it on I still seem to have the same pilling issues.\n\nI've also reduced the amount of product I'm using with both the aloe vera and the cerave, and increased the amount of time to let products soak in. That's helped, but when I put on my sunscreen I still tend to get pilling. Am I just using too much/many products, too hydrating, specific ingredients in the products, what do you think? My skin does really seem to love the hydration, I have dry skin and live in a really cold/dry climate during the winter.\n\nI really love the mineral sunscreen, as I can't wear chemical sunscreens (they always sting my eyes and also make my mouth taste strange?? Even without getting it in my mouth?). I've tried probably a dozen mineral sunscreens. I got it as a much cheaper dupe for [Biossance Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen](https://www.biossance.com/p/squalane-and-zinc-sheer-mineral-sunscreen/15243371/?affil=thgppc&amp;switchcurrency=USD&amp;shippingcountry=US&amp;bvstate=pg:5/ct:r) which I also loved, both of which are the only mineral sunscreens I've found that don't have a white cast and aren't super drying. I'm open to other options here.\n\nHere's PM routine too, just for reference:\n\n[Bioderma Cleansing Oil](https://www.bioderma.ca/en/all-products/atoderm/cleansing-oil)\n\nSame aloe vera and The Ordinary matrixyl\n\nPrescription retinol cream\n\nSame Cerave\n\nThe Ordinary 100% Plant Derived Squalane\n\nThank you for any help!\n\nP.S. Just saw the post about The Ordinary and Estee Lauder - open to alternatives for my TO products for this reason, too! ",

I’ve had pimples &amp; texture before but never like this. \n\nIt started about 2 months ago (late November) and hasn’t let up since. My regular skin care routine for the past few years is double cleansing with a gentle face wash, using a milky toner, &amp; moisturizer. I also use acne free brand adapalene 0.1% &amp; the ordinary aha bha peeling solution but never on the same days. Since the breakouts have gotten worse I have been not using the adapalene as much or peeling solution at all. \n\nI have been working out in a hot mat pilates studio for about 6 months but more often since mid-September. \n\nI guess my real question(s) here are does this look more like anything besides regular run-of-the-mill acne ? I’ve been thinking that it may be fungal since I have used the pilates studios’ lavender towels after working out but don’t know if that’s even plausible. If you have any advice on how to clear this up it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

I get hard keratin plugs on my back and shoulders often. I have lots of discoloration on my back and shoulders form acne scarring. I have prominent sebaceous filaments on my nose, but it's been greatly reduced since using BHA every other day.

I spent a few times in the past several years trying to understand and like my curls, to find what works for me. Everything ever seems to weight it down. Is trying to achieve a gel cast possible? And if so, how do I do that without putting too much gel on and weighing things down? Thank you!!!\n\nTo give further context of where I'm at so far, I only just realized you really shouldn't touch your curls much while diffusing. Oops.\n\nCurrent routine: shampoo with dove repair, or ION hard water shampoo. Usually conditioner, Pantene of some kind. Try to plop into a towel but my hair is short. Air dry for best results but it's winter so I diffuse try to upside down.\n\n ",
