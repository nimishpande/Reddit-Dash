      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

But I’m having a hard time believing that, and it seems like a regular metal one could do the job with some heat protectant?\n\nThanks!",

I’ve developed pretty bad dermatillomania as a result and i know it’s making it worse but if i didn’t have anything to pick at it wouldnt. It’s definitely partly hormonal/stress related but i don’t think that’s the entirety. Birth control didn’t make a different but i am on spiro 50mg, and it has definitely helped with the big gross inflamed ones, but i still struggle with clogged pores, closed comadones, whiteheads and red spots. \nNot only that but i have hEDS which makes my skin extremely sensitive. Most topical products don’t agree with me. Tret, Benzoyl Peroxide and adapalane have dried the f out of my skin or damaged my skin barrier. Tret nearly had my skin sloughing off no matter how i used it. Salicylic acid and MAYBE clindamycin are the only two that haven’t, but i haven’t seen much results. My skin is generally dry and it’s hard to find acne products that don’t make that worse. \nmy routine right now, which i would like to get help with because i don’t think all the products are necessarily the best is \nmorning: \nThe ordinary Glucoside Foaming cleanser (want to try a different one, any gentle cleansers that help with acne, are non comedogenic, non drying and avoid alcohol, this is something i’m looking at changing most importantly) \nITK milky toner (i like this, would like to keep) \nThe Ordinary 2%aloe 2%NAG solution \nclindamycin 1% lotion (don’t know if this is beneficial or not) \nLa Roche Posay double repair moisturizer \nnight: same cleanser \nElf woah glow 30spf primer \nThe ordinary salicylic acid 2%\nByoma Barrier repair treatment (i’ve heard this is not recommended for acne prone skin, would like a better barrier treatment) \nThe ordinary Natural Moisturizing factors+beta glucan \nif my skin is really dry i add a layer of the la roache posay as needed \nLion Pair acne spot cream (tiktok product yes but i’ve seen good results and i like it a lot) \nWould love some insight as to what’s potentially causing my acne and a good routine for my skin type. I’m just now trying to take it seriously so plz don’t be mean. I also can’t spend a lot of money so in the lower/medium price range. Also i’ve heard azeliac acid is good? what do yall think. i would appreciate any insight. ",

Hair, nails, and skin are all doing fantastic.\n\nBreathe through my nose.\n\nI’ve tried a lot of products, Asian beauty tends to work better for me but I’m open to Western brands as well.\n\nI’ve tried periods of no exfoliating and no lip balms to see if it helps. The only combo that has worked so far is RiRe Bubble Lip Mask followed by A'PIEU Honey &amp; Milk Lip Oil, and that gets me almost a whole day of happy, smooth lips where I don’t have to constantly moisturize and/or can apply lip products without a layer of dead skin forming. If I don’t exfoliate sometimes the Honey &amp; Milk lip oil can create the dead skin issue, but not every time.\n\nSide question, is it safe to use a bubble lip mask every day? Physical exfoliants seem to be too rough and at the same time far less effective.\n\nMy other mainstays are Vitamin E stick, Nivea Moisture Pure Color, Shiseido Water Lip, and the Laneige lip mask. CNP Laboratory Propolis Lipcerin seems to make my lips burn, I only used it twice so it might be a coincidence but if I’m allergic to something then something in that would be my first guess.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that anything with a significant quantity of bees wax makes everything 10x worse",

I’ve noticed it got really bad after I stopped taking birth control pills and switched to an implant so I don’t know if that has anything to do with it. I’ve always had acne prone skin and ever since I turned 19 I noticed that if I got a pimple it would leave a dark mark (regardless of if I touched it or not) And I’ll have pimples that will never ever go away and will just stay as a bump\n\nWould a facial help? What else would help to get rid of dark spots left by pimples?? Or would it just be a waste of time? I have pretty sensitive skin that is oily on my forehead and nose but dry on the lower half of my face. What else would you suggest?
