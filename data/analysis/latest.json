      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

My routine is l’oréal elvive color safe wash, and verb ghost conditioner, then when soaking wet I use the curlsmith flexi jelly all over with praying hands and lightly scrunch. I usually diffuse a little and then mostly air dry. Sometimes I use the rizos curl cream instead of gel! I also clarify using ouais clarifying shampoo once a week. \n\nPic 2 is what my hair looks like day 2 no matter what. I have tried satin pillow case, pineapple and no matter what I get straight pieces that look kind of fried and I always end up completely re wetting to make it look decent. \n\nPic 3 is what my hair looks like when photographed and I’m hoping for haircut advice so it looks less flat? I’ve never gotten a curl specific hair cut but I really like the shag style cuts where it gets rid of the triangle shape. Any advice is welcomed!\n\nTo note: I have fine hair, but a lot of it (I think??) I color my hair with level 10 developer but I am sure that I probably have some damage related to that. I’m open to any advice!!!",

      "content": "Hello everyone! I’ve started wanting to get into ACTUALLY caring for my hair instead of just picking a random shampoo and conditioner and hoping it works and then pulling it up all day every day.\n\nI have dense, course, low (?) porosity hair, but I have never used a clarifying shampoo/chelating shampoo to remove any buildup that might be there so I’m not entirely sure if my hair is truly LOW porosity.\n\nI have a mix of 2b and 2c I’m pretty sure. maybe some 3a? I attached a picture of what my hair looks like when I actually style my curls (i.e., gel, mouse, diffuse, etc.) and of what my hair typically looks like day to day without styling (just wash, condition, and leave-in).\n\nin my routine I use the OGX Coconut Curls shampoo and conditioner, double shampooing, and switch between the Function of Beauty curly hair leave-in and the Not Your Mothers Curl Talk leave-in. I also used the Aveda Nutri-Plenish daily moisturizing treatment before and it worked pretty well, but it’s too expensive for me to rebuy consistently. when styling I use the Aveda Nutri-Plenish styling mouse and curl gel and scrunch both in in sections and then diffuse. I feel like the shampoo and conditioner do okay because my roots and bottom layers closer to my scalp are pretty soft, but my top layers and ends are always crazy dry and frizzy. I use a satin pillowcase and dry my hair with a microfiber towel after showering.\n\nthere is at least 2 inches that needs to be chopped, but even when I didn’t need a cut my hair has always been super dry.\n\nI’m hoping to get some assistance on:\n\n- good ingredients to stick to (I’ve read humectants, lightweight oils [argan, coconut, etc], and lightweight products) for my hair type and typically avoiding proteins. I’ve already read the silicones are good for low porosity, especially in humid areas (I’m in SE Texas close to Galveston)\n\n- best way to go about clarifying and removing all possible buildup (I’ve read going with a clarifying shampoo [i.e., Suave] and a chelating shampoo or an apple cider vinegar soak and then redoing the porosity test)\n\n- product recommendations for shampoo/conditioner (I know typically sticking to the same line is beneficial due to pH)\n\n- any other additional help and advice that would be beneficial or good to know\n\nI am doing my own research alongside this post, but getting additional information from people who may have dealt with similar problems to myself would help a lot.\n\nTHANKS!!",

I want to move away from the stereotypical TikTok/teen look and go for something that’ll age well into my 20s.\n\nI have thinner hair strands but a lot of hair overall, so volume can be tricky — it can either look flat or fluffy depending on the day. I’m open to medium or shorter styles and don’t mind using product if needed.\n\nWhat styles or cuts would you recommend for:\n\t•\tThinner hair with decent density\n\t•\tA more mature, clean look\n\t•\tSomething versatile for casual + nicer settings\n\nI’m open to barber vs salon, specific cuts, or even styling/product advice.

      "title": "Need a new but very simple routine for low porosity dry hair",
      "content": "Hi everyone! I'm hoping to get some help on what to buy my bf to help him get (and keep) his hair healthier. He's finally become open to trying a new shampoo and conditioner and asked me to figure out what he should use. \n\nHis hair is mid-back length. He has never gotten a trim since he started growing it out 6 years ago. His current routine is as follows: \n\n1. Wash hair as needed (maybe 2x a week) with Head &amp; Shoulders 2-in-1\n2. Wrap hair in a bath towel while he does other things (I'm trying to get him to switch to a t-shirt or microfiber towel)\n3. (Sometimes) dry it with a blowdryer (no diffuser)\n4. Finger comb it dry over the next several days. When he gets down to tiny knots, pull the hair until it breaks out of the knot. You can hear it snap. (I have been trying to educate him on how bad this is, he thinks it's the only way to get the knots out...)\n\n[Pictures of his hair here](https://imgur.com/a/MUXXZ6j). From L to R: fresh out of the shower 1.5 years ago (it's gotten more damaged looking since then), a few hours post-shower (more recent), 1 day out, and maybe 1.5 days out. By the end of day 2, that ponytail is one large knotted mass. You can see that it starts out looking nice and curly fresh out of the shower, and then slowly becomes more dry, straight, frizzy, and matted looking.\n\nHis hair tangles very easily and is constantly a pile of knots, to the point that it does sometimes mat. He spends significant time each day \"unknotting\" it, leaving piles of hair everywhere in the process. The bottom 6-8 inches always looks much dryer and frizzier than the hair above it, and idk if that's from damage, his handling the hair to detangle it, or both.\n\nI did finally convince him to get a trim to get rid of any damage he may have with my haircutter next Wednesday (she is not a curl specialist), and she understandably asked that we try and get many of the knots out before the appointment. I'm planning to lather him with conditioner and brush it out with my Wet Brush while the conditioner is still in, as per the guide. I expect this to take multiple hours and may take multiple sessions.\n\nHere are some of the reasons I'm struggling with picking products for him:\n\n- his hair seems to be low porosity (it's tough to get it wet and it takes forever to dry on its own), so it seems co-washing is not recommended\n- it also looks like it's really dry, but all the low porosity recommendations are less moisturizing\n- He gets dry skin flakes (at least that's what I think it is, he won't see a derm). Head &amp; Shoulders seems to help but is not enough to stop it \n- He's extremely sensitive to textures and hates the idea of being able to feel any kind of film or waxiness or build-up in his hair post-shower. He is against using gels for this reason as well\n\nI've read the wiki but between all of the above and the low likelihood of him doing anything but the simplest of routines, I don't know where to start. Any product tips or advice?",

Yet, no matter what I do, my hair never looks the way I wish it to. It feels like I have just one continuous layer of curls (the outer one), and even it is almost completely hidden down to just above the ends (of which I have few) by a nest of frizz; frizz which is so bad that it persists when my hair is wet. It would not matter anyway; the following morning, whatever curls there are will be dried out and hidden by even more frizz. To compound matters, the advice I get ranges from \"you can do nothing about it\" to \"you need moisture\" to \"scrunch it!\" (which I already do). I am quite ready to give up; what is the point of my hair, if after an hour-long wash, with hundreds of dollars in hair products, it barely looks better than how I started off?\n\nRoutine if you need it: Rinse, Shampoo (Aunt Jackie's Clarifying or Moisturising Shampoo, either raked through hair), Condition (Cantu moisturising masque, or SheaMoisture moisturising conditioner, with praying hands), comb (bounce brush or fine tooth comb, I find the former works slightly better), rinse (though recently I am trying to \"squish to condish\", which as of now has not worked at all), apply LottaBody leave-in (praying hands), apply Curl keeper gel (praying hands), scrunch while wet, wait, then scrunch out the crunch.",

Just give it time.\n\nI have been on Fin (1mg/day) for probably close to 9 years now and on oral Min (2.5-5mg/day) for almost 3. I have had occasional sheds over the years but the shed I had starting in May of this year was really concerning. I could just rub my head and see tons of hairs falling out, and when I would style my hair with product my hand would be covered. I took a shower at a house with a hair catcher and after two showers there were probably 100 or more hairs caught.\n\nIt was causing so much concern that I just shaved my head which really helped relieve the anxiety. Anyway almost 7 months have passed since then and my hair is right back to where it was before the shed. When I style my hair now I might see 1 or 2 hairs stick to my hand, I am not seeing hair in the shower, and not noticing random hairs falling through the day.\n\nSo just ride it out. Keep taking the medication. Make sure you eat well and take your Vitamin D. The shed will pass!",

Nothing has made a noticeable difference on my face.\n\nRecently, I went to a dermatologist and took the medication they prescribed. My active acne cleared during the treatment, but the red marks (PIE) stayed. My doctor told me they would fade with time, but they didn’t. After finishing the medication, my pimples came back again.\n\nI tried using lacto calamine lotion as a spot on new pimples to dry them,it's works but now I’m getting a dark scars too. I’ve heard azelaic acids help with PIE, so I used that consistently (day and night) for 4–5 weeks, but my marks have barely improved.\n\nMy pores have become very visible and my skin looks textured. I feel like nothing is working anymore. This is my recent picture. Please suggest what I should do for the acne, red marks, dark spots, and large pores. I’m honestly tired now.\nI badly want a clear skin i am done with this acne it's been 4 year dealing with this someday it get cleared nd then suddenly it came back again 😭😭😭 \n\nMy current skincare is cleanser suggest by derma,ponds moisturizer and deconst sunscreen and fr night I repeat same step but if I have pimple I use lacto calamine lotion oonly on pimple rest i aaply azelaic acid but recently I stoped both these things because nothing is working ...!! \n\n",
