      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

In the beginning of this journey I styled my curls with a brush but found out it made my curls lose all their shape so I just detangle with my hands in the shower while I still have conditioner on before rinsing.\nMy routine is nothing crazy but it works for me and I am happy to share it with you guys☺️",

I started on 2.5 mg of dutasteride daily for the first six weeks, and then switched to 0.5 mg. I did this as a loading phase to get to the 0.5 mg serum concentration based on my understanding of its accumulation in the blood and tissues.\n\nI’ve had no side effects other than the elimination of my acne, which I’ve struggled with since my early teenage years. I don’t believe I’ve had a single pimple in over five months, where before I had at least 4 to 5 on my forehead at any time. My hair has come back extremely thick and dense, and even darker than it was before. I always had blonde hair, but now it’s coming in very dark blonde/light brown. Happy to answer any questions.\n\nFirst three are after photos, and second three are before photos. It is in the same order: left temple, right temple, center hairline.",

Since starting hormone treatment (about a year ago) I've started getting acne as I'm going through male puberty and I have absolutely no idea how to combat this. All the basic products I see people recommend like Cerave cleansers are at \\*least\\* £10 and people act like this is cheap, plus the amount of people that have like 5+ products in their skincare routine.... ofc I'm willing to spend that money but I want to know it'll actually work if I'm gonna spend a week's worth of food on making my skin clear up :/\n\nRight now I just wash my face with the Simple cleansing facial wash but just ran out of it. I've started infrequently using St Ives apricot facial scrub too which I know is controversial but it seemed like the best option I could afford. I'm going to ask for some specific items for Christmas, so what should I get and how do I build a cheap, \\*easy\\* routine that should actually work to reduce hormonal/puberty acne? My skin is probably on the mildly oily side if that changes things.\n\nThanks so much in advance for reading and for any help!!!",

      "content": "ok so today i went to get a full body wax for the first time. i did some research and picked a place close enough by my house and had a 4.2 star rating with 600 reviews so i thought why not. I booked an appointment with the owner of the place because there was countless of reviews mentioning how she made the process easy and how she was very informative and thats exactly what i needed for a first time full body wax. Upon my arrival i was met with a different esthetician from the one i booked online, she didnt know what i was there for, and didnt even introduce herself at all, i thought it was a bit weird but she seemed nice, there was a young lady who walked out of the room before i entered and she had a smile on her face, the esthetician was an older lady and i assumed she has plenty of experience and i just wanted to finally get a full body wax because i HATE shaving and body hair makes me overstimulated. When i first entered the room i explained to her how this is my first time getting wax ever in my life and although i did book for a full body wax im not sure if i wanted to do my bikini area today, but the rest of my body im fine with. she said okay and told me to take off my clothes and underwear so i did and i laid on the table, the whole appointment she didnt talk at all and just opened my legs up, i though she was going to start with just my bikini lines to test the waters on how much the pain feels like…but she proceeds to put a whole strip of wax on the right lip of my vagina, my heart was pounding out of my chest at this point cause i wasnt expecting her to start with the kitty off rip considering i was extremely nervous. she didnt warn me at all and didnt explain the process at all. it genuinely hurt so bad and the lack of communication the whole time was so awkward and was not helping at all. I was genuinely rethinking my choices booking an appointment and even thought maybe i showed up to the wrong place or something. she was waxing my cooch and arm pits and legs all at the same time.. currently typing this with one armpit waxed because the whole process was so unbearable and uncomfortable and not what i was expecting at all , i started to tear up a little cause i genuinely felt like she was pulling my pussy lips off and i told her to stop and she seemed upset and said “never in my 20 years have i had a client act like this”. I told her i wasnt enjoying my experience and to tell me how much i owed her so i can get the hell out of there. Anyways i feel maybe i overreacted? Im not really sure how a full body wax is supposed to go… i know that the first initial wax is always the worst, but just the whole vibe was weird from the beginning.  i feel like maybe if she was more communicative it would have been a better experience, but anyways should i try another place? is it even worth it? :( im scared to go to another place but i really cant stand having hair on my body, any recommendations on finding a good wax place? and what should i expect for a proper and professional wax… thank u if u made it this far 🙏🏽",

My skin has improved a lot this year, but I’m still almost always breaking out. My issue is that for the longest time I’ve only ever focused on finding acne-reducing skincare products, and because most of them have things that cannot be used with tret, I don’t know where to start when it comes to finding new products to use when I start the tret.\n\nMy current products: Caudalie cleansing oil, Caudalie vinopure cleanser (has salicylic acid), Caudalie vinopure serum (has salicylic acid), niacinamide serum, Hyaluronic acid serum, and Kiehl’s expertly clear moisturizer (has salicylic acid). \n\nThese products have helped my skin A LOT, and a lot of products break my skin out, so I’m really nervous to try all new products along with the tret. I have combo skin (my t-zone is pretty oily but the rest of my face is dryer) and have never been able to use any thick moisturizers.\n\nAnyone have any advice for products I should look into? I really want to prevent peeling/flaking, I can handle a purge if I need to. Any tips or recommendations (even a whole routine recommendation) would be so so appreciated!! \n\nPS: budget is not an issue, if there is one thing that I am okay to splurge on its skincare!\n\nSigned, a nervous nelly who’s scared to mess up her skin \n ",

Today for some reason I put a fish oil and dutasteride capsule in my mouth and on my way to get some water to swallow them I forgot what I was even trying to do and just bit down on both capsules.\n\nAnd let me tell you: The dutasteride suspension tastes like the concentrated sweat from the wool of an old sheep, a shocking mutton like taste and at the same time it slightly tasted like battery acid. It's stunning to discover tastes you didn't know before after more than 3 decades on this shitty planet. This is like Harry Potters stupid mystery beans.\n\nWhat the fuck are the putting in our pills? Was that the taste of the dut? The (rotten?) suspension? I am enjoying the regrowth though.",

Detangle while conditioning, leave in conditioner, curl cream, Scrunch and finger curling after wash. Diffuse after wash with low heat and low speed.\n\nI just recently started diffusing and using a bonnet. The bonnet seems to have reduced my bed head hair and diffusing has brought some extra volume to my hair. I was messing around with the heat and fan settings but hot and high fan made my hair dry really fast and according to ChatGPT (not the best source ik) low heat and low fan seem to work well for my hair.\n\nI never knew about detangling hair until recently and about curly hair having to have to have this much maintenance so any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nProducts: as I am cowash, Camille rose leave in, ms Jessie’s pillow soft curl creams. Aunt Jackie’s curl custard. I’d like any products recommendations as well because I was using Cantu and Miele before but from what I’ve heard from my friends, they suck since their formula changed. They didn’t do much until I switched to my new products. I’ve heard mixed opinions on shea moisture but I do use one of their scalp conditioner. \n\n(Update I’m currently using as I am leave in and aunt Jackie’s curl custard until they run out. The leave in has coconut and idk if that’s good for my hair type and sometimes it feels weird compared to when I tried out the Camille rose leave in) also I’m using Camille rose shampoo and conditioner for my Monday wash days. I’ve been forgetting to use my bonnet lately but I’m gonna try to remember more from now on, I’ve heard satin pillow cases are good but don’t know where to get. ",

      "content": "Please help! Currently dealing with a massive flare up after having used retinol every night, thinking my skin would be able to handle it as I was using the Kiehl’s retinol daily micro-dose and my skin was fine with actives previously. Admittedly, I think the product was also out of date as my partner first received it over a year ago, used it a couple times, and never used it again so I snatched it up 2.5 months ago and have stupidly been using it every night until about 1.5 weeks ago when my skin had this major outbreak (pictured) and is still like this now. Until then, I’d just thought I was purging as I was getting the odd cystic spot. \n\nI also don’t know if the acne is just from damaged skin barrier etc or if it may also be bacterial/fungal. I had really bad acne when I was younger and the only thing that got rid of it was accutane so I’m really hoping it isn’t one of them times again. My diet also hasn’t been the best coming into December however I wouldn’t say it’s that wildly different to normal.\n\nMy skin is currently super sensitive, tight and also very itchy around where I’m getting the white head spots and also all over my forehead.\n\nTrying to keep it super super simple if I have indeed damaged my skin barrier and want to get it back to normal asap. Also, if you think it looks like it may be another type of acne from your own experience etc, please do let me know! \n\n**Current routine:** \n*AM:*\n- gentle rinse with warm water \n- Cerave moisturising lotion (blue) \nI know I really should be adding spf but I’m now scared to try incase it makes my acne worse! \n\nI also take the Aegles Clear Skin supplement on a morning which was highly recommended online. I started taking it after the big breakout first appeared as I had initially thought it may be hormonal/gut-related and figured it can’t hurt to keep taking?\n\n*PM:* \n- Garnier micellar water with oil\n- Cerave moisturising lotion (blue) \n\n",

      "content": "I’m so disappointed — I recently splurged on a few skincare products and seem to be having a reaction after just a few nights of use.\n\nFor context: I’m 34 and starting to notice some wrinkles/loose skin under my eyes. I’m also fairly sensitive, rosacea-prone, and still deal with acne. I’d *love* to improve pore size and texture too.\n\n**My routine:**\n\n**AM**\n\n* La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser\n* Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant\n* iS Clinical Pro-Heal Serum Advance+ (almost empty — planning to switch to SkinCeuticals Vitamin C)\n* La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer UV SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n* La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser\n* Estée Lauder nighttime products\n\nI purchased this Estée Lauder set:  \n[https://m.esteelauder.com/product/707/137616/product-catalog/sets-gifts/skincare-sets-gifts/nighttime-experts-skincare-gift-set/repair-bounce-brighten](https://m.esteelauder.com/product/707/137616/product-catalog/sets-gifts/skincare-sets-gifts/nighttime-experts-skincare-gift-set/repair-bounce-brighten)\n\n…but it’s not going well. I think I’m reacting to something in the set.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n  \n**First few nights:** Totally fine.  \n**Yesterday morning:** Woke up with puffy under eyes and deeper-than-usual creases. Nothing wildly noticeable to others, but very noticeable to me.  \n**Last night:** I skipped the eye cream and used just the serum + night cream. My under eyes started lightly burning and feeling dry, so I added the eye cream for moisture.  \n**This morning:** Woke up puffy again — slightly worse — and still stingy.\n\nI’ve used Advanced Night Repair off and on before with no issues, and I use Estée Lauder Double Wear foundation without problems, so I’m thinking the Revitalizing Supreme+ Night cream might be the culprit (maybe fragrance?).\n\nI’m sad because I really wanted these to work, but I'm still hoping to build a really good nighttime routine that’s safe for sensitive, rosacea-prone, acne-prone skin and helps with fine lines, texture, and hydration.\n\nAny recommendations for gentler nighttime products or routines that won’t cause reactions?",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "I have recently started a new Korean skincare routine care routine for my face and I have got a decent amount of Korean products the eye cream I think is the only non Korean skin care product. I was told that I should use Retinol instead of the stridex pads as they seem to also dry out my skin. The stridex and the eye Caffeine Cream are the only products that aren’t Korean skin care products. My question is do I need retinol added to my skincare needs ?? I heard it could cause skin cancer and be rougher on sensitive skin as I have sensitive skin. And I’ve also heard to use bakuchiol serum that is a natural version of retinol do I even need that?? Or am I good with what I have now?? Also I’ve been using the Yuka App and reviews to help me research ingredients and reviews with skin care products. Which I’ve also heard that the Yuka App isn’t completely accurate. I attached my skin care routine products that I will be using as a picture added to this post and the Madagascar Centella Ampoule that I just got today.",
