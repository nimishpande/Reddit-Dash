      "content": "Hey reddit! Looking for some advice on this crazy curl pattern change. Over the last two years, my curl pattern has gone from the beautiful texture you see on the first slide to the flat, sad pattern in the second, and I’m so lost trying to figure out why. I didn’t change my routine until after the change had occurred, stayed with the same amazing curly hair stylist for years, and didn’t change locations (i.e. water stayed the same). \n\nHere’s the routine I was using 2-3x per week:\n- Oribe hair alchemy shampoo (2 washes) + conditioner\n- Oribe leave-in conditioner\n- Oribe curl gloss\n- Oribe curl mousse\n- Scrunched dry with a microfiber towel, then diffused on low heat. Finished with kerastase oil and oribe anti-humidity spray. \n\nAfter I really started to get frustrated with the change, I tried:\n- Two different heat protectants for over a year, thinking maybe heat damage was the culprit\n- AG Care Renew Clarifying shampoo once per week, thinking buildup may be contributing\n- Innersense True Enlightenment scalp scrub once per month \nThese changes did not make a difference :(\n\nI have consistently used a silk pillowcase and silk bonnet to sleep, both before and after the change. \n\nI fear that, after doing some research, the culprit may be hormonal changes associated with a change in my birth control, or maybe this is just aging-associated change that I can’t control. But, before I jump to talking with my doctor about making major medical changes, does anyone have any other ideas I can try? \n\nTIA for your help and for reading, I miss my curls and really appreciate your help getting them back!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I put on my bonnet while a tad bit damp. \n\nI tend to struggle with frizziness. Especially in the back of my hair. More in a specific spot it’s frizzy and doesn’t like to curl up like the rest.

At that point, it does give more “order” to my hair, but at the expense of the “fluffy” look.\n\nThe pics shown have been taken on different days throughout the last week to show how much my hair’s appearance can vary.

      "content": "Hi, guys. After nineteen years, my hair curled/got wavy when I trimmed the dead ends-- This was early october. With it now being January and my hair not having reverted, I figured I was stuck. I used to hair straighter/maybe a bit wavy hair, amd no one else living in my family had this hair(My maternal aunt did, but she passed as a teenager, unfortunately, long before I was born) and no one knows how to care for it. I am doing my best after neglecting my new curls.\n\nI have not acquired a 'Routine' yet, as I have not proper done research and have not done been very responsible. I know I have damaged by hair. I use a regular hair brush, but my mom suggested using a wide comb(she is slowly doing research with me) so I will be picking one up. My hair is also very, very thick; very long. My hair also likes to frizz. It also does not like to sit in generic hair ties very well. It was always a nightmare, now it's worse.\n\n I do not have a refresh routine, I air dry my hair, I do not style with any products, and I do not \"protect my hair while I sleep\". I also do not dye, bleach, straighten or curl my hair. I do not part my hair. These are all things I really have to do some research into and care for. It's all very... overwhelming, almost.\n\nI use OGX for Shampoo and I alternate between Bond Repair Repair &amp; Protect, and their Clarifying Strength+ Refresh and Clarify; I am a woman, and I have cycle, during that cycle I use both some days because my hair gets really greasy and oily[very ucky]. I don't use too much conditioner, but the brand is also OGX and it's something like Repair &amp; strengthen. OGX cleans my hair best. I seldom use conditioner, as everything I've tried makes me hair frizz worse. Which sucks big time.\n\nI picked up Shea Moisture-- Kalhari Melon Oil-- Curl Stretch Refersher spray on an impulse at Walmart. Not smart, I know, but I decided earlier that day that I wasn't going to fight my curls/wavy-curls--?-- any longer and that I was going to embrace them. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips? Brand recommendations? Hair care? Anything at all? I'll gladly take any advice or suggestions you have.",

      "content": "Hello! \n\nI’m a woman in my early 20s! As a teenager in high school, I NEVER had any skin issues. It felt like I was blessed with perfect skin. However, I got a terrible rash on my forehead a few years ago that ruined everything! \n\nA dermatologist had prescribed me a rash cream that fixed it but it left me with a permanent oily forehead. I’ve left it for years thinking it would naturally go away but it’s messed with my bangs too since my forehead is SO oily that even touching my bangs or moving them would immediately cause them to become oily as well. It also has caused some tiny bumps on my head too!\n\nI’ve researched it and as a broke BROKE broke college student who can barely afford anything, I’m assuming I need toner and some exfoliation product (I’m so sorry I’m a newbie to skincare)?? \n\nI have a 5 in 1 facial serum from Self Care Canada and I’m planning to buy a St Ives Apricot Scrub (a cheap exfoliant for oily skin apparently) and a green Nivea Purifying Toner for Combination &amp; Oily Skin. \n\nAm I making the right choice? I’ve looked for the cheapest products, I know St Ives ISNT really good from what I hear and the ingredients don’t look too good but I need a solution that works until I can afford a better skincare routine. I just need something that’ll help my forehead and as long as these products do the job, it’s fine! \n\nAlso!! What order do I do this stuff in? I know I have to cleanse first, then I put on the scrub?? Then I cleanse again? Which I should do once a week apparently? Then I dry my face and apply toner and then I apply a serum? Is this right? \n\nI’m so thankful for any help and advice I can get, thank you all in advance! ",

Shampoo- Loreal Clarifying(Hard-water residue) one once every couple weeks and Loreal Hyaluron(Purple one) on the regular\n\n3. The pictures above I used an Egg, yogurt and honey mask(pre shampoo) and Dove Bond Repair mask(after shampooing)\n\n4. Redken Frizz Dismiss- leave in conditioner\n\n5. Kirsten Ess Volumizing mousse\n\n6. Dippity-do girls with curls gel and then brush with Bounce curl brush(the one with edges for defined curls)\n\n7. I usually air dry them and sleep with a satin bonnet and use any oil/serum to break the cast which is not a lot\n\nSomehow my hair feels more dry when I follow a curly hair routine compared to when I let my hair dry on its own. I am not even sure if the products I'm using are meant for my hair type. I also wanted suggestions on hair serum/oil after styling as I am running out of my current one(John Frieda frizz red bottle). I'm open to any suggestions or feedback.",
