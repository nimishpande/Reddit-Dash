      "content": "I feel like my whole life, curly hair isn't something that society deems professional or beautiful.\n\nGrowing up, my mum and other older adults in my life were constantly telling me to straighten my hair. Or like\"do you even brush your hair???\" Giving me endless products that stop frizz. Telling me how much nicer I looked when I straightened my hair. This still happens today.\n\nIt feels like looking after my curly hair takes so much effort just to make it even look presentable. A straight-haired goddess just walks out of bed with effortless-looking, shiny, smooth long locks. \n\nIt will take me half an hour to wash using my routine.  Pre-shampoo (Garnier Fructis Curls Method Shampoo), double shampoo. Conditioner (Natural Look curls boost). Leave-in Conditioner (Garnier Fructis, 3-in-1 Hair Mask). Mouse (SHEA MOISTURE Coconut and Hibiscus), then gel, scrunching and praying hands, and then diffusing (plus a few hours to dry since my hair is so thick). By the time it's all done, it's the evening, and it looks nice for a few hours. I use a stain pillow, but the next day it's all crumpled and sad looking, so it's like all the effort for nothing.\n\nI feel so self-conscious going out with my natural curls. I feel like people look at me as if I do not look after myself when my hair is naturally curly. For events, there is always pressure to straighten or heat-curl my hair.\n\nI do get comments from people who really like my natural curls, but I feel like the majority of people aren't impressed.\n\nJust wondering if it gets easier, and if you've found you sort of grown into your curls more. Thank you.",

Need help choosing:\n\t1.\tA good anti-dandruff shampoo + conditioner (for dryness + hair fall)\n\t2.\tA body wash for back acne + what to apply after bath\n\t3.\tA gentle face wash + moisturizer for oily/acne-prone skin\nAlso want tips on finding my skin type, reliable brands, and routine structure.\n\nAny recommendations or routines that worked for you guys would mean a lot 🙏\n\nAlso I think this post can be handy and of good help to not only me but also many other folks like me so please give your valuable contribution. \n\nThanks in advance!",

She even listed all the products so I could get them and recommend substitutes. So here is my current routine, the same routine she gave me to get these curls. 1)Wash: I use shea moisture shampoo and conditioner with warm but not hot water. 2) Style: I go section by section with a leave in, (curls smiths), a gel (innersence) and the wet brush. I can’t describe the motion I do with the brush but it s like brushing and twisting it at the same time. 3) Dry: She used a salon grade dryer but recommended I use a diffuser but not touch my hair with it just hover around it until it’s completely dry. 4)Serum: I break the gel cast with innersence serum. She was very specific about using a serum not an oil. I do all of this but my curls never come out like hers. Am I missing a step? Mine come out very frizzy no solid or strong curls. ",

      "content": "Hey everyone 👋\n\n26M here. I recently saw my dermatologist and they suggested trying Skinoren 20% (Azelaic Acid) for my mild acne and post-inflammatory erythema (PIE).\n\nA bit of background:\n\n\t•\tI’ve never had acne before until recently — everything started after a really stressful time and almost no sleep for a few days.\n\n\t•\tSince then, I’ve been dealing with small whiteheads and pustules, mostly on my cheeks and around my nose.\n\n\t•\tMy skin is also quite sensitive because I probably damaged my barrier when I tried too many actives at once (vitamin C, BHA, niacinamide, etc.).\n\n\t•\tI stopped all that and switched to a very gentle routine: CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser, CeraVe Moisturizer, and sometimes a hydrating toner.\n\nMy dermatologist said Azelaic Acid might help calm inflammation, even out my skin tone, and reduce new breakouts — but to start with once a day right away.\n\n👉 Has anyone here used Skinoren 20% for mild acne and PIE, especially on sensitive skin?\n\n\t•\tHow long did it take before you results?\n\n\t•\tDid you go through a purge or initial irritation?\n\n\t•\tAny tips on how to layer it with moisturizer (before or after)?\n\nI’m a bit nervous to start because my skin finally feels calmer, but I still get small recurring pustules at the same spots.\n\nWould love to hear your experiences or advice 🙏\n",

I took screenshots because the group doesn’t allow video posts. In the ad, the girl applies the product on one side of her face and says there’s no filter, that the brightness is all real.

I’m a 17-year-old guy and I have thin, light brown / blondish hair that’s not fully straight but not really wavy either — something in between.\n\nHere’s my issue: in summer, my hair looks *so much better* — soft, voluminous, and healthy. But every winter, it becomes extremely dry and my scalp gets flaky and tight, especially after showers. It gets even worse whenever I try to **scrub** my scalp; it starts flaking more and just looks awful afterward.\n\nI went to a doctor last year and he said I have mild eczema / dry scalp. He prescribed **Ketoral** shampoo, which I use up to 3 times a week. It helps with the scalp part but my hair still feels super dry and flat compared to summer.\n\nI also tried **sea salt spray** for volume — it worked volume-wise, but made my dryness way worse. What I’m looking for now is something that can help me get:\n\n* Moisturized, non-dry hair\n* Natural volume and maybe some light waves\n* A healthy, “summer” look again\n\nThere’s so much mixed info online about oils, conditioners, masks, and leave-ins, and I don’t want to make it worse.\n\nWhat products or routines would you recommend for someone like me? (thin, semi-wavy, light hair + mild eczema scalp + winter dryness that gets worse when scrubbing)\n\nThanks a lot if you read this far 🙏 any tips are really appreciated!(first 2 pics are winter hair, last 3 summer)",

They've gradually worsened over the years and never seem to fade, which makes me suspect there's a genetic component involved. Lately, it's been taking a real toll on my self-confidence, and I'm actively looking for ways to reduce or eliminate them.\nI've done some scattered research and recently came across the Botanique Paris red light therapy mask. I'm considering giving it a try, but before I invest, I’d love to hear from anyone who’s used it. Have you seen genuine results, or was it more hype than help? Also, if anyone has found other effective treatments for stubborn dark circles, I’d be incredibly grateful for your recommendations.",

      "content": "i was on accutane for a few months and stopped treatment 2.5 years ago but my skin is still severely dehydrated/dry and flaky and i don't know what to do about it. while i was still getting checkups at my dermatologists, he recommended me a few moisturizers but none of them helped and i ended up spending probably over a 100 bucks for products that didn't work. \n\nmy routine is very simple - i just use a gentle dove soap daily (in the morning) and exfoliate when i deem necessary, and apply moisturizer twice a day. right now i'm using some nameless brand's one with glycerin and it's enough to keep my skin from drying out during the day but it doesn't \"fix\" it at all. my skin is only okay when i have the cream on.\n\nwhat kind of moisturizer would you recommend i look for and what ingredients? i was checking out some recently, and there were a bunch for different purposes - repair, regeneration, hydration, and so on - but idk which one would help the most. as i said my skin is really dry when i don't have any moisturizer on, it gets flakey when i move my face and it feels really tight too - basically has very little elasticity.

I didn't visit any dermatologist for this; I knew what they would prescribe me and the expensive products. Being a teenager, not only do I not earn much (and that too is sometimes I do, sometimes I don't), but also I didn't want my parents to spend a luxury for my skincare. So I did my research, or whatever you'd like to call it, and started using my savings to purchase all these products one by one from a generic pharmacy. \n\n**Slide 1: Prior to May 17, 2025**  \nAM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra\n\n**Slide 2: Prior to August 26, 2025, till Sept 2, 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: AcMist  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nActive: Adapalene 0.1%\n\n**Slide 3: From Sep 3 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC (Using this as a moisturiser base provides better sun protection.)  \nActive: Azelskin - Azelaic Acid 10%  \nSunscreen: FixDerma Shadow SPF 30 (cheap and gets the job done for me)\n\nIn-between AM/PM (occasionally only if I am at home):  \nCleanser: Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC  \nActive: HQ 4%\n\nElse not at home:  \nSunscreen reapplication\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Minimalist B5 10% Moisturiser  \nActive: Melapik (0.0125% tretinoin, 2% HQ, 1% allantoin) **// Not a steroid cream**\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\nYes, I am aware of the ochronosis risk using HQ. But cycling it, 2 months use (alternative) and then stopping for a few weeks and then starting again will keep the melanocytes sensitive. So I will not encounter any of it, as most side effects happen due to long-term abuse without any protection and carelessness, and I am not at all careless.\n\nAll of the supplements I take are within the safe limits; I will mention the dosage and the frequency in the comments.\n\nI am looking forward to starting microdose isotretinoin. \\~7 mg / day.  \nEven weeks: 20 mg Thrice  \nOdd weeks: 20 mg twice\n\nAvg weekly intake: 50 mg\n\nWill be monitoring my lipid and liver panels every 3-4 months and ensuring they are within the ideal range.\n\nAny review and insights would be helpful.\n\nThank You",

After having kids my hair seems to have gone back to curly mode, but I don’t know how to truly bring out my hair’s natural curls. I did the whole “scrunching with gel” trend in the 2000s because that was the only way to get it curly then. I see the potential, but I have no idea what to do to elevate what my hair already wants to do lol\n\nThis is my hair now when it dries naturally. I showered last night and it air dried over a towel. I lift my hair up over the pillow/towel so it’s not under my head while I sleep. My hair is also layered. \n\nMy normal routine is:\nDove Shampoo with Dove conditioner. \nAn occasional hair mask for dry hair-just the ends (it’s been dyed a lot and the ends are the last of what’s left of my last dye job)\nEvery other evening I do overnight leave in conditioner (just the ends)\nIn the morning when I want it to curl a little more, I spray in leave in conditioner (just the ends) because when it gets wet it curls.\n\nHelp! ❤️\n\n",

Tresemme mousse and scrunch \n\n3-5 pics: \n1. Clarifying shampoo and deep conditioner, OGX heat protection/bond repair leave  in  \n2. Same mousse but added NYM gel and finger coiled/diffused \n\n-&gt; I always sleep with a bonnet/silk pillow case and wash like 2-3 times a week (when needed, really. Not a strict schedule.) \n\nLOVE the curl shape in the updated one, and the last/hold was fab. \n\nTwo questions:\n1. I feel like the roots are flat? Is that normal? Should I have diffused upside down? I was afraid to mess with the clumps too much after finger coiling. \n2. I think I used too much gel - my hair felt CHUNKY after it dried. Which maybe is a good thing? I could super duper feel the product in it.  (I ordered the curlsmith shower styler to replace the NYM gel from another subreddits recs!)\n\n(I swear these were taken 2 days apart - the lighting is just different. No hairs were dyed in the process! I have super fine hair at high density so products can really impact my color/shine. Also the second one was taken in my offices’ poopoo lighting bathroom.) ",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
