I remember reading something someone posted here that hit close to home \"People will excuse severe hair loss as long as their hairline is in tact\". Something I fell victim to. As insane as it might be to believe, I honestly didn't realize I was going bald until more than half my hair was already gone. So it was quite alarming the moment it clicked. I went to bed a guy with a full head of hair and woke up someone on life support. It's truly amazing what someome will ignore until things become way too obvious.\n\nI definitely regrew some hair but I think the most work done was from my hairs thickening up.

I’ve struggled with skin picking my whole life (getting better though!) and made it a long time without getting serious scarring, until this year when the texture of my skin got horrible, and I started getting scars even from pimples I let run their course without touching at all.\n\nSo I’ve never had big blackheads before, especially not on my face, and would like advice on how to get rid of this without leaving permanent damage. The blackhead has been here for about a month and it seems to be loosening up, but I’m worried that even if it comes out naturally it will leave a crater :( I’m not great at routine but I currently wash my face with Target’s Oil Free Acne Wash with Salicylic Acid 1-2x a day, and I’ve started applying Clean &amp; Clear spot treatment as well. I moisturize cautiously as I have yet to find something that doesn’t make me break out.\n\nAny advice about my skin in general would be helpful too, as I know I probably need a better routine. The texture, scarring, and CONSTANT irritation has been awful. Planning on seeing a dermatologist next month. Thanks everyone &lt;3",

At first everything was great — my pores and blackheads disappeared, I had some small breakouts but nothing major, and after that my skin looked amazing. But around July things started to get worse again: lots of texture, a lot of inflammation, and honestly my skin now looks even worse than before.\n\nAccording to my dermatologist, my treatment could have ended in July since I barely had any acne left on my face (most of it was on my body). So we began tapering down the dose: first three times a week, then once a week. But that’s when things really got worse. I went back to her, and she said she’s not entirely sure what it could be — it seems like follicular acne, not fungal, because there’s no flaking or signs of a compromised skin barrier. Her advice was to go back on daily Accutane and wait to see how things progress.\n\nShe even told me to buy two more boxes for the next two months. In total i have 2 months and 15 days of medication left. Do you think this will eventually resolve? I’ve already tried ceramides (thinking it was barrier related), azelaic acid to reduce redness, light moisturizers, heavy repairing moisturizers… but nothing seems to help.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar?\n",

I'm particularly self-conscious about the space between my eyebrows (see slide 2). I've plucked hairs there for the last 10 years because I get a pretty noticeable unibrow if I don't. But it seems to have caused a lot of skin damage. Nobody has said anything to me, but I just assume they're being nice. I also have pretty visible forehead wrinkles.\n\nI've always had acne and use a facial gel which works pretty well. Unfortunately I still get scars and hyperpigmentation. I've never really used sunscreen very much, and I don't have the best diet. I'm thinking that fixing these two things will help me improve. Anything else you suggest?",

My scalp feels terrible and there is burning/itching/crawling sensation on my scalp. Also Idk how to explain this but my scalp feels a lot more sensitive or tender(?) and my shedding has increased much more (maybe losing 150-200 hairs per day). I'm losing both thin miniaturized AND THICK TERMINAL HAIRS (both short &amp; long lengths). I'm also losing hair from every part of the scalp including sides and nape area.\n\nI've always had this itchiness on my scalp since my hairloss began 4 yrs ago. I've tried 2% keto shampoo (nizoral), selsun blue, ciclopirox shampoo but nothing worked for me in this case. The itchiness gets far more devastating when I'm doing physical activities (running,sports etc) or wearing a hat &amp; maybe sweating. Then it almost feels like pins and needles like sensation all over the scalp.\n\nHow do i fix this? Or do I have to suffer like this for the rest of my life? It's becoming unbearable at this point and all the dermatologists I went too prescribed me the same nizoral &amp; nothing else. Any response helping me in this matter is highly appreciated. ",

I have somewhat frizzy red hair but I really don’t want to deal with it looking crazy worst case I’ll grab a wig if needed but sort of hate wigs and we may have one at work I can use from the Photo Booth.
