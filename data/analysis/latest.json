My hair feels like it almost randomizes, some days like the 1st photo, some like tbe 2nd, sometimes straighter, sometimes curlier, but usually between the 1st and 2nd photo. 3rd 4th pics are my hair rn after a brush with today being hair wash day\n\nI know I have curls, I think maybe 2b? Not totally sure though. I've heard i may need a clarifying shampoo, but im very uneducated about properly taking care of my curls, though I have tried with experimenting. Ive thought about olaplex, but ive seen a ton of reviews its absolutely ruined people's hair texture \n\nmy routine:\n\n\\- hair wash every other day \n\n\\- shampoo: Pantene Pro V daily moisture renewal \n\n\\- conditioner: Pantene Pro V daily moisture renewal \n\n\\- second conditioner: Hask organic oil repairing conditioner\n\n\\- brush out and let air dry, scrunch method\n\n\\- very recently ive been using argan magic intensive hair oil about once a week but havent noticed a substantial difference \n\n\\- my hair becomes incredibly frizzy and loses curl texture after brushing when its dry, but curls up immediately after a shower\n\nI feel kind of at a loss on what my hair needs. I see all this stuff about proteins and other elements, and I need to do more research, but im not sure where to look or even what my hair type actually is. \n\ncurious if anyone else would reccomend a clarifying shampoo, as im sure I have decent build up potentially. any advice would be great! tysm!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

My current under eye situation is super bad and I’ve been told my dermatologists that there is a large genetic component to this. This is very disheartening to hear especially because I’ve been working hard to make them brighter and plumper. I’ve been combining and alternating a routine that uses collagen serum (from Medicube), Vitamin C brightening under eye cream (Oli Henriksen) and a Hyaluronic under eye serum. I’ve been using these products consistently for 3-4 months. Will adding caffeine under-eye patches do anything or just increase the pile of useless product on my shelf. I’m sure these products are doing something for me and probably preventing my under-eyes from getting even worse, but I don’t know what to do to make them better.\n\nI’m attaching pics of my under-eyes for reference (They look slightly darker in real life). Please let me know if there’s any alternative. If there’s none, what should I start with first: Laser or Filler? What are the risks and what kind of treatment should I look into?

I was able to catch mine early and got decent results with finasteride, but my mom’s hair is thinning badly, similar to my grandmother’s. I understand that hair loss in women can be more complicated.\n\nLately, this has been affecting her emotionally a lot. She’s become afraid to even take a shower because of how much hair she sees falling out, and sometimes she cries because of it. Seeing her go through this honestly breaks my heart.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for what I could help her use? Would minoxidil or spironolactone be appropriate? Can they be used together? Or is there anything else she could try?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",

Every time I do it, \\*this\\* happens. When I let it air dry? It’s absolutely fine. (Just, the ends get very frizzy. I have dry hair, I think, which is why I prefer blow drying to get that sleeker finish.) I should also note that my stylist and I use the same products, and I’ve been using them for over a year now. This greasy doll hair has only started within the past \\~6 months though. \n\nThe only thing I can do to hide it is spray with some dry shampoo and tease it a bit. But with my hair stylist, she just blow drys it, and it’s sleek, shiny, non-greasy, and perfect as hell. (Again—we use the same products.)\n\nHOWEVER! \n\n\\~6 months ago I started to use the Revlon blow dry brush. Now I’ll admit right now that I used that thing WRONG. I didn’t know it was more of a styling tool rather than an actual blow dryer (which I treated it as one.) I would use it on wet / damp hair and the end result would be the greasy doll hair. But I stopped right away—maybe after 3 uses of the brush. The thing is, that was months ago, and this doll hair has still stuck every time I blow dry. \n\nIs my hair just royally damaged? What do I do?",

There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine?

With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

I’m looking for help with my wavy hair because I feel a bit stuck and confused 🥲\n\nMy main issues:\n\nMy hair gets very producty and heavy really fast\n\nThe waves/curls look forced rather than natural\n\nIt’s curly/wavy underneath and at the nape, but almost completely straight on top\n\nIt looks especially bad at the roots\n\nLots of frizz and dryness\n\nMy waves don’t last, and I struggle with how to sleep/preserve them\n\nHair type/details:\n\nFine strands, medium density\n\nVery easily weighed down\n\nAround 2B underneath and 2A on top\n\nRoutine and what I have tried:\n\n1. Shampoo / Conditioner:\n\nI use a regular (non-clarifying) shampoo and a hair mask in the shower. No co-wash.\n\n2. Styling products &amp; application:\n\nTried Curl Cream (Curly Love) + Gel (Curly Love): applied all over soaking-wet hair before scrunching. Result: very weighed down, hard to control, took a lot of effort, and the hold didn’t last.\n\nTried Mousse (Umberto Giannini) only: applied all over wet hair before scrunching. Result: better wave shape, but hair looked very dry, messy, and chaotic.\n\nAfter applying products, I always scrunch and then scrunch again with a T-shirt to remove excess water.\n\n3. Drying method:\n\nI diffuse my hair until it’s almost dry. After that, I tie it into a loose bun with a scrunchie.\n\n4. Other helpful info:\n\nI sleep with a silk bonnet every night, but I still wake up with crunchy, heavy, messy hair.\n\nMy hair looks almost curly in the shower, but throughout the day it loses definition and turns into a tangled mess — it’s definitely wavy though, I promise 😅\n\nWhat I’m looking for help with:\n\nLightweight product recommendations (especially for fine hair)\n\nHow to reduce frizz without weighing hair down\n\nHow to avoid that “forced curl” look, especially at the roots\n\nThe best way to sleep/preserve waves so they last more than one day\n\nHow to refresh or style without brushing (brushing ruins everything 😅)\n\nAny tips, routines, techniques, or product recs would be hugely appreciated.\n\nThank you so much in advance and sorry for the long and annoying text wall. My mother was never around to help me learn this🤍",

I’ve been consistently using it and noticed I haven’t really had any breakouts except around my period. I want to get rid of the dots on my nose and improve brightness, and my upper lip always has dark spots (I use facial razors on my moustache and I think it makes me get pimples?? I always have dark spots there it’s so annoying). I’ve done research into the ordinary products and what not but I’m just scared to add anything new? I tried the Paula’s choice BA thing a few times and it definitely made me breakout and I was too scared to let my skin purge or whatever. I generally have clear skin but it looks so dead and I look so tired all the time. I have dry skin sometimes oily on forehead only. Thanks for any advice!!",

I feel like this goes beyond just having run-of-the-mill oily/acne prone skin. This is what happens no matter what my skincare routine has been for the last 17 years (started getting acne at 10)\n\nI feel like I’ve tried it all, most recently Differin, which just made my cystic/nodular jawline acne so much worse even after 5 months. My current routine is so simple because I’m trying to recover my skin from the Differin. Idk if I’m looking for advice, or just to vent, or what but aaaaaaahhhhh!!! ",

It's like the first photo, I'd say it resembles a poodle, that's how it usually looks for me, but my issue was my hair still felt rough. \n\nI jumped back in the shower for a second time, this time using shampoo to get rid of everything in it, then using my conditioner. Yesterday, my had good volume, it was 'organized' in flow (best way I could put it), overall it looked great, I'd say it might be the best I've seen it in a while, I was impressed because I didn't think my hair could look that good, but I have bad memory, so there's that, lol.\n\nI took my shower last night, doing my usual, now it's back to being poodle form. I don't understand what happened with my hair that made it look like yesterday. I don't know anything really about hair and wanted advice on this, I was kinda wondering if I could just make it better or keep it how it was yesterday.\n\nRoutine:\nAussie mircale curls conditioner.\nAussie mircale curls shampoo.\nAussie moisturizer.\nAussie leave in conditioner.\n\nI take a shower everyday, I use shampoo once or twice a week depending on how my hair feels on certain days, no specific time I do it, then I take turns using moisturizer and leave in everyday. One day moisturizer, next day leave in, and I air day. I don't use anything special like a bonnet, special pillowcase, or diffuser.\n\nThe first photo is today, the second was yesterday, and the third was five to six days ago.
