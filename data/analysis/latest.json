Also leaving a bit of conditioner in the hair is an amazing tip. Thank god for this sub. No plopping this time either, as it just doesn't work for short hair I think. Or maybe I need to try it with better scrunching out, idk. But im happy!\n\nRoutine: Dove shampoo + Balea Traum Locken from DM + Locken curl cream. I didn't co-wash. ",

      "content": "I’m focusing on getting my curls healthy and bouncy after years of using damaging h.eat and heavy protein products, I’m finally finding what works for my hair type. \n\nIn the past I’ve been using h.eat on it ever since I was a kid to go to church or parties, without any protection oil ( the 90s), just damping h.eat from the h0t cur/ing ir0n. I got my first chemica/ re/axer at 12, which burned my scalp and caused a painful swirl of scabs and hair which was too painful to pull or comb. The things I’v done with my hair through the decades… But today a new day, a healthy way forward!\n\nIn 2024, I stopped using high h.eat, completely avoiding f/at ir0ns, and also quit co/oring my hair. At first, it made my hair look kinda worse, but thanks to these Reddit subs like this I think I’ve figured out part of the problem and the solution. Turns out I was overloading my curls with protein, and that just doesn’t work for my hair type anymore. Still figuring it all out, but I feel like I’m finally on the right track.\n\nWhen I used to si/k press my hair, I think it needed that superficial glow to look healthy, but wasn't, so I ended up using heavy coatings and lots of protein-based products. Now that I’ve stopped and don’t damp it in or anythin, the products just seem to sit on top of my hair instead of absorbing. I don’t really know the science behind it, but that’s what it feels like and look like.\n\nSo after a big clarifying wash this summer and switched products to light or none protein based product. I started washing with apple cider vinegar, only 1 time, I used way too much, because my hair looked scary dry. But I kept on using the new products and it’s already improved in just a couple of months and it feels like it is getting better with every wash.\n\nThe photos serie starts with my Day 7 hair  from last week, I was out and about, windy, traveling etc.\nSo when I got home I washed my hair when and kept my conditioner in overnight, too tired to style it. \n\nI documented the process, with a before &amp; after.\n\nI’m very much open to tips and advices!\n\n\n\n\n*Hair Routine + products in the photos \n\nProducts in order of use\n\nOnce a month Clarifying:\nGiovanni 50:50 Balanced hydrating clarifying shampoo.\nCurlsmith Mask Double Cream Deep quencher.\nRegular washing: 1 or 2 times a week\nKerastase Shampoo Curl Manifesto.\nKerastase Conditioner Curl Manifesto.\n\nStyling:\nGiovanni Curl defining Leave-in Curl Habit.\nGiovanni Curl shaping Gel Curl Habit.\nCurlsmith Frizz Rescue Curl Retainer.\nUmberto Giannini Boost Mousse Rosemary.\nMixed Chicks H.eat and Humidity protection serum.\n\nTools:\n-The Bounce curl brush  \n-Blow dryer diffuser with low h.eat and cold settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I just want to help it absorb the topical better. \n\nWhat’s your thoughts on this approach as well as cleaning ? \n\nIf I’m reusing it, I thought I would just dip it into the isopropyl alcohol 70% but I wasn’t sure if I should rinse it with water afterwards ?

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Are these bumps actually **milia**, or could they be closed comedones?\n2. Is it safe to use **retinol** around the under-eye/cheekbone area to help with these?\n3. Should I stop using tea tree toner (is it too drying or irritating for this area)?\n4. Do I need BHA exfoliation instead?\n5. At what point should I visit a dermatologist for extraction?\n\nAny advice or product recommendations (especially India-available brands) would be really helpful.\n\nThanks in advance",

I have pretty oily skin so I don’t even moisturise since that always seems to mess it up even more. I have an anti acne cleanser which I use in the morning and before going to bed. I’ve received some ointments for it but nothing helped (it actually got worse). I am starting to think if it’s fungal maybe? \n\nWhile looking online I found that salicylic acid exfoliating products might be a good fit for my issue but I would like to ask more experienced people like you all in this subreddit.\n\nWhat do you think?

An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community.
