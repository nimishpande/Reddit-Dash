It brought a lot of the spring factor back and fixed the wonky shape that was happening too. So yeah, whether you cut it yourself or get someone else to do it- let go of those dead ends. \n\nRoutine (pic 2):\nWash with Innersense clarity hairbath and hydrating cream conditioner.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I feel like the reason why is my routine, which goes like this: As I Am rosemary shampoo, and run it through my hair loosely and scrub scalp, As I am rosemary conditioner, and loosely let it through my hair, and then wash through and air dry, and i think this loose washing is leading to the mildew, but if i rake my hands through my hair, it makes my hair frizzy and pulls apart the curls. Does anyone know what I’m doing wrong or if my hair is healthy/how i can treat it better?

I had chemical straightening before but it just made my hair frizz out. \n\nMy routine is hair mask (usually Garnier papaya hair food or Aussie curls)\nShampoo with noughty shampoo and a silicone scalp scrubber thing. Noughty conditioner too. \nRinse that out then put leave in conditioner in. Right now im using one called bond plex.\nNoughty curl cream, UG hair gel. Wait until its hard, diffuse until it feels like hair again then put hair serum on it. I like the grapeseed one from the body shop as others felt too heavy.

I’m going to be living in Korea for a year next year and as you all know the skin treatments there are next level and way cheaper than in the West! I want to do some more intensive treatments as well as some maintenance treatments while i’m there in order to address some issues I have with my skin. I’m 22yo if it helps. I’ve thought about rejuran and potenza to address hyperpigmentation and indents from acne but not sure if they’re the best to address these issues. \n\nConcerns:\n- hyperpigmentation (PIH/PIE) from acne and sun freckles (I wear sunscreen daily and reapply especially during summers but some sun freckles have been here since I was young and I seem to have developed more in the recent years… not sure why.)\n- skin indents from acne \n(i have some indentation in my skin from acne scars? but they’re not too deep like how it can be with some extreme acne scars but I’d like to reduce the appearance of the indents if possible as some of them it makes the spot look dark like freckles or acne hyperpigmentation)\n- redness \n(i get red in some spots contributed by PIE i believe. i also have some broken capillaries around my nose which make it always red)\n- clogged pores \n(my breakouts now always start off with a closed comedone before erupting into a red fat pimple. I do use AHAs and BHAs throughout the week but I can’t seem to avoid the comedones)\n\nThanks for the read and hopefully reply :)\n\n \n",
