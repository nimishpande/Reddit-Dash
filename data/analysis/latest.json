      "content": "9-11 are what I wanted, from when I last had short hair.\n\n1-10 are from today after styling, and yesterday fresh from the salon.\n\nRoutine:\n\nShampoo and condition with herbal essence grapefruit shampoo and chamomile conditioner\n\nAdd pea sized amount of kinky curly knot today leave in\n\nGlaze and scrunch a few big globs of aussie instant freeze gel\n\nScrunch excess water with microfiber towel, then diffuse on medium heat high speed all around head, combo of hover and pixie diffusing, then scrunch. \n\nI don’t regret cutting my hair short. I like having short hair. And it does feel a lot healthier and thicker. All I can hope is that in a month or two it will grow out nicer. \n\nBut this is way too short. I showed my hair dresser the photos OF ME with my short bob and the choppy layers, and specifically told her i wanted to avoid my hair looking like a big ball. She seemed like she really understood and was even saying comments about how we are gonna bring out my curl, avoid flatness, add plenty of choppy layers… but i feel like it came out like a big shapeless ball anyway. It wont curl at all like how it did. Its shorter than I ever wanted. I feel like its an old lady haircut and i know its dramatic but i’ve been crying nonstop. This has completely tanked my self esteem and self image. I can’t even recognize myself, and itll take MONTHS to get to where I’m happy with it. I’m so so devastated that it isnt curling like it did before. I feel so sick and upset and like i cant even go outside. ",

I also have in the past had them tinted darker, more ashy but dark brown is not a good idea for me either.\n\nI currently tint the transparent hairs with just for men beard dye in blonde (which isn’t mean to be warm) and use fenty light blonde brow pencil (love how light it is but too yellow).\n\nWould appreciate hearing ideas - I’ve heard there are Asian brow gels that lighten? Or maybe there’s another lightening product?\n\nThanks everyone 🙏",

      "content": "25F Struggling with hormonal acne that has worsened after my abortion that happened October 31st. Ive always had hormonal cystic acne and did a year of accutane when i was 16/17. I had clear skin after that until 2024 when my skin got sorta bad again, but resolved partially after getting my IUD removed in July of 2025. I am also recovering from anorexia, and my acne started around the same time I got serious about recovery in 2024, and got my period cycles back for the first time in years. I got pregnant in October (by accident, i was using protection) and my skin was pretty clear up until after few weeks after my abortion, ive had two periods since my abortion (on my second period right now.) and my skin gets worse with each cycle. I am desperate for help at this point as I dont even want to go outside. My skin is so damaged and is scarring like how it was when i was a teenager. I will attach photos of my skin from last week, and from today. The photos don’t really do it justice and it looks worse in person.\n\nI cannot be on hormonal BC or Spiro because of medical problems.\n\nMy skincare is as follows:\n\nMorning:\n\nLRP micellar foaming cleanser\n\nAvene Cicalfate serum\n\nLRP dermallergo moisturizer\n\nEvening:\n\nLRP micellar foaming cleanser and Panoxyl cream cleanser(every other night)\n\nLRP salicylic acid toner (every few nights and not on the same nights that i use panoxyl as its too irritating to use at the same time)\n\nAvene cicalfate serum OR LRP cicaplast serum\n\nLRP dermallergo moisturizer\n\nSpot treat very dry flakey areas with cicalfate or cicaplast cream\n\nThis routine kept my skin relatively clear with the exception of my luteal phases where i would inevitably get a few pimples. Now i am breaking out all the time and nothing is helping. I am getting cysts again like how it was when i was a teenager. I know my hormones are probably crazy out of whack from all the changes and extreme stress I have been dealing with the past few months. Any advice or tips welcome I am desperate. I am open to any kind of treatment or products including laser or peels or whatever I just can’t function like this anymore",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I was lucky to get TWO hair dryers for Christmas 😅.\nSo there is a big price difference between both that’s not the point. \nI know sometimes more expensive doesn’t mean better etc. My hair is curly (2C) and I’ve been trying to get a salon result at home for ages 😅. \nI have products, watched tutorials etc. \nI wash my hair one to two times a week. \n\nMy question is : which product is better suited - how to use it ? Return both? (not the ideal solution as I’m not a fan of returning gifts - but one is from hubby and he’ll be happy to adapt) Also I feel like my hair takes a really long time to dry. Is that because of my hair type or is it because of the dryer? Happy new year !\n\nRoutine : \nProducts used : la belle boucle shampoo + conditionner \nThen same brand for leave in conditioner then honey gel for then scrunch then drying",

Not sure if this is a reliable indicator of my actual hair porosity.\nThe area I live in has what is considered very soft water so i have not worried about it affecting my hair.\n\nI have tried no shampoo routines and curly friendly routines but my hair just always seems to look like the picture below. Lots of frizz and no definition.\n\nI have not used any heat or chemical treatments on my hair but i have started noticing that some parts of my hair that used to be tight ringlets have gone completely straight and limp (cant see it in the photo, thet are hiding at the bottom) and this has gotten me worried that the rest of my hair is set to follow.\n\nAny suggestions on how to fix my frizz and strange straight limp strands will be appreciated!\n\n",

      "content": "Hi, Im 26 male. Have been on oral minoxidil 2.5mg once a day for past 6 months. And finasteride 1mg every other day for 4ish months- gonna up finasteride to daily now.\n\nI saw a dermatologist and they recommended the above treatments. Initial shed for minoxidil did occur- sometimes on shampoo days id lose 100ish in the shower, some even when drying with a towel. On non shampoo days, maybe id lose 20ish and 10 while styling\n\nNOW: On non shampoo days- I lose maybe around 10 in shower and 10 styling with a brush.\n\nWith shampoo, I lose 70 in shower, and 10-20 styling.\n\nIm just wondering why this shedding is going on for so long, despite reaching now the 6 month mark. I take collagen and multivits too and all my blood work is fine. Not stressed atm.\n\nBy now, expected shedding to drop (some people say their shedding is like 20 only by this time in other threads ive seen) for 6 months on oral minox.\n\nMy main concern was crown and temples. Crown doesnt look any different tbh, still quite bad, and after starting minoxidil, temples look a bit worse. I do see baby hairs, but temples look lighter than last year for example.\n\nI know people stay to stick with it but im struggling. Any advice, is this normal to shed this much still? I still see couple of strands of hair on my bed, on my bathroom floor etc- so even without shampoo i shed here and there!",

I do take care of it and use products consistently, but nothing seems to help long term. I also do get my waves but they feel dry after the next day. Fyi I’m only 16.\n\nI rarely use heat maybe five times this entire year and even when I blow dry or air dry, my hair still feels dry and rough. I know it’s not just bad technique. Lately, my hair has gotten noticeably drier, and I’m also worried because I feel like I’m losing more hair than usual.\n\nI’ve been trying to eat a balanced diet and take my vitamins, but I still don’t know how to fix the dryness or promote healthier hair growth. Dry hair definitely runs in my family, so I know genetics play a role, but my hair didn’t used to be this bad.\n\nThe only time my hair looked truly healthy and moisturized was right after I cut it a few months ago. It looked great for a short time, and then suddenly it went back to being dry again almost overnight. Now it looks dry every single day no matter what.\n\nFor reference my hair has never been dyed, I’ve never done chemical treatments, I use a regular shampoo for wavy hair sometimes Ouai shampoo, and I use the Ouai leave in conditioner. I’ve tried deep masks and fine hair products, but they haven’t really helped.\n\nI just want healthy moisturized hair again and tips on how to grow it without losing so much. If anyone has advice routines or product recommendations especially for genetically dry wavy hair I would really appreciate it. Thank you!\n",

      "content": "hi guys! I have been on a wavy hair journey for some years now and on and off I will try new products in hopes of defining my waves and taming my frizz without weighing my hair down. here is my daily routine currently:\n\n1. wash hair with Paul Mitchell Clean Beauty Anti-Frizz Shampoo, condition with Paul Mitchell Clean Beauty Hydrating Conditioner (I have found these products make my hair very soft without build up or residual residue) I also brush my hair in the shower while the conditioner is in my hair.\n2. post shower with hair very wet, I have just purchased and am trying out Oribe Curl Gloss. I add a quarter size amount and smooth through my hair then do the scrunch method for 5-10 minutes.\n3. when my hair is absolutely dried I apply Kerastase hair oil.\n\nthat is my whole routine. I find that with low porosity hair the less products the better because even though my hair is dry and frizzy it gets weighed down easily.\n\nthe one issue I’m trying to figure out is how to maintain my waves the next day after sleeping on it. I sleep on a satin pillow case. my hair creases easily so I don’t put my hair up in a pony tail or bun or else the next day my hair looks dented. I have read that some people next day “rewet” their hair with a spray bottle and rescrunch to activate the product from the day prior but I find adding water and scrunching makes my hair frizzy. am I doing something wrong?\n\nI just want luscious, defined, and soft curls. I don’t care if I have to spend money on high quality products to achieve this either. any product or routine recommendations? I also used to shower at night but I have no switched to morning in hopes of my hair drying more “nicely“ while my styling products are in.\n\nhere is a video of my post shower routine. ignore the Kerastase night serum I have got rid of that because I think applying it on top of my Oribe curl gloss was weighing my waves down. also shown is my hair dried with just the Oribe curl gloss and Kerastase hair oil. my hair still looks a bit dry to me. what else can I do?!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1beki0p0yr9g1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8104cf85a8e4204648e3b854e15df7f73abf275\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mi6rm4p0yr9g1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29547b4294d8700436deba6eb2c34bce28907d54\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lttvo0p0yr9g1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf2e0599e9dbb9fb8234d9778d88958f4e8d1c8a\n\nedit: I guess the video cannot be uploaded :/",

I have this problem where some of my hair stays in place (so it formes defined curls) but some stick up and give off a frizzy look. \n\nMy current routine (that i do in late afternoon/evening) is this: \n\nMonday and friday:\n\nWash with garnier shampoo, rinse put conditioner (NON leave-in) from a supermarket, scrunch it and let it sit for 3-4 mins, then I put some curl cream from sunsilk for curly hair (I also scrunch it). After it all I let it air dry and then before bed I put on some argan oil and sleep with a bonnet\n\nAny other day:\n\nI basically do the same thing but I dont use shampoo. On sundays I let the conditioner stay for 15 mins\n\nEvery morning:\n\nI wet my hair (soaking wet) then I put NASHI hydrating curl booster cream and scrunch it then I dry it with a medium temperature hairdryer with a diffuser. I wait 50 mins and then i put some oil. Frequently in the morning I apply the oil to hair that is still somewhat wet. \n\nThank you for your response, I apologise if something is unclear because im a non-native english speaker.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\nI’m looking for genuine advice because I’m confused and a bit worried about my skin.\nI’ve been using tretinoin 0.025% for about 5 months mainly for acne marks and overall skin improvement. On non-tret nights, I was also using Aziderm (azelaic acid 10%).\nInitially, I expected purging and mild irritation, but over time I started noticing persistent facial redness, which now feels “stuck”.\nFor the past 6 days, I have completely stopped tretinoin and all actives, and I’m only following a very basic routine:\nCurrent routine (last 6 days):\nSimple Gentle Face Wash\nCerave Moisturizer or Minimalist 0.3% Ceramide Moisturizer\nSunscreen every day (Neutrogena or Re’equil)\n\nEven after stopping all actives, the redness is still present, and my skin looks noticeably red compared to how it looked before starting tret. I’ve attached before-tret vs current photos for reference.\nSome background:\nOily, acne-prone skin\nUsed tret consistently but not aggressively\nAlways moisturized and used sunscreen\nNo exfoliating acids, scrubs, or harsh cleansers\nAzelaic acid was used only on non-tret nights\n\nMy questions:\n1)Did I over-stress or damage my skin barrier, especially by combining tret and azelaic acid?\n2)Can long-term tret use (5 months) still cause redness like this, even after stopping?\n 3)Is  this more likely irritation, inflammation, or early rosacea-like reaction?\n4)What’s the best way to calm this redness and return to my pre-tret skin condition?\n5)Should tretinoin be reintroduced later, or is it better to stop completely?",

I feel like my teenage skin is back with a vengeance.\n\nMy usual routine is:\n\n- Cerave blemish control cleanser\n- purifide breakout serum\n- Cerave resurfacing retinol serum\n- Mediheal blemish pad\n- Cerave facial moisturising lotion\n\n\nBut since this huge breakout started I’ve gone back to basics and am only using the cleanser and moisturising lotion in the evening and the hypochlorous spray and moisturising lotion in the evening. It doesn’t seem to have any effect so far.\n\nI feel like whenever one spot seems to calm down another two pop up in its place. They are generally angry/painful whiteheads.\n\nI always take my make up off at night and am pretty consistent with my skincare routine. This has really rocked my confidence and I’m grateful for any suggestions/tips! TIA ❤️",
