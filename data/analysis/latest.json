      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I have changed hair products A LOT and have dyed my hair many times, but since taken a break. I am currently using the Native brand and Soapbox brand for shampoo and conditioner. I had their sprays too, but after some research I found a lot of people were dealing with thinning and frizz. I too.. am dealing with thinning and frizz. For extra moisture I use the soapbox brand too. I’ll put shea oil in my hair on extra frizzy days. \n\nDuring 2021 I used Cantu, but they’ve changed their recipe sooo much over the years and I can’t rely on that anymore. I cannot recall what I was using for shampoo and conditioner, but I honestly think it was Dove shampoo and Suave. I feel like my hair was so much fuller and bouncier in 2021! \n\nExtra info: I air dry my hair and do not blow dry at all. I sleep with a bonnet sometimes and use a silk pillow case ALWAYS. I do not go to bed with wet hair. \n\nWhat should I do? Go back to the basic routine even though they’re full of sulfates or try something new again? I think a hair cut is due for starters. ",

These pictures were taken just a couple hours after soaking it like I do every morning, brushing, applying and scrunching product, and letting it air dry. For a little more context, I use ordinary shampoo (just on my scalp) twice a week and ordinary conditioner (on everything but my scalp) nightly.\n\n  \nI don't really have a concrete routine anymore since I've been trying different things every day, but here's what I did for the results pictured:\n\n  \n\\- Completely soaked\n\n\\- Very lightly dried with regular towel (just dabbed enough so it's not dripping everywhere)\n\n\\- Brushed it straight with a wet brush while spraying it with a spray bottle to keep it wet\n\n\\- Applied and brushed through some It's a 10 Miracle Leave-In Potion\n\n\\- Flipped head upside down, ran a palmful of LA Looks Extreme Sport through hair and scrunched all over\n\n\\- Left completely alone to air dry over my back\n\n  \nThe results of my hair feel inconsistent day-to-day. I think I have a straight bottom layer of hair, so I'll see little strands of straight/wavy hair frustratingly protruding from my curls. Frizz feels sporadic and seems to show up wherever it wants.\n\nI know I don't go above and beyond for my hair, so am I expecting too much? Is there really a normal amount of frizz in the photos? Any product or routine recommendations? Does my hair actually look okay?\n\nThanks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52gm9t8s9iuf1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dc93a593b391519e0b69e69db3a206142dbc2e8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o260614t9iuf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20b3219ad55412b6c9425e6c4f33742a5c90455b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4pb0ict9iuf1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=436b80873b8bc729592243bf40bd5affb3512a5c\n\n",

I apply Hask products to the whole head - i use fingers to separate my hair. I also use cold water. After every washing, even if only water, i use curl cream from Tresemmé and styling serum. I use diffuser to dry my hair. I also never wear bonnets and i don’t own a silk pillowcase\n\nI just want to ask - is this curly or just wavy?\nThose 2 photos are 1 day apart.

I am completely shook. I don't know what to do. I even got short strands of hair at the start if my hairline caused by the thinning scissors. I can't believe an educated hairdresser with an actually waiting list at a well respected salon could screw up this bad. \n\nMy question to you guys is? do I cut it down the where here thinning shears have reaced, completely erasing months worth of hair growth? or do I bite the bullet and let it grow, and get it cut when I have gone past my preferred length? is there any way to save the current hair? do I need to change my current hair routine? \n\nCurrent Routine: \nshampoo 1-2 times a week (Yari Rosemary &amp; Batana Shampoo)\nCondition 3-4 times a week (Yari Green Curls Hydrating Conditioner)",
