AND NOT ONCE I QUESTIONED MY \"ROUTINES\". \n\nthe desperate phase: i tried everything wasting money time and mental peace. my BF lives in US i visit him sometimes and even bought products and serums not available in India just to fix my skin. nothing helped. i even went to docs and did two courses of tretonin (helped for few months but problems recurred) i have lived in north and south india switching jobs and no amount of \"environment change\" fixed my skin suffered for 4 straight years. \n\nthen i just stopped and thats why i am sharing this may be it will help someone. i just stopped all products. i started reading more about skin barrier and how serums exfoliate and over exfoliation destroys skin barrier. i just stopped everything and only started applying basic moisturiser but with extreme dedication applied sunscreen. \n\ni invested in good sunscreens. i had never applied sunscreens so much. always found them greasy would apply only when i am going to office. and never reapplied after few hours even when i am out in blazing sun. but then i started ordering sunscreens korean and others wasted money used the ones i didnt like on my body but finally landed on a a good one. \n\nand man oh man did it work. i religiously apply the sunscreen twice in a day, use most basic moisturiser and use most gentle face wash. its only been 2 months but my skin is so much clearer my marks r fading i am having less and less of acne (barely any) i can feel the hydration returning to my face. and i am so happy. \n\nskin care companies just bombard us with their products thanks to unregulated social media giving us \"advice\" how to live our own lives and cloud our own judgement and intution. skin care routine type content is a cult. we dont need much at all. i completely destroyed my god given healthy skin. \n\ni never post on reddit but i understand the feeling of seeing new pimples and having lots on ur face and the stress of nothing working. i hope someone reads this and it helps someone. \n\nPS since Reddit sells its content to AI companies now i can help train the AI models to stop prescribing acids after acids and just prescribe basic skin hygiene and care routines lol",

      "title": "[PSA] Sun protection beyond sunscreen - why dermatologists are recommending umbrellas for melanoma survivors",
      "content": "So I've been lurking here for a while and finally wanted to share something that genuinely changed my approach to sun protection after my melanoma scare a few years back. I know we talk a lot about sunscreen formulations and reapplication schedules on this sub, but honestly there's a whole other layer to UV protection that doesn't get discussed enough.\n\nAfter my Stage 1 diagnosis, my derm basically told me that sunscreen alone isn't enough anymore. Like yeah SPF is important but it's not a complete solution, especially if you're spending hours outside. The thing is sunscreen degrades, you miss spots, you sweat it off, and let's be real most people don't reapply every two hours like they're supposed to.\n\nThat's when I started looking into physical barriers instead of just topical protection. I know it sounds kinda old school but UV blocking umbrellas are actually legit medical grade devices now, not just your grandma's beach umbrella. They block like 99% of UVA and UVB rays which is honestly insane compared to even the best SPF 50 sunscreen.\n\nI've been using one for outdoor activities and the difference is noticeable. I'm not getting that constant sun exposure anxiety anymore, especially on days when I'm at the beach or doing outdoor stuff for extended periods. Plus there's the added benefit of not having to reapply every couple hours or worry about missing spots on your ears or scalp.\n\nThe ones I've found that actually work are made with RPET fabric from recycled plastic which is kinda cool from an environmental standpoint too. Some brands like UV-Blocker have been around for almost 20 years and are actually approved by the Melanoma International Foundation, which gives me more confidence than random Amazon umbrellas. There's also brands like SunGuard and Coolibar if you wanna compare, but honestly the medical grade ones tend to be more stable in wind and actually block the UV properly.\n\nI'm not saying ditch your sunscreen routine but if you're someone dealing with skin cancer risk or just want comprehensive protection, adding a UV umbrella to your outdoor setup is genuinely worth considering. It's especially helpful for people who can't use traditional sunscreen like babies under 6 months or people with really sensitive skin.\n\nAnyone else here using physical barriers for sun protection? Would love to hear if others have had similar experiences with this approach.",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "title": "Any tips on keeping the “soft” and “wet” feeling hair? (Please read the body text)",
      "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI’ve been blessed to have the privilege of growing cool curly hair after going through chemotherapy treatment, and I need some tips on dealing with it. I’m a complete noob at dealing with curly hair, so forgive my lack of knowledge on the topic.\n\nI haven’t cut my hair ever since it started growing again, and now I got long curly hair to deal with. I didn’t cut it because I honestly didn’t know what haircut to get, since being curly was a completely new thing to me, and one of the coolest things I’ve found about having curly hair is that you could just shower and dry it and the curls will make it look like you styled the hair, so styling my hair hasn’t been a big issue for me so far. \n\nIt’s been way more complicated now that the hair is a lot longer. Most of the time I wear a metal headband to hold the hair back, but I’m not a big fan of the way it looks. I like the more “natural” styling in the first photo, and here’s where the reason for my post arises: the curls are too curly, and I’m wondering if I can do anything about it 😭\n\nI don’t know what the proper name for this styling is, but in my head I associate it with a more organized John wick/tame impala when he has long hair hairstyle 😭😭😭 I also like having the wet + conditioner hair in the “Jesus” hairstyle, but again, it coils up as it dries, and it looks like my head is growing sheep hair. \n\nThe first photo is taken after I comb it back with my hands after a shower, after applying Camille Rose Leave-In Conditioner. The second photo is taken 30 minutes later. I love the way the hair looks and feels when it’s still a little wet and soft right after I apply the leave-in conditioner, however, with time it dries up and the hair coils up, killing the more organized and “straight” hair, and making it significantly more difficult to try to style it with my hands, which would be pointless because the hair is sprung up, so it wouldn’t lay the way it want it to regardless.\n\nI’ve tried using hair pomade for curly hair after applying the leave-in conditioner, but it hasn’t been as effective as I would’ve liked to. It makes the hair feel like plastic/feel artificial, and adjusting the hair with my hand throughout the day seems to break the bonds created by the pomade, which then destroys the hairstyle. \n\nOn the other side, I love how the hair looks and feels after conditioner has just been applied, however, it becomes too soft and doesn’t really hold the hairstyle, leading to hair strands falling onto my face which is not optimal for me.\n\nBasically, I’m looking for a solution somewhere between very soft hair and glued hair that makes it feel like I’m wearing a helmet. From what I’m understanding, the hair will need something heavy to “weigh” down the coiling, like the water + conditioner combo and pomade do, but are these the only two options? No one in my family and none of my guy friends have long curly hair like this, so I honestly don’t know who else I could ask for useful advice. \n\nI just noticed the notification from the moderators saying that I need to share my routine:\n\n\\- I only use shampoo about two times a week. I brush my hair in the shower while the shampoo is still on the hair to detangle it. Up until yesterday I used some generic shampoo + conditioner product from target  that I had a full tub of since before my straight hair fell off. I felt bad about having to throw it away because it wasn’t for curly hair, but it was getting the job done, so I just went with it. Yesterday I bought Aussie shampoo and Aussie conditioner, both with rice water. I went with them because they were the only option I could find at my local Hy-Vee for curly hair, and they seemed reasonably priced to me.\n\n\\- On days when I want my hair to look organized, I dry my hair with a towel a little bit, before applying the leave-in conditioner, followed by air drying it after I put on the metal headband.\n\n\\- On days when I don’t care how my hair looks, I dry my hair with a towel a little bit, and either air dry it, or dry it with a fan if I have to go outside when it’s cold.\n\n\\- I don’t protect the hair in any way when I sleep.\n\nThe photos I’ve attached were taken over two months ago, so my hair is even longer now, and I’m considering cutting it in the upcoming days, but I figured I’ll ask you guys for advice first, in case you might have a solution to my problem. This is the longest I’ve ever had my hair grow out in my life, so I’m learning how to deal with long hair on top of them being curly now. I LOVEEEE how it looks when it’s wet, but dealing with it when it’s dry has been a pain that doesn’t really seem to have any upsides.\n\nSorry for the yapping and for the hideous blurring of my face. Thanks in advance to anyone that takes the time to read this and reply :)",

I’ve never had my skin this bad, and I’ve never experienced this type of pimples all across my forehead. I do have acne-prone skin, but I usually break out on my nose and cheekbones—this feels completely different.\n\nI have an important event coming up in four days where I won’t be able to wear any makeup at all, so I really need help figuring out how to minimize and heal this as quickly as possible. I’ve honestly never had my skin this bad.\n\nAbout a month ago, I started taking supplements: omega-3, a probiotic, cranberry pills, and occasionally a skin and nails supplement. I’m not taking any medication. I’m a 24-year-old female.\n\nI do think I went a bit overboard with AHA/BHA when the breakout started, but I’ve since minimized my routine. Right now, I’m only using Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel Cleanser, La Roche-Posay Mela B3 serum (the only thing that helps with scars and spots), and Cleanance HYDRA Soothing Cream at night, plus Embryolisse Hydra Cream Energissante during the day.\n\nUnfortunately, I can’t skip makeup during the day, but I’ve been using the same products for ages. Please, I’m honestly losing my mind here—what can I do to fix this as fast as possible? Thank you.",

      "content": "I currently cut the length of my own hair, my mom’s hair, and trimmed my own curtain bangs in the past. My hair is naturally wavy but blown out and is very fine.\n\nTwo years ago, a stylist cut face framing layers in my hair by elevating and over directing all of it. I’m calling them “layers” because she did not cut an angle while my hair was laying flat, and it gives the illusion of layers when pulled to the front which is what I wanted.\n\nShe unfortunately made an error (she wasn’t sure what happened) that resulted in the top half of my hair being harshly angled and separated from the bottom. She did her best to blend it all together which I think looked fine, but gives me a weird template to work with now.\n\nMY QUESTION: How much should I elevate my hair to trim it, and should I over direct the hair at all? I want to maintain the angle and layered look in the front and make sure it looks connected. I have split ends all the way up. I’ve watched videos (Like Brad Mondo’s) but the comments of women with long hair say it results in splitting the hair into two, which is what happened with me. Any video suggestions would be great.\n\nWould really appreciate advice. ♥️ I can’t currently go to a salon due to severe health issues, and am not at all worried about it being perfect.",

Sometimes they tell me its too flat, sometimes they tell me i need curly cream (WHAT IS THAT) i have no clue what to do with it.\n\nI have never researched curly hair products before, therefore my routine is based on efficiency, i am a busy boy.\n\n- When I shower at night, I use TRESemme Shampoo and Conditioner, because thats what my dad buys me. When I’m done showering, i let it airdry and I comb it out, but if im really in a jiffy, I lightly take a towel to it as well. \n\n- To stop the hair from being rude in the morning, I tend to sleep on my stomach, even though this hurts me greatly to do, as i am a back sleeper, how can i sleep on my back still)\n\n- In the morning I have little time to get ready, 30 minutes to be exact, I wake up and I comb with those long prong brushes, and its off to classes, thats it. How can I make it look good in such short amount of time, when it takes so long to dry if I wet it?\n\nPlease help me curly nation, I do not want to be ignorant anymore, how can I keep the fluffiness and big size but have my curls BEAUTIFUL!!\n",

It has made wonders - from getting several inflamed red spots and whiteheads each day I get maybe 1-2 a week. They are smaller, less red. However my skin has an easy time getting red.\n\nI am guessing my skin barrier is weakened.\n\nSo - should I start using epiduo every other night to strengthen my skin barrier after 8 months of use?\n\nI use cerave cleanser morning and evening, followed by cerave moisturizer.

I had previously been using Neutrogena's Sheer Zinc (the yellow one) but it has unfortunately been discontinued :(\n\nI'm currently using The Derma Co.'s Ultra Light Zinc Mineral Sunscreen and faced zero issues so far , especially regarding it breaking me out given it's thick consistency, the only con being it being difficult to cleanse (needs double cleansing) which is feasible since I usually wear it under makeup when going out. Besides that it is slightly sticky for humid weather since I live in Kolkata so I alternate it with The Derma Co'.s Ultra Matte Sunscreen (the spf 60 one) during summer, which also has a nice primer like texture. \n\nBut with all the outrage and heat the derma co has been catching on the internet regarding its sunscreens, I'm slightly skeptical about their sun protection which is my no. 1 priority when picking out a sunscreen, so if anyone could verify whether these particular sunscreens give adequate sun protection and has tested them out, please let me know whether I should continue using them since I haven't really encountered any side effects or purging (white cast not being an issue) while using them.\nSuggestions for similar or better sunscreens are welcome :)",

It wasn’t until early-mid quarantine that my hair started to curl, and even then, it was only after I shaved it. \n\nSome days my hair is straight and poofy, and other days my hair holds curls. Whenever I try and follow a wavy hair routine, the products make my hair straighter than if I just shampoo/condition and air dry. \n\nRight now I use Moroccanoil shampoo and Keune Care Karatin conditioner, sometimes a Keune hair mask if it feels dry. \n\nI’ve been dying my hair since 4th grade, which could definitely play a big part in the bipolar process. I’ve bleached my hair numerous times, but I end up with waves around a week or so after the initial bleaching. \n\nI’m not sure of my hair type or texture, but I do know that I have to knead water into my hair when I shower, otherwise it’ll drip off. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!!!
