      "content": "Hi! I've been wanting short hair for a longgg time &amp; finally got the courage to get my first ever haircut last year. It used to be waist-length when stretched. I got it cut to around shoulder-length (with shrinkage: a little bit past my chin). \n\n**Important context though** On Day 1 of wash day I have less volume and more definition (as seen in pics 1 &amp; 2) but around Day 3-4 I have a LOT of volume (as seen in pics 3 &amp; 5). I also learned it can turn into an afro the first month after my haircut because it was short enough and cut into a round shape (pic 7)\n\nI'm getting another haircut soon and would love to get a pixie this time (reference pics 8-12), but I'd like to get some advice from my fellow redditers. I know all about the pros and cons but I'm just a bit nervous, **with my features will I look more or less feminine? Do I have the features to pull it off? I won't lie, these things are important to me.** Lmk what you think I included pics with and w/o makeup &lt;3\n\nWash-n-go routine:\nWash with Native Coconut shampoo\nConditioner: Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Conditioner, detangle in 6 sections with Crave Naturals brush\nRinse thoroughly\nAdd Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Leave-in Cream to each section, prayer hand method\nBrush style with Crave Naturals brush for volume\nRake in Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic Gel to each section, finger coiling any curls that need some extra love\nAir dry, then scrunch out the crunch with Carol's Daughter 7 Oil Blend Hair &amp; Scalp Oil\nI use a bonnet every night, no refresh\n",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nSo normally I don’t post much, but wanted to drop this as a warning for anyone buying products purely on hype and regretting later.\n\nBack in September I got into fitness, and by December started protein supplements. My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily.\n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

      "content": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nI’m looking for some opinions and haircut suggestions.\n\nI’ve been growing my hair for almost a year now. I only trimmed it once just to clean up the shape and ends, and I’m planning another trim this January to refine the cut and remove damaged ends.\n\nMy goal is a long curly haircut (mine seems to be 3A), but I’m really unsure about the shape:\n- more elongated / layered and flowy, or\n- more rounded overall\n\nI honestly don’t know what would suit my curls and head shape better. I'd like an androgynous look/haircut!\n\nI also feel like my hair looks dry and very frizzy, especially when there’s wind. Sometimes it just loses definition instantly.\n\nDo you think using a dryer + diffuser more often could help with frizz and definition compared to air-drying?\n\nCurrent routine:\n- I follow a hydration / nutrition / reconstruction rotation\n- Wash 2–3x a week\n- One wash per week with ketoconazole shampoo (scalp reasons)\n- Leave-in + curl cream, usually air-dry\n\nDoes my hair look too dry to you?\n\nAny haircut references, shape advice, or routine tweaks are super welcome! Some androgynous haircut suggestion would be really great ;).\n\nThanks!\n\nOBS: Also worth mentioning: I have some thinning at the crown, which I’m already treating.\n\nIf you have haircut suggestions that could help disguise or balance that area, I’d really appreciate!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Hi, I want to preface this with the fact that I’ve been going to the same stylist for around 6 years. I always ask for the exact same style…. Heavy highlights, keeping my natural color, only highlights on the top portion and a trim. It never ever changes. The last 2 times she’s messed it up. The last time was in May of this year… she put a toner that apparently contained ash and it my hair looked grey. I prefer warmer tones. Thankfully I told her before I left the salon and she fixed it with a warmer toner. Over the past 7 months I’ve struggled with hair loss and started taking oral minoxidil. It’s finally started to work but I’ve been extra careful with my hair, very little heat, products etc. I noticed that alot of my new hair around my face was grey so this time I asked that she color just the pieces around my face with my natural color and then do the usual highlights. She insisted that lifting my roots would help hide the grey better. I really didn’t want bleach all over my new baby hairs and told her I was concerned with it damaging my hair. Not to mention I really didn’t want my base color changed. Well she just absolutely insisted. Not only did my hair turn out what looks like 5 different colors of orange/gold but I have never ever paid $372 for my hair (plus her tip and the washer’s tip)! I looked at my receipt and I was charged $140 for an all over root color! She didn’t lift my roots all over… only partial! I never have her touch my hair underneath! It didn’t look as bad in the salon because of the way she dried it. After I got home I pulled it up in a pony tail and it’s such a splotchy orange mess! Omfg!!! I’ve added pictures from 3 different rooms in my house as well as pics from outside. I’m terrified if she adds another toner it’s going to damage my hair even worse! Should I just try to put purple conditioner in my roots and around my face or would you have the salon fix this??  Please tell me how you would handle this. Call the salon, email salon with pics, text the stylist privately?? Thoughts?? Thank you!!  ",

I have some gray hairs, but not many.\n\nHey guys, happy new year! So I shaved my head over the summer due to a scalp condition. I am growing out something similar to a mohawk but need to keep the sides shaved or buzzed due to my skin condition. Also I like the look. I am going to be coloring my hair with a dark burgundy demi-permanent dye. It's my first time using demi-permanent, is it substantially less damaging than permanent? Also, I am considering growing out the \"mohawk\" area but not sure how to with my hair texture. You usually see this style with straight hair, and I'm not sure how it would look. I have been DIYing my hair since I was 14, I cannot afford salons. I do have a small amount of cosmetology training. I don't want to iron my hair, but I have stretched it with products and liked the results so I am open to that. Any ideas for upcoming colors and styles? Length, etc? I do not want to lighten my hair either, due to the damage it does.\n\nRoutine: CeraVe shampoo, CeraVe conditioner, Honest Leave-In spray, Prose custom curl cream (run through hair with fingers), Prose custom hair gel (run through hair with fingers), air-dry. I do not protect my hair when sleeping, I refresh with water when needed.",

      "content": "Hi, I recently moved back in with my parents and found out I’m allergic to our family cat. Allergy meds, among other things, are helping with some of the symptoms, but my skin feels like a lost cause at this point, and I’m in desperate need of advice.\n\nI spent a long time trying to improve my skincare routine, as I’ve always dealt with dry, sensitive skin and the occasional breakout. No matter what I tried, the constant dullness, puffiness, and random spots of redness and itchiness never really went away.\n\nI’ve also had mild eczema for years, so I didn’t think much of it at first. I honestly just accepted that having a puffy, overly sensitive face was normal for me and assumed my skincare products were the problem.\n\nWhen I moved away for school, my skin cleared up significantly and my usual allergy symptoms disappeared. It would only flare up if my roommates brought pets into the house or if I was exposed to known triggers like pollen or dust. Which is what eventually led me to realize I have cat allergies.\n\nSince moving back home, it feels like I’m back at square one. My skin looks awful, my eczema keeps flaring (especially on my face) and I’m pretty sure I’ve given myself contact dermatitis, particularly on my eyelids and upper lip, from touching my face after petting the cat.\n\nI’ve bought an air purifier, anti-allergen sprays, and detergent, and I’m trying to wash my hands more often, but I’m not sure what else to do. Wearing long sleeves and bottoms helps prevent hives on my body, but my face is another story. Is it realistic for my skin to calm down again while living here? Are there any skincare or environmental changes that could help? I feel so frustrated any advice would be appreciated :(\n\n  \nRoutine: \n\n* *Prequel Facial Gleanser Cleanser*\n* *Bioderma Sensibio (Micellar) / SEKKISEI Treatment Cleansing Oil*  \n* *Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion*\n* *Occasional Exfoliant: Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant, Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant*",

After dread shed ends is your daily hair fall rate supposed to go back to what it was before starting treatment or is it supposed to lower beyond that? For reference I was shedding around 115-130 hairs before treatment, doubled that loss rate in the dread shed phase, and am back down to around 100-115 a day a few weeks after shedding has ended. I know it's slightly less than before treatment and it is impovement but I'm thinking to may be a fluke or I fucked up my counting (which I am very diligent in).",

      "content": "Hi! Recently I’ve been getting a ton of closed comedones and some of them turn into long lasting pimples. My chin and left side of the face (towards outside) is more affected, along with the forehead (but no pimples there).\n\nI am currently using 1004 centella oil cleanser + cerave hidratying cleanser , 1004 centella ampoule, cerave resurfacing retinol/aha &amp; bha cosrx every other day (not toghether) and 1988 moisturizer. That is my nightime routine. I do almost nothing in the morning except the ampoule and maybe the moisturizer. I have dry skin and kept this type of routine for years with great results, but recently it doesn’t work anymore. Indeed, I’ve changed the moisturizer recently (a lot earlier than when the issues began) and also introduced the ampoule, but they are very lightweight and seems hard for me to believe they are the cause.\n\nI don’t know for sure what am i doing wrong or what to change. Have been thinking to change the retinol to retinal, stop the cosrx bha &amp; aha (as honestly i don’t think they do much for me) and introduce azelaic acid or try another products with bha/aha. Could you please give me some advice?\n\n(Sorry for the spelling mistakes, my keyboard is not on english autocorrect and messes up my words)",

I'm in my late 20s, female, and have had dark &amp; often ingrown hairs on my stomach for years now.\n\nThe way they grow can be painful (when they are thicker or in grown) and tweezing the problem ones doesn't help.\n\nI've had labs taken previous and there's no signs of hormone imbalance &amp; I was told I don't qualify to be diagnosed with PCOS. I am willing to get professional services done or to ask my doctor for extra referrals if there's likely nothing to be done from home! I just have no clue where to start looking/what to be looking for.\n(May have to wait a couple months to act on some suggestions though to update with any possible results, I'm currently pregnant... which has also not helped the hair growth &amp; issues.)",

I have been on minoxidil for 5 months and a half and finasteride for 6 months and a half, i can say with confidence that somehow it is working, but recently i have hit a plateau in seeing an increase in density around my crown and many other parts, although my hair loss isn’t as bad compared to many (diffusion alopecia) it still has decreased my density for a few years now. So i am wondering, is hair gains gradually or a sudden jump in-between months like 6-7 months time (no joke intended), it would definitely make me more at ease to know everyones timeline.",
