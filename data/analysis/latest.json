      "content": "​Hey everyone! I'm celebrating a huge milestone today: three years of consistent hair growth, and I've genuinely never been happier with my hair journey. It's been a marathon, not a sprint, and I won't lie—it's been a lot of work. But seeing the progress and feeling this level of confidence is so incredibly worth every single effort.\n​My routine is pretty simple, which is probably why I've been able to stick with it. I only wash my hair once a week, which has been a game-changer for maintaining moisture and preventing breakage. This has been essential for me. When I do wash it, my go-to style is a wash-and-go. I absolutely love how it defines my curls and cuts down on styling time during the week.\n​So, what's my secret sauce? I swear by Brazilian hair products, and I'm a huge fan of Novex in particular. Their deep conditioners and masks have transformed my hair from the inside out, making it stronger and more resilient. The difference is night and day. I also incorporate a coconut oil treatment once a week for that extra boost of hydration and shine. It's a simple, affordable step that makes a huge impact. To top it all off, I define my curls with Eco Style gel. It gives me the perfect hold without the crunch, which is exactly what I need to keep my wash-and-go looking fresh and frizz-free all week long.\n​I'm so glad I stuck with it. If you're on a similar journey, just know that consistency is key. Find what works for you and don't be afraid to experiment. If anyone has questions about my routine or product recommendations, feel free to ask! I'm happy to share more.",

      "content": "My tween initially had a few spots on her forehead. We tried benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid spot treatments at different times, but her skin seemed to flare up, and over time she developed more congestion with some inflamed bumps across her forehead.\n\nWe then tried a gentler approach using a benzoyl peroxide cleanser, which helped a little. However, even with short-contact use, her skin still became red and irritated.\n\nEventually, we saw a dermatologist who prescribed Epiduo to be used every four days. Although I mentioned that her skin seems sensitive and reactive, I decided to have her use only adapalene, applied as a short-contact treatment after cleansing and washed off after a few minutes every five days. She did go through a purge, but her skin did improve.\n\nAfter a few months, however, her skin suddenly began reacting badly to adapalene. We took a 10-day break, during which her skin calmed, though it started getting slightly congested again. Because she has more closed comedones than inflamed pimples, we thought a salicylic acid cleanser might be more suitable for her sensitive skin. We now use it once a week. Some closed comedones have resolved, but she still experiences flare-ups, and her skin takes about a week to settle before the next wash. On other days, she uses a gentle cleanser and moisturizer.\n\nI’m wondering whether her skin issues may have been caused, at least in part, by the use of active treatments, since she previously did not have a consistent cleansing or moisturizing routine. I’m considering taking a step back from actives to focus on healing her skin barrier. I worry she may get congested again, but ongoing irritation is also concerning.\n\nDoes anyone have thoughts or advice? I would really appreciate it. ",

      "content": "(used ai to touch up the post)  \nHi everyone — long time, many problems. I need blunt, useful replies (product recs, experiences with lasers, hair regrowth tips, and how to frame questions to my derm). No sugarcoat — tell it like it is.\n\n**TL;DR — problems**\n\n* Active acne (face; back/chest was an issue before), scarring, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), and hair loss.\n* Dealing with this for **\\~9 years**. Back acne is now mostly clear.\n* In treatment for just about a year.\n\n**Skin type / breakouts**\n\n* Oily. I get blackheads, whiteheads, painful cysts, and inflamed pimples — all of them.\n\n**Medical / Rx history (current &amp; important)**\n\n* **Oral:** Sotret (isotretinoin) — started a year ago. Dose history: 20 mg twice daily → 20 mg once daily (since March) → 10 mg once daily (since August).\n* **Supplements:** Follihair (capsule, nightly) (since a month).\n* **Topicals &amp; routine (AM / PM / other):**\n   * **AM:** Banzit cleanser; Tacrovera forte (tacrolimus 0.1% ointment) on pigmentation; Aquasoft FC (sunscreen + moisturizer); Olesoft Lite SPF 50; Trichowel serum (scalp); Reinvia-HS (hair strands).\n   * **PM:** Banzit cleanser; Xtralite Mild (azelaic acid + tretinoin cream) — used as a **2-hour wash-off on alternate nights**; Aquasoft FC (on nights after washing); Tyrodin (tranexamic acid + kojic + MAP + arbutin + Vit E) — used on red marks on alternate nights; Minofina (minoxidil + finasteride topical) on scalp; Eyecirque for under-eye.\n   * **Other/PRN:** Chaptex (lip), Benzac-AC (BP gel), Erypton-N (clindamycin + nicotinamide), Lupizol-ZS shampoo alternate days, Glotamin lotion (back PIH), Rega BPO spray &amp; creamy wash, Biosilk body moisturizer, etc.\n\n**What’s worked / not**\n\n* Back acne cleared — huge win.\n* Face: still active breakouts and lingering marks after a year on treatment. I get redness after Tacrovera and after Xtralite application.\n* Scars remain. My derm says **laser is the only option**, but online results look mixed — wanting real experiences.\n\n**What I want from this post**\n\n1. **Product recommendations/review** that actually help oily, scarring-prone skin — especially for PIH and texture. India-available recs preferred but open to imports.\n2. **Laser &amp; in-clinic advice:** real experiences only — which lasers helped your acne scars, number of sessions, downtime, realistic results, and how long after finishing isotretinoin you waited. Was it worth the cost?\n3. **Hairloss help:** experiences with topical minoxidil + topical finasteride solutions (Minofina or alternatives) and supplements — any visible regrowth stories or tips to speed results.\n4. **How to talk to my derm:** what specific questions to ask about lasers (expected % improvement, device/clinic examples, pre/post protocol, safe intervals with isotretinoin), and what to insist on or avoid.\n5. **Personal experiences &gt; theory.** Tell me real outcomes (good or bad) and what you’d do again.\n\n**Constraints &amp; notes**\n\n* I’m in **Chandigarh**. Willing to try in-clinic if the derm approves. **All these prescriptions already cost more than ₹10k.** Give realistic recs.\n* I gave my full prescription/routine above — use it to tailor answers.\n* Prefer straightforward, respectful replies.",

      "content": "Hi everyone. This'll be a bit of a long/vent-y post so please bare with me. I'm posting here because I don't know anyone with hair like me/other curly girls so I figured a Reddit community could help me out and relate to my struggles. \n\nMy hair has gone through so many phases. Super long, pixie cut, mid length, layers, no layers, you name it. \n\nPictures 1 &amp; 2 are my current hair, photos taken today. \n3 is May of this year \n4 is January 2023\n5 is my virgin natural hair from 4 years ago\n\nAs you can see, my hair has been dyed. And it's been dyed several times. It had pink highlights that were bleached and has since faded. In the 4th pic my hair had blonde highlights as well but was cut short. \n\nThe issue I have is that my hair is never the same. I feel like my curl pattern has changed a lot especially since growing it out and having bleached highlights. I miss the poofy, fluffy, \"80's style\" curls I had. \n\nI can't tell my hair is damaged, too long and weighed down, or I'm just getting older and my hair isn't like it was when I was 18 in that 4th picture. I'm 21 now. Even my natural hair had many ringlets I don't see often anymore.\n\nA part of me believes I have low density curls and I need to compensate for that by having short hair, but I want the mid length fluffy voluminous curls I see all over Pinterest. I'm probably in denial and can't have that. I want to grow my hair out but volume will always be more important to me.\n\nI watched a YouTube video talking about why a curly girl opted for no layers for her fine curls, and her hair looked voluminous and thick. She said layers made her hair look stringy, especially at the bottom layer when her hair started growing out. I feel like that's what's happening with my hair too.\n\nAs for my routine, here is what I do currently.\n-Mielle rosemary and mint shampoo every other day, on rare occasion every 2 days.\n-Carol's daughter conditioner every other day\n-Garnier leave in air dry conditioner \n-Herbal essence curl boosting mousse \n-Sleep sometimes in a pineapple bun w/ bonnet, sometimes in a ponytail\n\nI try to limit how much product I use. I don't even know what I should be using for my hair type. All I know is that my hair likes light weighted products and diffusing, which I don't do. And I know I should..I'm just lazy. Everytime I tried to diffuse my hair looks frizzy and a mess.\n\nI suppose I'm looking for advice on what haircut may fit me and my curl pattern, layers or no layers? maybe some color ideas too. Any product or routine advice is more than welcome. Sometimes I feel insecure because I wish I could go back in time and have my dream hair— but I can't undo all the box dye and highlights. \n\nIf anyone took the time to read, THANK YOU so much. I have no one to turn to for advice. I live in a small town where curly hair like mine is rare and there aren't curl specialists anywhere near me. I appreciate you hearing me out.\n\nTLDR; Insecure about changing curl pattern and would appreciate any advice such as haircuts, curl routines for low density curls, or hair color ideas. Personal stories are welcome too. \n\nThanks!",

All I want is a healthy discussion and some perspective.\n\nI see a lot of you in this sub using products certain products that contain added fragrance (as in, it's mentioned on the ingredients list). For those of you with sensitive skin, does it not cause any irritation? \n\nI don't really have a severe acne problem (thankfully), it's just mild breakouts now and then. I do have PIH though, from healed breakouts. I have a sensitive skin in general, it's always been like that, not just because of a compromised skin barrier. I have mild oiliness on my face- a combination skin type.\n\nI see lots of cleansing products targeted towards skin that have oiliness but theoretically, those look too harsh to be applied on a face like mine, since it's also sensitive. Plus, most sensitive skin cleansers contain fatty alcohols, which my skin absolutely does not tolerate, my face starts forming bumps which are painful. \n\nWhen it comes to moisturizers, I have tried thick creams (cerave), gone without applying creams in hot weather (used a thick essence instead, rovectin), and currently apply a lotion since it's lightweight (1025 dokdo lotion), yet it causes my face to sweat when I step out in the heat. What do you people use? \n\nComing to sunscreens, I've mostly had a negative relation with it. None of them felt good to wear, so I'm not quite regular with it. Currently I use the Re'equil matte sunscreen (blue one), it's not as bad, but still makes my face a bit greasy as the day goes on. But, I suppose I have to work with it, it's the best one I've stumbled upon so far. It does have added fragrance though (IFRA), is that alright for sensitive skin? Or should I look for alternatives?

I have combination skin (my T-zone and forehead are oily, but my cheeks are dry), and I just can’t seem to figure out what actually works.\n\nFor the longest time, I didn’t use anything at all, just my regular bathing soap (it weirdly never gave me acne). Then I went to a dermatologist, and she recommended the **Cetaphil Bright Healthy Radiance Creamy Cleanser...** and really that’s the *only* face wash that hasn’t messed up my skin. Everything else, like the Minimalist Salicylic Acid face wash, broke me out badly.\n\nShe also told me to use salicylic acid serum + Cleargel + another medicated cream for acne, but those only made things worse. Salicylic acid in general seems to destroy my skin.... both in face washes and serums. When I stopped using them, my skin actually improved.\n\nMoisturizers have been another nightmare: **Biosilk Moisturizer** broke me out, **Cetaphil DAM lotion** gave me heavy acne, **Neutrogena Hydro Boost**... same story\n\nSo right now, I don’t have a single moisturizer that works for me, and my cheeks are still dry.

      "content": "Hi, I came across an interesting piece about skin pigmentation and thought I’d share it here.\n\nPigmentation is a common skin concern—things like sun spots, melasma, or the dark marks that remain after acne.\n\nSo, why does pigmentation occur? Think of it as your skin drawing the curtains to block UV rays. The pigment melanin plays that role. When the skin is exposed to UV light, inflammation, or other stressors, it produces more melanin as a defense mechanism.\n\nAfter acne or an injury, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation can appear. It’s a bit like how a building’s walls get darkened with soot after a fire.\n\nTraditional brightening agents, such as retinoids or acids, can sometimes irritate the skin and trigger inflammation. Steroid-based treatments may even thin the skin. It’s like trying to remove a stain with a harsh detergent—yes, the stain fades, but the fabric is damaged. In fact, some whitening treatments can worsen pigmentation as a side effect.\n\nThe ingredient I’d like to introduce today is dark tea. Unlike green or black tea, dark tea goes through a unique fermentation process that produces special compounds.\n\nAnd here’s the key point: dark tea extract has two main effects.\n\nFirst, It reduces melanin production.\n\nDark tea extract suppresses the enzymes in skin cells that act like factories producing melanin. In other words, it slows down the production line and decreases overall pigment output.\n\nAnd it reduces inflammation.\n\nWhen skin cells are exposed to UV rays, they release inflammatory signals. These signals tell surrounding cells to produce even more melanin. Dark tea extract blocks this very first step, preventing the chain reaction from starting.\n\nIn short, dark tea extract helps regulate both melanin production and inflammatory responses, keeping the skin’s reactions balanced rather than excessive.\n\nWhat’s exciting is that it doesn’t just treat the visible symptoms—it addresses multiple root causes of pigmentation. And since it’s derived from a natural source rather than harsh chemicals, it has the potential to be a safe and effective skincare ingredient.\n\nThis article on pigmentation and dark tea was recently published, and I found it fascinating. I’ll continue to share more interesting updates like this in the future.\n\nIf you notice any errors or have questions, feel free to leave a comment. Thanks for reading!",

      "content": "I've been playing with my curly hair for years and have had loads of success at some points and less at others. I moved country last year so had to start with finding products all over again, but then I got pregnant so suddenly was super limited on what I could use. Then had a baby and obviously just haven't had loads of time to think about it since having her! My curls are doing ok...but I've seen them look way better. But I'm just not sure what they need, or why! My hair is low porosity, 2c/3a, and moderately thick, I guess?\n\nI shampoo and condition with HASK moisturising curl care range. They seem fine but I'm not obsessed with them - I have a feeling they're only available in my country though. I rake mousse through soaking wet hair then coat with flat hands with gel - both from Trepadora, which I think is only available in my home country and I'm about to run out of! I wrap in a t-shirt and leave it for a bit and then diffuse. My hair seems a bit flat but I love volume, and my curls are not as defined as I'd like and drop quite quickly. It's pretty humid here, and I wear a bonnet to bed.\n\nI'd love recommendations for mousse and gel in particular. The brands easy to get here seem to be clever curls, curlsmith, cantu, shea moisture, giovanni, mielle, ORS, Camille Rose, and creme of nature and aussie.\n\nI've no idea if I need protein, hydration, clarifying, etc. How would I tell? What sounds likely from my routine? Please help me rediscover the joys of being a full-on curly girl!!",

I ask for the same cut every time and sometimes it’s better than others, but I don’t know WHY (using the same and different stylists). it’s always hit and miss. \n\nI feel like stylists don’t really cut for my type of hair, giving me layers that are too far or too close apart (?), in the wrong place (?), or feathered or something, which makes my hair look more thin and sparse, and the ends are always so thinned out and scraggly.\n\n6 months ago I went to a curly hair salon and got a terrible cut - uneven and some chunks missing around my face…for $200! You can see in the pics how uneven it is. I should have gone back for a fix but I didn’t. \n\nI’ve been growing it out and am ready to a new stylist and possible new style. \n\nBut I’m not sure what to ask for- layers that are closer together? No layers at all? Are they bad for fine hair? I think I also don’t really know enough about hair cutting to even use the right terminology. \n\nOld shorter cut:\nFinally - there is a hair cut I had many years ago which I loved (pic 5 and 6)-shorter than I wear it now), but a few times I’ve tried to get it again it has failed miserably: pics 7 and 8 (too short, not enough shape?) and pic 9 (too short, and too pouffy and round overall- was a common problem trying to get this cut)Should I try that one again and if so, what do I ask for specifically? \n\nRoutine:\nWash every other day, curly hair lotion then mousse on very wet hair. Air dry then fluff/scrunch out. \n\nThanks! ",
