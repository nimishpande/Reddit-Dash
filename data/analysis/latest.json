      "title": "Are there lots of layers in my hair? I cannot tell at all:((",
      "content": "This might be a stupid post to make but I don’t know who else to ask. Whenever I go to the hairdresser I ask for rounded layers and lots of them. Recently I went to get a proper curly cut (only person in town who does it) after searching once again. I cannot for the life of me see layers except at the very bottom. My mom keeps telling me I need to get more layers than what I have right now. It’s just not round in the back the way I wanted it. On YouTube there’s a woman (Marina Ann - two of her videos showing what I mean: https://youtube.com/shorts/irIaGDE11MU?si=YV3Jr3KhkTdLAjx0\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/2fafQ4UEKlA?si=Gs_Tr6Cq0tXpPfXM) cutting her own hair with lots of layers and I always show her video and tons of pictures at every hair appointment but it just never translates. \n\nCan anyone help me out if these are lots of decent layers? The hairdresser took off so much of my hair last time and I feel like she gave me a cut she gives everyone else. I asked for curtain bangs and had to cut those myself afterwards essentially because she didn’t cut them short enough like the old picture of my curtain bangs I once had which I showed to her. From some angles the bottom looks a bit sparse. I was thinking I might just try and cut it myself next time considering that these cuts are expensive. I’m just a bit wary since I tried a Wayne Tuggle haircut on my own and the bottom was super uneven. First few pictures attached show my hair after the cut once I’ve been styling it myself and the last couple (where it’s more defined) show right at my hair appointment. \n\nRoutine (new one - I’m still figuring out how to use all of these but my hair does look better):\n\nShampoo: innersense pure radiance or clarity hairbath\nConditioner: innersense color radiance conditioner\nStylers: innersense quiet calm curl control, innersense I create volume and I create hold, sometimes I create finish as well. \n\nThese are all very concentrated so I only need to use a tiny amount. I usually just rake the products through with tons of water and then scrunch a bit and get the excess water out with a towel. I switch between air drying and diffusing. Now that it’s cold, I diffuse (definitely not as neat or methodically as others though). \n\nI’d really appreciate someone’s thoughts! \n\n",

There’s a lot of products out there right now that promises to do this and that - the majority seems to be aimed at a younger demographic, with very few anti-aging, age-defying lines. Stripped of marketing, 1) does older hair need its own formulation 2) can or has it been done? ",

I'm so so happy and in love with my hair right now 🥹 I had the \"I had pin straight hair my entire life so I thought my hair was just frizzy straight\" experience. After discovering it was wavy, trying to figure out what the hell to do with it has been a big struggle. I cut off most of my bleach damaged ends a couple weeks ago which I think also helped a ton. My hair has never looked this nice. It feels so amazing to not hate and be frustrated with it for once.\n \nMy routine:\n1. Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Defining Shampoo and Conditioner — shampoo twice, apply conditioner and brush through with a curl defining brush (the one w/ the slots on the sides), leave in for ~5 minutes while I do the rest of my shower stuff and space out lol. Rinse by scrunching with water.\n2. Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner — Apply on sopping wet hair w/ praying hands, brush through, *don't scrunch*.\n3. Not Your Mother's Activating Curl Talk Mousse — Apply (lots) using prayer hands, brush through, scrunch, then microplop until hair is no longer sopping.\n4. Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Sculpting Gel — Lightly glaze over hair upside down, then each side. Microplop until hair is damp.\n5. Hover diffuse (warm air, low speed) upside down, then start pixie diffusing. Flip to the side, pixie diffuse, then other side. Rightside up, pixie diffuse with cold air. SOTC once fully dry with Olaplex oil.",

      "content": "• the first two pictures is what my skin used to look like without a stable routine at 24 years old, I became fed up and went to see a dermatologist\n• the middle ones are during my isotretinoin treatment, I begun with 10mg, then 20mg and later 40mg, during a 10 moth period. During this I only used moisturiser and sunscreen\n• the later one is me now almost a year off the meds and I’m struggling to find a good routine. \n\nAs you can see I don’t have acne anymore and my pores are generally smaller. But I still have that annoying hyperpigmentation on my nose lol and most mornings I wake up with these small red dots around my eyes. They do not itch nor are they raised but they are annoying…\n\nMy AM routine is skin food carotene toner pads, vita-c dark spot cream and then the BOJ sunscreen.\n\nMy PM routine is double cleansing with a balm, then a regular mild face soap with nothing special in it. Then I use the AXIS-Y dark spot corrector, trying not to use around my eyes, and later I use the cicaplast cream.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n- what can I use around my eyes to prevent the red spots (my eyes are very teary as well)\n• what day moisturiser do you recommend? (my vita-c is almost finished)\n• what serums or products do you recommend for minimising my pores and/or general glow\n\nI’m also looking into micro needling for my acne scars around my chin.\n\nThank you in advance!!! :D",

The texture is a bit sticky at first, kind of like a gel, but it spreads easily and absorbs after a minute or two. I started using it because my skin was getting red and flaky from the weather, and I noticed it really helped calm things down. My skin feels softer, looks smoother, and some of my old acne marks have started to fade. Makeup also goes on a lot better now.\n\nThe main pros are how gentle and hydrating it is. It helps repair irritation without stinging and works well even when my skin feels sensitive. The ingredient list is simple, and it layers nicely with other products. The downsides are that it takes time to see real results. It’s not a quick fix, and it can feel a little tacky, especially if you have oily skin or live in a humid climate. Overall, it’s a great option if you want to focus on hydration and barrier repair rather than aggressive acne treatment.",

It seems like BP is devastating for acne, but is it devastating for my skin cells too? 😭\n\nI read on incidecoder that it works by generating free radicals that kill bacteria, but that they also damage and age the skin. I read conflicting info on other sources, saying that it won't cause aging if you use antioxidants later, but I can't use vitamin C because my skin gets red, hot and swells up (I think I may be allergic), so it's not an option.\n\nDo you have any suggestions?

      "content": "So I've had acne for the last 4 years (I'm 18 now). Over time, I've had more and more pigmentation, as you can see, and I've tried things like tretinoin cream, but it only seemed to help remove pimples after they formed; it's not a permanent treatment, and it never helped with the pigmentation. On the underside of my nose, there's a pigmented area that looks like a burn, and pimples often appear there. I went to 3 doctors. The first 2 recommended doxycycline 100mg, but I didn't want to use it because of its side effects and because I saw many people say that acne comes back after you stop treatment. Then I went to a third one, and he told me to get Accutane. He then told me to get a blood sample from the lab so he could analyze it and give me confirmation on whether to use it or not Results came out good and he told me to use it. Two pills after dinner, moisturizer, sunscreen, and lip balm. Should I start it? I tried to make the pigmentation visible in the photo, but it's not very clear. Usually, I see Accutane being prescribed for cases that look much more severe than mine, which is why I'm hesitant. It apparently causes Aneamia too.",

It’s mostly a sensory thing since I don’t like getting my face wet, but also I am lazy and it’s too much work for me, especially because I’d have to put on my headband and wrist bands to avoid getting wet. I used to remove make up/cleanse by using makeup wipes and then micellar water, but I later learned that makeup wipes are bad for your skin. Now I either use only micellar water that removes makeup, or sometimes I’ll use water and cleansing balm beforehand (but I don’t like it). I don’t have acne or major skin issues — just dry skin. I like the idea of just using cotton pads and an oil like this and then micellar water and cotton pads after. It’s easy, and I don’t get my face or hands wet in the process (or make a mess of my counter). Thoughts? ",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
