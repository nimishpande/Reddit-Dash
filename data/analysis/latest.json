Super over processed, barely curling, and generally weighing my hair down. I went and cut some layers into my hair (I am a hairstylist but I am also a lot more haphazard with my own hair), trying to avoid the perimeter as much as possible to preserve length. It brought a lot of the spring factor back and fixed the wonky shape that was happening too. So yeah, whether you cut it yourself or get someone else to do it- let go of those dead ends. \n\nRoutine (pic 2):\nWash with Innersense clarity hairbath and hydrating cream conditioner. Section into top and bottom, add the doux pop lock glaze on soaking wet hair. Brush through with a 3 row denman comb (not the brush, it’s different). Scrunch, diffuse. ",

I feel like the reason why is my routine, which goes like this: As I Am rosemary shampoo, and run it through my hair loosely and scrub scalp, As I am rosemary conditioner, and loosely let it through my hair, and then wash through and air dry, and i think this loose washing is leading to the mildew, but if i rake my hands through my hair, it makes my hair frizzy and pulls apart the curls. Does anyone know what I’m doing wrong or if my hair is healthy/how i can treat it better?

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Until last year, when I developed this persistent hormonal acne around the mouth. \n\nI have tried benzyl peroxide, deoxycycline, adapalene, spearmint tea, zinc supplements, silk pillowcases, changing toothpaste brands, etc, but nothing has worked. The antibiotics did work while I was on them but the problem came right back. I'm limited on what other things I can try since I have other health conditions, so going back on accutane etc isn't an option. Not on birth control or any contraception that could be causing it.\n\nCurrently have a minimal routine of cerave blemish control cleanser and the standard moisturiser, with spf in the mornings and adapalene in the evenings.\n\nany advice on what could have caused the issue and what could help would be appreciated. acne followed big life transition (graduating masters and moving home from the UK to NZ) which could be a factor.",

Usually it takes me around 20 minutes to detangle maybe a bit more when I go 2 weeks without doing it. However this is the worst knot I have ever had in my life time. It is like 3 knots (red circles) and majority of my hair. I spent almost all of yesterday combing it but still barely any progress. I feel like giving up and cutting it but i dont want to. Please any help or advice would be so appreciated. I am crying I dont want to lose my hair. \n\nTypical Weekly Routine (because required):\nOil hair with rosemary and caster oil let sit 30 minutes to 3 hours\nShampoo twice\nCondition and detangle \nConditioning mask\nScrunch with skill scarf and add some gel and leave in conditioner \nWrap in scarf for an hour\nDefuse ",

The last few haircuts I've had have been really bomb!! Despite this, my hair always looks so bad. It's not damaged, I never use heat or straighten my hair, I don't colour or bleach it. So it should be very healthy but it's always frizzy af!\n\nI have always just let my hair air dry, or blow-dried it with a regular hair dryer on low (which is terrible), because I could never figure out how to use a diffuser!! I finally decided to invest in the shark flexstyle hair dryer and it comes with a diffuser attachment... Omg it's a game changer. My curls have never looked better! Air drying always left my hair so flat and simultaneously frizzy, and now I have nice juicy voluminous curls! It's amazing. I definitely recommend the shark or whatever kind of fancy diffuser you're looking at getting! People complain that the shark is loud, but honestly, as a sound-sensitive person, it really isn't that bad as long as you're not aiming it directly into your ear haha.\n\n*(Routine: shampoo (Ouai detox), conditioner (AG curl fresh), out of the shower I spray the innate life's neroli primer on my hair, then used the mielle Rosemary mint cream, and AG CARE mousse-gel. Then diffused with shark. Amazing)*",

But I’m home for Christmas in a very dry, cold climate and after washing and diffusing, the curls were so loose, the next day it was basically straight lol. I know humidity can make curly hair curlier, but is there nothing I can do to replicate the results in a dryer climate? Or is what I’m seeing in this dryer climate more true to my actual curl pattern? It’s seriously making me wonder if I even have curly hair. \n\nI just recently started embracing my natural hair so this is my first time back at home styling my curly hair. \n\nRoutine: \n1. Shampoo and conditioner - dove curl repair \n2. I don’t use a leave in as I have fine hair and I find it’s too much product for it. I use the Marc Anthony strictly curls curl cream and the umberto Giannini scrunching jelly (at home I usually use a mouse as well, but I didn’t bring it with me)\n3. I style in two sections, my bottom layer first and then my crown. I apply the cream, then gel, style with my bounce define brush and scrunch. I do the same for the top layer\n4. I use a cotton tshirt for the excess water and then diffuse until fully dry and scrunch once more with an oil \n\nHeres a picture of what my hair typically looks like. \n",

      "content": "Treatment Recommendations?\n\nHi everyone! I’m going to be living in Korea for a year next year and as you all know the skin treatments there are next level and way cheaper than in the West! I want to do some more intensive treatments as well as some maintenance treatments while i’m there in order to address some issues I have with my skin. I’m 22yo if it helps. I’ve thought about rejuran and potenza to address hyperpigmentation and indents from acne but not sure if they’re the best to address these issues. \n\nConcerns:\n- hyperpigmentation (PIH/PIE) from acne and sun freckles (I wear sunscreen daily and reapply especially during summers but some sun freckles have been here since I was young and I seem to have developed more in the recent years… not sure why.)\n- skin indents from acne \n(i have some indentation in my skin from acne scars? but they’re not too deep like how it can be with some extreme acne scars but I’d like to reduce the appearance of the indents if possible as some of them it makes the spot look dark like freckles or acne hyperpigmentation)\n- redness \n(i get red in some spots contributed by PIE i believe. i also have some broken capillaries around my nose which make it always red)\n- clogged pores \n(my breakouts now always start off with a closed comedone before erupting into a red fat pimple. I do use AHAs and BHAs throughout the week but I can’t seem to avoid the comedones)\n\nThanks for the read and hopefully reply :)\n\n \n",

What i like about my haircut now is mostly just the length and bangs, what i dont like is how the shorter layers are wavy but the rest isnt and how i cant really get much volume/wavyness. id really like to have more volume and waves, but i feel like id have to cut my hair short which is spooky bc every time ive had short hair it was super unflattering on me. Im up for anything really but i want to keep the bangs.\n\nHair routine:\n\nCerave dandruff shampoo\n\nNative cactus flower shampoo\n\nNative shea butter conditioner on mid-end\n\nStyle with just water and scrunch usually, curler in bangs. Sometimes i use that “girls with curls” spray and for special occasions whatever curl cream i have atm, i also use iroiro plum hair dye ",

Yes, 8 months.\n\nI tried tons of moisturizers ranging from Vanicream to vaseline, to $80 moisturizers. I spent thousands on facials, I switched to clean hair care, and could not be out in the sun, use SPF, or wear makeup for 8 months because it was causing itchy dermatitis reactions that would erupt into hundreds of white heads. I was heart broken. Nothing worked. I was prescribed antibiotics multiple times and different creams, but I knew in my heart what my skin needed was moisture.\n\nI stumbled upon EpiCeram and got it from BlinkRx for only $39. In 5 days my skin is noticeably different. It's supple, it's literally HEALING FINALLY. It looks AMAZING.\n\nIf anyone out there has any severe skin issue, please get this stuff. It saved me!!\n\n[After SPF use, would start like this than break out into white heads everywhere.](https://preview.redd.it/qsj61rgfnv8g1.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ebed1893e628cbf706a108344e3884617991750)",
