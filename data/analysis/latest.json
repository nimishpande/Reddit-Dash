My hairline hasn’t really came back but the thickness in my hair is 10x so I’m honestly not super bothered by it not filling in. The hair that’s filling the bald spot in the back is still a little thinner than the rest of my hair but it’s not noticeable to anyone anymore. ",

      "content": "TL;DR: I like my wash day results, but my curls fall apart fast. Need help with frizz and longer-lasting hold without weighing hair down.\n\nHello!\nI only discovered my true hair texture about 1.5 years ago, and it’s definitely been a journey. I’m still trying to find the best styling routine for my hair and struggling a bit with consistency.\n\nSo far, my favourite results come from using Sebastian Professional Potion 9 as a leave-in and the L’Oréal Curl Expression mousse. I love how soft my hair feels with this combo, but as you can probably tell from the pictures, I still get some frizz, and the curls don’t really hold well past day 2.\n\nI’ve tried Olaplex No.10 gel before, but even after scrunching out the cast, I never seem to get it right and I don’t love the final result.\n\nI was wondering if anyone has recommendations for gel products that improve hold without weighing hair down, or\nany other tweaks/products that could help with frizz and longevity. My hair is thick, and I believe it’s medium porosity.\n\nCurrent routine (2x per week):\n- Double wash with Wella Nutricurls shampoo\n- Wella Nutricurls mask\n- Out of the shower, I detangle with a Denman brush while hair is very wet\n- I don’t towel-dry at all, just scrunch out excess water with my hands\n- Sebastian Professional Potion 9 (scrunched in)\n- L’Oréal Curl Expression mousse (scrunched in)\n- Diffuse\n- Finish with a tiny bit of Wella Oil Reflections\n\nRefresh:\n- Re-wet hair with a spray bottle\n- Small amount of leave-in\n- Diffuse\n\nI usually sleep with a lose pineapple bun with a lose scrunchie.\n\nThanks so much in advance! 😊",

Then, after washing hair, comb out hair while soaking wet and upside down, scrunching excess water out with an old tshirt. Then, add the tiniest pea sized amount of Aussie Miracle Curls frizz taming cream and emulsify in hands before scrunching it into all possible areas of hair. Finally, go at it with the Herbal Essences curl boosting mousse, scrunch that in and make sure there’s still no more excess water in the hair. Finally, diffuse fully!

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I’ve tweaked this over the years, and finally feel like I’m in a good place where it’s not overly complicated, budget friendly, and my skin isn’t super reactive, but nothing is really being improved-just maintained if that makes sense? I still have extreme oiliness when I wake up in the morning and then about an hour after washing my face. The sebaceous filaments (at least I think that’s what they are?) make my t-zone feel/look like sandpaper. I only ever see a difference after I use lactic acid or a physical exfoliant, but don’t want to do that on a daily basis and dry my face out. There’s also redness and waxy bumps around my nose which may be seborrheic dermatitis, but it’s never been diagnosed by a derm. I have some splotchy redness on my cheeks, but never diagnosed rosacea. Looks more like irritated pores. I did try Paula’s Choice azaleic acid for a while and didn’t notice a difference. I’m 36, and starting to accept the fine lines around my mouth and eyes. I understand there isn’t anything very anti-aging in my routine, but I’m afraid to add a retinol and my skin become super stripped again. But maybe the retinol would help with the bumps if incorporated the right way? 🤷‍♀️\n\nJust to throw out what I also do consistently that might be suggested: change pillowcase frequently, drink as much water as possible (still probably drink too much coffee), put serums/essences on damp skin, dermaplane every month (moving towards decreasing this as a result of stopping minoxidil which caused excessive facial hair). I can’t really afford to add daily supplements to my routine although I did notice a difference when I took omegas. My skin has also improved (no more cystic acne) when I had my IUD removed and went off all hormonal BC. I’d love routine and product recommendations from others with this skin type! ❤️\n\nRoutine below:\n\nAM\n\nWash with \\*\\*LRP Toleraine Purifying Foam Cleanser (\\*\\*I’ve tried not washing and more milky cleaners and they don’t remove the dirt/oil and eventually cause breakouts).\n\nApply **Biossance Copper Peptides** on damp skin\n\n**Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence**\n\n**Cosrx Advanced Snail 92 All in One Cream** (I’ve found this to be a great prep for my skin tint)\n\n**Biossance Squalane Marine Algae Eye Cream**\n\n\\*spray thermal water between steps\\*\n\nPM\n\nDouble cleanse with \\*\\*Farmacy Green Clean Cleansing Balm (\\*\\*HG) and follow with the same LRP AM cleanser or **Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant**\n\nEvery two nights, **TO Lactic Acid 10%**\n\n**Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence**\n\nMoisturize with **Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer** (in tube)\\*\\*…still not sure how I feel about this. Like the consistency but may be contributing to cc’s.\n\n**Biossance Squalane Marine Algae Eye Cream**\n\nOnce a week, **TO Glycolic Acid 7%** and **LRP Cicaplast Balm** instead of Vanicream or whenever skin is feeling irritated.\n\n\\*\\*Also I live in a humid climate and have noticed a great deal of improvement in my skin when it’s summer/I’m out in the sun.",

I've tried to french braid my hair multiple times and it never works. In fact I can't really do anything with my hair apart from wearing it down, low pony tail or a single braid (not french braid). Like I cant even do a high pony tail. I really need help be​cause I am getting so frustrated with myself and my hair because I can't do anything.

I am wondering if anyone can explain to me scientifically the discussion and recommendation of not washing the hair until 48-72 hours after a color service due to the cuticle not being “completely closed”. I know cuticles dont work like blinds that just open and close. In my experience, washing 24 hours after color shouldn’t affect the longevity because the color doesn’t continue processing &amp; the conditioner seals with an acidic pH. I’m confusedddd",

I had to stop using my glycolic acid as my skin never tolerated it after that. And pretty much everything I used after Microneedling my skin became reactive to (oil blends, Estée Lauder ANR, niacinamide, etc).\n\nAnd flash forward to now… I have aged ten years. I have this horrible crepe texture all over, that wrinkles up when I move my face. All of that is new. What can I do if my skin won’t tolerate acids? It’s very dry here in cold Vermont right now, so to combat this I’m using:\n\n \n\n(Cleanse with water or cetaphil dry skin)\n\n1. Avene thermal spray \n\n2. Vanicream face moisturizer \n\n3. Vanicream lotion (in tub)\n\n4. Aquaphor on dry spots\n\n5. SPF if I go outside for longer than 15 min\n\n6. Azelaic acid (just on my chin where I get cysts, my face can’t tolerate it anywhere else)\n\nI try to drink plenty of water. I am outside every day because we have a farm. How common is it to age so rapidly like this? How do I hydrate my skin more, or what could I try? Im only 39 and up until this year I looked younger than my friends, got compliments on my skin… now I feel like my skin looks 70 😭 ",

I was hesitant and told my mom \"am i just testing​ products now? Like a lab rat? \". Anyways i gave in and and mixed tiny miny drops on my forehead and used it on my whole face. Next day my skin was literally radiant.\n\nWhat i used were ​​​​**Fito** and **Hametan** from Abdiibrahim,\n\n**Madecassol** and **Bepanthen** Plus from​ Bayer.\n\nAnd trust me when i say radiant it was movie star radiant. Just gorgeous.\n\nBut this last few days ive been breaking out with comedones and pimples down my neck. My cheek and neck never had anything before but now they have​ deep ​​cheek comedones(idk what to call them but theyre too skin colored to be pimples)​​. I even have a milia now! I then started my deep research and saw that they're for repairing skin. So any scars, burns, acne scars, inflammation, dryness... They're good for many stuff. But i repeat. If you have ongoing issues with acne and comedones... Dont. They clog pores. \n\nNow that i have worse skin (i jinxed myself) what do i do? The products i use went like this step by step.\n\nCeraVe acne control cleanser\n\nSulfur soap\n\nTea tree soap\n\nToner made by my pharmacist\n\nCeraVe eye repair​ cream\n\nThen i used those creams :\"0 and didnt use moisturizer othen than my lips since they moisturized the skin. ​\n\nI used Neutrogena deep moisture beforehand\n\n**I need reccomendations chemical or natural, any steps i should add?** ​\n\nAlso i started getting lash crust because i forgot to remove my makeup so i also would appreciate advice on that.\n\nedit: typo",

It’s very dull as well.\n\nI’ve dyed my hair from 2012-2018. The last thing I did to my hair was stripping black dye out of it, and then chopped it. All of my current hair is natural and never been colored. But somehow my hair felt and looked healthier when I was coloring it 😭 I had texture, it was soft, shiny, and never got tangled. I’m just so bored and frustrated with it now, so I only wear it up in claw clips or braids.\n\nI’d like advice on how to add shine and softness, without breaking the bank or making the oil so much worse. I alternate washes with Dove Dryness &amp; Itch Relief shampoo, and Mane ‘n Tail shampoo, then Mane ‘n Tail conditioner on the mid/ends every time. I’ve seen the whole trend of “training” hair, and I’ve been washing my hair once a week for about a year now. I used to wash it daily, but I feel like it made the oil as well as the dryness so much worse. I don’t really use heat on it, just blow drying it on warm. Then on about day 4, I use Good Ass Hair Day dry shampoo powder on, and it gets me through until wash day. \n\nAny advice/opinions are welcome. Thank you!",

I always wear SPF 100 (Anthelios) on top during the day.\nLast night my daughter mentioned that my dark spot looked much darker than usual, and this morning I noticed what appears to be a new dark spot forming that definitely wasn’t there before. It looked like it popped up overnight. I honestly panicked.\nI called La Roche-Posay customer support and they told me to stop using the product. When I looked it up, I saw mentions of a possible paradoxical reaction, where increased skin cell turnover can sometimes cause pigment to rise to the surface and look darker before improving early in treatment. I also read that not wearing sunscreen can worsen pigmentation with this product — but I have been very diligent with SPF (Anthelios 100).\nI had really high hopes for this serum, so this has been discouraging and scary.\nHas anyone else experienced darkening or new spots when starting MelaB3? Did it eventually improve, or did stopping help?",
