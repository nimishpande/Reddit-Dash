Yeah so Tretinoin really does work if used according to your skins needs. (If you want to ask about peeling, then yes it peeled for first one year and now also it peels but significantly low peeling, and strangely the peeling kinda reduced when I jumped from 0.05% to 0.1%, so yeah it might take different durations for your skin to adapt to the peeling).

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Here is what I gathered so far:\n\n* HairLoss Channel on YouTube says once daily is fine.\n* Some studies suggest twice daily is “optimal” and can give \\~20% better regrowth\n* Some users argue minoxidil stays active on the scalp for \\~22 hours, so once should be enough.\n* But then I’ve seen comments saying that by the end of the day, the concentration is too low if you only apply once so twice would be better.\n\n**My routine:**\n\n* Dutasteride daily\n* Finasteride daily\n* Minoxidil once daily (with 0.25 dermastamping EOD \\~30 mins before application)\n* 1.5 dermastamping once every 2 weeks and skip minox that day\n* PS: Where I live - Tretionion and oral minox are unavailable\n\nBeen consistent for 5+ years. My scalp skin is pretty thick from all the dermastamping lol so I rarely bleed, just some redness. Started late in my hair loss journey (around Norwood 3) since I always had thin hair and my temples were pretty high since young age, and nobody told me about thinning crown. Treatments have helped me a lot, I managed to keep what I have, thicken things up, and get some regrowth, but not enough to cover everything properly without using styling/masking products.\n\nIf I can expect around 20% improvement, I’d go for it. If it's none or lower than 20% I would skip it since all these meds are pretty pricey.\n\n  \nEdit: Some errors about my routine",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI am 27 and I am starting to see some signs of aging in my skin. I'm wondering how I can better support my skin to keep it looking great as I approach 30. My main area of concern is my forehead, which has some fine lines that have become prominent over the last year. I have normal to dry skin, mostly struggling with the dryness in the wintertime as the air gets really dry where I am. I don't have a lot of issues with acne but I do have a sensitivity to fragrance, which poses an issue when finding products. I'd love to get in to Korean skincare, but I don't know where to start.\n\nMy current routine is not great, and I know that. I struggle most with face washing because I am autistic and have sensory issues so I can't really do it in the sink. I wash my face in the shower every evening. My sensory issues pose a problem when choosing products as well. I've spent a lot of money over time trying out a bunch of sunscreens and I can't wear any of them because I hate the way they feel on my face. The greasiness is what gets me. My current products absorb right into the skin, which is what I need from any product or I won't be able to use it. \n\nMy current routine:\n\nMorning: Lacura anti-wrinkle day cream\n\nEvening: Wash face with locally made goat milk soap\n\nSalicylic acid toner\n\nLacura anti-wrinkle night cream\n\nLike I said, it's not great, but I want to do better for my skin and my body, so any advice you may have is very appreciated! Thank you!",

I go through phases of having it naturally wavy, but each time it comes out differently - sometimes the way I want it, and other times it’s just a pain (like fluffy/frizzy on top, just not as nice as the curls/waves underneath) - and I guess this is where I need advice on how to avoid this and what styling products to use! I am open to trying mousse/gels etc but worried about it looking hard and sticky? \n\nI will try my best to explain my routine and also put pics up. I wash my hair with redken all soft, and brush it with a wet brush as soon as I get out. I then use ‘as I am’ leave in hair conditioner cream for curls. I also add a small bit of macadamia oil. Then I leave it to dry naturally, and I found what works better for me if sort of twisting sections and then leaving it. When it’s dry I then shake my hair upside down etc so it goes more volume. As it’s winter sometimes to hurry it up I do use diffuser right at the end but in the summer I can leave it to dry fast. \n\nSo the first pic is my hair today (bad hair day lol) fluffy on top etc. 2nd pic is what I do when my hair is wet, I twist it like that (I did used to scrunch it, not sure why I do this now lol maybe to avoid frizz) and 3rd pic is a better hair day, but it’s rare lol.\n\nAny advice etc is much appreciated!

I’ve left my hair alone for some time now so I have fully virgin hair, my natural colour.\n\nI went for a consultation for a cut+colour+bleaching for bright pink hair. Everything went well and when I got my quote it was £220 for all of that. It also comes with an olaplaex treatment as standard she said. At the time I was low on money and wanted to save so I asked if she could just bleach it and if I could colour it myself at home, she said yes, all was good. She said that would come to just £185, which I was okay with.\na few weeks go by and I haven’t booked in to get it done yet because I’m working so much around Christmas. But in January I book myself in for my cut+bleaching because I have more time. She then tells me, about a week later, that if my hair comes out uneven then she may have to use a toner to get it there, and that that would be raised back to the original £220, but if I was okay with having it potentially being uneven then I could just pay £185.\n\nNow I said that was fine and I could pay because I got enough money to treat myself to this over Christmas, but now I’m left wondering wether she was not going to tone me in the first place, and why wasn’t it extra then?

I’ve always been self conscious about them. I finally landed on a solid routine that has cleared it up. I have smooth arms that I am no longer self-conscious about. I wanted to come here and share my routine to hopefully help some other people out. So here it is:\n\nIn the shower I use Naturiums the smoother glycolic acid body wash with a Goshi towel.\n\nI give a good scrub all over my arms (and the rest of my body). I do this almost daily. You can start a few times a week if you’re worried about drying out.\n\nAfter the shower, I use Naturiums bio lipid restoring body lotion.\n\nI seal it in with palmers cocoa butter formula skin therapy oil - like one pump rubbed between hands then really massage it in on your arms.\n\nA few times a week (more if in the winter) I will use beef tallow on the backs of my arms right before bed! I feel this really makes a difference. I love this one ([ https://summersolacetallow.com/collections/all-skincare/products/slow-made-pure-unscented-pasture-raised-moisturizing-tallow-balm ](https://summersolacetallow.com/collections/all-skincare/products/slow-made-pure-unscented-pasture-raised-moisturizing-tallow-balm))\n\nNow, if you’re showering right before bed you might choose to forego the lotion/oil and just use the tallow after exfoliating in the shower.\n\nNote- I do use this method on the rest of my body when I have time/feel like it and it does feel luxurious. I hope if you try this, it helps! Xo",
