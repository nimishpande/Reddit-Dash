For years now I’ve seen posts of all you curly haired gods and goddesses simply wrapping your curls at night and waking up as though you’ve just spent 2 hours doing your hair. I just don’t get it! To me the idea of my curls lasting more than a day is an utter mystery.\n\nI’ve tried it all. Ive used a bonnet, clips, a wrap, cast with gel before bed, and more and yet every time i wake up my hair looks like the 2nd picture. How in the world do people do it? Am I doomed to have to spend several hours in the bathroom every morning to not hate the way I look?\n\nRoutine: I use argan oil of Morocco shampoo once a week, shea moisture curl and shine conditioner, shea moisture mouse, a heat protectant and detangler from Amika, a diffuser, and rosemary oil.\n\nEDIT: More routine info for mods. The products are applied in that order and scrunched in in sections. I dry with the diffuser and separate curls with oiled fingers.",

EVERY TIME my hair gets thin past my shoulders. Doesn't matter if I do a big reset chop (20cm+), it gets stringy in the ends immediately afterwards. The last time my hair looked fine was when I was 18 (2021), second photo. \n\nThe \"long\" hair isn't damaged either; I can brush it smoothly and can't detect split ends. It just feels like I have \"underwool\" that doesn't want to get longer and just becomes more coily while my top hair is rather wavy.\n\nFor my routine, I am a simple gal: Use drugstore (Balea professional Traumlocken) conditioner on my ends during shower, then wash with Schauma shampoo. Rinse, scrunch in some conditioner again and squeeze out water. Depending on what I have going on, I might use mousse (Balea Schaumfestiger Locken) and sometimes Gel (Balea Locken Scrunchgel). At night I put my hair up in a protective bun. 95% of the time I air dry. Wash every second day.\n\nThere's been no change in routine between those pictures I have to add, other than that I went from school to uni and in the second picture I had an ED, so it makes even less sense that my hair was looking alright lol",

I’ve always felt unsure about my hairstyle, especially because I think my nose is on the bigger side and I worry my curls make my features stand out more instead of balancing my face. My photos I posted go from last night (first 3) to this morning before water (4-6) to after water at 7-8\n\nI’d really appreciate honest advice on how to better define my curls\n\nReducing frizz\n\nWhether a different cut would suit my face better\n\nHow to maintain volume without it puffing out\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nShampoo: Not Your Mother’s Curl Defining Shampoo\n\nConditioner: (none currently)\n\nStyling: I’ve only tried using water in the morning to restyle\n\nDrying: I let it air dry\n\nhair protection: none \n\nmy routine\n\njust water in the morning\n\nRight after washing it looks decent, but by morning it pushes outward and gets frizzy. When I try to restyle with water, it just expands more instead of defining.\n\nI’ve never really had a structured routine before, so I’m open to product suggestions, technique advice, haircut recommendations, or anything else that could help.\n\nThanks in advance.",

      "title": "[Anti-Aging] Spilling the Tea, 38yo F (Looks 25) Routine (Many things you have Never Heard of)",
      "content": "This is a long post, but I promise you, you're going to learn a lot.\n\nI usually gate keep but today I am feeling generous. I know Sigmund Freud said that, \"if you care about future generations when you're older you are at the appropriate maturity for your age\" or something like that. Perhaps since I am married and have been in a relationship for 17 years now and I am almost 39 (almost 40) I don't feel the need to gate keep anymore because I no longer need to worry about being \"out there\" among other women. So now I pass the torch onto you guys so you can benefit from my wisdom.\n\nThis will be in three parts. First one is general tips (young women especially need to hear), second one is what I have been doing over the years, third is what I do now and why (the juicy tea)\n\nI have had ZERO work done. No fillers, botox, surgeries, hyaluronic fillers. I haven't even gotten a spa or salon treatment once in my life.\n\n\\---------------------------General tips---------------------------\n\n\\#1 95-98% of skincare is not worth your time. It is either too expensive for what you get, does not have enough research to back it up, or doesn't actually penetrate the top layer of the skin (gets to the deeper layers) + it isn't something you actually need. If you have sensitive skin and you use an acid now your skin is inflamed so then you use something to calm it down when all you needed to do is stop using the acid.\n\n\\#2 Skincare is the last thing you should try to improve your skin. If your gut, nutrition, sleep, stress level, and other things are in ill repair then no skincare product is going to help you. Inside first. I highly recommend you get your blood tested for all vitamins / minerals two times a year to make sure you have no deficiencies. Almost all skin and health issues can lead to starting with a vitamin deficiency. Example: you have dark under eye circles, this could mean you are deficient in iron or folate or both, no cream is going to fix that until you get your iron or folate up to normal levels.\n\n\\#3 15 step skincare, morning sheds, etc (similar to #1) it's all BS. They are all just trying to sell you things and you keep falling for it.\n\n\\#4 If it works for you, don't stop until it doesn't. Don't try something new, why \"fix\" something that doesn't need fixing? If you feel the need to replace something that is already working with something new, the problem is actually either FOMO, a shopping addiction, or dopamine issues, your brain is your first priority (get off Tiktok)\n\n\\#5 Stop trying to \"stop aging\" that is never going to happen. Yes I look much younger than my age but I still look older than 18. You're never going to remain looking 18 forever. Have realistic goals. It's very possible to look 10-15 years younger than your age but you're never gonna be 18 forever.\n\n\\#6 Beauty draws them in, your personality is what keeps you around. In the long run, who you are is always more important.\n\n\\#7 Topical and supplemental collagen is BS. Collagen will not penetrate the top or deep layers of the skin so it is useless as a topical. Oral / supplemental collagen will provide you with some protein, but it is an incomplete protein so it will not repair / rebuild muscle or skin. Instead, take amino acids first thing in the morning that has ALL essential amino acids. I recommend \"Perfect Aminos\"\n\n\\-----------------What I have been doing over the years-----------------\n\n\\---The Early years (16-23) - Not a lot. I had mild acne and would use acid face washes, Proactive, and sunscreen everyday. I started working at GNC when I was 19 and started getting into supplements which included things for beauty, I can't remember what I took then. I tried some Japanese brightening lotions for a hot minute as well as Japanese beauty candy containing collagen, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin c (worked amazing, made me so pink and glowing)\n\n\\---My 20s (23-29) - I was using a lot of Estee Lauder skincare during this time, the Night Repair, neck lotion, and eye cream as well as taking collagen, vitamin c, biotin, and a few other things\n\n\\---The Years Before today (29-38) - I experimented and researched hundreds of things during this time to refine what I now know today. There was so much during this time that I don't even remember 90% of it. The only thing I do the same from this era that I still do is take many of the same supplements.\n\n\\---------------------------What I do now---------------------------\n\n\\#1. Weekly micro needling at home - This is one of the truly proven things you can do for aging that works. Much like how you damage your muscles to grow them and like how moving your body slightly traumatizes your bones to remain strong, small amounts of damage to the body is what keeps you healthy and resilient. There is nothing that traumatizes the skin on a regular basis that is in the deeper layers of the skin therefore the body is not constantly repairing it. When you micro needle, your body then uses its resources to repair micro damage done to the deeper layers of the skin creating microscopic scars that toughen and strengthen the skin. DO NOT use a rolling micro needling device. This is literally the worst thing you can do for your skin. As the needles roll out, they are pushing away from the pierced sight and ripping out. Think of it like you shoveling dirt at an angle, the hole is thicker than the shovel. I use a manual press style micro needling tool where the only thing that is going on is you pierce and pull out in the exact same spot so the only damage truly going on is very small holes. I micro needle my face (eyelids included at 0.25mm) and neck once a week as well as my decolletage, hands, and forearms once a month (deeper piercing). To avoid infection I make sure to wash the skin and then apply a mixture of rubbing alcohol with some tea tree oil in it. Afterward I wash my face and apply the mixture again. The tool itself I wash with soap, then dunk in bleach water, then finish with spraying with alcohol. There is always a risk doing it at home or in a clinic (infection). I have been doing it for 2 years with no problems.\n\n\\#2 The Skincare - Most skincare is not truly helping because it is not penetrating the deeper layers of the skin it just sits on top of the top layer. It doesn't make it useless, it's just repairing far less than you think. Wrinkles and fine lines run deeper than the surface layer. I make my own serum using beta glucan powder. This holds water and plumps the skin much better than hyaluronic acid because it actually goes into the deeper layers of the skin, hyaluronic acid only works on the surface level. I use beta glucan all over my face, neck and hands (twice a day). I use a 0.5% trentinoin from Musley all over my face and neck (once at night). Trentinoin is proven stronger than retinol. I use spf 50 all over ANY skin showing that day and wear it all day (reapplication all day). I use Allies of Skin's Multi Peptide in my chin fold (under lips) and around my eyes for extra fine line / wrinkle support the Trentinoin isn't giving. I use Volufiline mixed into my lip cream and mixed into the Allies of Skin Multi Peptide. Volufiline works by engorging fat tissue to expand and become larger, this will not make anything huge, rather, it will fill out the area with about 5-10% more volume after doing it for 6+ months. I use Cle de Peau's Lip Serum (twice a day). I wash my face with bar soap (seriously). I use Lancome's Bi-Facial make-up remover and don't wash my face at night. Over washing your face is what is aging you and giving you acne. Lastly, I use Strivectin's TL Advanced Tightening Neck Cream Plus on my neck, decolletage, and face twice a day. So, four products on the face (beta glucan, sunscreen, trentinoin, Strivectin), four on the eyes (beta glucan, trentinoin, peptide, volufiline), three on the lips (beta glucan, lip serum, volufiline) and four on the neck (beta glucan, trentinoin, Strivectin, sunscreen) THAT'S IT! No sheet masks, 10 step, 15 step. Simplicity and the best of what your skin needs is all you need.\n\n\\#3 Exercising bone &amp; muscle in the face - You ever see one of those posts of a much older woman (60s, 70s, or 80s) that has an amazing body like they're 30 but their face shows their age? Here is the disconnect: they haven't been micro damaging the bone and muscle in their face like they have been with their body. As I said, the body grows through small amounts of damage to it. \"He's ripped\" literally comes from the knowledge that the muscle rips &amp; tears and repairs itself to get bigger. As we know, muscle on the body = toned &amp; firm. You can do the same to your face as well. So every other day I do 10-15 facial yoga exercises to cover every muscle in my face and neck. Then to make sure the fascia in my face remains bouncy every other day (opposing day to the facial yoga) I do gua sha all over my face and neck. This contours, fills, and keeps your face structured nice and tight, we don't neglect the muscles in our body, but we do with the face. Gua sha and facial yoga also puts strain on the bone of your face keeping your muscle tighter and more attached to your skull leading to less sagging skin.\n\n\\#4 Supplements (beauty related) - I take, \"Perfect Aminos\" with my coffee first thing in the morning, in the middle of my morning workout, and before I go to bed, this is the equivalent of three servings of chicken for only 3 calories. Complete amino acids are far more effective at building collagen and skin than taking a collagen supplement. I take a womens probiotic first thing in the morning with my coffee and one before bed, this keeps my gut and skin flora healthy (fights off acne). Lastly, all of these supplements I take throughout the day with food. 400 mg of hyaluronic acid for skin plumpness. Methylated multivitamin (10x) for over all health, including skin. Sea buckthorn oil for softness and elasticity. Silica for building bone, collagen, and elastin. Rosemary for hair growth. Nettle for hair growth. Turmeric for detoxification. MSM to build collagen and elastin. NAD+ for circulation leading to better skin. CoQ10 for circulation leading to better skin. Chlorophyll for detoxification (+ prevents body odor). Fisetin a general anti-aging. Lastly, HMB for delaying muscle degeneration (preserves face muscles too).\n\n\\#5 Candylipz - To maintain volume, I do Candylipz pumping twice a day. This works through exercising and traumatizing the muscles in your lips to make them more plump.\n\n\\#6 The Other Stuff - Daily I use the \"Cutis\" by Shawana Vali, this has been recent, it is new and so far I like it, it has been helping with the tiny bit of jowls I have been developing. I get 8 hours of sleep every night. I eat a keto diet. I do a 16 hour fast everyday. I lift heavy weights. I did not have children. I drink plenty of water and I do everything I can to be calm and stress-free.\n\nAsk me anything you'd like.",

However, I’m still dealing with a lot of congestion specifically along my jawline and chin.\n\nIn the photo you’ll see:\n\n•\tVisible clogged pores and blackheads\n\n•\tA lot of small white bumps that never come to a head\n\n•\tIf I squeeze them really hard, a little bit of white will come out, but the bump never fully goes away\n\n•\tThey tend to stick around and I continuously get more in the same area\n\nThey’re concentrated mostly along my jawline and chin. They’re not painful cysts like before, just stubborn, persistent bumps that don’t resolve.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n•\tLa Roche-Posay cleanser\n\n•\tSnail mucin\n\n•\tMilky toner\n\n•\tRetinol eye cream\n\n•\tI alternate between Pond’s moisturizer and Medicube ceramide cream\n\nI’m wondering:\n\n•\tCould one of these products be clogging me?\n\n•\tDoes this sound like closed comedones, milia, fungal acne, or something else?\n\nI’d really appreciate any insight on what this might be and how to treat it.

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Even though it messed with me mentally my skin was perfect for months after up until about january when I went back to school after being on break. This is when I started eating worse and eating more sugary things which i’m now trying to sugar cleanse to see if itll help. However i’ve noticed my acne worsens each day and don’t know what to do. I feel like only pills help me. My AM routine consists of Gentle cleanse, Niacinimide, Clindamycin, Moisturizer and a sunscreen. My PM is Gentle cleanse, Moisturizer, Tret 0.05% and Moisturizer again. I was on 0.025% and had no clindamycin until 2 days ago my derm put me on it so i’m hoping it helps. Does anyone have any advice? I even got new silk pillow cases and swap them every 2 days. I feel like i’m stuck and it’s very draining. I just wanna find a good routine with an occasional breakout, not months of this. I don’t get those deep cystic acne anymore because i was on accutane, I just get normal acne all around my cheeks. Please help!!",

      "content": "I have curly hair, more loose/thick curls than tight (definitely not wavy tho), but in texture very fine, which I think is causing me most of my issues. Its about shoulder length, and my haircut has a lot of layers. I used the season 5 nancy wheeler haircut as a reference for my most recent salon visit if that helps lol. \n\nOn days that I wash my hair, it usually comes out fine, no major complaints. But the next day, my hair is a mess. It is frizzy, the curls are a mix of totally straight and pitiful waves, my bangs look awful and flat, and it looks and feels greasy. My bangs and the length of my hair are usually clearly two separated chunks as well. It looks just awful. One day later! In the past couple weeks, I’ve tried shampooing my hair on that second day, and that's kind of hit or miss. In the past it hasn't worked, but lately I've been getting more success from it. I have no idea why as I haven't changed anything lol but that's just the way it goes with my hair. \n\nMy concern now is that I am really close to getting a new job that would require a long commute three days of the week, meaning I won't have much time in the morning to wash my hair. I would like to switch to washing my hair in the evening, but I have yet to find a successful way to arrange my hair while I sleep without it coming out like I described earlier.\n\nI've tried a silk bonnet, which keeps it smooth but flattens the curls, I've tried the pineapple method, which doesn't do well with my layers, and I think it contributes toward straightening out the length of my curls by pulling them, and I've tried the bonnet and the pineapple combined. Nothing works. \n\nHere’s my wash routine: \n\nEvery other day, I shampoo and condition my hair with Cantù brand shampoo and conditioner, and comb my hair in the shower after I condition. After getting out of the shower, I comb my hair again, then use Cantù brand mousse, and scrunch it into my hair w head upside down. I plop dry w a t shirt for usually thirty minutes or longer, as I’ve found the longer I plop the better it comes out. After unplopping, I have to let it sit and air dry for a little bit before I use a diffuser, scrunching it up with my head upside down. Usually this process is fine.\n\nI don't have any styling products that I can use outside of the shower. I had a gel that I used but I found it to just weigh my hair down more. \n\nAny tips would be greatly appreciated! I am new to learning how to handle my curly hair and I am sick of looking like a rat that got dragged through the gutter every other day of the week. Thank you !! ",

      "content": "Hi, y'all. New here, first post, looking for advice/experiences specifically for \"flow\" or mullet-like styles for women with 2C/3A/3B curls.\n\nRoutine: Malibu C for Hard water Wellness shampoo once a week (have very hard water), rest of the week use Shea Moisture shampoo (no more than 2x a week) and conditioner (typically 4x a week). Style with Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie, and Curl Enhancing Gel, depending on the look I'm going for. I air-dry 90% of the time, blow dry with cold air when I'm feeling fancy. I put most of my styling product in while the hair is still dripping wet, and use a combo of prayer hands and roping to help define my curls.\n\nCurrent Style: I usually trim my own hair because I've had my trust broken by one too many \"professionals.\" It's currently shoulder blade length with very few long layers, and styled my own side-part undercut, which I keep up with myself.\n\nI have a formal wedding to go to in a month, so I want to *attempt* to get it cut by a professional. But I'm 30yrs old and have yet to find a short-medium length cut that fits both my face and my vibe. I've been seeing mullet-like cuts on more and more women lately, and as a bisexual girly I'm totally in love with the trend. I'm curious if anyone else with similar curls (2C/3A/3B) has had a similar cut.\n\nWould also love to hear if any curly girlies out there have had good experiences with traditionally masculine cuts, like the \"flow\" cut, angled curtain, shaggy mullet, etc. I plan to air-dry the style most of the time, but willing to blow dry to make it look more elegant.\n\nMy hair has always been a big insecurity for me, so I'm probably hyperfixating on it a bit. I'm also not gonna pay for a professional cut without knowing what I'm getting myself into, and whether or not it's worth paying for. Send help. Lol!",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",
