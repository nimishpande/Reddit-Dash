For years now I’ve seen posts of all you curly haired gods and goddesses simply wrapping your curls at night and waking up as though you’ve just spent 2 hours doing your hair. I just don’t get it! To me the idea of my curls lasting more than a day is an utter mystery.\n\nI’ve tried it all. Ive used a bonnet, clips, a wrap, cast with gel before bed, and more and yet every time i wake up my hair looks like the 2nd picture. How in the world do people do it? Am I doomed to have to spend several hours in the bathroom every morning to not hate the way I look?\n\nRoutine: I use argan oil of Morocco shampoo once a week, shea moisture curl and shine conditioner, shea moisture mouse, a heat protectant and detangler from Amika, a diffuser, and rosemary oil.\n\nEDIT: More routine info for mods. The products are applied in that order and scrunched in in sections. I dry with the diffuser and separate curls with oiled fingers.",

EVERY TIME my hair gets thin past my shoulders. Doesn't matter if I do a big reset chop (20cm+), it gets stringy in the ends immediately afterwards. The last time my hair looked fine was when I was 18 (2021), second photo. \n\nThe \"long\" hair isn't damaged either; I can brush it smoothly and can't detect split ends. It just feels like I have \"underwool\" that doesn't want to get longer and just becomes more coily while my top hair is rather wavy.\n\nFor my routine, I am a simple gal: Use drugstore (Balea professional Traumlocken) conditioner on my ends during shower, then wash with Schauma shampoo. Rinse, scrunch in some conditioner again and squeeze out water. Depending on what I have going on, I might use mousse (Balea Schaumfestiger Locken) and sometimes Gel (Balea Locken Scrunchgel). At night I put my hair up in a protective bun. 95% of the time I air dry. Wash every second day.\n\nThere's been no change in routine between those pictures I have to add, other than that I went from school to uni and in the second picture I had an ED, so it makes even less sense that my hair was looking alright lol",

I’ve always felt unsure about my hairstyle, especially because I think my nose is on the bigger side and I worry my curls make my features stand out more instead of balancing my face. My photos I posted go from last night (first 3) to this morning before water (4-6) to after water at 7-8\n\nI’d really appreciate honest advice on how to better define my curls\n\nReducing frizz\n\nWhether a different cut would suit my face better\n\nHow to maintain volume without it puffing out\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nShampoo: Not Your Mother’s Curl Defining Shampoo\n\nConditioner: (none currently)\n\nStyling: I’ve only tried using water in the morning to restyle\n\nDrying: I let it air dry\n\nhair protection: none \n\nmy routine\n\njust water in the morning\n\nRight after washing it looks decent, but by morning it pushes outward and gets frizzy. When I try to restyle with water, it just expands more instead of defining.\n\nI’ve never really had a structured routine before, so I’m open to product suggestions, technique advice, haircut recommendations, or anything else that could help.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Perhaps since I am married and have been in a relationship for 17 years now and I am almost 39 (almost 40) I don't feel the need to gate keep anymore because I no longer need to worry about being \"out there\" among other women. So now I pass the torch onto you guys so you can benefit from my wisdom.\n\nThis will be in three parts. First one is general tips (young women especially need to hear), second one is what I have been doing over the years, third is what I do now and why (the juicy tea)\n\nI have had ZERO work done. No fillers, botox, surgeries, hyaluronic fillers. I haven't even gotten a spa or salon treatment once in my life.\n\n\\---------------------------General tips---------------------------\n\n\\#1 95-98% of skincare is not worth your time. It is either too expensive for what you get, does not have enough research to back it up, or doesn't actually penetrate the top layer of the skin (gets to the deeper layers) + it isn't something you actually need. If you have sensitive skin and you use an acid now your skin is inflamed so then you use something to calm it down when all you needed to do is stop using the acid.\n\n\\#2 Skincare is the last thing you should try to improve your skin. If your gut, nutrition, sleep, stress level, and other things are in ill repair then no skincare product is going to help you. Inside first. I highly recommend you get your blood tested for all vitamins / minerals two times a year to make sure you have no deficiencies. Almost all skin and health issues can lead to starting with a vitamin deficiency. Example: you have dark under eye circles, this could mean you are deficient in iron or folate or both, no cream is going to fix that until you get your iron or folate up to normal levels.\n\n\\#3 15 step skincare, morning sheds, etc (similar to #1) it's all BS. They are all just trying to sell you things and you keep falling for it.\n\n\\#4 If it works for you, don't stop until it doesn't. Don't try something new, why \"fix\" something that doesn't need fixing? If you feel the need to replace something that is already working with something new, the problem is actually either FOMO, a shopping addiction, or dopamine issues, your brain is your first priority (get off Tiktok)\n\n\\#5 Stop trying to \"stop aging\" that is never going to happen. Yes I look much younger than my age but I still look older than 18. You're never going to remain looking 18 forever. Have realistic goals. It's very possible to look 10-15 years younger than your age but you're never gonna be 18 forever.\n\n\\#6 Beauty draws them in, your personality is what keeps you around. In the long run, who you are is always more important.\n\n\\#7 Topical and supplemental collagen is BS. Collagen will not penetrate the top or deep layers of the skin so it is useless as a topical. Oral / supplemental collagen will provide you with some protein, but it is an incomplete protein so it will not repair / rebuild muscle or skin. Instead, take amino acids first thing in the morning that has ALL essential amino acids. I recommend \"Perfect Aminos\"\n\n\\-----------------What I have been doing over the years-----------------\n\n\\---The Early years (16-23) - Not a lot. I had mild acne and would use acid face washes, Proactive, and sunscreen everyday. I started working at GNC when I was 19 and started getting into supplements which included things for beauty, I can't remember what I took then. I tried some Japanese brightening lotions for a hot minute as well as Japanese beauty candy containing collagen, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin c (worked amazing, made me so pink and glowing)\n\n\\---My 20s (23-29) - I was using a lot of Estee Lauder skincare during this time, the Night Repair, neck lotion, and eye cream as well as taking collagen, vitamin c, biotin, and a few other things\n\n\\---The Years Before today (29-38) - I experimented and researched hundreds of things during this time to refine what I now know today. There was so much during this time that I don't even remember 90% of it. The only thing I do the same from this era that I still do is take many of the same supplements.\n\n\\---------------------------What I do now---------------------------\n\n\\#1. Weekly micro needling at home - This is one of the truly proven things you can do for aging that works. Much like how you damage your muscles to grow them and like how moving your body slightly traumatizes your bones to remain strong, small amounts of damage to the body is what keeps you healthy and resilient. There is nothing that traumatizes the skin on a regular basis that is in the deeper layers of the skin therefore the body is not constantly repairing it. When you micro needle, your body then uses its resources to repair micro damage done to the deeper layers of the skin creating microscopic scars that toughen and strengthen the skin. DO NOT use a rolling micro needling device. This is literally the worst thing you can do for your skin. As the needles roll out, they are pushing away from the pierced sight and ripping out. Think of it like you shoveling dirt at an angle, the hole is thicker than the shovel. I use a manual press style micro needling tool where the only thing that is going on is you pierce and pull out in the exact same spot so the only damage truly going on is very small holes. I micro needle my face (eyelids included at 0.25mm) and neck once a week as well as my decolletage, hands, and forearms once a month (deeper piercing). To avoid infection I make sure to wash the skin and then apply a mixture of rubbing alcohol with some tea tree oil in it. Afterward I wash my face and apply the mixture again. The tool itself I wash with soap, then dunk in bleach water, then finish with spraying with alcohol. There is always a risk doing it at home or in a clinic (infection). I have been doing it for 2 years with no problems.\n\n\\#2 The Skincare - Most skincare is not truly helping because it is not penetrating the deeper layers of the skin it just sits on top of the top layer. It doesn't make it useless, it's just repairing far less than you think. Wrinkles and fine lines run deeper than the surface layer. I make my own serum using beta glucan powder. This holds water and plumps the skin much better than hyaluronic acid because it actually goes into the deeper layers of the skin, hyaluronic acid only works on the surface level. I use beta glucan all over my face, neck and hands (twice a day). I use a 0.5% trentinoin from Musley all over my face and neck (once at night). Trentinoin is proven stronger than retinol. I use spf 50 all over ANY skin showing that day and wear it all day (reapplication all day). I use Allies of Skin's Multi Peptide in my chin fold (under lips) and around my eyes for extra fine line / wrinkle support the Trentinoin isn't giving. I use Volufiline mixed into my lip cream and mixed into the Allies of Skin Multi Peptide. Volufiline works by engorging fat tissue to expand and become larger, this will not make anything huge, rather, it will fill out the area with about 5-10% more volume after doing it for 6+ months. I use Cle de Peau's Lip Serum (twice a day). I wash my face with bar soap (seriously). I use Lancome's Bi-Facial make-up remover and don't wash my face at night. Over washing your face is what is aging you and giving you acne. Lastly, I use Strivectin's TL Advanced Tightening Neck Cream Plus on my neck, decolletage, and face twice a day. So, four products on the face (beta glucan, sunscreen, trentinoin, Strivectin), four on the eyes (beta glucan, trentinoin, peptide, volufiline), three on the lips (beta glucan, lip serum, volufiline) and four on the neck (beta glucan, trentinoin, Strivectin, sunscreen) THAT'S IT! No sheet masks, 10 step, 15 step. Simplicity and the best of what your skin needs is all you need.\n\n\\#3 Exercising bone &amp; muscle in the face - You ever see one of those posts of a much older woman (60s, 70s, or 80s) that has an amazing body like they're 30 but their face shows their age? Here is the disconnect: they haven't been micro damaging the bone and muscle in their face like they have been with their body. As I said, the body grows through small amounts of damage to it. \"He's ripped\" literally comes from the knowledge that the muscle rips &amp; tears and repairs itself to get bigger. As we know, muscle on the body = toned &amp; firm. You can do the same to your face as well. So every other day I do 10-15 facial yoga exercises to cover every muscle in my face and neck. Then to make sure the fascia in my face remains bouncy every other day (opposing day to the facial yoga) I do gua sha all over my face and neck. This contours, fills, and keeps your face structured nice and tight, we don't neglect the muscles in our body, but we do with the face. Gua sha and facial yoga also puts strain on the bone of your face keeping your muscle tighter and more attached to your skull leading to less sagging skin.\n\n\\#4 Supplements (beauty related) - I take, \"Perfect Aminos\" with my coffee first thing in the morning, in the middle of my morning workout, and before I go to bed, this is the equivalent of three servings of chicken for only 3 calories. Complete amino acids are far more effective at building collagen and skin than taking a collagen supplement. I take a womens probiotic first thing in the morning with my coffee and one before bed, this keeps my gut and skin flora healthy (fights off acne). Lastly, all of these supplements I take throughout the day with food. 400 mg of hyaluronic acid for skin plumpness. Methylated multivitamin (10x) for over all health, including skin. Sea buckthorn oil for softness and elasticity. Silica for building bone, collagen, and elastin. Rosemary for hair growth. Nettle for hair growth. Turmeric for detoxification. MSM to build collagen and elastin. NAD+ for circulation leading to better skin. CoQ10 for circulation leading to better skin. Chlorophyll for detoxification (+ prevents body odor). Fisetin a general anti-aging. Lastly, HMB for delaying muscle degeneration (preserves face muscles too).\n\n\\#5 Candylipz - To maintain volume, I do Candylipz pumping twice a day. This works through exercising and traumatizing the muscles in your lips to make them more plump.\n\n\\#6 The Other Stuff - Daily I use the \"Cutis\" by Shawana Vali, this has been recent, it is new and so far I like it, it has been helping with the tiny bit of jowls I have been developing. I get 8 hours of sleep every night. I eat a keto diet. I do a 16 hour fast everyday. I lift heavy weights. I did not have children. I drink plenty of water and I do everything I can to be calm and stress-free.\n\nAsk me anything you'd like.",

I have small bumps and texture on my cheeks with some dryness and redness. It is not extremely dry where it is itchy or flaky all the time, but it does feel rough. If I scratch or pick at the bumps even a little, the area gets irritated pretty fast. I have never really had acne growing up, so this is just how my skin naturally has been.\n\n\n\nRight now my routine is very basic. I only use Cetaphil moisturizer daily. I do not use any actives because I am not sure what is safe or helpful. I keep seeing people talk about retinoids, exfoliants, and sunscreen every day, but I do not know what I actually need or how to start without making my skin worse.\n\n\n\nI would really love help with:\n\n• reducing dryness  \n\n• smoothing the bumps and texture  \n\n• calming redness  \n\n• building a routine  \n\n• understanding if I should be using retinoids or sunscreen daily\n\n\n\nAlso, I have similar tiny bumps on the back of my arms too, if that is relevant.\n\n\n\nIf anyone has had skin like this or has advice or product suggestions, I would really appreciate it.

I’ve really been wanting to experiment with different hairstyles and routines and would like some advice.\n\nI’ve always had really short and straight hair but my hair got super curly when I hit puberty. Since then, I’ve sort of just rocked messy curly hair with minimal styling and upkeep but I’ve also lately been finger coiling my hair for track meets. At its longest, the back of my hair is around 11 inches, but the length does vary just based on the haircut I got about 6-7 months ago. I was thinking of getting a front taper and using a headband to push my curls back, but what do yall think?\n\nRoutine:\n\n\\- Detangle, Shampoo and Condition with Being Shampoo and Conditioner once a week (I will not get hair wet if I have finger coils in for about 5 days; I’ll only use curl activator)\n\n\\- Condition about every 3 days\n\n\\- If I’m about to do finger coils, I’ll use Being Leave in, She’s Moisturizing Curl Smoothie and Eco gel after doing my wash routine\n\n\\- Bonnet when I sleep",

I go back and forth a lot but I can’t decide if I should cut to shoulder length. For context picture one is my natural hair texture, kinda wavy/ some loose curls. Two is more recent so the length is where I’m at now but that’s styled with heatless overnight curls. \n\nI just want to send it and do it but I’m nervous how it will look in pony tails or braids bc I don’t wear my hair down everyday. I’m just at this point (and honestly has been for a while) where I’m annoyed with my hair and feel like half the time it doesn’t look good up or down. (Don’t get me started on my color I never know if I should go back natural or keep highlighting lol) \n\nAny advice or thoughts appreciated! Especially if you’ve done a similar chop or have shoulder length hair now. ",

I haven’t bleached in months and don’t intend to for some time, so my blonde will just grow out with long shadow roots if I stay. As far as toning goes I only use a purple shampoo occasionally. I also stopped using heat and changed all my products to moisture and hydration focused. \n\nI did ask chat gpt to show me how I would look with my natural hair again and as I inch closer to 40 I’m wondering if I have blonde blindness. I’m very fair skinned with green eyes so I thought the brown was washing me and the blonde helped but I know just about nothing 🤦🏼‍♀️\n\nI don’t have any girlfriends, can I get some girls girls to help me with a color direction? Also I know chat gpt did change my face and the coloring I can’t work that upgraded smarterchild.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I’ve tried everything it feels like! Niacinamide, salicylic acid, retinol, glycolic acid, azelaic acid, you name it. Nothing has helped even slightly! I’m sick of the redness and texture of my skin and I don’t know what else to try. Anyone got any idea what could be causing it and how to get rid of it?\n\nI’m currently trying to keep my skincare routine simple-ish as every new product I’ve tried recently has broken me out or I’ve had a reaction to. I use a cleansing oil and simple face wash after, then I’ve been using a 10% azelaic acid serum which has done nothing and it’s nearly empty. I use a moisturiser that has hyaluronic acid in and an eye cream. For the past week or so I’ve reintroduced a toner with AHA and PHA and tea tree in to see how that goes, but I don’t use the azelaic acid and toner at the same time. \n\nMy acne is usually a lot worse but this is it when it’s not bad! It’s mostly just my pores/redness/bumps I’m trying to get rid of. \n\nProduct list:\nHaru Haru Wonder black rice cleansing oil\nSimple hydrate+ micellar cleanser face wash\nIsntree hyaluronic acid moist cream moisturiser\nAnua 10% azelaic acid serum\nMary &amp; May cica tea tree AHA/PHA toner",

Tried a number of things over the course of 20 years, nothing really helped completely including Tret and everything else everyone usually talks about but I had never really explored antibiotics. \n\nDuac (or any other clindamycin topical) has basically eliminated that patchy red irritation, the flare ups I'd get from temperature and consuming certain foods and also eliminated the actual acne I'd get associated with my condition.\n\nAbout as close to a miracle as there ever has been for me but I was wondering, for others that have gone this route, did it return after you've stopped using it? I think going beyond 5-6 months has the potential to increase resistance?\n\nFrom what I've read antibacterial topicals are mostly just to get your skin under control so you can begin to manage it with something like tret. My skin though can sometimes look great and within the space of a few days or a week look patchy, red and have numerous pustules. Tret alone can't prevent these flare ups. Depending on when you see me I might look perfect or in pretty bad shape worthy of a post on this sub.   \n  \nDoes anyone go off and on with something like Duac? 4-5 months on, then 4-5 months off?
