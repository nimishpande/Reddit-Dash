If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

The only two I had lucky with was the Kravebeauty oat so simple water cream and old formula Purito panthenol b5 but the krave doesn't offer enough moisture and purito decided to reformulate the panthenol b5 to some bamboo formula. the new bamboo formula broke me out of course.

It gave me a better idea of what my skin might need and how it’s changing over time, but I still treat it more like a fun tracker than a diagnosis.\n\nMost of these apps use your camera to scan acne, pores, redness, etc., and lighting changes everything. Same face, different lighting, totally different results. That’s why I use the AI Decode just to see the changes on my skin and not to make any major treatment decisions.\n\nAI tools can be fun and give you some insights, but they’re not a replacement for your own judgment or advice from a professional. Think of them as a fun helper, not the boss of your skin.\n\n",
