Luckily it works great with my hair (which has interesting curl patterns and textures due to being varying shades of gray and white). Thanks, curl community!🙌\n\nNote: if you are confused by what my hair style is, I am, too 😅. I've been cutting it myself for years and I guess I would call it an asymmetrical bob (???)\n\nHere is my (very basic) routine:\n-Shampoo and condition with Not Your Mother's Curl Talk.\n-Comb with wide tooth comb\n-Apply Boulceme Curl Cream to lightly towel-dried hair\n-Air dry\n\n ",

I really want to take care of my underarms. \n\nBackground:\n\n\t•\tI used razors only for several years (stopped \\~2 years ago)\n\n\t•\tAround a year ago, I had a wax burn from Rica wax\n\n\t•\tSince then, I switched to hard Brazilian wax, but I feel my underarm skin keeps getting worse\n\n\t•\tI have thick, coarse hair\n\n\t•\tMy skin is PIH-prone — even mosquito bites leave dark marks for months before fading\n\n\t•\tCurrently using Chemist at Play underarm roll-on\n\n\t•\tOccasionally used alum for odor\n\n\t•\tRarely used The Ordinary Glycolic Acid with a cotton pad\n\n\t•\tRecently exfoliated gently with Dove body polish (pink variant)\n\nCurrent issues:\n\n\t•\tPersistent dark pigmentation\n\n\t•\tUneven tone\n\n\t•\tBumps after waxing (they go away, but darkness doesn’t)\n\n\t•\tSkin gets irritated easily after hair removal\n\nWhat I’m confused about:\n\n\t•\tIs epilator better or worse than hard/Brazilian wax for someone like me?\n\n\t•\tShould I completely avoid root hair removal?\n\n\t•\tWould switching to a trimmer actually help pigmentation fade?\n\n\t•\tAny routines/products that helped you personally?\n\nLaser is not an option for me right now, so I’m looking for realistic, affordable solutions.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with similar underarm pigmentation or sensitive skin, I’d really appreciate your experience or advice 🙏\n\nPlease be kind — this is something I’m genuinely trying to fix.",

That’s the first “after” picture. I had not even TOUCHED my hair at all. No brushing, no shower, no product, nothing. And that’s still the case now 20 hours later, but the damn thing seems to be gone completely!!! Last image is the inspo picture I gave her. I paid $200 for this.

I know my routine is bad so much, and the products i use are mostly useless, i want you guys to recommend me a good products, i don't want something risky or might have side affects, i really really need help guys!, my hair is straight but little bit curly, Thanks ",

I really like the Bobbi brown enriched face base as moisturiser and the Embryolisse for when my face feels more on the dry side, like in winter. I also use SPF over my moisturiser.\n\nI now use the cleanser, vitamin C serum, moisturiser, SPF in the morning and snail serum, retinol, moisturiser or kielh’s overnight face mask (in that order). The other products i just use sometimes random but i would like to have a nice daily and weekly routine which i can follow (and in what order?). Any advice would be very appreciated!",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Hi! \n\nI have been dealing with some skin problems for a while now. At the end of 2023, I started getting acne for the first time (mainly on the chin/jaw, also on cheeks). It improved for a short while but has recently returned. For context, I'm 25 years old - so getting acne for the first time at 23-25 years old is pretty devastating. The spot on my chin in the images has re-flared up multiple times and I can't seem to get rid of it. I know acne in this area is linked to hormones but it happens all month, not at specific points in the cycle. \n\nMy other issue besides acne is that my skin just looks dull and lifeless. I have some dark under eye circles (you can see the darker pigmentation in the pics), and I just have no glow. \n\nI have cut back a lot on my skincare due to the acne. For reference, I think I have combination skin as it can be oily around my nose and chin, but I also get dry patches occasionally.\n\nIn the morning, I just wash my face with water, put on Byoma Moisturising Gel Cream and the Skin 1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum. \n\nIn the evening, my routine varies. I always use the Skin 1004 Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil, Shiseido Senka Perfect Whip Cleansing Foam and Byoma Moisturising Gel Cream. Once a week before moisturising, I use The Ordinary Retinal 0.2% Emulsion. I also use the Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum with Ginseng and Retinal a few times a week. Occasionally, I'll use the Medicube Zero Pore Pads, or the COSRX Snail Mucin Power Essence. I use pimple patches on my spots too.\n\nIs there anything I can add/remove from my routine to improve my skin? Especially removing the acne and the red marks that they leave. Nothing seems to be improving which has been getting me down. ",

I added more detailed info in hopes that answers any first-thought questions.\n\nI don't normally notice these wrinkles and didn't know they were this bad until I took a selfie outside a few months ago. I am shook. One of the wrinkles on the eye that looks worse is a little line from a scar, otherwise this is all me I guess. I covered my irises to maybe keep some identity hidden 😂 I am totally fine with crows feet but what I have going on is hard to love. The first photo with the red pixel hearts is the outdoor one. I had a little concealor on top of my Alba Botanica moisturizer. I don't leave the house without concealor because of my dark undereyes. The rest of the photos are clean, no makeup, and just Roc retinal corexxion on before I applied my moisturizer for the night.\n\nI have had eye bags since I was a little kid, have been taking collagen since I was about 23, eat a healthy diet with plenty of fats and antioxidants, and have used Roc Retinol Correxion under my eyes for at least 5 years. I don't think it's doing anything for me. My moisturizer has been Alba Botanica oil-free daily hydrating moisturizer and I have recently switched to Vanicream daily facial moisturizer for the winter, since I don't think Alba Botanica's was hydrating me enough anymore during these months. I have included photos of the rest of my products I use. It's missing Naturium retinol complex, but that isn't applied to my undereyes, same with Naturium's vitamin c serum.\n\nI do use mineral sunscreen in the summer when I am outside &amp; reapply every two hours with an aerosol sunscreen so I don't mess up my makeup.\n\nI have a suspicion that the eye that is worse is that way because I've slept mostly on that side during my 20's due to ear piercings on the opposite side.\n\nI get plenty of sleep, I think. I make sure to sleep at least 7.5 to 8 hrs a night and it's usually regular unless one or two nights of work keeps me up later (wedding business)\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!!​ For product and routine recommendations, please talk to me like I am a child because my only advice has been from online sources and I could be doing things wrong. What time of day and layering details would be great to know! Thank you all tons",

And relatedly, Is there any point in:  \n(1) increasing DHT Dosage or (2) adding laser caps / microneedling / PRP?  \nOr at this stage am I doing all that I can.\n\nThanks",
