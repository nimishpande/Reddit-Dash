      "content": "**(Example pics in comments!)** Hi all!  My first time posting here - so glad you are all here.  Looking for advice on how to get better results for my desired hair color look (rainbow ends!).  Any advice you have is welcomed!\n\n**Here's the situation:**  \nSeveral years ago I worked with a colorist in the place where I lived and they did an amazing job creating \"rainbow hair\" for me. A couple years passed, I moved to a new state, and my new colorist has tried to do this twice for me, and both times the colors were much \"muddier\" (not distinct between the colors) and also faded MUCH more quickly.  This is a rather expensive process, and I like my new colorist personally and want to support them, so I don't want to go somewhere else if there's just some feedback they need to hear from me that could help!  I also wonder if I'm not using the right \"language\" to communicate what I'm asking for, for some reason my brain just will not \"learn\" haircolor lingo.\n\n**Some information that might help:**\n\n* My natural hair tone is a light brown, colorists have told me that it both \"lifts\" easily and that my hair is porous (that it holds onto color for awhile).   My hair is also rather fine (though not \"baby fine\").\n* My hair is long.\n* Both colorists (old one and new one) lifted out my natural color from my hair, and then had me wait a couple weeks, and then added the rainbow color.\n* I do not know the brand of color that was used by either colorist, sorry :(\n* The goal is to have maybe the lower 2/3 of my hair colored like 6 different rainbow colors.\n* I get that this is a big job for a colorist!  My old one pulled it off so beautifully!  The colors were bright and distinctive and lasted a long time.   With my new colorist, both times we did it, the colors were really \"muddy\" - they sort of faded into one another and blended.  And then like a few weeks later, they just faded dramatically into much paler shades.\n* So there' s really TWO problems:\n   * Color was never distinctive enough - even with fresh color, leaving the salon.\n   * Color faded too quickly.\n* I know that our environment and our lifestyles can affect how our hair looks.  The changes in my life that might be relevant here are I live in another state.\n   * Maybe the water in my shower is too hard and I need one of those filter thingies?\n   * I also regularly use a professional quality conditioner now.  Maybe there is residue deposited onto my hair,  so when my colorist starts the color, it doesn't sink in?\n\nThanks for reading!  I'll save this post and come back to add old and new pics.",

My hair is wavy and I’m thinking of doing tiny twists all over my head while damp and sleeping on it. Curious what kind of products may help it hold like should I do straight up hairspray and tease it? I have thick wavy hair.\n\nJust curious if anyone has some helpful suggestions I usually use frizz and curl enhancing products but I’m worried they may weigh it down to fall out should I just skip the product? I have somewhat frizzy red hair but I really don’t want to deal with it looking crazy worst case I’ll grab a wig if needed but sort of hate wigs and we may have one at work I can use from the Photo Booth.

My scalp feels terrible and there is burning/itching/crawling sensation on my scalp. Also Idk how to explain this but my scalp feels a lot more sensitive or tender(?) and my shedding has increased much more (maybe losing 150-200 hairs per day). I'm losing both thin miniaturized AND THICK TERMINAL HAIRS (both short &amp; long lengths). I'm also losing hair from every part of the scalp including sides and nape area.\n\nI've always had this itchiness on my scalp since my hairloss began 4 yrs ago. I've tried 2% keto shampoo (nizoral), selsun blue, ciclopirox shampoo but nothing worked for me in this case. The itchiness gets far more devastating when I'm doing physical activities (running,sports etc) or wearing a hat &amp; maybe sweating. Then it almost feels like pins and needles like sensation all over the scalp.\n\nHow do i fix this? Or do I have to suffer like this for the rest of my life? It's becoming unbearable at this point and all the dermatologists I went too prescribed me the same nizoral &amp; nothing else. Any response helping me in this matter is highly appreciated. ",

Some are just skin-coloured which I don't mind as much, however sometimes I'll get these ones that seem more flat but are very red (they don't look as bad on camera for some reason). I've found that if I can ignore them for a few days they'll mostly fade, but a couple weeks later they pop up again in the exact same places. I struggled with excoriation disorder in the past so it's very difficult to just keep ignoring the look and feel of these marks every day, and they're also hard to conceal (admittedly I have occasionally broken and tried picking/squeezing a couple but it just results in PIE that takes months to fade). Any idea what this is/how to get rid of them for good?\n\nMy current routine:\n\nAM\n\n* the ordinary plant-derived squalane oil\n* the ordinary natural moisturising factors + phytoceramides\n* skin1004 centella sun serum\n\nPM\n\n* the ordinary plant-derived squalane oil\n* the ordinary natural moisturising factors + phytoceramides\n* the ordinary retinol 0.5% in squalane (only 2/3 times a week)\n* the ordinary lactic acid 10% + HA (again, only 2/3 times a week)\n* recently been incorporating azclear azelaic acid 20% on days where I haven't used retinol or lactic acid\n\nTIA!  \n",
