I applied a generous amount of mayonnaise in my hair as a protein mask which felt not as illegal as it sounds. I have a history of using acv for my hair so it might just be me lol \n\nI’m trying to add roughness to my hair as it falls flat so easily so I gave the hairspray method a chance. I applied the spray on wet hair after scrunching and after diffusing. I feel no difference in softness but my hopes are up that my hair will be as curly in the next days.\n\nalso, last pic is from 3 months ago. no trims in between. I’m trying to grow out my hair to at least mid back but it’s taking forever 😭 am I growth blind or is there literally no difference?\n\nroutine:\n\nwash with ogx biotin&amp;collagen shampoo, mayonnaise mask for 20mins, onlycurls moisturising conditioner\n\na little conditioner as leave in, neqi heat protector, moroccanoil curl foam, taft 14 gel one after another applied by raking and scrunching it upside down in the shower\n\nplop for a few minutes, apply loreal hairspray, cup diffusing and hairspray when it’s dry\n\nleave it a few minutes until the hair is cold and clap out the scrunch (without my beloved balea plex oil which felt so wrong)",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I am a 27 year old female living in northern Wisconsin. I have always dealt with some level of acne and the last year I have been obsessing over it a little more, so constantly trying new products (mostly cleansers and moisturizers). I started Differin in November and have been using it twice a week consistently. My skin is clearer but it feels so tight and irritated that I don't even want to make any expressions or open my mouth too wide to eat. Also, my T-zone is sooo oily, especially right when I wake up in the morning.\n\nLifestyle factors:\n\n\\-I drink lots of filtered water and herbal tea\n\n\\-I go to the gym multiple times a week\n\n\\-Sleep 8-9 hours\n\n\\-Supplements: Cod liver oil, vitamin D3 + K2, Zinc, and Magnesium Bisglycinate\n\n\\-Use a humidifier at night next to my bed\n\nSkincare:\n\n\\-AM: Wash with Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser or Aveeno Calm and Restore...Moisturize (rotating) Vanicream lotion, Cerave PM, Ordinary NMF + HA...Cerave Ultra Light SPF 30 (not every day because sunscreen feels like it makes the tight feeling worse and mineral sunscreen feels like it dries out my skin)\n\n\\-PM: Cleanse with same cleanser, Differin x2 per week with buffer method, rotating moisturizer (above)\n\nI have tried skipping morning cleanse but the greasiness on my face is too much to handle and I think it has caused a few breakouts. I really don't want to lose the progress on the Differin, but maybe that has to go?\n\nIdeally I would have a really low-key routine with just a couple of steps but I haven't found any HG products and I feel so discouraged.

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Like so painful to the point I cried.\n\n\\-End of January 2025 I cut out eggs from my diet to see if the biotin levels were causing any of the acne (it did help a good amount).\n\n\\-Spring/summer 2025 the severity of my acne decreased dramatically but I was still getting closed comedomes, cysts on my neck, and just really uneven skin texture.\n\n\\-Mid August 2025 I started 50mg of spironolactone and began sticking with a simple skincare routine.\n\n\\-Mid October 2025 I started using lactic acid at night every third day.\n\nNow my skis is so soft and even!\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nMorning: Rinse with cold water, moisturize with Weleda light skin food, and use a mineral spf (currently using babo botanicals spf 30). Also I take my birth control pill and my 50mg spiro.\n\nNight: oil cleanse with jojoba oil and ripe off with cotton round and cold water, second cleanse with cold water and derma e hydrating cleanser, followed with Andalou Naturals, Enlighten Serum + The Ordinary Azelaic Acid, and moisturize with DERMA E, Vitamin E Creme. And like I mentioned above, I use The Ordinary 10% Lactic Acid every third night in place of the Enlighten Serum.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I've tried retinol, trent, niacinimide, etc but nothing has helped tighten the skin. My primary care doctor only now decided to say that they could be allergic shiners, which gives me hope as to why I'm the only one in my family who has them, but im not sure if it's true because i don't have any dark circles. I've started allergy suppression at home with a 24hr 10mg zyrtec I take daily, though nothing has improved in the week I've used them. I'm worried that since I've had them for years, it's going to be very hard for my body to tighten my undereyes naturally. I'm open for any suggestions to bring them down though.",

      "content": "I'd like to improve my skincare routine but there are so many products out there I'm not sure what would be best to try out first. I'm 26, female. My skin concerns are:\n* Skin tend to be dry and flaky looking quickly on my forehead.\n* Would like an overall smooth and glowy look to my skin.\n* I tend to get acne breakouts on my chin, between nose &amp; lip, between eyebrows, and on the right side of my cheek &amp; jaw. I'm not sure if it's hormonal because it generally matches up with my cycle, but the left side of my face is always perfect so maybe environmental? It's usually either deep under the surface, or whiteheads. Either way, heavy products like thick lotion and Vaseline do tend to cause me to break out so I want to avoid making it worse.\n\nMy current daily routine is CeraVe hydrating cleanser, The Ordinary HA serum, The Ordinary Ascorbicyl Glucoside serum, and CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion. Occasionally, maybe once every 2 weeks, I use The Ordinary's red AHA &amp; BHA peeling solution. I like how smooth my face looks afterwards but it feels too harsh to use more often, and I'm almost out of that so I'd be open to switching products!\n\nI'd prefer either drugstore or inexpensive-ish products from Ulta, with little to no scent. I'm breastfeeding so I can't do any retinol.\n\nI've hear about milky toners, but I'm not sure if that would be the right type of product?",

      "content": "Recently, I started to pay much more attention on taking care of my hair, since in a couple of months I'll go and donate most of it after like growing it out for 5 years, but till then, I want to know what I am doing wrong with my routine and what I could improve to make my hair look much better and make my 2C/3A (down to mid-back) hair shine, plus with less frizz! I asked on r/haircare, but I didn't get much of a response so I'm going to try in here too!\n\n# My hair routine: \n\n1. I go to shower myself\n\n2. After a bit, I wet my hair and put shampoo on it, mainly doing the scalp\n\n3. Then I rinse out the shampoo and I scrunch my hair so that I can apply hair conditioner\n\n4. After it being applied, I go bottom to top with my wide tooth comb to untangle my hair (I only brush the hair when showering)\n\n5. I wait 5-6 minutes for the conditioner to sit on the hair and then I rinse it out with colder water.\n\n6. Then with a t-shirt, I scrunch my hair so that it's damp and I apply leave-in conditioner (spray) on hair ends and mids.\n\n7. Lastly, 30 minutes after leaving my hair to dry (air-dry method), I go and put some argan oil of morocco and some time later go to sleep, currently with cotton pillowcases (haven't tried it, but will probably replace pillowcases to satin ones)\n\n# Products/Ingredients:\n\n1. Shampoo - Bulgarian drugstore brand, which I use every other day on my scalp mainly, with ingredients like: \n\n* AQUA \n* SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE\n* COCAMIDOPROPIL BETAINE\n* ACRYLATES COPOLYMER\n* PARFUM\n* HEXYL CINNAMAL\n* LINALOOL\n* GERANIOL\n* CITRONELLOL\n* SODIUM CHLORIDE\n* PIROCTONE OLAMINE\n* C12-13 ALKYL LACTATE\n* PANTHENOL\n* LACTIC ACID\n* POLYQUATERNIUM-7\n* PEG-7 GLYCERYL COCOATE\n* PEG-12 DIMETHICONE\n* MELALEUCA ALTERNIFOLIA LEAF OIL\n* CITRIC ACID\n* SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n* TETRASODIUM GLUTAMATE DIACETATE\n* BENZYL ALCOHOL\n* METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE\n* METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE\n\n2. Conditioner: It's an head and shoulders \"Derma X Pro\" conditioner, which has: \n\n* Aqua\n* Stearyl Alcohol\n* Behentrimonium Chloride\n* Cetyl Alcohol\n* Isopropyl Alcohol\n* Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n* Phenoxyethanol\n* Benzyl Alcohol\n* Parfum\n* Sodium Benzoate\n* Piroctone Olamine\n* Citric Acid\n* Tocopheryl Acetate\n* Menthol\n* Hexyl Cinnamal\n* Polysorbate 20\n* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n* Linalool\n* Hydroxycitronellal\n* Geraniol\n* Propylene Glycol\n* Cereus Grandiflorus Flower Extract\n* Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf / Stem Extract\n\n3. Leave-in conditioner (from what I think it should be) - schwarzkopf GLISS OIL NUTRITIVE with ingredients like: \n\n* Aqua (Water, Eau)\n* Cyclomethicone\n* Phenyl Trimethicone\n* Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil\n* Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil\n* Hydrolyzed Keratin\n* Lactic Acid\n* Sodium Benzoate\n* Dimethiconol\n* Cetrimonium Chloride\n* Coumarin\n* Phenoxyethanol\n* Potassium Sorbate\n* Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone\n* Polyquaternium-16\n* Parfum (Fragrance)\n* Benzyl Alcohol\n* Linalool\n* Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone\n* Citronellol\n\n4. Finally, the argan oil of morocco by OGX - \n\n* Cyclopentasiloxane\n* Cyclotetrasiloxane\n* Dimethiconol\n* Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil\n* C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate\n* Fragrance (Parfum).",

And if so, how do I do that without putting too much gel on and weighing things down? Thank you!!!\n\nTo give further context of where I'm at so far, I only just realized you really shouldn't touch your curls much while diffusing. Oops.\n\nCurrent routine: shampoo with dove repair, or ION hard water shampoo. Usually conditioner, Pantene of some kind. Try to plop into a towel but my hair is short.

I suspect it's because my hair is very fine, dense and I live in very humid weather.\nThe only gels that kinda worked are these:\n\nUncle's funky gel: looked good, but was too moisturizing for the weather, so it didn't last an hour and kinda never fully dried even under hooded dryer. Never flaked though, just disappeared.\n\nMorocannoil's strong styling gel: expensive, which I wouldn't mind if they had a bigger tube. I think it's meant for straight hair but it's the best one I've used. Cast without flakes somehow\n\nAloe vera: definition, but didn't last at all.\n\nIs there any other way I can define my hair? I'm ok with having a soft definition and having to retouch it daily. I don't need it to be \"perfect\".\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nPrepoo: Sometimes I use aloe vera with crecepelo. I don't tend to pre-poo unless my hair is very dry, which it doesn't tend to be.\n\nShampoo: Helen Seward Remedy 7/S shampoo or OUAI Detox shampoo\n\nHair masks: Crecepelo hair mask, l'oreal elvive total repair 5 (black pot) + occasional protein treatment. \n\nConditioner: Lendan plex forte N.5. But might switch to Redken All Soft Mega Curls conditioner.\n\nStyling: Don't have any \"staple\" styling products but my hair loves Aunt Jackie's quench leave in. It's harder to find lately though (in my country)\n\nI don't mind paying more for a product if it comes on a bigger tube. I use a hooded dryer.

About two weeks ago, I reduced the contact time to 1 to 5 minutes maximum, still twice daily.\n\nI also recently got sick and didn’t do my skincare routine for around 2 to 3 days. After that, I restarted skincare in the evenings only (my full PM routine). After doing this for about 3 days, I noticed 4-5 fairly large white pimples appear on my face. Could this timing correspond to anything? (Since I got better, I’m doing my full AM and PM routine again.)\n\nAdding to that, I’d like to know if reducing my benzoyl peroxide to only PM, maybe every other night, and switching to a basic cleanser (potentially a CeraVe one) would be better. My skin has also been pilling recently.\n\nIf I’m being totally honest, I have 0 idea what I’m doing, so some guidance would be nice :) The budget isn’t super limited, but cheaper options are always better unless the more expensive option is 100x better.",
