      "content": "Not here to sell anything, and I’m not speaking for every provider or clinic. This is just what I’ve consistently seen move the needle for people’s skin over years of working in medical aesthetics and consulting with regulated health-care teams.\n\nSkincare can feel overwhelming, but the ingredients that work long-term are surprisingly consistent. Here’s what actually delivers noticeable improvement when used correctly and consistently! \n\n  \n**For pigmentation and stubborn** discolouration\n\nHydroquinone (at least 2%)  \nStill one of the strongest short-term options for targeted pigment concerns. Usually used in cycles because it’s potent.\n\nNiacinamide (Vitamin B3)  \nGood for general discoloration, redness, and supporting the barrier.\n\nAzelaic Acid  \nGentle, versatile, and effective for pigmentation, redness, and texture issues.\n\nTranexamic Acid  \nOften helps with melasma-type uneven tone and overall brightening over time.\n\n**For anti-aging and long-term skin quality**\n\nRetinol or Tretinoin  \nStill the most reliable ingredient for improving texture, fine lines, and overall skin quality.\n\nVitamin C + E + Peptides  \nA brightening, antioxidant-rich combination that helps support healthier-looking skin.\n\nPeptides  \nUseful for strengthening the skin and improving resilience when used consistently.\n\nSunscreen  \nThe ingredient that protects all of the above from going to waste.\n\n**For hydration and barrier repair**\n\nHyaluronic Acid  \nBest used on damp skin and sealed with a moisturizer to prevent moisture loss.\n\nCeramides  \nEssential for repairing and reinforcing the skin barrier.\n\nUrea (low percentage)  \nHelps with smoothness, hydration, and softening rough patches.\n\nCicaplast Baume B5  \nConsistently helpful for calming irritation, supporting barrier repair, and restoring comfort when the skin is stressed or over-exfoliated.\n\n**For acne-prone or congested skin**\n\nSalicylic Acid (BHA)  \nKeeps pores clear and helps reduce inflammation.\n\nBenzoyl Peroxide  \nStill one of the most effective tools for managing acne-causing bacteria.\n\nAdapalene  \nA beginner-friendly retinoid that supports both acne control and long-term skin refinement.\n\n**General principles that make the biggest difference**\n\n\\- Consistency is more important than product count (can take sometimes months to see real permanent change, give a product at least a month of consistent use before deciding if it helps you or not) \n\n\\- Barrier health should always come first\n\n\\- Introduce new products slowly\n\n\\- Use one strong active at a time\n\n\\- Water intake and a balanced diet genuinely impact skin behaviour\n\n\\- Sunscreen determines how well all other products work",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "What product will help my scarring?\n\nEdit: Pictures in comments\n\nTLDR: Acne-like face blemishes/sores that spread and migrate, which has left me with red scarring. Looking for suggestions to clear up red marks, and also ways to prevent them from recurring. \n\n\nI've had issues with strange blemishes for several years now. My dermatologists have been no help at diagnosing what is causing this and wouldn't do any cytology(?) testing. I've been told it's probably acne, or dermatitis, and other generic diagnoses. Usually these blemishes start as small bumps in the surface of the skin (never above nose level, most commonly around jaw) with an itch that's much deeper than the surface of the skin, which develops into a small sore that grows and slowly spreads/migrates. The spots will sometimes itch or burn, other times they don't. As it starts healing, another will form right next to it, and it slowly grows and migrates around until I can finally get it healed and wait for the next episode. You can see the migration path in the red scarring. Some scars are also white around the jaw line. The blemishes/sores stay for MONTHS, getting better then worse again, and it takes forever to get under control and then heal. Makeup seems to make it worse or trigger a new flare up, but I've found a liquidy foundation serum that I can handle for occasional daytime use. ANY SPF other than zinc oxide can trigger a flare. It seems sunlight exposure *might* also make flares worse.\n\nI've tried: \n\n-PanOxyl face wash (did nothing) \n-Nizoral dandruff shampoo, in case it's fungal (maybe helped but didn't heal)\n-Prescription antibiotic ointment that treats bacterial or staph infections like impetigo (will help for a few days then does nothing and they get worse again)\n-dial antibacterial sensitive hand soap (helps heal the most) \n-hydrocolloid patches (best for getting under control)\n-multiple types of spot treatments for acne, including those with salicylic acid (can make worse)\n-plain aquaphor or vaseline\n-i also wash my hands frequently, keep my nails short during flare ups, and change my hypoallergenic pillow case weekly.\n\nI currently do NOT have an active breakout (yay! 🎉) following starting an AM/PM routine in September 2025 that includes: \n\nAM\nDial antibacterial hand soap OR a gentle face cleanser from The Ordinary (T.O.)\nT.O. GF 15% Solution\nEight Saints Pep Rally Serum (HA, Vit C &amp; E, MSM)\nThe Inkey Hydro-Glow serum\nEight Saints Cloud Whip Vitamin C moisturizing face cream\nZinc Oxide SPF 50\n\nPM\nT.O. gentle foaming face wash\nGlycolic Acid 2x weekly\nRetinal 0.2% Emulsion 1x weekly\nT.O. GF 15% solution\nEight Saints Night Shift face gel (peptides, Vit C, MSM, antioxidants)\n\nI'm really trying to keep my skin clear, and so far I feel the Glycolic Acid makes the most difference, as does the Dial antibacterial hand soap I sub in once every day or every other day. \n\nI now have these dark long scars on my cheeks and jaw though and I want to know what I can use to help them fade! I'm open to products or other professional treatments.\n\nIf you have suggestions on preventing recurrence, OR can help me reduce the red path of destruction, I would be so appreciative! ",

      "content": "Hoping for some advice here from people who are having the same issue. My front and sides are decently curly but my back is only wavy in comparison. Of course, this gets elevated by sleeping on it and so on.\n\nI'll do my usual routine, as stated below, and diffuse with Dyson, then scrunch curls when fully dry. Sometimes I use one drop of hair oil for this step, sometimes not, just whatever I feel like doing that day.\n\nI've tried stronger hold gels to no effect, did finger curling, tried upside down styling exclusively, I even used the Bounce Curl Brush. I have rather fine hair and this thing makes my hair so incredibly shiny and frizz free but sadly sucks out all the measly volume there is. The best way to handle the back of my head for now is to style regularly and then diffuse upside down but this often leaves me with a lot of mess (as well as some stronger curled waves). Problem is, to get rid of this mess, meaning some unwanted parting, I use my flat iron to even things out. Most of the time this means killing some of the pretty curly waves. Even finger combing before diffusing to get some order into my hair does not help anything.\n\nNicer waves/curls + messy back of my head or pretty loose and shiny waves. It feels like I can't get one or the other. My sides are nice and bouncy and hold up so nicely even with me only using mousse. A curly cut is already off the table since I'm worried this will make me look like a spaghetti monster.\n\nCurrent routine (just 1 of each):    \n1. Pantene Volume &amp; Body OR Ouai Detox OR Wella Nutri Curls shampoo     \n2. L'Oreal Glycolic Gloss Conditioner OR L'Oreal Bond Repair Conditioner    \n3. Every 4th wash K18 mask    \n4. Pantene Miracle Rescue Leave-In OR Pureology Color Fanatic Spray    \n5. Pantene Perfect Waves Mousse (applied with prayer hands and scrunched)",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "I (19F) have had hormonal acne since I was 13. I mostly cleared the actual whiteheads and occasional pustules by taking birth control and sticking to daily cleansing + moisturizing (with help of derm). Now that my acne has cleared, my attention has shifted to these little white bumps, mostly on my chin and forehead, but also a few on my cheeks and temples. (it might not look that bad on camera, but I swear they're there in great numbers!) They don't hurt, itch etc. they're not red either. If I try popping them a little white worm comes out. \n\nI started using the *Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Night Pads Extreme* as an exfoliator. They feel great on my skin, but I still haven’t seen any results after 2 months of using them 3x/week (maybe because the pads don’t have the right pH or something, that's what I've read). I’ll finish the pack, but I’m on the lookout for a new product that might finally get rid of these or at least keep them in check.\n\nThe amount of chemical exfoliators out there is overwhelming… any recommendations for something that targets this specific issue? Retinol, salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid…?\n\n**TLDR: pls help me get rid of these bumps with the right chemical exfoliator!**",

This was not entirely my decision, but it is an obvious problem...)\n\nThe results are much better than what I was doing a few months before I started, but they are still poor;  \n\\- The biggest issue is that my curls have hardly any definition to speak of.  \n\\- My hair is rather limp.  \n\\- I find I get more frizz than is normal.\n\nI am asking for advice on what products I ought to use instead, and also on how I should use them. Keep in mind that where I live has a lack of quality hairdressers and beauty-stores, and so I find it hard to find quality products and advice. On the latter, only my mum and sister are available to help, but I am not entirely satisfied with what they have recommended me.",
