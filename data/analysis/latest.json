      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Pictures just taken with flash in sunlight (cheek, nose, forehead). I did my morning routine literally 2 hours ago and I’m already getting oily. This isn’t nearly as bad as it’ll be just an hour from now. It gets to where I can literally run my finger across my face and my fingertip comes back shiny and slick from the oil. I need it to stop, it looks and feels so gross.\n\nAlso, as you can see, I’m still getting breakouts at 27 years old. I know nothing can be done about the huge pores/orange peel skin, but I’d love to not break out like a teenager and minimize the appearance of the pores if I can. I also wouldn’t mind recommendations to minimize the appearance of the forehead wrinkles, because for as much as I feel too old for acne and oil, I feel too young to be walking around with deep lines. \n\nWhat should I add/get rid of/swap? It’s by my biggest insecurity to the point I don’t even like leaving the house when my skin breaks out. I wear makeup twice a month at most, and really nothing on my skin when I do except a little concealer if I have inflamed acne. I don’t have a huge budget for expensive products, so the cheaper the better as long as it’s still effective. But I’ll splurge if I absolutely must. ",

      "content": "I know it’s normal for curl patterns to change over time, but mine is happening VERY quickly over the course of the past month. Bear with me, the routine and situation is wordy\n\n*Photo 1 is my hair right now—it’s been finger combed, but not brushed. \nPhoto 2 is my hair before I finger combed it, after I’ve done more normal air drying routine\nPhoto 3 is what my hair looked like last month, before all of this started*\n\n1) I have historically had what my friend (who’s a stylist) and I understood to be 2b hair with some sections that looked a little more 2a (photo 3 is my hair literally last month)—we’ve had a running joke about how odd my hair is, because it responds *very* favorably to heavier products intended for natural textured coily and kinky hair…despite being fine and wavy. It has defied logic, in that way, because everything I’ve read would suggest that this should be “too heavy.”\n\n2) She gives me a blowout every time she dyes my roots, but I otherwise *seldom* blow dry and opt to air dry my hair. Sometimes I hit the roots with a diffuser after some air drying, but blow drying has historically made it *much* frizzier and appearing damaged, even with heat protection products. Standard 2b shit.\n\n3) I use EVO root lifter (I have both kinds), EVO liquid rollers curl cream, Joico color therapy leave-in spray and a small bit of emu oil on the ends. When my hair has fully dried in the curl casing, it usually looks a bit more like 2c hair; I brush it out with a boar bristle brush and tidy up with a smidge of Moroccanoil. If I don’t brush it out like that, my hair has a tendency to knot up into itself and brushing it out has been the only way to look like I meant for my hair to look this way\n\nTLDR is here: Suddenly, in the past four weeks or so, the under layer of my hair has decided to coil. **Hard.** Beyond the shape changing, it’s now behaving like properly curly hair—brushing it at all makes the texture feel wiry and it puffs up into a horrible mess. Air drying doesn’t appear to be a totally viable methodology now, either. This is entirely new and it appears to be spreading!\n\nNot only do I have no idea how to care for properly curly hair, but why is this happening so quickly? Am I missing something? How the hell do I take care of hair that’s half wavy, half curly? Someone recommended a Denman brush—which one?! HELP\n",

I just don't think I can last 2 weeks of doing this, and the tears are not helping with the pain. I'm using Neutrogena ultra gentle daily moisturiser and la roche-posay as cleaner. Is there any alternatives or do I just live with my acne until it decides to go away? I should add I've noticed no changes except for more redness, my acne is still there and I'm still getting pimples.",

Every few days I get a new one and they scar. I'm also not a picker! I attached a few photos. The first 3 photos were taken March 2025.\nThe last 3 photos were taken today. For reference I change my pillow cases every 3 days, never put my phone on the side of my face, 80% have my hair up and wash it every two days. I also don't use hair products.\nI really want to know why these pimples keep appearing and how I can stop that, as well as get rid of scarring. I know it looks better but for 10 months, the scarring and reoccurring acne has become upsetting to say the least. I've been reading about Adapalene but worried to start it because of purging. I'm also prone to closed comedones and clogged pores, so l get scared to try out new products and they break me out more. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated.\n\nMy current routine that I started in July:\n\nAM: after workout\n1. Haruharu cleansing gel / panoxyl (3 times a week)\n2. Avene thermal spray\n3. iUnik beta glucan serum\n4. Purito oat in calming gel\n5. House of Hur weightless spf\n\nPM:\n1. Haruharu cleansing oil\n2. Haruharu cleansing gel\n3. Avene thermal spray\n4.

      "content": "I’m new to cleansing oils and enzyme cleansers. Yesterday I got the Mara enzyme cleansing oil and the Dr. Dennis Gross creamy cleansing oil to use 1-2x a week, and mainly use Mara most nights. \n\nI plan on using a cleansing oil at night to double cleanse. My main concerns are getting a deep clean and getting gunk in my pores out. I used it last night and loved it. My skin felt so smooth! \n\nApparently Mara is ok to use daily. I say that because I don’t want to overdo actives. I use the DDG peel pads, prescription retinol, and Farmacy honey glow (not all everyday, and in rotation, I give my skin a break every few nights). \n\nIt is on the pricier side- usually I don’t mind spending money on skincare but it has to be worth it for me. The enzymes are listed so low on the ingredient list so I wonder if I can use a cheaper one that’s just as good. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Is it ok to use the enzyme oil cleanser (or any) most nights while using DDG cleanser 1-2x a week with all my other actives? \n\nIf not,\n\n2. Should I use a different, gentler cleansing oil?\n\n\n3. Are enzyme cleansers just a buzzword thing? Does it mostly matter if I use targeted serums, etc.?\n\nI’m late 20s, combo/oily leaning skin, somewhat acne prone, sensitive, but ok with most actives as I’ve been using them for a few years. \n\nI’d love your insight and experience! Also any advice for routine would be nice.",

I started off with 0.5 but recently realized that my skin doesn’t handle it especially when I am using azelaic acid along with it, so I moved to 0.025%. While this has helped keep those skin flakes at bay, my skin still feels dry and I have mild acne/texture all over my face. \nI’m open to recommendations for moisturizers, ampoules, or in-office treatment.\n\n\nThank you!!\n",

It used to be wavy when I was a child, now I think its 3a/3b. Unfortunately, I neglected it for many years and I finally decided to start taking care of it. However, I am not quite sure if I am doing things right in my current routine and I still struggle with some things so I would love to hear your thoughts!  \n\n\n**1st Picture is after washing them. My routine:**  \n\\- Shampoo (only 2 times per week)  \n\\- Conditioner  \n\\- Mousse  \n\\- Scrunch  \n\\- Air Dry\n\nI detangle my hair using a comb while the conditioner is applied. After scrunching, I shake my head for some time to \"style\" it.\n\nIs this a good result? Anything I can improve?\n\nI recently added leave in conditioner and gel to that routine but the picture was taken before these products were included.\n\n**2nd Picture is morning after washing day**  \nAs you can see, my hair looks absolutely fried. I don't sleep with bonnet. What should I do? Do I have to do my routine every day? So far, I only do it every 2nd day because I am afraid of using too much product. I just rinse them with cold water when I don't wash them that day. Should I apply products every day?  \n\n\n**3rd Picture is something I would like to change.**  \nI currently have a fringe but it's mostly coils. Whenever my hair dries, they clump together to these coils. I don't really like that since the other parts are not very coily. How can I style my hair to get rid of these coils? I didn't wash my hair on that picture. ",

      "content": "Hey everyone 👋\n26M here. I’ve been dealing with something frustrating over the past weeks. I never had acne before — I always had clear skin no matter what I ate or did.\n\nA few weeks ago, during a period of heavy stress and barely any sleep, I suddenly started breaking out — and it began with cystic acne (which I had never experienced before). The cystic spots eventually went away on their own, but now I’m stuck with small pustules and whiteheads that keep coming back.\n\nThey appear mostly on my cheeks and around my nose, and often on the exact same spots where I have PIE (post-inflammatory erythema) from previous breakouts. Every small pimple leaves behind a new red mark, even if I don’t touch it.\n\nRight now, I’m not using much skincare anymore:\n\t•\t🧼 Just rinsing with water\n\t•\t💧 Moisturizer sometimes (Eucerin Hydra Repair), not every day\n\t•\t🧴 Sunscreen when I’m in the sun\n\nI stopped actives completely because I felt like I damaged my skin barrier earlier by introducing too many products too fast (cleanser, vitamin C, salicylic acid, niacinamide, azelaic acid — all at once 😬).\n\nI saw a dermatologist who prescribed:\n\t•\tEpiduo Forte every 3 nights, applied alone before bed\n\t•\tOn other nights: gentle cleanser + moisturizer\n\nBut I haven’t started it yet because I wasn’t sure if it’s too strong for my current mild situation.\n\nI’m currently on vacation (warm climate, lots of sun) and have noticed more small whiteheads / pustules popping up on my cheeks, chin, and around the nose. They’re not painful or deep anymore — just annoying and they always leave PIE behind.\n\n👉 My main question:\nWhat’s the best way to prevent new small breakouts / pustules from forming — especially on cheeks and around the nose, chin, where I already have PIE?\n\nWould you recommend:\n\t•\tStarting BHA (Paula’s Choice) first\n\t•\tGoing straight to Epiduo Forte\n\t•\tOr simply focusing on barrier care &amp; gentle cleansing for a while longer?\n\nI’d love to hear your personal experiences, especially from people who started with cystic breakouts but are now dealing with persistent mild breakouts in the same areas.\n\nThanks a lot 🙏\n",
