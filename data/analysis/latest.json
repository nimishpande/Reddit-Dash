It’s frustrating cuz well.. it looks curlier but it doesn’t last very long (have to rewet it all the time) versus if I put product in it, I like how defined it looks near the ends and how long it lasts but the roots feel flat. the first image is right after a wash\n\nAny advice here?\n\nUsually when i’m doing a routine with product in it, it’s-\n\n1x a week full hair wash with curlsmith shampoo, then shea moisture conditioner, then shea moisture curl cream, some gel or mousse, curlbounce brush and then air dry or diffuse (it rlly depends on the day)\n\ni went a while without using shea moisture products too (mielle leave-in and ouidad gel) and it still looked similar, if not worse (ouidad gel did not leave a gel cast on my curls unless i dumped like 2 pounds of it, which caused it to frizz early)",

It's also Paraben free and Reef safe. \n\nNext I checked the full ingredients list. Here's what I found:\n\nThere are a few differences within the ingredients:\n\nHumectants: India uses Propanediol | USA uses Propylene Glycol\n\nHyaluronic Form: India uses Sodium Hyaluronate | USA uses Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid\n\nPreservatives: India uses Phenoxyethanol and Ethylhexylglycerin | USA uses Parabens, like Methylparaben &amp; Propylparaben\n\nRest all ingredients as similar to the USA variant!!!\n\nRight now I just kept it short and simple. Let me know if you guys wanna see more of such comparisons 🙂",

Sharing my Jan &amp; Feb empties.\n\nSkin type: Acne-prone combination\n\nSeason: Winter (my skin becomes dry)\n\nDuring winter, I focused more on hydration and barrier repair while slowly targeting acne\n\n• COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Essence\n\nUsing this for the past 3 years and always keep it stocked. Great for hydration and calming acne without clogging pores. A solid staple for my winter routine.\n\n• L’Oréal Glycolic Bright Serum\n\nUsing regularly at night for pigmentation. It works gradually acne marks fade with consistent use. Needs patience.(WRP)\n\n• L’Oréal Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\nOkay-okay hydration. Lightweight, layers well, not sticky. Nothing extraordinary, but does the job. I personally prefer this over The Ordinary one. (WNRP)\n\n• L’Oréal Eye Serum\n\nBetter for puffiness. I mainly have dark circles (no puffiness), and it helped slightly but not dramatically.\n\n(WNRP)\n\n• The Derma Co AHA-BHA-PHA Peeling Solution\n\nFirst time trying it. Helped with texture and mild acne marks but caused some irritation. (WNRP)\n\n• Earth Rhythm Phytoceramide Moisturizer\n\nReally helpful for winter dryness. Texture is similar to CeraVe or Bioderma — creamy, barrier-supporting, and nourishing without clogging pores. Worked very well for my dry skin during winter. (WNRP)\n\n• Moody Sunscreen\n\nVery lightweight and great for humid weather. My tube was close to expiry, so I finished it during winter. Texture-wise, better suited for summer. (MRP)\n\n• Deconstruct Sunscreen\n\nGood for winter, slightly heavier. Budget-friendly, but I don’t think I can use it in summer. (WNRP)\n\n• Parachute Body Lotion\n\nBasic winter body lotion. Does the job for dryness.",

      "content": "Hi everyone, the first two photos are from today and as you swipe it’s how my skin has built up to this. A week ago today, I had clear skin 🥲 compromised yes but clearish.\n\nI want to cry, I’ve developed a million tiny pustules - all red and irritated. Especially around my temples for some reason. I had around 20-30 whiteheads all across my eyebrows and forehead - fortunately they’ve cleared up now.\n\nBut it seems as though my cheeks are worsening. I use the Ego QV Gentle Wash cleanser and Cerave Moisturiser.\n\nI did switch from the green hydrating cerave cleanser to the Ego QV cleanser about a week before coming back to the UK for 2 weeks. Should I go back?\n\nI’ve also worn the Beauty of Joseon suncream the past 2 days and I’m debating removing that from my routine as well.\n\nI’m wearing sudocreme and benzoyl peroxide to bed, letting the benzoyl sit for 15 mins before applying the sudocreme.\n\nI’m at a complete loss as I feel out of control with my skin for the first time in years 🥲 I did take these photos straight out of the shower so that might’ve increased the redness but the texture is just as bad as it looks - it’s a mental challenge washing my face at the moment and just feeling it.\n\nAny help would be greatly greatly greatly appreciated, this has been a huge knock on my confidence entirely.",

I’ve heard rice toners can help even out skin tone, but I’m not sure if I should instead get with BHA since my skin seems dehydrated.\n\nMy routine: MIXSOON Master Serum; Real Barrier Aqua Soothing Cream (working well, but whiteheads persist); Skin1004 Centella Tone Brightening Gel Foam (AM &amp; PM); once a week, I use I’m From Fig Enzyme Powder for \\~90 seconds. I’ve been using Anua 10% Azelaic Acid for 7 months with little improvement.\n\nI’m going to Bali in a month and need a daily sunscreen with chemical filters, suitable under makeup, not too dewy, and won’t darken my PIE. Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing breaks me out; I’ve been eyeing Dr. Althea Green Tea Fresh Sunscreen (but there’s few reviews).\n\nAny recommendations for sunscreens, toners, spot treatments for whiteheads, or dermatology treatments for PIE would be helpful! 🙏",

Neutrogena cleanser normal to oily (just started this one though) \n\nI use cheap neem face washes (medimix and Himalaya) or pears shower gel. They haven't aggravated my skin, just serve their basic purpose I guess. \n\nI do love and use the Himalaya neem face pack, that one actually feels great, eliminated some bad acne and gave me an overall brighter clean look. \nI also have really bad hyperpigmentation on the rest of my body and blackheads on my nose.\n\nI don't use much moisturizer on my face due to having oily skin and commute that exposes me directly to pollution for long periods. \n\nI did go to a dermat about two years ago who gave me a bunch of products but told me mine was hormonal. I don't have PCOS, my periods are regular. I am overweight by 20kgs (working on losing it) just 10k steps and reducing meal quantities.\n\nWill this be fixed by weight loss?

My face gets so dry and puffy, especially under my eyes, my cheeks, jaw, really my emtire face, puffy and my fingers and stomach feel so swollen. It was like this throughout a wedding functions throughout my trip last year. It was very hard to get over the symptoms.  I infact couldn't... \n\nI have several South Asian wedding functions coming up across the border and I’m terrified of looking like this in all the photos.\n\n​I feel like I’m doing everything \"right\", I drink water, I try to watch my salt, I even try to use a Gua Sha when I get there, but nothing is working. I’m clearly missing something.\n\n​Is it the sitting in the vehicle while getting to the destination?\n\n​Is it the air in the car? Was it the air in the hotel that dried out my skin?!\n\n​Am I drinking too much water? Or not enough??!\n\n​Should I be using specific products or tools during the drive? or after? \n\nShould I take my nuface with me? or gua sha it ? I don't know what to do!! \n\n​I honestly have no idea what to do at this point. If anyone has ever dealt with this or has a \"holy grail\" trick to stop the swelling before it starts, please help! I'm desperate!\n\nI really don't want to suffer, I was in bittersweet sadness throughout the family wedding.  I don't want to be haunted by the same issue by this trip too. I am open all advice!!! ",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

Also my hair type..\n\nMy routine\n\nWash - moroccan oil curl shampoo (massage into scalp and rinse)\n\nCondition- moroccan oil curl conditioner (squeeze extra water out before product then rake through hair and then push to scalp with head tilt over)\n\nProducts - I use moroccan oil, intense, curl cream and do the praying hands method and then push to scalp with head tilt over. I then use not your mothers curl mousse and just put a golf ball size and have head still tilt over and push to scalp.\n\nI then either just let it hair dry or just squeeze a bit of water out with a cotton shirt.\n\nI’m new to all this so I just do what I see online.\n\nThe first 4 photos I like. But that’s not on the wash day it’s either 1-2-3 days after. Every morning after my wash I just damp my hair with my hands and then just squeeze the water out with a cotton shirt and it it makes my curls a lot more defined or something.\n\nThe fifth photo is after my shower and doing my routine, it seems like really weighed down or something.\n\nThe 6th photo is like 3 days after wash it gets super frizzy sometimes\n\nnumber 7 is right after I wake up with my bonnet this is when I would use my hands to pat water on my head to make it damp to make it look nicer.\n\n8th photo is like once in awhile it looks really bad after a shower\n\nLike I said I really have no clue what I’m doing. I would like to know my hair type and find a good routine I can stick to. Find how to make my front pieces less flat. I get a diffuser tomorrow.\n\nThe rest of the photos is just photos from a video I took that shows better angles.\n\nAlso like when I don’t how it looks after a shower I just scratch at the roots and that’s when it looks better.\n\nThank you to anyone who reads this and can try to help me. I can provide more info or photos (:\n\nAlso bonus photo of my curls when I was little 😭",

      "content": "Hi guys, I’ve been struggling with stubborn spots and redness around my chin and upper lips for the last year. It all started when I overdid it with a combo of tazarotene and glycolic acid, and heavily compromised my skin barrier. In an effort to repair it, I then stuck with using occlusives that were probably too heavy for my skin, which caused further breakouts. I also have to shave, which only exacerbates the problem - this is unavoidable, but I am pursuing hair removal to remove the necessity for shaving.\n\nI wanted to ask if anybody had any thoughts on what is the likely cause?\n\nOver the last couple of weeks, I’ve been using nothing but Avene Cicalfate and a hydrating, sulfate-free cleanser, and it has improved somewhat. I was at a point a while ago where my skin was so dry that moisturiser wouldn’t even absorb properly and my whole chin would be flakey.\n\nAny help would be super appreciated!",

I’m still a beginner though and definitely open to advice.\n\nHair type: 3C, fine strands, high density, high porosity, on the drier side.\n\nSchedule:  \n1 wash day per week  \n1 refresh per week  \nSilk bonnet at night\n\nWash day:  \nClarifying shampoo: Curlsmith Curl Reset Detox Shampoo  \nShampoo: Curlsmith Core Strength Shampoo  \nConditioner: Curlsmith Multi-Tasking Conditioner  \nLeave-in: Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream  \nGel: Curlsmith In-Shower Style Fixer  \nSealing oil: Curlsmith Bonding Oil\n\nI clarify when I feel buildup. I leave the conditioner on for 15 to 30 minutes and detangle with it in. I apply the leave-in on very wet hair, then a good amount of gel, and diffuse. Once fully dry, I scrunch out the cast with the oil.\n\nRefresh:  \nWater spray  \nA bit of leave-in  \nSometimes a little gel if needed  \nDiffuse\n\nI’m happy with the volume and definition, but I feel like I can still improve curl clumping and dryness management. Any feedback or optimization tips are welcome.",
