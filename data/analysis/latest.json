Is there any recommendations for products (including shampoo and conditioners) suited for this type of hair? My current routine is just a regular vanilla shampoo (ogx) 3 times a week, and let airdry. I also feel like my curls are very forced, and i have to use a lot of water to make them pop, I’ve also switched to silk pillow recently which helps a bit i guess",

I’m exhausted dealing with this.\n\nI’ve been using 5% benzoyl peroxide on my underarms in the shower, but I don’t really see much of a difference—maybe slight odor control at best. If anything, it feels like it makes me sweat more. Within about 4 hours of showering, there’s already a noticeable smell, and it just gets worse as the day goes on.\n\nI also use a salicylic acid body wash and scrub my armpits pretty thoroughly (I even washed them three times last night), but it still doesn’t help. Even with my Ouai deodorant, the odor eventually comes through.\n\nThis has become really frustrating and embarrassing, especially because I worry other people can smell it—my brother has even pointed it out before. I really need advice or recommendations because I’m at a loss.\n\nTHANK YOU 🙏",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I am looking for a simple product or maybe 2 products that could help with acne discolouration/ dark spots and also black heads.\n\nI struggled with acne for a long time, went on accutane which worked so good for a while. Pores literally disappeared but then my acne eventually came back. Finally got off all the hormonal stuff and my skin has balanced out (for the most part) I still get some hormonal acne along my jaw but only on the left side which is super weird. And some random smaller pimples on my cheeks but rarely.\n\nNow I have some blackheads on my cheeks which have been more common. And I also have a lot of dark spots and discolouration from acne that I’d love to heal. Currently I’m using panoxyl cleanser at night plus the panoxyl balancing moisturizer and then just using a lightweight gel moisturizer from aveeno in the morning. My skin isn’t dry and not too oily either.\n\nSo far my research has lead me to maybe azelaic acid? And maybe a toner? I’m so overwhelmed by the options! My budget is pretty low so looking for drugstore options.\n\nThank you SO much for any recommendations or advice yall have &lt;33",

Apologies for the quality of the pictures.\n\nThese past few weeks, she has been complaining that her skin feels really dry and that she would like to get rid of the hyperpigmentation on her face. \n\nHer face has been much darker than the rest of her body for over a decade now. Before bed, she uses a Vitamin C Serum, Arbutin 7.0+ TXA 4.0 Cream, and Naugé's Oatmeal Daily Moisturising Cream (not in order). I'm assuming its the same in the morning as well. \n\nFor the dryness, I advised her to put Vaseline on her face after applying the products just to reduce the feeling temporarily. And she bought the Arbutin 7.0+ TCA 4.0 Cream about a month and a half ago with the hope that it would help with her hyperpigmentation, but she stated that it hasn't really made a change.\n\nIf there is anything that you guys could recommend that she should use, I would really appreciate it. Thank you!",

I do have a diffuser but I’ve not had very much success with it, and I’m thinking it’s because I do not use other products in addition to my current routine.\n\nI currently live in an East Asian country where straight, thick hair is the norm—I did go to a supposed curly hair specialist in my city, and was recommended their in-house “N brand” (pictures attached) but didn’t find that these products worked very well either—even with the leave-in conditioner and using a microfiber towel, my hair still doesn’t look very well-defined and ends up pretty frizzy. \n\nI’ll have some defined curls, but when I go out/go to sleep, my hair usually just becomes a floofy mess by the time I get home/wake up in the mornings, so I’ve resorted to straightening my hair, but would love to learn how to style my natural hair. \n\nI get a little disheartened when I see products recommended here that I’m not able buy where I am—I do have access to iHerb, so if any curly girls in East Asia have similar hair and found products that work for them, I’d be super grateful to hear about those.\n\nAppreciate your time in reading through this.

I have struggled with bad blackheads on my nose prior.\n\nI used the “coxir ULTRA HYALURONIC CLEANSING OIL,” and it seemingly worked great at first! It got everything out, and I got a little trigger happy and used it maybe three times that week. After, I would hop in the shower and clean my face with Cetaphil Gentle Face Washer. I did notice my skin on my nose drying because of it.\n\nI stopped for a bit, and about a week or two after, I got a really big breakout on my nose and cheek area. Tiny whiteheads and big pimples, with red irritation and dry, peeling skin. It was so bad it looked like I got sunburned!\n\nIt’s finally calming down now, but I do notice some texture on my nose and cheeks still. I wanted to try again thinking maybe I’m doing something wrong? Or is it a product thing? It was the only thing that ever really got rid of my blackheads, which is a big insecurity for me.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, or product recommendations on the less expensive side, I’d love the help! Thank you.",

      "content": "I honestly have to share this because I was about two days away from just chopping all my hair off. For the last few months, my curl pattern has been completely undefined, just mushy, frizzy, and refusing to clump, no matter how much gel I used.  \n  \nI realized my old products were probably stripping my hair too much, so I decided to look into Japanese haircare since I heard they use milder surfactants. I picked up the BOTANIST \"Smooth\" line (the Green Apple &amp; Rose one) because I was specifically looking for an organic shampoo for women that balances protein and moisture without being heavy.  \n  \nThe difference after just two washes is actually insane. The shampoo feels really gentle but still lathers well, which is rare for sulfate-free stuff.  \n  \nHere is the full breakdown of how I managed this wash day:  \n  \nFor the wash, I used the BOTANIST Botanical Shampoo (Smooth) - I focused really heavily on massaging the scalp to make sure I got all the buildup off without stripping the lengths. I followed up with the matching BOTANIST Treatment, applying it generously from the ears down. I detangled with my fingers and used the \"squish to condish\" method to really push water into the hair shaft until it felt like seaweed.  \n  \nFor styling, I kept it simple to test the shampoo's effect. I applied Kinky Curly Knot Today leave-in using the \"prayer hands\" method on soaking wet hair, then scrunched in a good amount of LA Looks Blue Gel to form a cast. I micro-plopped with an old cotton t-shirt for about 10 minutes to stop the dripping, then diffused on low heat until it was 100% dry.  \n  \nTo maintain this overnight, I sleep on a satin pillowcase with my hair up in a loose \"pineapple\". If I need a refresh on day 2 or 3, I usually just mix a little water with the leave-in in my palms and glaze it over any frizz halo.  \n  \nI'm just so relieved to see my definition back without that gross, dry feeling!",

I'm new to this sub and know very little about skin care, so I thought I could ask you guys for some tips/advice on my routine! l'm closing in on 30 years old and my face is changing with more lines and some sagginess. Although I love getting older and seeing my looks change, I don't want to speed up the process by doing some big mistakes with my skincare. I have little issues with my skin other than a (sometimes very) oily t-zone that I have had my whole life, and some pimples here and there. Again, I know very little about skin care products and would love to hear if anyone have any tips or feedbacks? Thanks in advance :)\n\nMorning routine  \n1. Cleansing - *CeraVe foaming cleanser normal to oily skin*  \n2. Serum - EITHER *COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power essence* OR *COSRX Centella Aqua Soothing Ampoule*  \n3. Moisturizer, eye cream and sun screen. I usually mix the sun screen and moisturizer together  just because it saves time, hehe - *COSRX Lightweight Soothing Moisturizer* and *COSRX Advanced Snail Peptide Eye Cream* \\+ *La Roche-posay Anthelios 50 spf* (works, but feel a bit sticky throughout the day\n\nNight routine:  \n1. Cleansing - *CeraVe foaming cleanser normal ta oily skin*  \n2. Toner - *COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner*  \n3. Serum - EITHER *COSRX The 6 Peptide Booster* OR *The Ordinary Multi-Peptide + HA Serum*  \n4. Moisturizer and eve cream - *COSRX Ultimate Nourishing Rice (overnight spa mask)* and *COSRX Advanced Snail Peptide Eye Cream*\n\nOnce in a while (thinking of starting using them once a week on different days?):  \n*- The Ordinarv Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%*  \n*- The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Soultion*",

My hair was around 2b-c short and when long 2a, that was 2 years ago. \n\nI ate a very unhealthy diet of excess meat and carbs and oil and sugar and didn't workout. Going forward now I had long 2a hair but eat very healthy and excercise, but i don't do anything special with my hair because the products seem too complex for me to work out what to do, I get a haircut a few weeks back and now my hair is much more curlier than it ever has been, like almost 3a hair while short, its considerably curlier to the point people think I did something special with my hair.\n\nSo that begs the question, can eating a healthy diet actually make your hair curlier, or is this some kind of cognitive bias I have and Im forgetting how curly it used to be?",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m looking for advice because I honestly have no idea where to start with my hair.\n\nI recently did a big chop (first image). My hair used to be mid-back length, but it was very damaged, so I cut it shorter to try and start fresh. I have not created a routine at all yet so I am unable to provide one I’ve been mix matching between creams, mousses, gels, oils and leave-ins trying to find something that works. The first picture is no product but it is diffused to the best of my ability. I hover dry for 15 minutes and pixie diffuse for another 5 minutes until completely dry. Other than that I use head and shoulders shampoo and conditioner as this is the only thing that has seemed to work for me.\n\nI’ve had curly and frizzy hair since I was a kid, but it was never really taken care of properly. Both my parents have straight hair, so no one really knew how to manage curls. It was almost always brushed out and pulled into a low ponytail or slicked-back ponytail, which definitely didn’t help.\n\nOn top of that, I started using heat on my hair every day from around age 13, and I’ve only just recently stopped at 21, so I’m sure that contributed a lot to the damage and loss of curl pattern.\n\nWhen I was younger, I did actually have spiral curls, and even recently my hair can still form curls, but they feel inconsistent and hard to maintain.\n\nI also went to a hairdresser for my 21st birthday hoping to get my curls styled and shaped properly, but it was honestly a terrible experience. Their website advertised curl-focused styling, but they barely put effort into defining or styling my curls, and the result didn’t reflect what I was hoping for at all (second image).\n\nRight now my biggest struggles are frizz, flat roots with no volume at the scalp, curls forming more on the ends but looking limp or weighed down at the top, and not knowing whether I should focus on moisture, protein, lighter products, or something else.\n\nEverything I’ve tried so far seems to either weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy and undefined.\n\nIf anyone has advice on how to help curls become healthier, how to get volume at the roots, what kind of routine or products might suit fine to medium curly hair, or even just where to start when you’ve never really learned curl care, I’d seriously appreciate it. Also I’m from Australia, so preferably Aussie products!\n\nAny advice is welcome because I feel pretty lost and overwhelmed. Thanks so much!",

      "content": "Hi all! I've got this problem where my hair looks \"curly\" for about 30 minutes every other time it gets wet, then goes back to flat \"wavy-at-best\" in a few hours. Is there anything I can do to retain the definition and volume without spending half my life on maintenance, or should i just come to terms with having straight hair?\n\nI've tried different shampoos, conditioners, blow drying/not blow drying methods, and ended up with a cabinet full of half-used products that I spent way too much on &amp; gave up because the results seemed like placebo compared to the amount of effort that went into it. Not to mention the scalp weigh-down... It seems like everyone has their own curly hair routine they swear by that i could spent hundreds of dollars on commiting to only to find out that it doesn't work for me.\n\nNow I'm back at square one, which means washing my hair every 2-3 days with whatever shitty 2-in-1 Schauma Men Sports shampoo i have on hand, using Syoss Intense Oleo conditioner every other wash to prevent complete matting, and leaving it alone to air dry. This was also the treatment after which i took the first picture. Later I decided to give it one more try and invest in OnlyBio curl activator cream &amp; Taft curl styling balm, rubbed about a pea sized amount of each into wet hair after washing, and it instantly turned whatever \"curls\" there were into silky smooth, flat loose strands that refused to form any definition. This🤏 close to just giving up on it lol\n\nSo, question to the experienced curlyheads that started out with flat, straight-ish hair. How did you build your routine? Is it even worth it?",

Second and third was kind of a one off where it actually held a curl, and it was after no shampoo for a few days, but i had to stop because it was way too greasy and sweaty.\n\nMy routine currently is just shampoo then condition (generic brands) and rinse then let it air dry, no extra products.",

However, in the last month (at least) there have maybe been 5 days where my lips didn’t look like this, if not worst. My bottom lip isn’t definitely chapped (nothing new) but my top lip is totally different and nearly intolerable. It feels like sandpaper, is very stiff, and burns all day and all night.\n\nI use Aquaphor when I’m at home, applying several times a day. It provides little relief. I have a Vaseline chapstick that I use when I’m at work because it’s more convenient than a tube of Aquaphor. Also is having nearly no impact on the state of my lip.\n\nI had a similar flare up mid December, and my lips were in better shape for a little while until I took a day trip to Chicago on Jan. 2 on a very cold day. I thought my lips had just gotten wind-chapped, but my lip has been this way since with no improvement.\n\nThis doesn’t feel like my usual chapped lips. I have seen posts about eczema, cheilitis, and other things… wondering if anyone can tell just by this picture if it might be one of these things.\n\nIf you have any recommendations on what I can do to get some relief, I’m open to literally anything.
