      "content": "I (54F) have 2B-3B 20% virgin grey hair, and I'd like to try something fun with it. I was thinking about trying a semi permanent colour, something fun and vivid, like deep red or royal purple, that would really make the white streaks that frame my face pop. However, when I've tried semi permanents in the past, my curl does NOT like it. My hair gets drier, curls don't clump properly and get looser. I've already lost so much of my curl pattern since menopause (gone from a solid 3B with lots of density and consistent curls that needed minimum help to define or style to much looser overall, with a real mix of mostly 2B-3B, and a couple of small pieces that are closer to 2A. But I am not happy with my hair - I'm 20% grey,  especially around the front (incl. 2 cool white streaks at the temples) and the loss of volume and curl means it's so much flatter and harder to style than it used to be.\nI have dyed my hair before, about 8 years ago, with E-Salon, when my hair had a tighter more consistent curl pattern and full density (I've lost 25-30% of my density since then), and it always took a few weeks minimum to recover. Now, with the current density and curl pattern, as well as being on the drier side of normal, I'm worried that I will just end up losing much of the remaining curl and volume. \nHas anyone had any experience playing with colour on their curls? What effect did it have on condition, curl pattern and styling? \n\nMy routine:\n\nShampoo: Carole's Daughter Goddess Strength (once or twice a month)\nDaily conditioner: Carole's Daughter Goddess Strength (every shower)\nMask: alternating between Carole's Daughter Goddess Strength and Verb Hydrate Mask \nClarifying shampoo: L'Oreal Everpure (as needed - I don't get a lot of product building up as I don't use a lot of product)\nLeave In: LUS All in One for curly hair\nStyling: LUS Sea Moss gel. Have also tried Curlsmith Curl Souffle and FX texturizing paste.\nMethod: squish to condish, then before getting out of shower, apply the LUS All in 1 prayer style, comb through w wide toothed comb, wrap in microfiber towel to soak up excess water, then section and curl brush and either air dry or, if going out, apply LUS Sea Moss gel to hair prayer style, section and curl brush to clump, then combo of scrunch/hover diffuser on low gentle heat until about 80-90% dry (live in a very humid climate). If I'm using texturizing paste, I do it right after taking off the towel, but don't use both that and gel.\n\nAlso, please note that photos show my hair air dried, not diffused and styled (which would be fuller and curlier). And I'm planning on getting a shorter cut to reclaim some of my curls and volume.",

      "content": "Hello! I have recently decided to actually try to take care of my curly hair lol. The issue is, I have no idea what I am doing.\n\nMy curl type is maybe 3a, but that probably doesn't matter.  My hair type is thick, coarse, and absorbs product well, I think? Most likely dry. I just started using curl cream (unscented Not Your Mother's), mouse (also unscented, same brand), and curl gel (Odele). Sometimes I use an Odele volume foam, but not too much. I have the Odele hair oil too, but haven't used it really. I use the Wet Brush Curl Detangler. It kind of looks like a hand? lol.\n\nThe first pic of my hair is after swimming in the ocean, no product or styling. The second doesn't have a product either, I believe.\n\nHere are my troubles:\n\n1. I flip my head upside down and apply products. The bottom half looks really nice! However, the sideburn areas tend to be kinda straight-ish, as do the top half of my hair. The curls lose their magic the longer after wash day. Any curl refresher product recommendations?\n2. I've tried doing a pineapple bun and a bonnet at night (the tie with a ribbon kind). I wake up with it slipped off a bit and feel like my curls look kinda flat/frizzy. It's also not the most comfortable.\n3. I LOVE volume. Especially at the top of my hair! Is it possible to get this and a good curl definition? So far, I'm lacking in both areas.\n\nDoes anyone have routine advice? How often should I wash my hair? My hair doesn't get too greasy. What do I do after washing? What should I do in the morning and at night daily? How do I refresh the curls to last longer?\n\nI don't diffuse because I'm a tad bit nervous about heat damage (silly, I know). But I am open to it!\n\nLet me know any product recommendations! As you can see from what I listed, I prefer unscented or minimal, naturally derived fragrances.\n\nWould love any advice! Thank you.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

      "content": "Hi! \n\nMy daughter is about 16 months old and I'm trying to learn how do her hair after her bath and before bedtime. I'm just some white dude with straight hair so I've barely even brushed my own hair. But my wife is Black and beautiful with wonderfully curly hair. \nOur daughters hair is a mix between our hair. It's curly, but they are big curls, not like my wife's tight curls. \n\nRight now I'm brushing her hair in the bath/shower every night, and shampooing every few days with her baby soap/shampoo. Then I dry her hair, and use a lush product called curl power. My wife used to use this product before she did her big chop many years ago and allowed her hair to go full Afro. So I like using it because she smells like my wife when we met. Then I brush her hair again before trying to curl it. I just take strands of hair and wrap them around my finger while she plays with books. \n\nI'm not even sure if this is the right order of operations, just with testing it's seemed to turn out okay? My wife didn't grow up around any Black people, so she was never taught how to manage her hair and didn't embrace her curls until she was well into her 30s. I'm just trying to decrease the mental load on my wife by figuring out a decent routine at night. Also I do all the baths at night so it just makes logical sense. \n\nBut if there's any resources or advice the curly hair community can give a new Dad I'd be all ears. Thanks so much! ",

I haven't moved to a new environment or anything, though I will mention I live in a dry area.\nEvery morning and night, I wash my face and add\nmoisturizing creams. I've tried to do my research but I guess it's not enough because I continue to have dry skin. See pic attached. Sorry, that's the best I could get and zoomed in so it could show what its like, but all over my face. It was hard to capture it so it could convey what I mean. \n\nIts mostly annoying and peeling off constantly. And really not normal. I also exfoliate and that sort of helps but not really. This picture was taken after\nexfoliating and putting on a cream with retinol. I've tried several expensive face creams throughout the years, the last one being a Korean cream a friend recommended me. But still the same results.\n\nSo I'm at a loss. I put on makeup a few times per week also. Putting it on top of skin like that is a bummer. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.",

Over the past two years I have been trying to take better care of myself, which includes my hair, and now it curls like this. But for some reason, only half my hair does this and the other half stays straight?? \n\nWhile researching my question, I found that some people with wavy hair go their whole lives without knowing their hair was wavy because they weren't using the right products. I guess I was one of those people. My whole family has curly hair, and my sister has the prettiest ringlets. I always kinda felt left out. \n\nAnyways, my question is, why does some of my hair curl and some of it stay straight while most of it is wavy? Why is it so inconsistent?? And is there a way to keep all of my hair curly/wavy?? \n\nObligatory routine (please forgive me if I did anything wrong, this is my first time on this subreddit and I am still new to hair care!!):\n1. I used to use the crown hair society curl enhancing shampoo and conditioner, but after I moved states I am not allowed to buy anything for myself, so I have been using my mother's leftover 2-in-1 shampoo :(\n2. I use the herbal essences rose hips conditioner (also leftover from my mother :( ) \n3. I don't use any styling products\n4. I towel dry my hair.

I've been really struggling because I can't seem to make this haircut look good, I basically look like Dora the Explorer minus the bangs. I've started going to a new hairdresser (it was another hairdresser who cut my hair into a bob) and she suggested getting another haircut that is specific for reducing volume and making the hair look \"lighter\". I told her that I would think about it but to be honest I'm really sceptical about this, I don't really see how another haircut will make my hair look less thick.
