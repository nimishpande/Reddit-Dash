      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

The top of my hair turned orange and the bottom turned ashy and almost white. Nothing blended at all. When I asked her why it looked like that, she blamed “damage from a previous stylist,” even though she never mentioned any issue before starting. If my hair was supposedly too damaged to lift evenly, I feel like that’s something I should have been told before she went ahead with the color.\n\nI went back and asked for ash blonde to fix it and even things out. After the second appointment my hair is still patchy, still uneven, and still two totally different tones. The front pieces are extremely white while the rest is a completely different color. My curls also feel more damaged now.\n\nWhen I brought it up, she just told me to wash it and that the white would fade with time. To me that doesn’t feel like a real solution, especially after two appointments and paying a lot of money.\n\nAm I overreacting, or does it sound like she’s avoiding responsibility for a bad color job? I’d really appreciate outside opinions. \n\nI’m feeling so depressed, how long would it take for me to fix my hair if I use bond repair products ? And can I use a darker blonde gloss to even everything out ? I just got my hair done Friday and redone Saturday . This picture is what it looks like now \n\n\nRoutine:\nShampoo: Shea Moisture / curl-friendly sulfate-free shampoo (I rotate depending on wash day)\nConditioner: Any moisturizing conditioner for curly hair\nStyling: Curl cream + light gel (nothing heavy because my curls get weighed down easily)\nDrying: Air-dried\nOther: I sleep on a satin pillowcase and try to avoid heat",

      "title": "Post op day 1, My 10 year journey and thoughts about hair loss, advice",
      "content": "Just wanted to share some perspectives after just having a transplant post op day 1. These are general advice and thoughts, not representing a patient - provider medical recommendation.\n\nBackground:\n\n* I work in the medical field as an internal medicine physician so although I am not an expert on hair I treat patients all the time for AGA with prescriptions of oral minoxidil and oral finasteride. Anything beyond that such as dutasteride I refer to my dermatology colleagues given need for ongoing lab monitoring\n* I also routinely recommend LLLT for my patients but my understanding of the evidence is that its unclear whether lasers vs LED is better and at what treatment protocol. Many of the studies are industry sponsored but I do believe there may be some additional benefit.\n* Outside of these I don't have too much to say about copper, exosomes, micro needling etc.\n\nMy Journey\n\n* I started noticing hair loss at age 19. I didn't think much of it because I was premed in college and also went out a lot so I assumed it was stress and poor sleep.\n* I only started discussing with my primary care doctor when I was 21 and started on finasteride orally at topical rogaine. At that time the hair loss had progressed significantly.\n* I believe I added LLLT to my protocol at approximately age 26.\n* I would say that at age 21-30 my hairloss minimized to stabalized, but especially at the front there was never any significant regrowth. Through that time I experimented with a lot of other options such as topical finasteride, topical dusteride, etc from companies such as hers/hims offering compounded products. There may have been some benefit but I eventually switched to the tried and true oral minoxidil and oral finasteride.\n* Ultimately I decided on a hair transplant to fix what the medication and other treatments could not. I wanted something to look natural for my age and look natural into aging 40-60s in the future. Maybe at age 45-55 I'd just stop treatment and go for the bald look or buy a toupee.\n\nTransplantation Decision\n\n* As an Asian dude I decided to go to a country with more experience seeing Asian patients (not sure if there is any actual benefit here) but found a good clinic in thailand with a good reputation and reasonable price . I met with the main doctor and their partner and they both seemed very competent leading me to book and place a deposit.\n\nCurve Ball (1-2 weeks before transplantation) - ?Alopecia Areata Icognitia/Diffuse Diagnosis\n\n* About 2 weeks before the transplantation I came across a YouTuber discussing the diagnosis of alopecia areata incognita. Unlike AGA, this is a inflammatory/autoimmune condition that is completely different in pathogenesis, treatment to AGA. I had noticed that on minoxidil and finasteride I was having less hair loss but there was still ongoing loss. This led me to question my original diagnosis from both primary care and dermatologists I'd seen as I wondered if both were present.\n* Alopecia areata (non incognita or non diffuse) typically presents with round patchy complete hairloss, not necessarily diffuse thinning.\n* I booked an appointment with a hair specialist/surgeon (with dermatology training) locally without mentioning anything about my concerns. They used trichoscopy and noticed at my temples (an area typically not affected by AGA) there seemed to be more thinning than what would be expected. They also noticed some yellow dots which led them to believe that I also had ongoing alopecia areata incognita. They strongly recommended I treat with topical steroids for about a year before moving forward with any surgery. I asked about their level of confidence and they said 80% that I had both AGA and AAI.\n* Obviously at this point I was super concerned. They had no reason to lie to me, in fact the incentives they have are to do a surgery. I was also on a tight timeline with my upcoming booked surgery.\n* Being in the healthcare field I had some connection with some local dermatologists so asked around for their second opinion, sending over dermatoscope (slightly different from trichoscopy) photos. I was able to be seen by a different 2 dermatologists based in the US and they shared their following thoughts.\n   * On their exam in person and review of my dermoscopy pictures I had no obvious features of AAI. If they were to pursue a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis they wouldn't even know where to biopsy.\n   * The timeline for biopsy results would not come before my expected surgery date.\n   * They mentioned that in some individuals AGA can affect atypical areas such as the temporal area above the ear where some mild thinning was noted.\n* On my own research reading of this condition\n   * Yellow dots at the follicle used to be pathognomonic(confirmatory) of alopecia areata and AAI/diffuse\n   * Alopecia areata and AAI also seem to have other trichoscopy features (exclamation point hairs, black dots etc) [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11908991/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11908991/)\n   * As medical science has increased, it seems that yellow dots are also found in other hair conditions such as AGA, and that they may be more variable in size (not peer reviewed) [https://donovanmedical.com/hair-blog/yellow-dots](https://donovanmedical.com/hair-blog/yellow-dots)\n   * During my trichoscopy appointment I noticed that the yellow dot I had was **indeed variable in size and looked nothing like the ones mentioned in the literature**\n\nMy Plan/Thoughts\n\n* I shared my recent findings with the transplantation surgeon, who initially was quite skeptical of the AAI/diffuse diagnosis. They are dermatology trained too and had the following to say\n   * AAI/diffuse is rarer in men\n   * It presents with pretty intense diffuse shedding\n* After much back and forth we agreed to do a pre-op assessment as initially discussed and if there were any concerns they would change my deposit for PRP injections to which I agreed.\n* Given my own practice I know that medical science is always evolving and is our knowledge. Certain conditions such as Lyme disease weren't even thought to be a real condition until scientists found the causitive organism in 1982. I just want to share that medical science is not perfect.\n   * My own thoughts after getting so many opinions (2 against, 1 possibly yes) is that yes, if I do have some component of AAI/diffuse its likely very mild given trichoscopy, dermoscopy and lack of aggressive shedding.\n* Once I'm back in the US, I plan to get a biopsy of the non donor/non recipient area to confirm whether there is some low level AAI/diffuse. Mainly at the temporal area above the ear where some thinning was noticed\n\nPre Op Day and Post Op\n\n* My transplant physician examined me and did not feel at all that my presentation was consistent with AAI/diffuse. We moved forward with the surgery.\n* I plan to discuss with them when its okay to concurrently treat with topical steroids incase there is also some underlying autoimmune component.\n\nLearnings/Advice to others given my own journey (just general advice, not a patient - provider medical opinion)\n\n* I wish I had pursued more opinions before going into a transplant surgery. Get advice from a specialist in hair (many dermatologists are not used to more atypical cases), and ask for trischocopy and bring up the features of AAI/diffuse so they can examine for this If possible. Many transplant surgeons will do this for free as a part of an initial consultation.\n* If you continue to have some low level of shedding even with regular treatments, it could be that your response has platuead with these medications and maybe you need dutasteride etc, OR that you might have some other concurrent condition such as AAI/diffuse.\n* Consider getting a biopsy if there is an obvious area involved to confirm this diagnosis\n* Consider holding off on transplantation if you are okay with it. It seems there are many novel medications in the pipeline with new mechanisms of action that may be helpful. It's possible however they wont be approved and onsale until 2027-2029",

I'm now a bit lost. I have no idea what type this is. Sometimes it comes out wavy, but sometimes really curly. Curl gel doesn't quite work for me (I used John Frieda hair jelly) and defuser to, so I just let it dry naturally. Here is my routine:\n\n1. Schauma Man shampoo. It's the only shampoo that makes my hair curly (and costs 3 euros lolz). Shampoo twice, brush through with a wide tooth comb.\n\n2. John Frieda - curl defining conditioner. Apply it on the lenght, brush through, then scrunch and rinse.\n\n3. Eleven - keep my curl defining cream. Apply it on towel dried hair and scrunch.\n\n4. Hair oil (sorry, don't remember the name)\nAnd then airdry. I don't wear bonnets nor use silky pillows.\n\nAny tips for flat roots and creating an even curl/wave pattern? What products can be helpful? How to use defuser so it won't make my hair frizzy? \n\nThank you! 🤍",

      "content": "1. I wash my hair about once a week with Carol’s daughter shampoo and conditioner curl quencher one and afterwards started parting my hair in four and applying leave in conditioner (was also carol’s daughter hair milk but it proved too thick for my hair texture so then I recently bought Mixed Chicks leave in). Today was my first time ever using the Redken acidic bonding leave in conditioner and I freaking love it! \n\n2. I don’t use any products ever apart from carol’s daughter shampoo and conditioner listed above, and mixed chicks leave in conditioner and today I used the Redken acidic bonding curl quenching leave in conditioner. \n\n3. I mostly air dry with the very rare occasion of using a diffuser when I’m in a rush and need my hair dry \n\n4. I use a fabric scrunchy for curly hair to very loosely tie my hair up when I go to sleep, and sometimes will use a bonnet to sleep\n\nThe issue is that the mid back upper layer part of my hair doesn’t curl the same, it barely curls because a few months ago I would comb through my hair with my fingers (when stressed or anxious) and whenever I felt a knot or clumping, I’d continue to comb through it with my fingers while dry (which I know is terrible) and I’m sure I damaged it enough to be the reason it doesn’t curl the same anymore. \n\nDo I just have to wait for it to grow out? Or will it be doomed forever? I’m hoping that regular use of this leave in conditioner will help get my curl pattern back but I was hoping maybe someone has some advice or tips. Thank you! ",

Now I'm reading posts that if you can scrunch your hair while wet and it air dries wavy, that's what it really wants to be. I have thin hair that has to be washed about every two to three days or it looks oily. I don't do much to style it currently. Just brush it/let it air dry/put it up in a clip. I'd love to wear it down more often. Can anyone recommend some products to me and help me establish a routine? Specifically nontoxic/EWG verified products. I just added a silk pillowcase to my pick up order and saw recommendations to pin hair up in a tshirt for 10-20 min after showering.

I’ve read that some people have gotten fungal acne from the mineral formula, and I don’t know if that’s what it is in my case, but either way I don’t want bumps.\n\nSo… does anyone have any sunscreen recommendations with that in mind? I am 39, caucasian, fair toned, combination, sensitive, somewhat acne prone. In the U.S. and trying to cap the price at $40. I will happily consider anything in that price range that can be ordered easily.\n\nThe rest of my routine for reference:\n\nAM- rinse with lukewarm water, apply a caffeinated eye gel or cream (right now I’m alternating Good Molecules Yerba Mate eye gel and Inkey Caffeinated eye cream), The Ordinary Azelaic Acid suspension, Peach Slices Redness Relief cream, a very thin layer of LRP Cicaplast on the apples of my cheeks (this is where I have barrier issues/rosacea flare-ups).\n\nPM- cleanse with LRP Toleriane Purifying Foaming face wash, the eye cream or gel, LRP Toleriane Double Repair moisturizer, Good Molecules Bakuchiol oil blend for dry skin, Good Molecules Gentle Retinol cream on my forehead, a bit thicker layer of Cicaplast on cheeks.",

Years later (after multiples choppings) I decided to just let it grow, i was seeing some curls in the front but most of it are just strong waves. I don’t really understand, I took care of my hair but the more and more kept falling out, yes i’ve been under a lot of stress idk if that has a part in it, I also smoke weed so that either. Fast-forward to now I just decided to start over and go baldita! Could I get any tips or answers on how i could get back my thicker curly-hair? Like what could I eat, supplements, derma-rolling? Anything would be helpful🫶🏽\n\nFor the routine that I used most of the times was\n\n1. Wash hair, rinse\n2. Condition, detangle, rinse\n3. Shea moisture leave in conditionner, rake through, scrunch\n4. Shes moisture curling cream, rake through, scrunch\n5. Scrunch with gel\n6. Scrunch with a towel, turn head upside down scrunch again\n7. Plop for 15-20mins\n8. Diffuse until damp\n9.

I have used la Roche posays toleraine cleanser, but that really seemed to burn my skin and made my face look like a tomato, I have also been using avene tolerance cream, but not having much joy, so I’m looking to switch over to K-beauty products. Has anybody had any experience with things that have worked well for them with similar skin issues? I’m looking to keep it quite simple, like just a cleanser, a serum and then a moisturiser.

I don’t have a lot of time to let it  my hair air dry (don’t have a hair dryer. Wife doesn’t want me using one says it will damage my hair), so I pat dry as much as I can then towel dry it (I know I’m not supposed to do this as it causes some frizz but I think it helps my hair to lay better)\n\nIn the photos attached, I had used a drop of hair oil the day before and tried my best to pat dry only as best I could and that was the result in the picture (I think it’s messy and all over the place but I’m also not used to having my hair this length.)\n\nMy hair length currently goes to just above my eyes.\n\nAny help/tips/things to try would be appreciated.",
