I tried posting about this early on in my treatment but the post was rejected. (Hoping this one isn't...I read a lot in this group but don't post much.)

      "content": "Went to a dermatologist for a full skin exam since I‚Äôm a new patient. I brought up my concerns - uneven skin texture(no acne), fine lines starting on my face and neck, under-eye puffiness, smile lines, and wanting more hair volume(no dandruff or other conditions), laser hair removal, and laser and LED devices uses and benefits for me.\n\nHonestly, I got almost nothing out of the visit except a prescription for tretinoin (which I specifically asked for). No suggestions on procedures, skincare routines, or new technologies that could help. I left feeling like dermatology visits have become quick, transactional stops, easy money for minimal insight.\n\nI do not understand why dermatologists don‚Äôt prescribe certain treatments unless I insist. Most of the time, they just tell me to buy products over the counter or give me specific instructions written on sticky notes, rather than providing a prescription. Strange as it is, I feel like I visited a medical intern rather than a qualified doctor. Is it common amongst dermatologists to not bother unless it's a concerning skin disease?\n\nSo now I‚Äôm wondering: if not a dermatologist,¬†**who‚Äôs the right person to talk to**¬†about real, customized solutions, whether it‚Äôs treatments, procedures, or tech-based options for skin and hair?\n\n* Cosmetic derm?\n* Aesthetician?\n* Med spa provider?\n* Plastic surgeon?\n\nCurious to hear what‚Äôs worked best for others who‚Äôve been in this ‚ÄúI want to age well but don‚Äôt know where to start‚Äù phase.\n\n  \n",

I‚Äôm 24 and I did get frequent mild-moderate hormonal breakouts up until a few years ago, it‚Äôs chilled out since then aside from the occasional ugly pimple but the pigmentation from that remains and my skin is still textured, gets quite blotchy and itchy sometimes, and I feel like my face always looks dirty and spotty despite me having relatively ‚Äòclear‚Äô skin most of the time. \n\nIn fairness these photos don‚Äôt show it at its worst, I feel like it looks worse in person/in certain lighting. I react quite strongly to heat as well so I get much more red and itchy when I get hot! I‚Äôve completely stripped back my skincare habits to see if it helped but there‚Äôs been not much change so there‚Äôs clearly a key issue I‚Äôm missing. I don‚Äôt do a proper routine eeevery day bc I get lazy sometimes but I do try keep my skin clean and moisturised at minimum every day. I am just wary of trying something targeting the wrong issue or something super medicated in case it gets worse. \n\nThe basic products I‚Äôm using right now are: \n\n- Neutrogena micellar water (I use this for makeup removal and most nights to wipe the days grime from my face when I feel too lazy for a proper clean before bed lol) \n- Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser\n- The Ordinary hyluaronic acid &amp; niacinamide (I really like these however I‚Äôm almost out of both so haven‚Äôt been using much lately) \n- Thayers Witch Hazel rose water spray\n- Beauty of Joseon green plum toner (although  have recently run out of this too so haven‚Äôt used it in a bit)\n- Aveeno daily moisturising lotion  \n\nNothing I‚Äôve tried has ever made my skin worse, but I never particularly see an improvement either. Would love some help and some suggestions!",
