Which is basically an AD for this oil.  No real person is using this product in the ads. \n\nAs AI keeps advancing, more videos of these “influencers” will keep popping up. So be hyper vigilant out there. \n\nPost asked for my hair routine. I wash and shampoo with Shea moisture products, use a denman brush and then use Pattern Beauty leave in and curl cream. Air dry. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

How can I trim the ends myself at home? I'm terrified of cutting my hair and seeing a difference in length. I've always hated cutting my hair since I was a child, so my confidence in salons or barbers is very low. I would like some tips on how to trim the ends at home.\n\nNote: The hair in the photos is not in the best condition because I'm spending my vacation in a city that is dry and hot.\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. Wash and detangle on the same day (1-3 times) a week.\n2. Shampoo: Neutrox \"Curls and Waves\"\n3. Conditioner: Skala Curl Styling Cream\n4. Oil after washing: Salon Line \"S.O.S\" Curls\n5. Drying: Using a regular towel for a few minutes on the hair and then air drying.\n6. I don't use a satin bonnet before bed.\n\nThis is the routine I've maintained for a few years.\n\nBetween washes I don't do anything to my hair, I don't do any kind of styling.",

      "content": "First set of pictures (first 5) are from days before starting treatment 6 months ago. The second set (last 5) are from today, a bit over 6 months after starting treatment.\n\nI have seen no progress and continual loss. While it looks like my corners and my hairline are more aligned, don’t be fooled—this is because the middle/center part of my hairline moved backward, not that my corners moved forward. I am seeing continued diffuse thinning, so much so that my crown is now visibly thinning. The corners of my hairline are also moving further and further back, by the day it seems. My hair’s texture and consistency has completely changed in these 6 months and it is only going to get worse.\n\nI can’t grow a beard (probably the worst one I’ve ever seen in terms of density) and I’m only 20 so there really isn’t a good way to approach this. I’m kind of just holding on to what I have and will shave it off once it gets too bad. It’s hurting my confidence, ego, and self image in so many ways. My hair used to be one of my greatest features, and now it’s leaving me. I won’t get to enjoy my 20s with hair and will now be written off as an outcast. \n\nI have a girlfriend, but I feel that she won’t stick around once I become noticeably bald. She’s a wealthy gal and is quite pretty; there’s no reason why she’d stick around with a guy like me if I was bald. My thick, luscious Italian waves are rapidly leaving. I don’t know how to accept this and I am unsure of how I will be viewed when looking for jobs. I am already a very reserved and quiet person, but it’s okay because my hair has made me approachable and “normal” seeming. However, without this, I will surely have to try a lot harder and embrace being myself and get over my chronic anxiety.\n\nMy biggest fears are being consumed by anxiety and losing my girlfriend. She is so important to me but I feel like this will be a deal breaker, given that she is a little vain, worthy of better, and loves fashion and appearances. I’m already quite bad at socializing, so going through this might literally make or break me.\n\nI’m not sure what I should do in terms of other options. I’m afraid to start dutasteride because I’ve already been experiencing negative side effects from finasteride (ED, lowered libido, higher voice, etc) and I’m already afraid of PFS so I’m really unsure. I truly hope my symptoms subside if I choose to stop. If I opt for dutasteride, I’m afraid of my symptoms worsening and I just can’t handle even lowered libido or worsened ED—I’d be miserable. \n\nGiven that finasteride hasn’t even stabilized my hair, I don’t even think I’d qualify for a hair transplant at this point. I think I am ultimately out of luck and destined for baldness.\n\nAny words of affirmation? Any advice? Anything positive at all to pick me up off of the floor? Thanks everyone.",

Is washing twice daily with this cleanser okay? I'm also considering switching to Kiehls cleanser and moisturiser and wondering if that would make sense for my skin type.\n\nShould I be using SPF daily, and if so, where would it fit into my routine? Am I missing any key skincare steps like toner or serums? \n\nWould really love some advice!!\n\nTHANK YOU!!",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I’m posting again to see if there is anyone who could help - I don’t know anyone in real life!\n\nI’m a little desperate. I got a haircut last summer which I didn’t like due to the blunt shape which I tried rectifying by trying this Wayne Tuggle 4 section haircut on YouTube. I assume this is what left me with a gap in the middle essentially. I then had a haircut at a curly hair stylist in the fall to fix all of it and we agreed not to completely trim it all in regards to the hole in the middle of the back since it seemed to camouflage well. I cut some curtain bags myself about a week later. I also started using a whole new line of products (Innersense).\n\nThat was end of October. Out of curiosity I filmed the back of my head yesterday and was shocked to see the bottom layers. I did notice that my hair seemed to be thinner at the bottom (especially when both parts are pulled to the front) which I chalked up to hormones/vitamin deficiencies and the face framing layers I got. But the videos seem to look even worse. A noticeable gap in the middle (prior to this hair cut I did have long hair with no gaps) and generally straggly bits at the bottom. I don’t even know what this from nor how to fix it. The stylist I saw is the only curly hair specialist in town. I’ve attached two videos (in one). I’d really appreciate any advice!\n\nRoutine:\n\nShampoo: Innersense Pure Harmony Hairbath and Vichy Dercos\n\nConditioner: Innersense Color Radiance\n\nStylers: a concoction of Sweet Spirit Leave in and I create volume as well as I create hold and I create lift (all from Innersense)\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- a little goes a long way; it was my first time doing this particular mix of products on this wash day and the hair seems to be good. I emulsify product with water and take it in wet hair. Then I scrunch and scrunch out excess water with microfiber towel. I let it sit like that for 5 minutes and then cup diffuse upside down and from side to side. I then fluff it out. Refresh is just taking a bit of water with sweet spirit leave in and coating frizzy, undefined strands with that as well as a bit of I create volume and then scrunching it up. Often I don’t need to do that. I sleep with my hair in a pineapple. Sometimes I use I create finish on dry hair.",

      "content": "hello everyone, i’ve recently been feeling that i desperately need to refresh my skincare routine. the picture attached is my current routine i’ve used for about 3 years now. i use at least one of the cleansers a day and have generally stuck with each step, only making slight improvements from different brands throughout the years. while my face is noticeably much better than it was before i had this set routine, it’s still not where i’d like it to be. i believe i have combination skin (could be just oily). my face can be pretty dry and unhydrated at times, but oil seems to be something i can never get away from. my face, especially my forehead and nose get super oily throughout the day, and i often breakout in small scattered pimples, usually around or on my forehead. i can never seem to get rid of the blackheads on my nose either, even though my nose feels smooth when it’s clean, the blackheads are still visible. my pores could be clearer too, specifically around my nose and forehead. i can hide most of it with makeup (the oiliness always comes back to haunt me even w powders and setting sprays), but im very tired of not wanting to even step foot outside of my house because of how my skin looks without it.\n\ni’ve been looking into some different drugstore options for clear skin, and the few that constantly get repeated are:\n\n\\* prequel gleanser\n\n\\* prequel pre-cleanse\n\n\\* cocokind calming magnesium mist\n\n\\* byoma cream jelly cleanser\n\n\\* byoma hydrating milky toner\n\n\\* ulta brand milky toner\n\n\\*  byoma phyto-mucin glow serum\n\n\\* BHA liquid exfoliant 2%\n\ni was wondering if any these were worth buying to replace or add on to what i have already, or if anyone could suggest any alternatives, i’d really appreciate it. i really hate wasting money on stuff i don’t actually need/doesn’t work for my skin type so any advice would be very helpful 🫠",

I have attached several pictures to kind of show how my eyes look on different lights and angles. Like when there's direct light from the sun or anything else, they kinda look pinkish/reddish? but when there's no direct light, it kinda creates a shadow or they just look darker than the skintone of my face. And the area around my mouth is the same, especially the corners of my lips, they are really dark there.",
