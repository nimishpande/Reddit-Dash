Now back to 1 mg.\n\n3) derma stamp 0.7 to 0.9 mm once week. For the past 2 months, I’ve been doing it once every 15 days.\n\nSide effects: From finasteride, I experienced low libido (it has improved compared to the first few months, but still not like before finasteride). I also have mild ED, but I can get an erection.\n\non 0.5mg my libido increase compared to 1 mg.\n\nI will shift to 0.5 mg or 0.25 mg after full results. If my hairline becomes thin again,I will get a hair transplant just for the hairline, and continue taking 0.25 mg daily.\n\nI had no hairloss on crown only front diffuse thinning and hairline",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Hello, l've had acne for the past 2 years (23F), I don't know why it started but it did. Before that I never had to use any special products as l've had unproblematic skin and had no reason to have a skincare routine of any sorts, I only used micellar water for cleansing and a moisturiser when i remembered/needed. I've been using sunscreen religiously since childhood because of skin cancer in my family.\n\nWhen my acne first developed I thought it was weird but i guess i was too busy to get into it. A friend who had acne previously recommended the La Roche Posay purifying foaming gel and i've been using it for the past 2 years. I would say it managed to clear my skin pretty well, to the point where I had rarely any new breakouts and could focus on healing the scars on my cheeks the acne left behind - which i did with 2 laser sessions in winter 2024 and 1 in winter 2025.\n\nHowever, about 3 months ago I started to get new breakouts and my skin is as bad again as it was 2 years ago. Roughly around the same time the acne came back I had started taking biotin for hair growth and I read that can cause breakouts so about a month ago i stopped but the acne is still here.\n\nBesides the biotin i didn't really change or add any new skincare around the time of acne reappearance.\n\nHowever, i keep getting new pimples almost daily and they stick around for a while.\n\nMy current routine is very minimal:\n\nAM: no facewash, beauty of joseon spf50+ (been using it for 4+ years) and if my skin feels dry during the day then alverde anti-age ultra sensitive daycream\n\nPM: LRP purifying foaming gel, alverde moisturiser, occasionally LRP cicaplast\n\nI would guess my skin is combination, with acne on the cheek and chin, never forehead, my diet is vegetarian with a decent variation of veg and fruits, and I’m physically active.\n\nMy question is, I live in the Netherlands and getting a referral to a dermatologist is nearly impossible and overall my gp won't take my skin concerns too seriously so prescriptions are off the table. Are there any OTC products I could try to heal this long term?",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

It could permanently damage my hair. I feel like I would look better with curly hair. And shes like \"no no no you only need to straighten it like every other day, heat doesn't damage hair I can get you some stuff (blatant lie), you look foot with straight hair\" and tbh I was just like why do you want me to have straight hair like what do you have against curly hair and she was like \"I just don't want you to give up on straight hair for silly reasons\" so I kind of feel like she wants me to have straight hair and who knows if she is actually cutting it in a way that would help it look good curly at all\n\nMy routine is just like wash add leave in, and then add gel or mousse idk why I have to put it",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I recently realized that I have naturally textured hair. For most of my life, I would shower twice a day, shampoo every other day, brush my hair straight out of the shower, and blow-dry daily — basically flattening any natural curl for decades.\n\nI started trying a curl-focused routine about 8 days ago. I’ve been using curl-friendly shampoo and conditioner (briogio shampoo and DevaCurl conditioner), scrunching in a small amount of styling product (pattern) while damp, and diffusing gently to roughly 80% dry. I also tried a protein treatment that I will continue once a week. Honestly, I’m still figuring out what works for me.\n\nEven on day 2 hair, I can see clumps and waves forming naturally. Some sections curlier than others. After doing a full routine, the curls/waves look more defined, and my hair can even wake up with some pattern instead of just flat bedhead. It’s been really surprising to see this start happening!\n\nI’ve included photos: 2 from before I knew my hair was textured (completely straightened), and some from my current hair, including day 2 hair and post-routine hair. I have been told it looks like I have 2C/3A hair. That's what my curly friends think I'm going to end up with.\n\n\nHas anyone else discovered their natural curls later in life? Any advice for encouraging clumping or helping the curl pattern wake up faster would be so appreciated — I’m still figuring all of this out!",

The texture also looks rough.\n\nI consulted a dermatologist and was advised to use a moisturizer. I’ve already tried multiple brands including Cetaphil, Dermaco, and Epilyno (dermatologist-recommended), but I’m still seeing no real improvement.\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this?\n\n\t•\tWhat was the actual cause in your case?\n\n\t•\tDid anything other than basic moisturizers help?\n\n\t•\tWas it dermatitis, fungal infection, allergy, or something else?\n\nI’m not looking for a diagnosis, just real experiences or routines that worked. It’s making me feel quite insecure, so any input would really help. Thanks 🙏",

This all started about 4 months into school.\n\nI started developing these small, papule type acne lesions around my hairline and jawline. I initially started by switching products (hair care, laundry detergents, makeup products, and skincare) nothing helped. I started making cuts in my diet, gluten, sugar, and dairy. But had never had issues with my diet or gut health before. No changes.\n\nI’ve seen 4 dermatologists now and have been prescribed doxycycline, spironolactone, metro gel, dapsone cream with Tret, dapsone with niacinamide, differin, sulfa cleanse, and clindamycin. (Not all at once) All of them say that this is just acne, my last appointment they wanted to put me on accuntane. \n\nI’ve considered the possibility that this could be acne rosacea, or even PIE. My current skincare routine consists of professional grade products that focus on calming and soothing. \n- Circadia Vitamin Veil Cleanser\n- Vani cream cream cleanser \n- chrono calm (Circadia)\n-Post Peel Balm (Circadia)\n-Light day sunscreen (Circadia) \n\nI’m just at a complete loss, if anyone has any advice, or has seen anything like this before I would love your opinion!!
