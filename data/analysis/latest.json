I’m trying to achieve even 10% of what she has.\n\nI am currently on day 3 after washing. My current routine for this week was: I shampoo with moisturizing curl talk shampoo, then I do Mielle rosemary mint strengthening hair mask. Then I do 3-in-1 Curl Talk conditioner and don’t fully wash it out and squish in a bit to my ends before exiting the shower.\n\nThen I praying hands Pattern styling custard and drag it through a bit on top.  I then use them bounce curl clips while diffusing on warm setting for heat and low intensity with minimal movement to set the curls. I fluff out the roots after dry with the bounce curl volume comb. I scrunch in Ouai hair oil once dry.\n\nToday I sectioned my hair out while using tresemme keratin smooth weightless anti-frizz finishing spray at the roots and using the bounce curl volume comb diffusing where I sprayed after using the comb on low cold setting to set the spray.\n\nI’m pretty happy with the results, but looking for more tips if anyone has any? \n\nI may just need a hair cut. I just can’t seem the back to achieve the same volume at the back that I get around my face. At the side part it seems flat as well.  Amy other hair spray, how to cut the hair (I just cut my own hair how I feel like, so I’m not scared to try), or technique tips?\n\nI also want to understand how they do her lazy messy updo (see photo)??? I’m totally lost on how that is achieved.\n\n\n",

I got it cut to around shoulder-length (with shrinkage: a little bit past my chin). \n\n**Important context though** On Day 1 of wash day I have less volume and more definition (as seen in pics 1 &amp; 2) but around Day 3-4 I have a LOT of volume (as seen in pics 3 &amp; 5). I also learned it can turn into an afro the first month after my haircut because it was short enough and cut into a round shape (pic 7)\n\nI'm getting another haircut soon and would love to get a pixie this time (reference pics 8-12), but I'd like to get some advice from my fellow redditers. I know all about the pros and cons but I'm just a bit nervous, **with my features will I look more or less feminine? Do I have the features to pull it off? I won't lie, these things are important to me.** Lmk what you think I included pics with and w/o makeup &lt;3\n\nWash-n-go routine:\nWash with Native Coconut shampoo\nConditioner: Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Conditioner, detangle in 6 sections with Crave Naturals brush\nRinse thoroughly\nAdd Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Leave-in Cream to each section, prayer hand method\nBrush style with Crave Naturals brush for volume\nRake in Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic Gel to each section, finger coiling any curls that need some extra love\nAir dry, then scrunch out the crunch with Carol's Daughter 7 Oil Blend Hair &amp; Scalp Oil\nI use a bonnet every night, no refresh\n",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nSo normally I don’t post much, but wanted to drop this as a warning for anyone buying products purely on hype and regretting later.\n\nBack in September I got into fitness, and by December started protein supplements. My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily.\n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nSo normally I don’t post much, but wanted to drop this as a warning for anyone buying products purely on hype and regretting later.\n\nBack in September I got into fitness, and by December started protein supplements. My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily. \n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

      "content": "Hey guys and gals, I (24M) wanted to make skincare one of my new year's resolutions. For the longest time I've had those imposing dark circles under my eyes that I want to get rid of. I've also found my face turning a blotchy red after a hot shower, probably rosacea. I'd like my skin to be smoother and less 'pink', if that makes sense??\n\nAnyway, I put together this routine based on some basic research:\n\n**Morning**\n\n1. **CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** (water cleanser: ceramides + hyaluronic acid)\n2. **Neutrogena Hydro Boost** (hyaluronic acid)\n3. **Beauty of Joseon Sunscreen** (rice + probiotic, SPF50+, PA++++)\n\n**Night**\n\n1. **The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm** (oil cleanser)\n2. **CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** (water cleanser: ceramides + hyaluronic acid)\n3. **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5**\\+ (barrier repair: panthenol)\n4. **La Roche-Posay Retinol B3 Serum** (retinol + niacin) - **ramping from once per week**\n\nI've already bought these products and used the AM set once this morning for the pics above. Three things I'd like advice on are:\n\n* Sources are conflicted on whether retinol should be before or after the cleanser/barrier repair. I put it after, knowing that I still need to be gentle to protect against sensitivity in the first week or so, but after that, should I swap things round?\n* AFAIK none of this will help with the dark circles. What can you recommend for that? Collagen or microneedling etc?\n* There's a singular pink bump on my left cheek, as seen in pics. Will this go away sooner or later with this routine?\n\nThank you for your help and happy new year!!",

      "content": "Good morning everyone and Happy New Year! 🎆 I have a few questions I’m hoping to get advice on. I had gastric bypass, lost almost 170 pounds, went from 377 to 210. Looking great, feeling great! However, I noticed that I’m starting to have dry flaky spots on my face, and I’m getting bags under my eyes. I’m 41, so the bags don’t necessarily bother me, it’s part of the aging process, but the dry spots are bad.\n\nMy dermatologist suggested rosehip oil, he says it helps tighten the skin, provides more moisture and may even help with the bags. It has the good vitamins like A C and E that is essential for the skin. I just started using it like 3 days ago, he suggested once in the morning, and once before bed. I’m noticing a difference yet, he says it may take a few days/weeks to notice a change as everyone’s skin is different.\n\nI have been seriously self conscious going out in public because of the dry patches on my face. It looks horrible. My husband says I’m still beautiful and it doesn’t bother him, but I feel like he HAS to say that because he’s my husband. Like he can’t say “babe your face is gross” you know what I mean?\n\nI guess questions would be, is rosehip oil really good? Has anyone used it and it helped their skin? Will it help with the dry flaky skin on my face? Are there any other recommendations you guys may have that I can try?",

Not only were the products prescribed kind of expensive but the sunscreen costs over ₹700 too? She recommended IPCA Acne UV gel and afaik it's one of the best for my skin types, but as a broke ahh college student I just can't afford that. \n\n\nThen I started searching skincare related subreddits for other options and learnt that there are barely any good and reliable ones under ₹500.\nAll of the sunscreen options fall in one of these categories:\n1. They're affordable but from a cosmetic brand with shady practices or no proper certification.\n2. They make you look like a ghost by leaving a white cast or feel sticky and greasy and aren't photostable.\n3. They're reliable and it works but costs and an arm and a leg for a measly 30 g pack.\n\n\nLike what am I supposed to buy??\n\nThe same goes for body sunscreen too, I saw great reviews about Nivea SPF 50 sunscreen's protection, but it apparently feels very sticky and greasy.\n\nP.S. what's up with r/indianskincareaddicts? I tried posting this there, but the post ever got approved. ",

I met a guy recently with whom I kissed and he had a very short beard, so it was extremely harsh on my skin. After kissing him I had a lot of redness the following day around my nose and lips, where his beard touched but next day it was gone. Then after 5 days I discovered a lot of red small pimples on my nose, it was really bad… and then it started to spread in my chin, around lips and next to my nose. It’s very itching, especially the nose. It doesn’t look that bad on picture but in reality the dots are red and there’s many of them next to my nose area. I never had this problem before but it was the first time when I kissed with a guy with harsh beard while also using retinol. I don’t know if it has anything to do though.\n\nDid anyone experience anything like this? I went to dermatologist and she prescribed me a topical Anity inflammatory cream but it doesn’t help at all.. I don’t know what to do, it looks really terrible. I don’t think she diagnosed me correctly she just looked at my face for 5 minutes.\n\nMaybe someone had something similar and got the treatment right.\n\nRight now I stopped using retinol and acids but still a month has passed and it’s just getting worse with more pimples I new areas, it travelled onto my cheek:(",

Previously, I did very little in terms of a skincare routine and have always had good skin. I started this routine in order to combat the sagging skin that comes with aging, especially in the neck area. In the past couple of days, all of a sudden I have irritation on my neck, right in the creases along the front of my neck, almost like burn marks. My neck skin feels uncomfortable and a bit itchy, and there are also a few new blemishes on my chest (not normal for me). So now my neck and chest look worse than they did to start with. I'd appreciate advice about whether the mask or the mild retinol is the culprit, how to treat these burn-like marks in the creases of my skin (quickly, because I have an important event coming up), and/or how to adjust my skincare routine. Thank you! ",

Most data suggests sperm parameters usually recover, plenty of guys have kids on fin/dut, etc. I get that.\n\nThat said, a few things made me pause:\n\nDutasteride isn’t something most of us take short-term, I'll be taking it for the foreseeable future. Realistically it’s a 10–20+ year drug. And there isn't a 10-20 year safety profile yet for this for fertility issues. \n\nThe half-life is insanely long, so stopping isn’t like stopping fin and being “clear” in a few weeks.\nThere was that recent paper suggesting persistent fertility issues in a subset of men, yeah, it’s disputed and not definitive, but what stuck out to me was that some parameters didn’t fully bounce back even compared to controls who never took dut.\n\nFertility data beyond short- to mid-term use just isn’t that deep yet.\n\nFor me it wasn’t “panic”, it was more:\nif there’s even a small unknown and an easy workaround, why not?\n\nSperm banking is:\nRoutine (chemo, TRT, surgeries, etc.) \nOne-time effort\nFrozen sperm lasts 20-30 years or if stored well indefinite. The company I'll be doing this with have a great track record. \nQuality depends on how good it is now, not how long it’s stored\n\n\nWorst case? I never use it and wasted a bit of money. I'm doing this in a country where this is very cheap to freeze and preserve/store. \n\nBest case? I never have to stress about fertility later while being on one of the strongest DHT blocker we’ve got (ofc 2.5mg dut exists) .\n\nI still think dut is probably safe for most guys. I’m still going to be taking it. This just felt like cheap insurance before committing long-term.\n\nCurious if anyone else here has done this or thought about it. Is it overkill or reasonable? ",

      "content": "Hi everyone! 👋 \n\nI've struggled with acne since high school (I'm a college freshman now), and while my active breakouts have finally calmed down, I'm left with a lot of post-acne hyperpigmentation (PIH), general dullness, and oily skin. Honestly, it's made me really insecure. I get scared seeing my face on camera or in photos now 😔\n\nI'm really hoping a good tone-up sunscreen can help me look a bit better on camera and feel more confident. I'm on the hunt for one that can help brighten my dull complexion and even out some redness/PIH, but my absolute top priority is finding one that won't cause breakouts or clog pores. My skin is super acne-prone and oily, so I'd love something lightweight, non-comedogenic, and ideally fragrance-free! 🙏\n\nI've seen some love for the d'alba tone up sunscreen, abib glutathione cc sunscreen, and the Skin Aqua Tone Up UV Essence (pink or mint). Has anyone with skin like mine tried these? How did they work for you?\n\nMy Skin Profile:\n\n1. Type: Acne-prone, oily, with post-acne marks and dullness.\n2. Looking For:\n  - Safe for acne-prone &amp; oily skin (oil-free/non-comedogenic is a huge plus)\n  - Fragrance-free (my skin can be sensitive to scents)\n  - natural tone up (I have light-medium skin tone) \n  - Good protection like SPF 50+ PA++++\n\nI would be so, so grateful for any recommendations: your holy grails, what to avoid, or any tips! Thank you in advance for your help! You're all amazing💖",
