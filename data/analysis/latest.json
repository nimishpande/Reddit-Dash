      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Bali Curls Bonding Oil for scrunch out the gelcast.\n\nI never had long hair and had to find out just after my early 40s that i have curly hair (i would say 2c-3a). It is very fine but it seems i still have a lot strands. I was going to cut that dry and frizzy mess short again until i learned how to maintain it after watching videos, search the internet and finally got a \"curlsys\" cut from a hair stylist knowing how to handle curly hair and teach me how to maintain and style it. I also learned that some things makes night and day like avoid friction and sleeping only on a silk pillowcase with a loose bun (also silk scrunchie here). It can get really on my nerves to maintain that mane but i just feel so much better now at my age with my longer hair and while in the beginning people said it looks terrible, now it is more the opposite and it is a great conservation starter to women and man.\n\nI am still searching for maybe some better products for my special hair type and try other things. I just bought the \"Lockenbox\" Christmas calendar with 24 tools and products to try for next year ;) My journey just began (even i am already a 47 years old man) and hope to grow the curls much longer and maintain them better. I still have some bad hair days with a frizzball on my head but now i know how to \"repair\" it. One thing for sure, even if some people try to talk me into a shorter hairstyle i am done with shorter hair.....at least until it might get thinner as an aging man. So far i think i still have some years to go. ",

I started to take care of my curls again mid October and this is the progress I made so far🥰 I feel more and more confident wearing my not-so-perfect curls everyday and looking forward to grow them longer!\n1st pic is my curls today, 2nd pic was two months ago when I stopped straightening my hair and the 3rd one was when they were freshly bleached and straightened.\n\nHere’s my routine:\n- Shampoo and Condition with Arganicare Coconut line\n- I use a coin amount of Lola Cosmetics Dream cream as a leave in conditioner \n- I finish my routine by scrunching my hair,put them up in a cotton t-shirt and let them air-dry. \nI don’t use gel because I hate the crunchiness . In the beginning of this journey I styled my curls with a brush but found out it made my curls lose all their shape so I just detangle with my hands in the shower while I still have conditioner on before rinsing.\nMy routine is nothing crazy but it works for me and I am happy to share it with you guys☺️",

I tried loads of different moisturizers but nothing worked. The ones that were very heavy caused whiteheads to appear and still didn't do shit.\n\nI had heard a lot about asian beauty products, so I ordered a japanese lotion called Kikamasamune High Moist Sake Lotion just to try it out. I didn't know it was actually a toner at the time. And OMG, it literally transformed my skin. After using it overnight, I woke up to glass skin!!\n\nThis particular one is quite expensive due to imports and all, but I'm pretty confident that any moisturizing toner would work the same.\n\nMy routine:\nCleanse with Cetaphil Gentle cleanser, then i dab around 2 pumps of Kikamasamune toner, then come the serums (i only use hyluronic acid), then another layer of the toner and finally on damp skin I apply CeraVe moisturizer liberally.\n\nI had problems with suscreen too. Since chemical ones broke me out, I had to use physical sunscreens, but the thing about Zinc based formulations is that they tend to leave a dryyy matte finish. Now I can use the mineral ones without any prolems and my skin still feels plump and hydrated.\n\nI think toners should be included in the skincare essential/core routine for dry skin type. I overlooked toners because I wanted to keep a minimal routine.\n\nLink to the toner: https://dokodemo.world/en/item/196377/",

Even though my mother had been after me to do something about it, it never bothered me. We have had a lot of arguments regarding this and she did succeed in applying hena on my hair twice.But it's been some time since that and I don't have that orangish shade of hena anymore.I am getting married in Feb and most of  my grey hair are at the start of my head so very very visible. I was thinking of dying them. Please suggest some hair dye and post- dye care routine. Also would it work if I just dye the grey hair and not my entire head. \nIt would be a big help.

I can’t STAND the back of my hair. It’s stringy and flat and weird, and only curls at the bottom. I have strands that frizz and don’t define no matter what I seem to do. At the same time, my hair can look flat and weighed down, and only curls at the bottom in most places. I’m not sure what I can do. I don’t know if I should be adding more moisture or if I’m adding too much. How can I get my hair to look less weighed down at the top and in the back? Any help would be appreciated.  \nI usually use Herbal Essences honey shampoo and conditioner, but lately I’ve been using garnier fructis conditioner. I wash my hair maybe 2-3 times a week, or more if it gets sweaty. I try to leave in conditioner for as long as I can before washing it out and I always leave in a tiny bit. I only brush my hair wet, and I apply products while it’s pretty damp. Daily, I use OUAI leave in, or Sleep on it overnight curl cream. Neither really do anything, I still have a ton of frizz and weighed down looking hair. I shower before bed, and let my hair air dry 70% before I clip it up. I swear I could put in the whole bottle of product and my hair would still look dry. The second pic is a failed attempt at defusing. In the 3rd picture I included, I had used gel as well to style my hair, and I like the way it looks. It was completely air dried. It was also summer, and my hair always seems to be prettier in the summer. The fourth pic is just air dried hair after my normal routine. Any advice would be really appreciated. I’m not sure what my hair needs. Plz give tips!!",

A few years ago I was struggling with really bad cystic acne because of an IUD, and my doctor prescribed me Tretinoin. At the time I was able to tolerate it really well, eventually being able to use it almost everyday. I moved countries so I don’t have the same doctor anymore, and my cystic acne cleared up after I had the IUD removed, so I never got more Tretinoin and haven’t been using Retinol for the last couple years. I have recently introduce The Ordinay Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion into my routine. I have developed a really bad reaction under my eyes a couple of times where my under-eyes get very red, super dry, burning, and prominent wrinkles (photos attached). I’m not sure if it is a Retinol burn? I got the Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Bakuchiol under eye cream, because Bakuchiol is supposedly gentler than retinol, but I’ve ended up with the same thing from that, just not *quite* as bad. Everything I’ve been able to find says that Retinol often gives you irritation and purging as you are getting used to it, so I’m wondering if that is what is happening or if my skin can just not tolerate Retinol. If anyone could help me out, I’d appreciate it!",

Started balding at 28 at the crown. At the age of 29 it was progressing so I jumped on Minoxidil topical and after a while I started oral Fin. After two years I had made an almost full recovery but after a lot of ups and downs with sides and dosages, I desided to quit (unfortunately from minox also,big mistake) somewhere during the pandemic and kept a buzz cut. Also with the supervision of a good endo btw.\n\n\nStarted again now and I am 4 months into Minox topical 5% 2Xday and 1 month on  topical fin 0,01% 1Xday (pharmacy compound with minox). Got me a Dr. Pen also and will start next week at 0,7 every 10 days after I buzz again. Got a rosemary castor  oil for the scalp also with biotin etc just for the fvck of it..Also using Ketoconazole 2% 3Xweek. Vitamin B12, D3, C and  Biotin, Ω3 and will add zinc and copper at a 10:1 ratio.\nLong way to go but let's see. That will be the final push to recovery.\n\n\nThank you all for inspiring me to start again with your contributions.",

I do need to be careful with what I use due to the retinol causing sensitivity. \n\nI have always struggled with cystic acne (PCOS-related) which the retinol has completely cleared up and has gone some way to clearing up these tiny dots but not completely. \n\nHaving done some research I thought it could be fungal acne so for the past few weeks I've been using Nizoral ketoconazole 2-3 times a week, leaving on for 3 minutes, but I don't think that's really done anything! \n\nAlso thought they could be closed comedones which I've read salicylic acid and retinol are treatments for, both of which I already use.\n\nGrateful for any advice 🙂",

It had that fibrous, workable texture with a medium hold that kept my thick, wavy hair under control. It stayed matte, felt natural, and the best part was that I didn’t have to wash it out every night.\n\nI’ve tried a few replacements and haven’t had much luck so far:\n-Hanz de Fuko Claymation felt like cement in my hair\n-Hanz de Fuko Sponge Wax didn’t have enough hold\n-Aquage Paste also didn’t hold well for me\n\nI’m already about $100 into this little hair adventure without much success. I’m 39 with a strong head of hair and no signs of thinning, so once I find the right product I’ll probably stick with it for the next few decades.\n\nIf you used Rusk Paste too, what did you switch to? Did anything actually work as a replacement? I’d really appreciate any suggestions. Thanks in advance!",

I noticed my part looked wider, and for a while I have felt this strange cowlick around my crown area. In the video there were a lot of random partings that made my scalp show more. I assumed it was because my hair was really oily since it had been three days unwashed, and my scalp gets oily fast, but it still worried me. I washed my hair right away and took pictures.  \nI am not good at making a clean part in the back. The front is fine, but the top looks off. I took a few photos and it is really bothering me. Could you tell me what you think is going on? Any advice would be appreciated.\n\n**A bit of background about me**. I am a 22 year old female living in a very **polluted city**, and I am quite **underweight**. I also have several **deficiencies**, including **vitamin B, vitamin B12, and iron**. I do not follow a set hair care routine. I usually just wash my hair with shampoo and sometimes use conditioner. My hair is **very thin.** It is **type 1A,** completely straight, shiny, and when a light or flashlight hits it directly my scalp shows a lot more.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6th2r4h6gd6g1.png?width=379&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6af4201a44b6b3d3f712d75823014c01ab4494f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m0fvlqtjgd6g1.png?width=256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df912a66e90d95c0b23678bb783738fe01732209\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xeevkw3ygd6g1.png?width=278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe7b47e8f7069af24625ec4c24ae5740309ec384\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5gg0ggs4hd6g1.png?width=318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6240097ea69637192500fd46d09ad162db5619ca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rr7xtvlchd6g1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b266df62b623c67cdbcb5dccb030684494b02b3a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yukshvqzhd6g1.png?width=317&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46ac93ce975b79257a76a2f7c221ca67be44fa7b\n\n  \n",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
