      "content": "Hi all, new here and will take all the advice I can get!\n\nBackstory: I have a giant exam on Friday I’m supposed to be studying for, so like any rational person I got side tracked on the internet for HOURS.\n\nI was steaming a shirt in my bathroom to de-wrinkle it, when I noticed the teeny little curl (pic 3, the one that started it all). My hair does that a lot with humidity, but I never thought beyond that. I’ve said for years I have stick straight hair, but alas, here we are 😂 I’ve always wanted \\*not\\* straight, flat hair, so I clung to that hope/urge to procrastinate. \n\nI immediately found this subreddit and started scrolling. Then googling. Then putting strands of hair in a glass of water. \n\nTurns out I have low porosity hair, which makes a lot of sense. I never moisturize my hair (as clearly evidenced in photo 2, pre-experiment) because it gets oily so quickly, but the internet tells me that’s because it’s not absorbing the heavy products I’d try on it every other month or so. I’d get annoyed that it made my hair oily, and go back to no moisture, only to try again with a super heavy product when I decided to combat the follicular dehydration again. And the cycle continued. \n\nI decided to put off my responsibilities further and go to Walmart to find a low porosity friendly leave in conditioner. I don’t know if this one for sure qualifies, but it was grad-school budget friendly, so I rolled with it. I always brush my hair essentially flat to my scalp right after I shower, but this time I used the leave in conditioner and scrunched my hair rather than brushing it out immediately. I used a microfiber towel I usually use when washing my face to scrunch more. It looked wavy (and probably is just wavy) and I figured it was just texture from the scrunching. \n\nI waited it out though! I’m usually a constant play-with-my-hair-er, so it was brutal trying not to touch it while it dried, but when I checked it out after studying a bit, I found a full on curl?! (Is that a curl? A wave? I honestly have no idea what it classifies as, I have no idea what I’m doing. The rest is just wavy for sure, but the first photo is of my golden child chunk of hair 😂)\n\nWhatever it is, it feels like it’s not from scrunching, and I now have so much enthusiasm and so little knowledge on how to keep making progress here. \n\nSorry for the long winded post, I’m just genuinely so jazzed that my hair is doing anything, and I figured maybe someone here would have advice!\n\nRoutine: native strengthening shampoo + conditioner, not your mother’s leave in conditioner ",

They were chunky and I was happy with them, but I went to a hairdresser so she could fill in the regrowth line and blend it a bit. I told her not to touch the current length and only bleach the roots, but she bleached them anyway and when I asked why, she said it won’t make a difference anyway.\n\nI paid $232AUD ($162US) and I look like a blonde. I hate it so much I can’t stop crying. Not only is it blonde, there is white blonde, honey blonde, yellow blonde. I did not want to be blonde, I loved being a brunette. The original regrowth I wanted to fix still is there with a harsh line, I kept reminding her to not dye new sections and then she just wiped the bleach off with a towel.\n\nI feel so sad because for over a year I have been trying to grow my hair out from hair loss and my hair was so thin and above my shoulders. I also have been trying to grow out a peekaboo of platinum blonde I had at the back, and even if I get it professionally salon died back to brown, it always fades back to blonde or green or red or orange. I have to put semi permanent dye in every shower.\n\nI phoned the salon and they said they can add some lowlights in but I feel these were just wash out like that usually does with me, yes I use a safe shampoo and I wash my hair with cold water. This is just what my hair does. Also, it’s so broken and damaged, the ends of the blonde are snapping off and I’m so sad.\n\n:( I just wanna be a brunette I feel so ugly",

Then I scrunched a little and then scrunched the curl defining gel in and scrunched all the way to my head (I reapplied some water with a spray bottle because the tiktok tutorials said to keep the hair as wet as possible) (I used Bali curl products but I had this problem with other products before too so I don’t think the product is the issue haha)\n\n3.

      "content": "21M Asian looking for full routine FOR PIH + product recs (low irritation) \\[don't want anything with any potentially LT damaging effects like accutane for e.g.\\].\n\n**Issues:**\n\n1. PIH from old acne (main issue) (mainly I have the issue of popping / scratching at the dead skin after acne which I know NOT to do, and will try to not do anymore). No pitted scarring, just darker spots that I'd like to remove.\n2. alongside the PIH, I'd like to also lighten my general skin tone slightly (paler).\n3. oily nose /sebaceous filaments (millia I believe)\n4. Noticeably more visible pores on cheeks.\n\n**Context:**\n\n* So, currently, I don't think I have any significant issue with getting new pimples (maybe just one a week or less (I don't really notice it)). I have tried skincare to fix my PIH issue in the past couple years on and off but have sort of given up, but I'm trying again now.\n* I'm also indoors like 99% of the time with minimal sunlight exposure so I haven't really been using sunscreen (though I'm thinking of using like a lightweight, not too oily/heavy asian sunscreen now).\n\n**Current routine (minimal):** AM/PM I just wash my face with warm water and or use a warm towel and rub very gently on face. Then PM I use a foaming cleanser while showering (pea size).\n\n**Past products I tried:** (products are correct, but the results take with a grain of salt because I don't remember super clearly).\n\n1. COSRX Pure Vitamin C Serum 23% (I think it was too strong; couldn’t use daily)\n2. Niacinamide serum (don’t remember brand; used on/off)\n3. Skin1004 Centella “brightening ampoule” (not sure it did anything)\n4. Roundlab moisturiser + cleanser. Also tried some man:yo oil cleanser rarely maybe once a month (mostly for fun).\n\nI've also tried using a silk pillowcase, but didn't like how if I wore products it felt sticky to the surface and felt like the side of my face touching the pillowcase would heat up quickly / faster than my cotton pillowcase. (I did try putting the products on well in advance before sleeping and didn't put too much (I think)). Are silk / silver pillowcases actually worth using for its \"anti microbial activities\" because I didn't really like it, idk.\n\nI also now use a seperate face towel to dry my face after shower which I use for 1-3 days before using a different one.\n\n# So, I've also been consulting ChatGPT.\n\n**So, I've also been consulting ChatGPT** past couple days about this to get some advice, but this post is mainly to ask the community and actual people for advice as ChatGPT can hallucinate. What it basically recommended was this:\n\n* Base for PIH + acne prevention: **azelaic acid (15–20%) + a retinoid (adapalene 0.1%)**\n* For nose/filaments: **BHA (salicylic acid 2%)** on nose only a few nights/week\n* Add a light moisturizer + lightweight sunscreen (non-greasy)\n* Use hydrocolloid patches to stop picking\n\n**My questions are:**\n\n1. Is there any way to 'test' products for cheap/free for a bit before buying in case I react to it strongly? I've thought of probably making a list of products that I might buy and just going out to a store to test them out for a week straight before deciding to buy or something (not sure if theres an easier way).\n2. What product stack should I use in the AM/PM to fix the **aforementioned 4 issues above (mainly the PIH).** How to store that product, how much/often to use and in AM or PM. And should I try buy korean products? Idk why but I feel more inclined to buy Japanese/Korean products over Western ones (I think mainly due to how much glaze those products typically recieve online).\n3. I read this reddit post and it mentioned a lot of PIH ingredients like (vitamin c, retinoids, azelaic acid, arbutin, tranexamic acid, kojic acid etc). So I'm a bit unsure what I actually should be looking for in a product. Which ingredient is MOST important for me to be looking for?\n4.

I've heard that you should cut out added sugars and that \"your skin is a reflection of your gut health\", so i should be eating foods good for my gut.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

      "content": "Heyo, sorry for the long post, basically I want my hair to look like it does in the first 2 images (particularly the first) consistently/stay like that thru a day VS frizzy/undefined in 3/4 OR whatever tf it is in image 5, which seems to be most frequent. \n\nFor context: 21, Central FL (hot+humidaf), healthy scalp, high porosity (i think?), 3a-3c(?), not thin but def not dense/thick, and very very fine hair (super fine strands). Cold water=130ppm Hot=200+ ppm\n\nHair was rlly thin two years ago (thank god it’s not that bad anymore) and only started caring about my hair like that the last year. \n\nIm not too sure what my issues really come down to, but I think my hierarchy of needs for products is:      1. **Lightweight** 2. **Deep/lasting moisture** 3. **Anti-frizz** 4. **Growth/repair** 5. **Heat protection**\n\n# Products \n\n**\\*SHAMPOO\\***\n\n\\-I use either ***L’Oréal Elvive curls*** OR ***As I Am Castor*** for shampoo, and quite happy with both but leaning towards as I am I think. I typically coat my entire hair/head, leave on for 15 seconds, and rinse out. Double cleanse, lukewarm water. ** **\n\n**\\*COWASH\\***\n\n\\-I use the ***As I Am Castor*** cowash, and I’m pretty satisfied with it, but seeing as in a 7-9 day period I sometimes cowash twice before shampooing again, I’m considering adding in a different one to use alongside, or trying new ones out in general, or even looking at hair masks, which btw, please explain the difference between them and a cowash, and what are overnight hair masks? \n\n**\\*RINSE OUT CONDITIONER\\***\n\n\\-I used to use ***Shea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine*** and liked it, but decided to experiment and have tried a few different things. For right now (I know this is bad), I just use ***Kinky Curly Knot Today*** for my rinse out. Try my best to rake/apply to ends only, leave in for \\~3 mins, rinse out. Was considering trying ***Creme of Nature Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment***\n\n**\\*LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER\\***\n\n**-**I’ve been using either ***Pillow Soft Curls*** or ***Kinky Curly Knot Today*** for leave in conditioner, and apply when hair is wet, not damp or dry (not soaking wet either though, should I?). I think I like KC more than PSC, and previously used base skala but felt it dried out really really quick. KC gives me some nice clumps and doesn’t ever feel crunchy if pure air drying, and still leaves some bounce and is very lightweight. Pillow soft has been pretty decent too I think, only been using for the last week-ish though. Considering trying ***curlsmith*** \n\n**\\*MOUSSE\\***\n\n**-**I only recently started using mousse and realized I’d been applying it incorrectly/using bad ones. I’m very new to mousse still, though, and absolutely taking recommendations AND specifically recommendations on how to apply. I used to use ***Shea Moisture Frizz Free Curl Mousse*** but switched to ***The Doux Def Texture Foam*** and like it quite a bit better. I typically apply it to my hands, lightly rub together, and then gloss my hair, and then rake, and then lightly scrunch (directly after applying leave in conditioner); considering using ***curlsmith***\n\n**\\*LEAVE-IN OIL/PROTECTANT/SERUM (?)\\***\n\n\\-I don’t usually use any, but I want to start, but don’t know what to use exactly, and right now I use ***Camille Rose Rosemary Oil Strengthening Leave In Conditioner***; I know it says conditioner but it really is more like an oil solution. I suck at applying it I feel, sometimes use too much, and can’t figure out at what stage of the process I should use it. \n\n**\\*PRE-POO + OVERNIGHT OIL TREATMENT\\***\n\n**-**i definitely notice and love it when I do pre shampoo, but I’m not sure what oils/products to use, and don’t do it every time. I currently use ***African Pride “Feel-It” Formula*** for pre poo (10-30 mins). Also any info on overnight treatments, what products/oils, do it or don’t, if so then before shampoo days only, or also cowash days?\n\n**\\*POMADE / BALM\\***\n\n**-**I also don’t really use this, but occasionally I will for spots that aren’t cooperating, or if I have to just get up and leave, or to even refresh certain spots. I use ***The Doux Bonita Afro Balm*** and just apply to strands/ends, and then scrunch/style and go.\n\n**\\*OTHERS/MISC\\***\n\n**-**I haven’t tried: hair spray, dry shampoo, hair mask, custard, gel, lotion, definers, protein and or acidic treatments/products, hair tonic, hair milks, thermal protectants, curl refreshers, pre shampoo specific products, detangling specific products, rice water or protein stuff, actual serums, or curl creams.\n\n# Styling/Routine\n\n**\\*STYLING\\***\n\nHonestly, I think I suck at styling, and I really need a video to see how I should be styling my hair and applying products, particularly after getting out the shower. I sometimes use a diffuser especially if I’m leaving soon, but it leaves my hair either too dry (3/4 pic) or like pic 5. I typically gloss then rake products in, scrunch after applying mousse, and air dry, and then pick/fluff with my hands (rlly bad habit I know)\n\n\\***ROUTINE\\***\n\n**D1**: pre poo w/ oil, shampoo double cleanse, RO cond., LE cond., mousse, air dry/diffuse halfway, (sometimes) rosemary oil thingie, air dry rest of way\n\n**D2**: Same as D1 without prepoo/shampoo\n\n**D3:** (depending on how it looks) sometimes the exact same as day 2, other times will opt out of mousse and/or Camille rosemary oil thingie. \n\n**D4:** no oil, rarely mousse, sometimes won’t use LE cond or just use less of it. Sometimes will skip straight to D5 process (cowash day) \n\n**D5**: cowash, and then the exact same as D2\n\n**D6**: rinse out conditioner, leave in conditioner (usually less), sometimes mousse \n\n**D7+:** usually just go with the flow, as in observe my hair and feel it, and then either decide to restart the cycle n shampoo, or cowash, or continue just using rinse out+leave in or sometimes just rinse out. Just depends but tbh, ***I don’t know what I’m doing at all, I need recs/feedback and guidance/tips**** *\n\n*\\*—sometimes go 8-9 days between shampoo but cowash again at some point*\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBasically I just want my hair to always look like the first 2 pics and get it to actually last like that throughout the day, and my hair usually looks like the last image most of the time. I don’t know if I have damage, frizz issues, breakage, too thin of hair, if I’m forcing curls, using the wrong products, or simply styling/applying products wrong. I’m also looking for to repair hair + \n\nIm looking for any and all product recs (whether I use the type of product or not), most definitely looking for styling/application methods and recs, and also an explanation of wtf is going on with my hair? Generally any thoughts, comments, opinions, recs, tips tricks etc. all welcomed, thank you!\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nHow can I get my hair to be like the first pic consistently and make it last; what am I doing wrong/what is happening, what types of products do I need, what specific recommendations, any styling/application + routine tips? Thank you for reading!",

Even though I’m beginning to disagree with “anti ageing” as a concept and think its a bit of a scam. But I’m still obviously obsessed with my skin. Is the root of this obsession patriarchal? Maybe. Or maybe its as simple as I enjoy rubbing slime on my face. \n\nAM:\n\nBioderma Sensibio H2O Soothing Micellar Water Cleanser with Unicharm Silcot Uru-uru Cotton Sponge Touch Moisturizing Cotton Puff Pads\n\nShenzen Light Idea Red/NIR light panel (but honestly I slack so hard with this)\n\nNIOD SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE 3 ENZYME MIST\n\nPaula’s Choice 7% Ectoin + Hyaluronic Acid Milky Hydrating Serum \n\niUNIK Beta-Glucan Power Moisture Serum\n\nAestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream (the formula changed, but I have tried literally everything and this moisturiser is unmatched.

My skin won’t tolerate vitamin c, retinoids, and many many things. The niacinamide, peptides and avene sunscreen are almost too much. I also have airyday pretty in zinc but its too dark for my skin and sometimes irritating as well. The sebaceous filaments on my nose will not go away. I am open to all opinions, suggestions and product recommendations. Especially sunscreen and especially something to get rid of sebaceous filaments. Would be happy to cut down on serums. Am unsure if I am missing key things in my routine.\n\nAlso, I am skeptical if peptides do much. Treatments like needling, lasers, etc are way better for collagen stimulation. But **(TMI warning--skip to rating my routine if you just want that)** as I mentioned at the start, I’m currently battling the idea of wanting to look young and choice feminism as a whole. I've already decided I wont be getting botox, threads or plastic surgery. But where is the line? We all get old and die and I don't want to see wrinkles as ugly. I've been shocked hearing people say getting a face lift is ageing gracefully. What could be spent on treatments (not that I can afford them) could be spent on therapy to help me accept ageing. And to add to the weirdness, (TW) after seeing so much from the Epstein files it's opened my eyes to how ingrained *it* is in our culture. Literally makes me sick. But I still want to glow and lather my face with things. Don't we all want to be forever young? Does anyone else feel me on this? I shouldn't feel guilty for wanting to look my best. I shouldn't judge myself for how I look either. And I certainly don't judge others for either, as I participate in the beauty industry too. But I've definitely started to wonder if its healthy and where the want comes from. On the other hand, I also want to feel healthy. Skin is our largest organ, it's good to take care of it on some level. I enjoy the ritual of skincare and nerding out about it. Skincare is a female dominated industry too, which has its pros. Remove the patriarchy and looks must still matter in some human way right? Wtf is \"ageing gracefully\"? Idk. Full disclosure when my sister is qualified I will probs still do all the treatments for cheap lol. So yea please rate my routine (bonus if u have deeper insights too) :-)",

      "title": "Completely Lost on Hair Type",
      "content": "I have experimented with hair products for the past year or two without much success or satisfaction, so I’m finally reaching out for some help. My hair has been short for almost all of my teenage years, and now in my early 20s, it is the longest it has been since I was a child. I have tried a few things to learn more about my hair type and how to take care of it. For about 1.5 years I did not get it professionally cut and instead lightly trimmed it at home. I also heat styled some parts of my hair daily without hair protection and without much apparent damage happening at the time. From some combination of the poor trims and heat styling, I had a build up of dead ends that left my hair getting tangled and taking forever to dry. If I walked around with clean, brushed hair going about my day, the underside of my head would be tangled into a solid mass within a few hours. \n\nA few months ago I went to a hairstylist and paid $90 for her to help me shape up my hair and cut off the necessary parts of the dead ends (she wanted to cut much more to give me a very fresh start). I noticed quicker drying time in my hair and less tangling. I still have issues with both of these things. It takes my hair about 2-3 hours to fully air dry.\n\nI’m so attached to the confidence the length has given me that I’m hesitant to cut more even if it would ease my tangling and drying issues. However, I think this may also significantly be related to my hair type and improper treatment.\n\nI think my hair is a bit curly. It is very thick, the porosity seems to be low, and it forms S shaped curls in the shower when it’s moisturized, especially when it’s squished to my head. It never lays quite straight when I treat it straight.\n\nMy routine has almost entirely been a straight hair routine: daily use clarifying and hydrating shampoo and conditioners (these were marketed as daily use and lightweight), very occasional deep condition masks, occasional clarifying shampoo. These are my products. My hair with a conditioning mask or some leave in conditioner will definitely form the S shaped curls while wet, and they’re somewhat visible after drying in the first few photos (1-3). Photo 4 is my hair before the cut a few months ago where it is visibly beginning to tangle on the inner (nape) hair sections despite the fact I was only walking around indoors that day. I should probably include a photo of my wet hair and the curl definition there, but I don’t have it currently. \n\nI’m very comfortable with accepting my hair is more straight than wavy/curly, but it has such a texture to it that I find that difficult. I’m not sure if it is defined enough to be wavy/curly though since I’ve used  conditioner masks, creams, and sprays to try to add definition and results never seem to hold. I’ve never used a diffuser or wavy/curly shampoo/conditioner combo, so I wonder if these would make a difference.\n\nI know my self care and approach to my hair seems a mess. It genuinely was, as was a lot of my life at the time. I’m currently trying to find what to do to make my routine and my life a bit easier while adding to my confidence.\n\nAny advice on what to do/try?",

Leaves very bad grey cast, pills like crazy. And the new one is also extremely difficult to remove. I've always used micellar water to remove sunscreen bcuz cleansing oil or balm breaks me out. But this new version is impossible to remove with micellar water. I hate that they ruined my holy grail safe-space sunscreen. How can they mess up reformulation this bad. My skin is also a bit sensitive so I'm scared to try any new sunscreen after staying loyal to Acne UV all these years. Please recommend me something similar. \n\nAnd I'd also like to hear your opinions on the new formulation, the ones who're using it, please tell me if there's any way I can make this new variant work? Or the old Acne UV users, which other sunscreen have you switched to? ",

Folks are saying that Cetaphil Redness Relieving Night Moisturizer is the same product but I'm also seeing that it's causing breakouts, so that worries me a bit. Plus it's more expensive and by the same parent company, and that just annoys me.\n\nMy current routine:\n\nMorning: Keihl's Ultra Facial Cream (in the winter/as-needed only) followed by Aveeno's Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer with 30SPF (year-round)\n\nNight: Cocokind's oil to milk cleanser, sometimes Cocokind's Advanced Care Retinol, and then Differin's night moisturizer.\n\nI love my skin as it is with this routine (no dryness or breakouts), I don't wear make-up, and I'd love a lower price point like the Differin so I can continue to splurge on my other stuff.

I barley put any product in then. Since then I keep it short and I’m much more grey and It feels like it is always just a tangled mess. Sometimes I will get a nice forehead curl (picture in white shirt), most days it’s like the final photo.\n\nI live in a very hard water area but I’m not sure if this is the issue.\n\nRoutine:\n\nWash daily with Aussie miracle moist shampoo. I know it has sulphates but I think I need these due to hard water?\n\nConditioner daily: Aussie miracle moist. I realise this now had silicones so should likely go!\n\nLeave hair wet. Then apply Mielle Pommegranate curl smoothie with hands. Then use a very wide tooth comb\n\n(+\\\\- some hairspray at this stage)\n\nAir dry 10-15 mins. Then diffuse\n\nI sleep on a cotton pillow and my hair is a a genuine birds nest each morning, so I wash/ apply products daily. \n\nMy questions (I’m Uk based so any local product suggestions welcome)\n\n\\- what to do about hard water? Should I chelate maybe every 3 weeks then use a clarifying sulphate containing shampoo once a week, or more?\n\n\\- Should I switch up the curl smoothie for a gel?\n\n\\- I think I need to add in a low poo option for lost washes \n\n\\- Should I give up? :(",

      "content": "I have pretty thick hair and I’ve always kept it shorter in a slickback style, but for the last couple of years I’ve been trying to grow it out, especially on top, so I can try a different look (The lenght is around eye level) . Honestly it’s been one of the most mentally draining experiences ever because my hair is just crazy.\n\nEven when I use the same routine, the same technique, and the same products, I still get a completely different result every time. Sometimes after I wash it, it looks perfect for days. It looks healthy, thick, smooth, and it’s easy to comb and stays in place, but other times it’s the complete opposite. It goes everywhere, gets super frizzy, feels impossible to comb, and just looks disgusting. It even looks way thinner like I’m balding, especially under certain lighting, and even the smallest gust of wind ruins it instantly.\n\nAt this point I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried everything: shampoos for dry hair, moisturizing ones, conditioners, hair milks, air drying, towel drying, no towel, rough towel, gentle towel, literally all of it. I’ve also tried different products like pomades, creams, clays, and salt spray. Salt spray does help, but I really hate how it feels in my hair, and I stopped using that kind of stuff a couple years ago. Any advice at all would be appreciated because I’m honestly out of ideas.\n\nRight now, I'm mostly using L'ORÉAL PARiS ELSEVE HYALURON PURE, and L'ORÉAL PARiS ELSEVE Extraordinary Oil Coco, and i've around 6 different conditioners and hair masks I've tried. I usually wash my hair two-three times a week, and sometimes air dry it, and sometimes use the blow dry method.",

I’m enjoying the length (it’s roughly mid-back) but I want something that frames my features and has more volume overall.\n\nI also know blowing out my hair isn’t the best for my curls but I still want the hair cut I get to maximize my curls while still looking blended and not choppy when I blow it out.\n\nroutine:\n\n\\-wash 1 a week with garnier curl nourish shampoo &amp; conditioner to detangle then eva-nyc deep conditioning mask for 10 mins.\n\n\\-leave in mixed chicks, brush through\n\n\\-rizos curl defining cream, rake through\n\n\\-either miss jessie’s jelly soft curls gel or eco gel, prayer hands then scrunch\n\n\\-satin pillow cases, satin bonnet, sometimes pineapple or braid hair under bonnet\n\nhaircut goals: bouncy, flattering face layers, volume at the root, lighter, can still look good blown out\n\nthank you 🩷",
