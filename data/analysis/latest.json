      "content": "Didn’t know I had a hair type and started catering to it. Vary happy to see how far it’s came. :))\nFirst pic was brushing daily no hair protectant, damaged hair. Honestly the least frizzy photo I had lol. Previous to this, my hair was a completely uncontrollable mess. Now, it actually has life to it!😁 Can’t wait to see how farther along it gets!\n\n       \n        🎀 HAIR ROUTINE 🎀\nAsk for face framing long\n\n- [x] 1st Week: Hydration Week → Hydration Shampoo, Hydration Hair Masque, Hydration Conditioner (add Hydration Masque only once if washing more than once that week)\n\n- [x] 2nd Week: Protein Week → Hydration Shampoo + bonding protein treatment. Light.\n\n- [ ] 3rd Week: Hydration Week → Hydration Shampoo + Conditioner (Hydration Masque if dry)\n\n- [ ] Clarify Week → Clarifying Shampoo (2 lathers) + Protein Masque\n\n⸻\n\n🧴 Wash Products\n\n1. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo\n\t•\tUse: Weekly (non-clarify weeks)\n\t•\tHow: Focus on scalp &amp; roots only. Massage with fingertips (not nails). Let suds run through lengths as you rinse.\n\t•\tRinse: Thoroughly with lukewarm water.\n\n2. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner\n\t•\tUse: Weekly (after Hydration Shampoo, except Clarify Week)\n\t•\tHow: Apply to mid-lengths &amp; ends (avoid roots to prevent heaviness). Use wide-tooth comb or fingers to detangle.\n\t•\tRinse: After 3–5 minutes, rinse lightly (leave a little slip if your hair likes it).\n\n3. SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Masque\n\t•\tUse: Every 1–2 weeks (instead of conditioner).\n\t•\tHow: Apply generously mid-lengths → ends. Detangle with wide-tooth comb. Smooth with “praying hands.”\n\t•\tWait: 10–15 minutes (cover with cap for extra effect).\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n4. SheaMoisture Protein Masque\n\t•\tUse: Once a month (after Clarifying Shampoo).\n\t•\tHow: Section hair, apply mid-lengths → ends first, then lightly on roots if needed. Brush through for even coverage. Light scrunch to help curls.\n\t•\tWait: 10–15 minutes.\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\t•\tConditioner: Skip (this masque replaces it).\n\n5. SheaMoisture Strengthen &amp; Restore Clarifying Shampoo\n\t•\tUse: Once a month (Clarify Week).\n\t•\tHow: Do 2 lathers — first lifts buildup, second deep cleans. Focus on scalp, let suds rinse through lengths.\n\t•\tFollow with: Protein Masque (not conditioner).\n\n6. SheaMoisture Bond Repair Masque (optional/alternate)\n\t•\tUse: Every 2–3 weeks or when hair feels weak/breaking.\n\t•\tHow: Same as Hydration Masque — mid-lengths → ends, detangle, smooth in.\n\t•\tRinse: Fully.\n\n⸻\n\n🌿 Leave-In &amp; Styling Products\n\n7. Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream\n\t•\tUse: Daily or after every wash/restyle.\n\t•\tHow: Apply to damp hair (after wash, or re-wet for daily refresh). Rake through with fingers from roots to ends, then smooth with praying hands.\n\t•\tAmount: Start with a nickel-sized amount per section, adjust as needed.\n\t•\tFinish: Scrunch lightly to encourage waves/curls.\n\n8. Curlsmith Frizz Rescue Curl Retainer\n\t•\tUse: After cream (daily).\n\t•\tHow: Scrunch into damp hair, focusing on mid-lengths &amp; ends. This helps lock curl shape and reduce frizz.\n\t•\tTip: Use hands or microfiber towel to “cup &amp; scrunch” upward.\n\n9. Curlsmith Frizz Rescue Finishing Serum\n\t•\tUse: After styling, when hair is 100% dry.\n\t•\tHow: Warm 2–3 drops in hands, then scrunch out any crunch or frizz. Glide lightly over surface for shine.\n\t•\tWhen: End of styling, or as touch-up on dry hair between washes.\n\n⸻\n\n\n",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

My mother has naturally curly hair that she’s unsure how to manage so she straightens it daily, when she leaves it “natural” it’s more frizzy straight than it is curly because she doesn’t know what to do to achieve her natural curls and just brushes them out. For Christmas I wanted to buy her everything she’ll need to achieve her natural curls! I took a look at a curl chart and I would say my mother’s curls are between a 2C and a 3A but only when she goes to the hair stylist and she does her curls for her. Since seeing the potential her hair actually has and realizing it’s not just frizzy it’s actually curly my mother has expressed interest in wearing her curls but she’s since given up on trying to achieve them. \n\nI’m looking for the most low maintenance option. Preferably something she can just wake up and do some care and it’s done. Perhaps overnight plopping? I have no idea!I’m not looking to spend a ton. I’ve been looking on temu, but if you guys could please give me some products she can use, also styling creams, I’m willing to spend more for the styling creams if theirs a highly suggested product! If you could give me the names of the products and in what order to use them I’d be so grateful. I think my mother would really appreciate it! \n\nThanks so much in advance to anyone with some advice! ",

I never used heat or chemicals, so I don’t think it’s damage. I’m starting to think it’s a cowlick, but I’m not sure.\n\nI don’t use heat and I don’t have a blow dryer, so I need a fix that doesn’t involve keratin or anything damaging.\n\nI’m going to the salon soon — what should I ask for? Face-framing layers? A different cut? Or is there a way to control cowlicks without styling tools?\n\n\n\nAny advice from people who have this would help a lot.

The severity of the bumps and texture goes up and down. Bumps don’t seem to be filled, just raised skin. The breakouts are worse when I try using AHAs/BHAs, retinols, etc. Those dry my skin out a ton too. I’ve tried glycolic acid and azelaic acid as well but these all burn my skin. I should mention I’m prone to seborrheic dermatitis, is this related? I get contact dermatitis on my hands too. Sensitive girl! I really just want baby smooth skin but I’m struggling to find the right products. I’ve switched to Vanicream cleanser and moisturizer this year and my skin has improved significantly. Niacinamide, HA, Good Molecules, COSRX 6 Peptides serum and BYOMA products have helped significantly as well. I rarely wear makeup because that breaks me out too. I keep it simple with tinted SPF. Gonna try Jane Iredale soon for makeup… Anyhow, I’ve currently got an Amazon wish list FULL of sensitive-skin friendly products, ones that I’ve read about here or seen on dermatologist social media posts. I’ll go broke trying it all. So, what do you think and what would you suggest based on this little bit of info and my pics? Appreciate all the help I can get! Thank you!!!",

I use stuff likeEtude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish, NIOD Re:Pigment, SK-II FTE, Ulike reglow LED mask, and then some random sheet mask I found on Amazon that somehow does exactly what I need on dehydrated days. Basically: some bougie, some cheap.\n\nI used to believe the whole “expensive = safer/better” thing. Like if it costs more, surely the quality control or ingredients are better, right?? But the more I try, the more I’m convinced it really depends on the product and why it’s priced the way it is.\n\nSometimes high-end stuff is pricey for legit reasons. Real R&amp;D, patented tech, unique actives, clinical testing, whatever. And when that’s the case, I don’t mind paying for it, because the performance makes sense. NIOD and SK-II fall into that category for me personally.\n\nBut there are definitely products that are expensive purely because of the brand “vibe” or luxe packaging. And half the time those brands belong to the same parent company anyway, so formulas get reused or tweaked slightly and then slapped with different pricing based on the line. It’s kinda wild when you realize how much of what we buy is branding psychology and not science.\n\nWhen I first got into LED masks, I assumed the expensive ones had to be miles better… but after trying a couple (one pricier one and two random Amazon ones), I found the biggest difference I noticed was consistency, not “power.” My more expensive mask has a smoother, more even light field, while the cheap ones were uneven that half my face looked like it was in a shadow. But in terms of actual results they weren’t wildly different, and the actual skin changes still took weeks either way, and neither gave me some magical overnight glow moment.\n\nOn the flip side, so many affordable brands today are actually killing it. There are cheap sunscreens that outperform mid-range ones, serums with solid actives that work just as well as “fancy” versions, and moisturizers that do the job without costing the same as a week of groceries. Affordable skincare is not what it used to be- the bar is way higher now.\n\nI’d really like to hear others’ perspective. Do you mix both? Are you “team drugstore,” “team luxury,” or “team whatever doesn’t break me out”?",

The first 3 photos are from today, the next 3 photos are from a year ago, the last photo shows my current products.\n\nI started following this routine consistently about 6 months ago:\n\nAM: Garnier micellar water and TJ’s daily facial sunscreen.\n\nPM: Neutrogena oil-free acne wash (~4 times per week) or micellar water and CeraVe PM moisturizer.\n\nFrom what I can tell, my routine is keeping my face moisturized and larger breakouts at bay, but isn’t helping with the persistent little bumps I get that stay for months (most noticeable by my eyes). I would love for those to go away. I’m also interested in potentially adding a product to help with my acne scarring and the lines under my eyes. I’m not a morning person and struggle to keep up with the morning portion of the routine as is, so any new steps would need to be added in the evening. I have combination skin (I think?).\n\nAny thoughts or advice would be appreciated! Thanks!",

On top of that, I see posts talking about diffusers. I know nothing about that, but should I buy that attachment as well? Will it help with her hair? I will add a picture in the comments for hair style. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated. (U.S if that matters)\n\nHer routine includes some sort of conditioner in the shower (I want to say it’s called “function of beauty” it’s a yellow bottle. Out of the shower, I have seen her use some curl cream. I know she’s used kinky curls and shea moisture before, but I’m not 100% if she’s still using one of those or switched, I can find out if that helps.

      "content": "Hi everyone. I need some advice on moisturizers to help heal and repair my skin barrier.\n\n**A little info about my skin:** I'm 21. I have an oily T-zone, and I’m very prone to blackheads (even on the cheeks) and milia (especially under the eyes). I’ve used a lot of exfoliating products to fight that, which I think is why my skin is so sensitive right now. I used to live in a humid city, but recently moved to a more moderate climate; my blackheads have decreased, but my skin is still pretty damaged.\n\nThe problem is that every moisturizer, even the ones that promise to be lightweight/for oily skin, causes under-the-skin bumps (hopefully visible in the photos) or milia. I’m just looking for a moisturizer that does its job without damaging my skin or causing congestion. Bonus points if it has specific healing properties!\n\nI currently use Mizon Good Bye Blemish, Low pH Cleanser. I’ve got no complaints, I think it’s pretty gentle. I can’t remove salicylic acid from my routine, or my blackheads will get worse. For a moisturizer, I use Ziaja Cucumber Mint Cream. It’s pretty meh. I haven’t noticed any particularly bad effects, but it does have perfume, and I don’t really like it on my skin.\n\nI do have some scarring (as you can see in the photos), but I don’t want to start using retinoids again yet—I just want to focus on healing.\n\n**Location/Availability:** I’m in Georgia, so I have access to a lot of European brands (French, German, Greek, Italian) as well as Korean (although Korean products are too thick, I’ve noticed and some popular American brands.\n\nIf you have similar skin issues, please share what has worked for you. Thank you!\n\nP.S. I already stopped showering with hot water because I noticed it made my forehead way worse (which is why you see more bumps there in the pics).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c8vbtmrie83g1.jpg?width=2246&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bb1bf15540ef2279bd3007c27b59baa1c9d4451\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g42csw2je83g1.jpg?width=1729&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fa018bcbaaf44e84c9f4ed86ae86da94d43dd76",

      "content": "I have 2C-3A hair and have been slowly teaching myself how to manage my curls over the past 10 years or so. My mom has 3B-3C curls but has never styled them a day in her life so all I know is what I’ve picked up on my own. I used to have very thick hair but it has become progressively more thin/brittle/dry due to medication side effects. \n\nMy current routine (when I am trying to “do” my hair rather than putting it in a pony tail) is washing my hair every other day with Plaine Products (shampoo and conditioner), using a wide tooth comb to brush it. Once a week I’ll use some kind of deep conditioning option like Plaine Product’s Deep Conditioner or Trader Joe’s Hair Mask. I’ll use a turban to dry it a bit before applying some product. I use a couple different ones because nothing seems to just “wow” me; I’ve tried Zotos All About Curls Bouncy Cream (probably the one I like the best), DevaCurl Defining Spray Gel, OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream, and Rizos Curls Refresh and Detangle Spray. I use an ancient diffuser I’ve had since college and I’ve learned from this community that I need to let it dry entirely before I break up the resulting cast. \n\nChristmas is coming up and I am thinking about asking for some products and tools to help me learn how to style and maintain my curls. My ask here is two fold: 1) can you please provide me with some pointers to help improve the look of my curls (and make no assumptions about what I know/don’t know; I probably don’t know) and 2) provide me with some product or tool recommendations to give to my family as gift ideas. Bonus points if the product recommendations are environmentally friendly and/or can be purchased in large quantities versus smaller store bought sizes.\n\nI know my hair can look amazing! I have never been told how to do it and don’t have anyone in my life who could help me learn. Please help a self-taught sister out! ",

I also believe I need to use a PM moisturizer or hydrating creme because my skin feels very dry after removing my makeup.\n\nI would love product suggestions or tips on how to tackle those closed comedones because it's been years and I don't know how to fix them.\n\nThank you!\n\nP.S. I do have eczema (mainly on the rest of my body), but it might affect my face also in some aspects (sensitivity)",
