Diffuse upside down scrunch hair to the scalp for extra volume.\n\nI’m on the fence about serums and gels still. I feel like my hair isn’t as soft when I use them and the style has to be reset every day so what’s the point? I kind of like just letting my hair be really soft, and letting it do its thing until wash day. It may be a lil frizzy, but I think I like it that way unless there is a way to get a lot of volume with gel. I think I have 2c hair, or a mix of Irish curls.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

For years I was rotating actives, acids, masks, spot treatments, you name it. My skin was constantly inflamed, breaking out, and never really healing. The more I tried to “fix” it, the worse it got.\n\nWhat helped wasn’t adding something new it was stripping everything back.\n\nWhat my routine looks like now\n\nMorning\n\n\\- no cleanser\n\n\\- Moisturizer \n\n\\- Sunscreen\n\nNight\n\n\\- Gentle cleanser \n\n\\- Ampoule \n\n\\- Moisturizer \n\n\\- Scar cream a few nights a week (not every night)\n\nThat’s literally it. No acids, no benzoyl peroxide, no harsh treatments. When my skin was bad, I was using 7–8 products a night. Now it’s 2–3 and my skin is way calmer.\n\nSkincare alone wasn’t the full fix for me. Simplifying my routine helped my barrier recover, but the real change happened once I started fixing things internally (diet, gut health, inflammation). Once my skin wasn’t constantly fighting my body, this simple routine actually worked.\n\nBefore that, even the “best” products just made things worse.\n\nI see a lot of people here blaming themselves for not finding the perfect product. In my case, my skin didn’t need more actives it needed less irritation and more consistency. Obviously everyone’s different, but if your skin feels reactive no matter what you use, it might be worth trying to calm things down instead of escalating.\n\nIf everyone wants me to rate all the skincare products I have tried. Just let me know, as you can tell have tried plenty😅",

      "content": "I’ve had really bad dandruff for over a year now. It’s not just light flakes it’s thick, stuck-to-the-scalp flakes, super itchy, and my scalp gets uncomfortable again just a day or two after washing. It looks a lot like **seborrheic dermatitis**  from what I’ve seen online.\n\nThe worst part is the hair fall. I’m losing SO much hair that it’s genuinely scaring me. Every wash, every comb  it feels like I’m slowly going bald. I know stress makes it worse, and I’m already under a lot of stress because my exams are right around the corner.\n\nBecause of that, I can’t visit a dermatologist right now. I don’t have the time or mental space, so I’m planning to order products online and just try to get this under control for now. I just want the itching and dandruff to stop, at least enough so the hair fall reduces.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\nAnti-dandruff shampoos with ketoconazole \nOr combination shampoos (ketoconazole + zinc pyrithione / ciclopirox / selenium sulfide, etc.)\n\nA leave-in lotion or serum that helps keep dandruff in check between washes\n\nAnything that helps control hair fall and help me regrow my hair\n\nWhat I don’t want:\n❌ Steroids (I don’t want rebound flares or dependency)\n❌ Minoxidil (not ready for the shedding or long-term commitment)\n\nExtra info:\nThe itching drives me crazy, especially at night\nDandruff comes back very fast after washing\n\nIf you’ve dealt with something similar and found anything that genuinely helped, please let me know  even if it’s a routine, shampoo rotation, or maintenance product. I’m honestly exhausted and just want some relief right now.\n\nP.S. I did take a little help from AI to organize my thoughts better the situation itself is very real though 😅\nI’ve attached a picture I found on Reddit because my dandruff looks almost exactly like this.\nThanks a lot 🤍",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I've been dabbling in products here and there but want to get more regimented. I'm looking for some recommendations of what products you use and what your current regime is.\n\nMy skin type is pretty normal, no breakouts, a little bit of redness, and I live in an extremely dry climate. I'm willing to invest in expensive products if they are worth it but found some inexpensive products work really well too.\n\nI've tried researching products but I don't really trust reviews because it seems like the skincare companies flood sites with positive reviews. Don't even get me started on influencer product reviews or MedSpa products....\n\nHere is what I think I need/currently use/need recommendations for:\n\n1. Moisturizer - I like a lighter moisturizer during the day and heavier at night. I use La mer Moisturizing Soft Cream during the day and the classic Creme de La mer at night. I think I need to switch to something with hyaluronic acid. Anyone have recommendations?\n2. Sunscreen - I like the La Roche Posay Tinted SPF 50. Its not heavy at all and the tint clears up redness but doesn't look like you are wearing makeup.\n3. Vitamin C - I've been using Drunk Elephant Vitamin C serum.\n4. Cleanser - Use La mer gel cleanser. Lasts a long time and doesn't seem to irritate my face.\n5. Eye cream - Don't really use one. Recommendations?\n6. Retinoid - Retin-A prescription from my doctor.\n7. Random additions - If the weather is really dry sometimes I will use the La Mer Renewal oil and add Vaseline/Eucerin stick.\n\nThis is what I was thinking for everyday:\n\nMorning: Face wash &gt; Vitamin C &gt; Light moisturizer &gt; Sunscreen\n\nEvening: Face wash &gt; Retinoid &gt; Eye cream &gt; Heavy moisturizer\n\nRandom additions: Exfoliate 2x/week with Clarisonic brush, face masks as needed, oil/Vaseline/Eucerin stick.\n\nLet me know if you have any recommendations for products/routine!",

      "title": "[Routine Help] Oily acne prone -1 month into skincare routine, now red and breaking out. Purging or irritation?",
      "content": "I’m 27M in the Philippines with oily, acne-prone skin and I’m trying to figure out if what I’m seeing is purging or irritation and how to reset my routine. The photos attached are my skin right after waking up today. I mostly stay indoors and have only been outside around four days this past month, so I haven’t been using sunscreen regularly.\n\nAbout a month ago I started a new routine with mostly these products to get into skincare: COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser, Isntree Green Tea Fresh Toner patted in with my hands, COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid 2 nights per week, and COSRX Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion as my moisturizer. I also have Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun SPF 50 but I only use it on the rare days I go out in daylight. All of these were started at roughly the same time about four weeks ago. For the first couple of weeks things seemed okay, but recently I’ve developed more redness all over plus new breakouts, including a couple of bigger inflamed pimples near my cheek/ear area and smaller ones on my cheeks and chin.\n\nBecause the redness and breakouts were getting worse, I stopped the COSRX Low pH cleanser two days ago. Since stopping it, the acne spots feel like they’re drying up a bit. I just started using Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Cleanser and have only used it once so far, so I’m not sure yet if it’s helping or if the improvement is just from dropping the previous cleanser and backing off irritation. Right now my main concern is calming the breakouts and redness, but I also have very visible pores and would love to know whether that’s something products can realistically improve\n\nMy questions are: does this sound more like irritation from the combo of COSRX Low pH cleanser plus BHA and other new products? Should I cut BHA completely for a while or just lower the frequency, and does it make sense to stick with Round Lab Dokdo or switch to something else? And separately, based on how my skin looks in the photos, is there anything that can actually help the appearance of my pores, or should I focus on getting the breakouts under control first?",

Before starting my treatment with this drug, I performed a blood test out of curiosity to check my individual hormonal parameters and then see how they would change during the treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tests I performed before starting treatment and their results:\n\n\n\nDHT Result: 389,42 Norms: 143-842\n\n\n\nTSH Result: 1,205  Norms : 0.35-4.94\n\n\n\nFT4 Result: 1,04   Norms:  0.7-1,48\n\n\n\nEstradiol Result: 43.0 Norms: 11-44\n\n\n\nProlactin Result 8.90 Norms: 3,46-19,4\n\n\n\nTestosteron: Result: 26,94 Norms: 8,33-30,19\n\n\n\n\n\nToday I went to the lab to do the blood tests needed for the hair transplant and I thought it would be interesting to do some hormone tests to see how the levels of various parameters are after 7 months on finasteride:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday's test results:\n\n\n\nDHT-still waiting\n\n\n\nEstradiol: Result 26.00 Norms : 11-44\n\nTestosteron 29,15 Norms 8.33-30,19\n\nPSA: 0.404 Norms: 0-4\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now my question... as you can see, the most important parameter, dhd, has not yet arrived but it surprises me that despite 7 months of taking finasteride, my level of estradiol has DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY!!!!. I am very surprised because from what I know, this drug blocks the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone, which results in a decrease in the level of dht, as well as an increase in the level of testosterone and estradiol.\n\nAs for the testosterone level, it is indeed elevated, but only slightly. Is there a chance that despite such a long therapy, finasteride won't work for me at all? I tried to find some information on the internet, but it seems like nobody had a case like mine.\n\n\n\n\n\nI would appreciate any help\n\n",

I know everyone says to split your hair, apply some drops, then rub it in. The problem I run into is I am just barely thinning, so it feels like I just end up getting a lot on my hair as well.\n\nInstead I've been applying drops at the front of my hairline, tilting my head back, and letting them go back while I rub it in...still get wet hair.\n\nAre there any other techniques or tools you can use to get less on the hair? Or is it okay for your hair to get some of the liquid as well? Looking for any advice here.\n\nThanks!",

This was 2-3 years ago but constant sun exposure and no sun protection awareness made it almost a part of my face now. And the pigmentation on forehead too. \n\nI used azelaic acid (aziderm) and glycolic+kojic acid cream for 2 months and saw some minor results. As my tan started going away these marks are starting to take a constrast on my face.\n\nNow I’m using vitamin c serum and glycolic acid toner and sun is my sworn enemy. \n\nWhat am I doing right and what am I doing wrong? Help a beginner out.\n\nP.S. - since I am a student it goes without saying—can’t spend much.",
