However when I put my head upside down it looks really nice! \n\nI had curly hair when I was a child but when growing up, I used to bleach my hair and cut them really short so there was absolutely no curl pattern. \nI’m in the process of growing my hair long and they always looked curly-ish while wet so I wanted to try this new routine.\n\nWhat do you think? \nShould I keep doing this routine or my hair pattern isn’t worth it? \nAlso why does it look fabulous upside down but terrible in a normal position?

She tried them, but after just one use, her skin is feeling very dry and tender to the touch.\n\nWe’re a bit confused because she wasn’t given any instructions on whether these two gels can be used together or how best to apply them. We’ve done our own research but I also mentioned how useful this Reddit is with people offering advice and sharing experience.\n\nShe never use to suffer with acne until the birth of our first child and hasn’t been able to shake it, despite numerous skincare products. She finally had enough and decided to visit the GP.\n\nI’ve advised her to trust the process and moisturise at different intervals, but I wanted to check if anyone here: •\tUses both gels together? •\tHas tips on how to apply them safely without      over-drying the skin? •\tCan share their experience with either product?\n\nAny advice or experiences would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Will obviously discuss with my fertility doctor in 2 days. \n\n————————\n\n\nWe’ve had a long journey TTC for few years and then went down the route of IVF to finally be pregnant. I’m currently about 5 weeks along.\n\nI just realized my husband has been using topical finasteride/minoxidil (HIMS) on his hair a few times a week. Knowing how dangerous finasteride is to fetal development, I’m now freaking out trying to remember if I’ve ever touched his hair directly after or touched something indirectly after he’s touched it? He says he sprayed it in mornings before heading to work and washes hands after (and we then don’t see each other until the end of the day) so that part makes me feel A LITTLE better but I can’t help but spiral, especially since this is a very hard road to get to this pregnancy. Anyone been in my shoes and everything turn out ok? He said he will stop using it from now on but I’m worried about anything from beforehand :( thanks in advance",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I’m looking for advice on my rolling 3 night routine. I have combination, slightly sensitive skin. \n\n\n- Night 1 - Medik8 Crystal Retinal 3 which has 0.03% retinal\n- Night 2 - Geek &amp; Gorgeous Calm Down PHA &amp; BHA exfoliant \n- Night 3 - hydrating/barrier repairing serum\n\nI’m mid-30s and started retinal in June for general skin improvement and anti aging benefits. \n\n\nI chose the exfoliant because I wanted something with mild BHA, as I could no longer tolerate Paula’s Choice 2% BHA once I started retinal. This has 0.8% BHA.\n\n\nI’ve settled into this routine through trial and error. It seems to be how I can best tolerate using retinal and chemical exfoliation. When I’ve tried to skip the 3rd night - the break - my skin has protested, feeling sensitive and uncomfortable.\n\n\nI would like to get the most efficacy from retinal, and I’m worried that only using it 2 x a week means I’m not getting that. I would ideally like to use it every other night. \n\n\nMy question is, do I listen to my skin, which seems to have settled into the rolling 3 night routine, or do I try and impose a retinal-every-other-night routine on my skin, and hope it becomes accustomed to it? When would be the best time to use the chemical exfoliant? I suppose I could use it a couple of mornings a week? \n\n\nI would be interested to hear your thoughts and experiences. ",

      "content": "I’m getting married in 11 days! we’re having something very low key - a register office marriage and a small celebration. Because it’s a smaller wedding, I haven’t given my hair that much thought, but as the day is coming up I was thinking I’d like my hair to look a bit shinier/smoother and less frizzy.\nI know I can’t get perfection in this time period, and I’m fine with that, but I was hoping to use some oils or serum on the day to flatten strays and frizz and generally make it oook a bit more polished. I would really appreciate some recommendations!\nAlso (this may be blasphemy on this subreddit) I am very likely to use heat tools to refine some of my curls on the day.\n\nI would class my hair more wavy than curly (so I hope it’s okay I’m in this sub) - it gets weighed down quite easily, and I think my “curls” lose their shape and become frizz within 24 hours of washing. I have also found that curl cream (cantu) can sometimes hinder my curls rather than help - but mousse (also cantu) is helpful. The first two pics are from this evening- I washed my hair this morning and put in no products afterwards but garnier’s ultimate blends papaya hair food, which I brushed out. My hair was air dried too. I feel that shows my natural texture quite well.\nThe last two pictures show how I plan on putting my hair up - part up, part down. There from the other day when I was trying out my dress and veil :) I had tried some heat styling the day before, which didn’t take too well - or at least didn’t last to the next day - so it’s not my natural or usual hair (but I guess not too different)\n\nRoutine:\nShampoo: I rotate between Noughty Detox Dynamo, Garnier’s curly shampoo, and olaplex (I used Detox Dynamo today)\nConditioner: I use olaplex occasionally, but mostly garnier ultimate blends papaya hair food\nOther products: when necessary I use tresemme’s heat protector spray, sometimes I use Cantu’s curl cream, and sometimes Cantu’s mousse\n",
