      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "title": "[Acne] Acne &amp; PIE Only Get Worse :(",
      "content": "I am at a loss of what to do. I absolutely hate the way my skin looks and it’s really taking a hit to my well being to be honest. \n\nHere’s my skincare timeline: \n\nPrior to 2020, I used some products, like the now viral Paula’s choice exfoliant and first aid beauty moisturizer among other things that I don’t even remember now. I never really thought twice about skin care and only broke out minimally in my luteal phase. I wore minimal makeup, but had started getting into it more in 2019 and 2020. That’s when I started pretty frequently wearing bb cream. \n\nSpring of 2020 I noticed I started to breakout much more frequently. This was pre masks. \n\nThen when masks became the norm it got significantly worse. My job involved talking excessively into a mask all day so it was pretty damp under there…. \n\nI started getting more into skin care because of my acne and tried a variety of random TikTok popular products to no avail. \n\nMasks continued well into 2021 for me, and my acne never really improved. Once masks came off later that year, my acne still did not improve. I continued my dive into skincare, learning more, trying more and always to no real help. My skin would fluctuate, sometimes improving and then always coming back to acne. \n\nIn Oct 2022 I started tret. That was a huge error in judgement as I didn’t properly work my skin up to it, and I broke out significantly worse for months. I tried to push past the purge phase but I ended up stopping in Feb of 2023. My skin improved and went back to its old state of acne but not nearly as bad as while on tret. I experimented with gentler retinols as exfoliants, but never had success. \n\nIn September 2024, I decided to try Naturium azelaic acid. I’d heard so many good things, especially for PIE, which was getting worse and worse for me. I didn’t react particularly well to most exfoliants or retinols so I thought this would be a really gentle option. My face blew the hell up. I continued using it because apparently there can be a purge stage you have to push through and every thing I read said azelaic acid is so so gentle and shouldn’t be an issue long term. I persisted. Throughout my entire acne journey I try to make sure I’m trying something for at least a few weeks if they are known to have a purge stage to see if it will help. Also, in Dec 2024 I started using a red light panel for 5 mins daily for the next several months. Finally, I stopped using azelaic acid around Feb 2025 and it had made my skin astronomically worse. The PIE I was maintaining was significant. I was so frustrated that I’ve fucked up my skin so much more. I became suspicious that I have a niacinamide allergy and that’s why the Naturium azelaic acid was so bad. I removed it from my routine. \n\nAt this point I was so over PIE and experimenting that I went to a medical esthetician. They recommended micro-needling for the acne and PIE but I asked for a DYE VL laser for a few treatments to specifically target the PIE first which was the biggest hit to my confidence.  After 2-3 treatments from March 2025 to July 2025 it hadn’t seemed to improve yet, and I was trying to get pregnant so I had to stop the laser. I also discovered the sunscreen and setting spray I was using daily had niacinamide so I was hopeful that was the reason I hadn’t seen any improvement and replaced it in my routine. \n\nIn August 2025 I switched to microneedling which I then did for 4 treatments from August 2025 to January 2026. I didn’t notice improvement from the  treatments and now I’m realizing microneedling actually makes my skin breakout a ton. It gets glowy for a duration after which has made me go back for more but I think it ultimately is making things worse. \n\nIn December 2025 I also realized that the moisturizer I was using daily had niacinamide . I had checked it previously but was reading an outdated ingredient list and their new formulation now included it. I removed it from my routine. I finally feel confident there’s no niacinamide in my routine but my skin hasn’t improved. \n\nMy esthetician suggested I remove tocopherol but it’s in bloody every makeup product I can get in my country and I literally can’t leave my house without makeup or at least a tinted spf because of how awful I feel in my skin. \n\nAside from those big changes I’ve listed, I’ve tried what feels like every product under the sun. Ive gotten a chemical peel but it just broke me the hell out. I’ve removed dairy from my diet for multiple months. I’ve removed gluten from my diet for multiple months. I’ve lowered sugar to &lt;25g daily from multiple months. I wash my pillowcases weekly. Ive tried a low histamines. Ive gone weeks at a time simplifying my routine to only simple cleanser, moisturizer and spf.  I’ve used single use towels to wash my face.  I’ve been to a derm who just suggested hormonal meds and didn’t even look at my skin without makeup. I have endometriosis and hypothyroidism and know they can contribute to acne but I consistently have good blood test results for my hormones. I feel like I’ve tried almost everything and can’t solve this. \n\nThe things I haven’t tried:\n\n1. Hormonal medication. I refuse to do this because I had an awful experience with birth control years ago that ruined my health for 11 months afterwards. I’m trying for a baby and can’t afford to throw my hormones out of wack.\n\n2. Removing tocopherol like suggested due to the makeup thing. \n\nI’m so frustrated and don’t know what to do. Is this going to be my skin forever? Help please :( ",

      "content": "I’m sorry if I sound pretty clueless but I’m like desperate for help here. Something is seriously wrong with my arms and hands and they look hideous. I wasn’t sure exactly what to tag this, as it could be either acne, ingrown hairs, some skin condition, or all three maybe, but you can take a good look at the pictures and see that my skin is all bumpy, and acne filled too in some places. The skin on my hands look wrinkly, and that’s after i put on lotion😭 fyi, i have a lot of body hair, i hate all of it and try to shave the hand hair off consistently, while shaving my arms every month or so, but it seems like it either A. Always results in looking this, or B. It looks like this regardless, and I just don’t know what it is. I’ve tried various different methods of shaving to see if it helps. I use tree hit bare - moisturizing shave oil (coconut lime) while I shave, and then I use Loasu soft serve after shave oil as my after shave. I’ve tried multiple shaving devices. I’ve used 2 or 3 different shavers, mainly the Philips morello one blade 360, but also the Philips Norelco Bodygroom Series 7000. I have tried one razor, that being the gilette Venus, but it usually turns out with this same result. I’ve tried shaving using these things with and without the shaving oil, I’ve tried applying and not applying the aftershave, that doesn’t work too well either. And of course, it doesn’t really seem like any lotion makes it look much better either… I’m really not that well educated on this stuff so I really apologize if this post seems really dumb, but I have no clue what’s supposed to work for me, and I can’t stand my arms and hands looking so gross, especially only at 19 years old, in fact, this is happening in literally any place I shave accept maybeeee my face, which still looks kinda yucky. Maybe it’s because I’m a man, I’m not sure if that has to do with anything, but that doesn’t mean I like it. So if anyone could please help I’d really appreciate it.",

I think I need to take care of it differently\n\nthe current routine:\n\n\\- vichy dercos sensitive shampoo\n\n\\- the ordinary behentrionium chloride 2% conditioner\n\n\\- harologi rebuild spray, every third wash for 5 min\n\n\\- hask curl defining cream, scrunched in\n\n\\- air dry or dry with diffuser\n\nthe pictures have been taken on wash day after diffuser drying and brushing once completely dry\n\nI suspect that this routine is drying out my hair a bit too much and I think the curl cream is too heavy. I‘m not sure whether the uneven curl pattern is due to my products not being ideal (the top layer is quite dry) or if that‘s just naturally what my hair does now\n\nI‘d like to try new products and techniques but am having a hard time navigating the sea of options. Any advice I can start researching from is appreciated :) I kind of don‘t know where to begin, that curl cream belonged to my ex and I just stuck with it lol\n\nalso… please be very honest, I feel like the back of my hair looks tragic ;-; do you think I should cut it shorter? I love the way it curls in the front at this lenght but whenever I see a picture of me at a slight angle or from the back I feel pain\n\nthank you!",

Almost everything I use regularly at home, and the travel sizes are stuff I've used fine at home and at my daughter's house. \n\nIs the water in the hotel too hard or soft?\n\nThis was my second wash at this hotel. First was fine, not exceptional, but fine. Second wash, hair washed fine, suds were normal. \n\nThe InnerSense Conditioner is amazing, normally, but this time my hair tangled badly, and the wet frizz was off the charts when I rinsed it out. Usually, I have soft seaweed hair after rinsing. Not this time. So, I put extra EcoSlay cream (normally use AG beach bomb sparingly at home), and it felt sticky, so I added more water, and \"squish to condish\" without improvement. \n\nI loaded up my hair with InnerSense I Create volume, that I normally I use for slip while brushing, and it was better, but my hair felt WEIRD. \n\nSo, second wash I left the gel off. Tried a little InnerSense I Create Lift foam to help with definition. Diffused, and I guess it'll stay in a pineapple until I go home. \n\nRoutine (travel kit)\n1. Ouidad Anti-frizz shampoo (I always use)\n2. InnerSense Conditioner (I always use)\n2a. BounceCurl detangler brush (I always use)\n3. EcoSlay Orange Marmalade cream - travel size pump\n4. InnerSense I Create Volume serum (I always use)\n5. DevaCurl Ultra Defining gel - travel size pump\n5a. BounceCurl detangler brush \n6. BounceCurl EdgeLift brush (I always use)\n7. Biosilk Rock Hard gelee (I always use)\n\nI've used all of these off and on at home without issue. \n\nMy only guess is the hotel's salt-based water softener system. Anyone else have solutions for either hard or soft water?\n",

I use the derma-code serum and moisturizer my go to’s as you can see in the picture lol. And yes I collect my bottles they’re very pretty haha. \n\nOk so last time I asked about incorporating just one more product into my daily routine. I had some great recommendations one I adopted religiously for about a month was a vitamin C serum someone recommended. Whit it brightened my skin for a few weeks then disaster I started piling a lot. I’m not sure what it was. For context I like my routines minimal because of my sensitive skin issue. I just want one more product ti add. My current stack is cleanser CeraVe, followed by derma- code serum then derma-code moisturizer, and lastly my sunscreen from EltaMD. \n\nI feel my routine is too basic and I don’t use or care for tretinoin or anything that’ll mess with my barrier. I finally have it under control with derma-code. \n\nFor image context I’ve been using this stuff for a little over 2 and a half months now and I use it day and evening and on days off from work I use it in between. I use more than I should because it’s the only stuff that makes my skin comfortable and fells protected. That’s why I have so many empties. \n\nMy question 🙋🏻‍♀️ what is one more product worth adding to my routine for a basic routine? What’s missing? I would mind trying vitamin c serum again but one that stays consistent and doesn’t change over a few weeks. So based on my skin concerns which are very close to being obsolete. What can I do to maintain my current glow for the long run. I don’t want it to begin fading again. \n\nThanks and looking forward to recommendations from everyone. ",

I’ve been using curl cream for years on someone else’s advice and I didn’t realize what it was really for. \n\nI didn’t want that springy condensed look for my hair, so now I can get visible length and stretch with the gel.

Result from the salon after my cut and styling\n2. Result when I style my hair myself at home\n\nWhat am I doing wrong that makes my waves fall flat during diffusing, even though I’m following the same routine and using the same products as the salon?
