      "content": "I feel like my whole life, curly hair isn't something that society deems professional or beautiful.\n\nGrowing up, my mum and other older adults in my life were constantly telling me to straighten my hair. Or like\"do you even brush your hair???\" Giving me endless products that stop frizz. Telling me how much nicer I looked when I straightened my hair. This still happens today.\n\nIt feels like looking after my curly hair takes so much effort just to make it even look presentable. A straight-haired goddess just walks out of bed with effortless-looking, shiny, smooth long locks. \n\nIt will take me half an hour to wash using my routine.  Pre-shampoo (Garnier Fructis Curls Method Shampoo), double shampoo. Conditioner (Natural Look curls boost). Leave-in Conditioner (Garnier Fructis, 3-in-1 Hair Mask). Mouse (SHEA MOISTURE Coconut and Hibiscus), then gel, scrunching and praying hands, and then diffusing (plus a few hours to dry since my hair is so thick). By the time it's all done, it's the evening, and it looks nice for a few hours. I use a stain pillow, but the next day it's all crumpled and sad looking, so it's like all the effort for nothing.\n\nI feel so self-conscious going out with my natural curls. I feel like people look at me as if I do not look after myself when my hair is naturally curly. For events, there is always pressure to straighten or heat-curl my hair.\n\nI do get comments from people who really like my natural curls, but I feel like the majority of people aren't impressed.\n\nJust wondering if it gets easier, and if you've found you sort of grown into your curls more. Thank you.",

I thought there might hopefully be some new products that have entered the market :)\n\nI’ve had keratosis pilaris on my legs and arms my entire life, have tried First aid beauty and Cerave SA, nothing works. I figured id try this amlactin thing  now that I’m in Canada for a few months. But im finding it hard to obtain (for a reasonable price) and was hoping anyone could recommend a similar product that works as well, or if amlactin is the holy grail, where to obtain? \n\nThank you all. Any other advice regarding KP is so appreciated, I have purchased those Korean Scrub mitts, hoping they will help a little at least\n\nIll insert a pic of my arm (im embarrassed to do so tbh), but my legs basically look the same, it just felt too intimate to post lol",

      "content": "(16 M) What I’m trying to say is, am I really improving or is this just false hope? So to start, I’ve been dealing with moderate acne for 2-3 years now. Most part is prob my fault because I was doing too much to my skin, we’ll touch on that later. Anyways, I’ve tried many different products and things over the years. Benzoyl peroxide, witch hazel. Nothing worked. Until I found salicylic acid. That’s the only thing that calmed down my acne, so I got excited and started using it in so many forms. And it did help, for a small period of time, then I kept getting pimples in patches and that’s when I stopped. \n\nThis August, later in the month, I stopped all actives and reset my routine. And I’ve been doing this since: \nMorning: cetaphil daily gentle cleanser, cerave daily moisturizer (just got a sunscreen one I’ve been using but nothing has happened because of it)\nNight: up&amp;up salicylic acid cleanser, thayers toner (every other night), peach slices dark spot serum, and cerave daily moisturizer. \nAnd with this routine, I’ve noticed a huge difference. My skin is much clearer than before, all that’s left is dark spots and light scarring. My pimples have become much smaller when they do form, and they don’t form in large chunks like before.\n\nNow back to my question, is all this a sign of something good? Only because this is the first time something’s ever worked like this for this long for me. Granted, I barely have made it past the purging weeks, but I already see and feel a huge difference, so I’m very optimistic. The only thing that is a little bothersome is the hyperpigmentation and dark spots left by my pimples, no matter how gentle and don’t mess with them, they all leave dark spots. But, I know those fade and the dark spot serum I’m using should be helping.\n\nEdit* I put urgent as I kind of need to know whether or not my routine will go somewhere, but it’s kind of a touchy subject that’ll take too long to explain. Also, I know it’s hard to tell with such limited information, but any feedback or advice is appreciated!",

I can’t describe the motion I do with the brush but it s like brushing and twisting it at the same time. 3) Dry: She used a salon grade dryer but recommended I use a diffuser but not touch my hair with it just hover around it until it’s completely dry. 4)Serum: I break the gel cast with innersence serum. She was very specific about using a serum not an oil. I do all of this but my curls never come out like hers. Am I missing a step? Mine come out very frizzy no solid or strong curls. ",
