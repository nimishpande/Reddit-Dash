Then I apply more curl custard on the crown section, and brush style with the bounce curl brush. I continue to scrunch with more gel, and then I diffuse. \n\nI get a pretty good gel cast but I still feel like the definition doesn’t stay? Or the curls get “fluffed out” too soon and I don’t get the ringlets I guess I’m looking for. My hair is more on the wavy end I suppose, should I be doing a more wavy focused routine?

It's the Sally Henson Insta-Dry. This is actually my FAVORITE brand of polish. I always love the way it glides in, has excellent coverage, dries super fast and is affordable. Oh and they always have a pretty good selection of shades. The black/red one is called 'Go Garnet' and I got another one that is a very very dark red but not as dark as the other one. It's called 'Pomo &amp; Plum'. Hope this helps someone!\n*The top one is Go Garnet and the bottom is Pomp&amp;Plum. ",

      "content": "So I’m trying to get my hair to get more defined. That’s my goal here. I’ve been watching curl training/routine videos for a while, seen so many different things, but I wanted to ask for product recommendations to try and for people to tell me what does and doesn’t work for them so I can try and get some idea what to do. Also I don’t know how important this is, but my ideal hair length is what it is in slide 5. My hair is more of a zigzag than curly, some pieces in the front get coils, some are just barely a wave, and some are zigzags. \n\nMy routine kinda looks like this normally, I shower, and I’m either using As I am co wash or Kevin Murphy Killer Curls. After that, I use my holy grail product, Not Your Mothers leave in conditioner. I used to use their curl cream and gel, but after that not working the best I switched to Mielle’s curl smoothie which seems to work a little better, but I wanna try a different curl cream and see what works best for me. I don’t use gel anymore, should I? I used to use sea salt spray, I’ve heard it helps but I’ve also heard it dries out your hair so I rarely use it anymore. I also use the Mielle rosemary mint hair oil recently, as well as the Mielle weightless oil for my ends. (If you can’t tell, I’m a brand whore. Once I like something I wanna try their other stuff haha.) I saw a video online saying to use mousse again, and I don’t have any but a while ago I used to use NYM’s curl foam stuff, but my mom told me too much product will weigh the curls down so I stopped and pretty much just did leave in confirmed and curl cream until recently. This time I even added some hairspray, I saw someone say that and I thought I’d give it a try. The brand is Kenra, I used to use it for when I’d curl my hair when I was in middle school haha. I usually let it air dry as I never give myself enough time before work to dry it, but today I used my conair orange blow dryer, it was cheap and from Walgreens I didn’t think it mattered but now I’m starting to see it does. But yeah, that’s my curl routine, I did it differently today and didn’t seem to get any different results. \n\nWhen I was showering I doused my hair in conditioner and scrunched it, I even did the twisty curl things where you roll it and twist it out today, but I don’t know how to tell which way your hair curls so I kinda just pick a direction and alternate like I would if I was curling my hair. I don’t expect it to make an immediate difference, but it didn’t seem to do anything so I will keep trying that to see if it helps. Should I do that after showering too? \n\nI also am aware I don’t do the brush thing and then coil it around that, I’ve seen that a lot, but my brush is very old and needs to be replaced, plus it doesn’t seem to be the best for doing that so does anybody have any brush recommendations? And does it matter what kind of blow dryer/diffuser I use? If so, what do you guys use? Also, what kind do heat protectant should I use? I stopped straightening my hair ages ago and I don’t know what works good, I don’t even really have anything except the 10 in one Not Your Mothers stuff but I don’t count that, it’s just currently my only option and I really don’t wanna damage my small curl pattern haha. \n\nSorry, I know this is a lot but I’m looking for product recommendations to try out, things I could do differently, and just tips in general. What works for you that you would recommend for curl training? Thank you to anybody who responds with advice. ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Her hair is SUPER thick(like, extremely thick), and my hair was just like hers up until the time period I mentioned earlier. My father is white, and is currently, almost bald. Bald on the top of his head, with little stubbles on the side. I’m wondering if this may be a genetic thing(sadly), from my Dad’s side, or if it may be a hormonal thing/stress thing(as I got my period around 2022-2023), and also noticed a texture difference in my hair since then.\n\nConsidering that information, does anybody have any advice on how to re-thicken my hair, if it was already thick before? I’ve tried fish oil, but wasn’t consistent, so may try again. Anything is appreciated. Thank you.",

My current routine is back to basics: mineral SPF and eye cream in the AM, with a double cleanse and Trader Joe’s retinol at night (I started retinol at 0.1% at age 23).\n\nI recently had a bad reaction after using the Dr. Ceuracle BHA Matcha Ampoule and the ALPB Kojic Acid/Vitamin C Ampoule. I’ve tried Vitamin C in the past, but it always seems to darken my skin even with SPF. Through this trial and error, I’ve realized I actually have quite sensitive skin. I’ve spent the last week on this simpler 'reset' routine and have already noticed my skin feeling better, but I still want to find a way to safely incorporate hydration, barrier protection and ensuring aging gracefully without looking glossy or making it hard to blend in my sunscreen.\n\n I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed by the K-beauty market and the sheer number of new products and new ingredients. Any suggestions on how to safely 'amp up' a routine like this for someone with a damaged-prone barrier and oily skin?",

      "content": "Hey! I am seeking advice regarding my skincare routine, I am new to skincare.\n\n(I don't post a lot, apologies in advance if this isn't reddit worthy!)\n\nI'm a 21 F, I've got a relatively healthy skin, can be a bit dry during winter and during summer/spring it can get a bit oily. I am looking to get products that will help me with getting a smooth, vibrant and healthier face with no bumps if possible\n\nI essentially got 2 full sized products, and The Littles 6.0 as I heard it's a good starter pack to get.\n\nI am open to any recommendations, my skin can be quite sensitive so I need products that will work for all skin types as I get breakouts depending on product.\n\n\\* My current setup is all drunk elephant as I am aware you can use it safely to create ''skincare cocktails''.\n\nCurrently I am using:\n\nDrunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Cleanser  \nC FIRMA (From drunk elephant)  \nAmino Rain Glasswater Serum  \nProtini Polypeptide Cream (from Littles)  \nLala Retro whipped cream moisturiser\n\nAnd the bundle Littles 6.0 so I use whatever the bundle has.\n\nI do exfoliation nights as well, so I use the TLC framboos.\n\nI will write down my routine at the moment.\n\nAM ROUTINE (EVERY DAY)\n\n1. Cleanse\n\nDrunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Cleanser Use a small amount Lukewarm water only 2.C FIRMA treatment: 1 pump of C-Firma to the skin\n\n1. Hydrate / Glow\n\nAmino Rain Glasswater Serum 1–2 pumps Apply on slightly damp skin\n\n1. Moisturize\n\nProtini Polypeptide Cream (from Littles) / Lala Retro | OR BOTH Peptides help smooth texture over time\n\n1. (Optional glow)\n\nMix 1 drop D-Bronzi into Protini if you want warmth/glow\n\n1. Sunscreen (MANDATORY)\n\nNot optional if you want smooth skin (any SPF you like)\n\nNON-EXFOLIATION NIGHTS (5× per week)\n\n1. Cleanse\n\nBeste No. 9\n\n1. Hydrate\n\nAmino Rain Glasswater Serum\n\n1. Moisturize\n\nLala Retro Whipped Cream\n\n1. OPTIONAL (2–3 nights/week only)\n\nVirgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil 1 drop Mix into Lala Retro OR press on top This helps barrier repair + glow, but don’t overuse. Non-Exfoliation Nights (5× per week) Nights 1 &amp; 2 — with Virgin Marula Oil Cleanse → Beste No. 9 Treatment → C-Firma Fresh Hydration → Amino Rain Glasswater Serum Moisturize → Lala Retro Whipped Cream Oil (optional) → Virgin Marula Oil, 1 drop, press on top Nights 3, 4 &amp; 5 — without oil Cleanse → Beste No. 9 Treatment → C-Firma Fresh Hydration → Amino Rain Glasswater Serum Moisturize → Lala Retro Whipped Cream\n\nPM ROUTINE — ROTATE NIGHTS EXFOLIATION NIGHTS (2× per week ONLY) First-Time TLC Night — Step-by-Step\n\n1. Cleanse\n\nUse Beste No. 9 Lukewarm water, gentle, no scrubbing Pat skin slightly damp or fully dry depending on instructions: TLC works on dry skin\n\n1. Apply TLC Framboos\n\nShake bottle (if needed) Use 1 pump for your whole face Apply thin, even layer Avoid eye area\n\n1. Moisturize Immediately\n\nApply Lala Retro Whipped Cream (thin layer) Do not mix with Glasswater serum or Marula oil tonight — keep it simple This seals hydration and protects the barrier\n\n1. Avoid Morning Products Tonight\n\nSkip serum + oil tonight Do not apply sunscreen tonight (obviously), but use SPF tomorrow morning\n\nTLDR :\n\n* 21F, new to skincare, skin is mostly healthy (dry in winter, oily in summer)\n* Current routine: Drunk Elephant products + Littles 6.0 bundle\n* AM: Cleanse &gt; C-Firma &gt; Serum &gt; Moisturizer &gt; SPF\n* PM: Cleanse &gt; Serum &gt; Moisturizer, plus TLC Framboos 2×/week for exfoliation\n* Goals: Smooth, healthy, vibrant skin with no bumps\n* Looking for advice: Is my routine balanced? Am I overcomplicating? Missing anything?",

All the while she is threading my eyebrows she always complain about how thick my hair is. I mean girl that is why I'm here! \n\nThen she'll suggest I just thread my upper lips also. But I tell her to wax it only. Guess what she did today. She was melting the wax for half an hour. Without waiting for the wax to cool down or anything she applied the hot boiling wax on my face. Oh my god it hurt and stung like crazy. And because the wax was too liquid-y, it slipped and fell on my chest. I'm so annoyed rn. I was not crying but tears kept falling out of my eyes. \n\nMY SKIN PEELED OFF BECAUSE OF HOW HOT THE WAX WAS!! \n\nI'm never going back again. I'm going to learn how to take care of my face myself. I hate her. I hate her. I hate her.\n\nAnd just for the context I'm not insecure about my facial hair but because I've thick and dense hair on my face. My face becomes really itchy and i hate it. \n\nI can't wait to earn and get everything lasered. ",

I’m looking to get my sweetheart the be-all-end-all of hairbrushes for her birthday. Don’t mind spending a substantial amount if the brush is worth it and will last well into future. The only high end offering I’m privy to is the Mason Pearson brand line of boar bristle &amp; nylon hairbrushes as I’ve seen nothing but positive remarks on this site and elsewhere. I’m seriously looking at the combo bristle 9”x3” that runs around $300. My darling’s hair is usually well below her shoulder blades and occasionally to her derrière and is probably thicker than average. Only products she uses on “bad” hair days is a leave-in spray conditioner/detangler and a plugin heated hair tong straightener thingy. If y’all can help in any way please do. Comments or links to other threads that have covered this topic before will get my gratitude and upvotes. Thank you kindly in advance. Peace and love. AlabamaDan",

      "content": "After almost a year and 2 hair cuts, I think I have a good routine down! First pic is from the start of this journey, second pic is today. My hair is pretty average, normal porosity, medium density, finer hair in front and medium coarse hair in the back. \n\nCurrent routine: Garnier Fructis clarifying shampoo followed with Shea moisture hydrating hair masque once a week\n\nConditioner only every other day or every 2 days depending on greasyness and laziness levels\n\nSquish to condish \n\nKnot Today leave in conditioner while hair is dripping wet in the shower, scrunch so my hair isn't dripping\n\nOut of the shower, I roughly section a top and bottom section and do the bottom section first. When I style the top section I split it into 2 sections, left and right\n\nFor each section, I spray with water to moisten the roots more, comb away from my scalp with a wide toothed comb, put a bit of Shea moisture whipped curl cream in my hands and emulsify (not really necessary but I bought it to try so I'm just trying to use up at this point). I rake the curl cream through, then using praying hands to reform the clumps and scrunch. I microplop with a microfiber towel, then put a golf ball size (more for the top section) of Not Your Mother's mousse and apply with praying hands and scrunch. Spritz some heat protectant, then I diffuse upside down till a cast has formed and my roots are like 75% dry. Then I pixie diffuse right side up, flipping side to side. I use a small rounded hair claw to clip my roots where my section is to get some volume\n\nI shower at night, so I leave the cast in my hair, put on a satin bonnet, and sleep. I scrunch out any cast in the morning. Usually it's a bit wild at the start of day 1, but it flattens a bit as the day goes on. For day 2 (and sometimes 3), I just spritz with water in the morning to dampen, scrunch a couple times, then scrunch out the cast after it's dry. \n\nLately I've been more into mousse more than gel. Gel gave me more definition, but mousse has given me more consistent results. Plus it's easier to sleep in the cast set by mousse than gel 🤭 the amount of mousse I use is probably a lot but it works surprisingly well",
