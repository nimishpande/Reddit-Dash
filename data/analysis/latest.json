      "content": "I’ve been using the Dot &amp; Key Vitamin C + SPF 50 sunscreen for a month straight. I bought it after seeing all the ads and I regretted it for a sec much since everyone bashed it but honestly, here is my hot take based just on my experience: \n\nPros: Leaves no white cast on my face. I layer it with a Serum, Moisturizer and then sunscreen but it hardly feels oily (maybe cuz I have dull skin). The texture feels good on the skin and mixes well. Feels very light. I hate the feeling of being plastered when I apply sunscreen so this felt good for a change.\n\nCons: Everyone keeps saying the SPF protection is not as good. I personally didn’t feel that way, since my face didn’t get any darker. It did give it a subtle suppleness, and i am getting no unwanted tan yet either. \n\nI think i’m gonna stick with it irrespective of what i might hear, if something works for you- it works! It is what it is. \n",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

A lot of people see a dude with a horseshoe and say \"Shave that already!\" and in some cases they might be right. But I’m starting to think the popularity of that advice has less to do with hair and more to do with how we dress now.  \n  \nIt used to be the case that if you were in your 30s during the 1950s and going bald, you were most likely already wearing a suit and dress shoes. Nowadays however you'd probably find yourself in a band tee and a pair of Nikes. It seems to me that this is what creates a weird visual mismatch — less “aging naturally” and more “overgrown man-child\", leading people to adopt the cue ball look to maintain some form of \"youthfulness\", if you could even call it that.  \n  \nDo you think the modern shaved-head trend is really about hair… or is it about the clash between baldness and casual, youthful looks?",

The photos may help you tell me what you think about my curl type and porosity.\n\nI’m EU-based, so not every US product is easy to get, but I can order online if something is really worth it. Still, I’d love suggestions I can actually find here too.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n- Help understanding my porosity\n- A simple routine suggestion\n- Recommendations for a good leave-in and curl cream (priority!)\n- Any other product ideas that could help with dryness/frizz\n\nWhat I currently use:\n\nMielle Rosemary Mint (as a clarifying once every one to 2 weeks) + Aussie Miracle Moist shampoos, Aussie deep hydration conditioner, Lush Super Milk (Leave in spray), Garnier Banana Hair Food (kinda as a leave in/curl cream), ECO Gel, some oils (Amla, Castor), and Aussie heat protectant before diffusing.\n\nWhat I want to try next:\n\nThinking of buying the SheaMoisture Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Mask for deep hydration. If you’ve used it on hair like mine, please tell me if it’s worth it!\n\nMy main issues: very dry, frizzy, moisture-sucking curls that don’t hold definition well.\n\nThank you so much for any help 💛\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I’m not sure of my curl type and porosity and I need help building a routine.

It could be ingrown hairs, razor bumps, shaving irritation, pigmentation, or marks left from old acne. The area feels like it has a lot of tiny clogged pores or trapped hair roots. I want to understand what this condition actually is so I can fix it properly. If anyone has had something similar or knows what this might be, please tell me.

It feels like i am always fighting my hair to be up when naturally it just wants to be down. For example it just starts bending and curling in annoying ways. You can see a couple of photos of how this looks on a good day. It also feels like I am not quite using the right products (normally i use sea salt spray + clay + a drop of hair oil).\n\nAlternatively I also like the messy look when its down but It almost feels like my hair is quite unbalanced like this and there is too much weight on the back. I guess i am thinking like britpop-mop style thing. There are some pictures here after shampoo + conditioner with no product, lightly blowdried.\n\nWhat style do you think I should go with and what therefore do you think I should ask the barber / hairdresser? I was planning on making a trip tomorrow to tidy up my haircut. Do you think I need to change styling products?\n\nI have attached also some pictures of example hairstyles that I think might suit me though some I would probably have to grow it out.\n\nThank you for the help and sorry for the long post!",

I’ve been trying to focus on my curls for the last 5 months it seems and it’s definitely gotten better, but this is a stage I’m stuck in now where it’s curly but also oddly thin? I’m very new at this so I’m not even sure what type of hair I have in terms of curl pattern. Is there a different haircut that I could maybe try? I feel a little meh about the whole thinning/thin thing because my hair i hold very near and dear to my heart. I included photos of my hair in 2023 because I feel like it was much thicker then. I did not use any products at the time nor was I focused on hair care like that sadly. \n\nI was overexercising for a hot second there (about 3-4 months) without proper nutrition which is when I noticed a ton of shedding/loss. I’ve been eating normally and back on track for about 7 months now. I put my routine below in order of how I do it! The photos I have here I blow dried with an adapter because of the cold weather,  which I don’t typically do. I usually let it air dry after I put the products in. I appreciate any and all advice 🫶🏻 \n\nshampoo/conditioner: dove intensive repair \nleave in: next of us low porosity leave-in conditioner \nmousse: not your mothers activating curl talk \ngel: curls blueberry bliss curl control jelly \n(Sometimes I alternate the gel and mousse) \n",

I would love your help/opinions on what you suggest she changes in her current routine and I'll purchase the recommendations as a physical present- along with the new routine guidance!\n\nHer routine now is just at night, because mornings are a little hectic to sneak in a routine. Her current routine has her face showing redness- and she has the goal of going makeup-free more often which the redness stops her from doing. Plus she thinks the routine could just be better.\n\nHer current routine (see list or the meme):  \n\\- Neutrogena oil free acne wash  \n\\- PCA skin hydrating toner  \n\\- Timeless 20% vitamin c ferulic acid vitamin e  \n\\- cos de baha AZ serum  \n\\- neutrogena hydro boost water cream+ lotion\n\nOne catch is that she's currently breastfeeding our 6 month old- so whatever routine needs to be breastfeeding friendly.\n\nAny insight would be helpful! There's a million routines online and I can't tell which are just marketing slop or which are useful / any better than her current one. I'm seeing retinol as a suggestion but also seeing lots of backlash to it too.",

I have decided I won't be ever using it again. \n\nI've been off fin for about 7 months and during that time i thought i was basically out of options and have pretty much just been trying to enjoy the time i have with the hair I have left while mentally preparing for shaving. \n\nAll the recent talk of PP405 and Breezula etc got me a bit excited and i realised that while we have no idea whether something promising will come out soon, it could actually be really beneficial for me to try and hold on as best i can for a couple of years. \n\nThe past few days i've been looking into drugs like Breezula which lead me into looking at RU58841 which lead me to look at other topical anti androgens on the market. \n\nFluridil seems like a really promising option that i could look into. I'm not even suggesting that it needs to be a replacement for fin, but since fin isn't an option to me, it looks like something definitely worth trying. \n\nHow come meds like this aren't talked about more? Do you think it's worth trying? it sounds like the safety profile is really good, even if the effects aren't super strong. The only negative is the price. I'm in the UK and it looks like i'll have to buy it from Germany and it works out to about £55 for a months supply. \n\nJust wanted to know your thoughts on if it's worth it, whether you've used it before, any tips, advice on where to get it, how to apply it etc. \n\nCheers!\n\n",

      "title": "[Hair Removal] [B+A] 3 month progress with chronic ingrowns and scarring from them + what I’ve done differently",
      "content": "People brought up my legs a lot. I was embarrassed to wear shorts or swimsuits. My mom had the same problem and used laser hair removal (which is what my derm recommended), but it was out of budget for me. She also still struggles with ingrowns and the scars that follow, so I told her what I’ve been doing, and she’s also had success with it. People have even pointed out how much better my legs look recently. Here’s what I’ve been doing if anyone else has this problem and looking for potential solutions:\n\nDISCLAIMER: I would not use a lot of the products I’m going to mention around the vulva. If you struggle with ingrowns and irritation when shaving down there, I would talk to your doctor about an effective strategy that is safe for that area. \n\n- I stopped picking at them. This is the BIGGEST tip. I know everyone says this, and it’s definitely a lot easier said than done, but it’s given my skin time to heal and prevented further infections/scarring. Instead of picking, find a drawing salve. Apply a generous amount to the ingrown and cover with a bandaid. Repeat daily until the ingrown is pulled out. Be warned: it has a very…odd smell. \n\n- In the beginning, I only shaved once a week. I now shave twice a week. I think that, with time, I’ll be able to shave more frequently, but I’m taking my time to be sure my skin heals, which means I’m not trying to “overdo” anything in the interim. \n\n- I made the switch to a single blade safety razor. A lot of multi blade razors actually cut the hair shorter than the skins surface. The safety razor is very sharp, and the design allows the hair to be cut at the skins surface while still delivering a smooth, close shave. I change the blade regularly (every couple shaves) and don’t store it in the shower. It has also saved me a lot of money, which is a nice bonus. It definitely takes some getting used to. TAKE YOUR TIME WITH IT!!! Don’t not try to do a quick shave with it. I snagged my ankle twice before I learned that lesson. \n\n- I use a kessa exfoliating mitt the day before I shave. I also use laundry sanitizer for it and washcloths to prevent bacterial growth as much as possible. It’s pretty aggressive, so I don’t use it more than once or twice a week. If I shaved more frequently, I still don’t think I would use it more than I am now. I use a chemically exfoliating body wash daily (which I elaborate on further in the next section) to prevent unnecessary irritation to the skin. \n\n- Hibiclens!!! I wash my legs with it twice before shaving and allow it to sit for a bit. Has helped prevent razor burn and ingrowns. It’s also super cheap. I also switched to a glycolic + lactic acid body wash that I use every shower, which has helped tremendously with skin roughness and bumpiness (exfoliation and moisturizing is the name of the game for people who struggle with ingrowns bc it’s caused by the hair getting trapped under the skin; this is a big reason my mother and I struggle so much with it bc we both have kp).\n\n- the ultra gentle Billie shave cream is my fav. You need something that provides a lot of cushion and moisture. Aveno also has a lovely shave cream if you’re looking for a cheaper option.  \n\n-  I’ve tried moisturizers for KP, but they irritated my skin. The lotions would also pill up if there was any sort of friction, even just from tighter pants. I couldn’t even itch a bug bite! Because of this, I took a different approach. After I shower most days, I use a lotion with retinol. I’ve found it has helped with my skins texture but also has helped some with scarring. On mornings and days where I shave, I use vanicream (I also love it for my face). Fragrance free, very moisturizing, non-irritating. Also, note that I said mornings! It helps a lot to keep your skin regularly moisturized so the hair has an easier time passing the skin. \n",

      "content": "Hi, I’m posting here because I honestly couldn’t find any other suitable Indian subreddit to talk about this and I was hoping to hear from people who may have experienced something similar.\n\nI have a noticeable facial asymmetry that becomes very obvious when I smile. The right side of my smile stretches more and looks looser, while the left side feels more stiff in comparison. I’ve also noticed that:\n\n- My right eye squints more when I smile\n- There is a bit more skin fold under my right eye than the left\n\nAt rest my face looks mostly fine, but when I smile, especially in back camera photos, my face starts to look  deformed or uneven, which somewhere affect my confidence.\n\nI just wanted to ask:\n\n- Has anyone else dealt with something like this?\n- Did it get better or worse over time?\n- Did anything help  exercises, habits, posture changes, dentist visit, physio, etc.?\n\nI don’t have any history of facial injury or surgery. I’m mainly looking for shared experiences and practical advice.\n\nThank you to anyone who takes the time to reply 🤍",

All of my teen years until about start of 22 where my face finally started to give way and clear up. I enjoyed pretty decent skin for almost two years and suddenly, since my last period, I’m getting random cystic acne. Not in a cluster- one painful bump at a time, accompanied by nothing else. EVERYTIME I treat one and it starts to go down, boom. A new one over night. The first two were on my chin, then next to my eye, and this morning the side of my nose. It’s almost time for my next period.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I use Cerave acne face wash, Paula’s choice toner, a benzoyl peroxide mix I got from a derm, and pimple patches. My face has combination skin so I only use youth people kale moisturizer as needed. Lately to treat the cysts, I have been applying a warm compress of camomile tea bag and it really helps them go down within a few days, so I can get rid of them- BUT THEY KEEP REPLACING THEMSELVES. What’s going on, this wasn’t a previous issue, is it maybe an imbalance? Anyone else go thru this? Anything helps 😞‼️\n\n",
