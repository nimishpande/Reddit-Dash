      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

It feels like every product I put on it is too heavy but also somehow drying.\n\nMy current routine (which I am not happy with) is Kristen Ess the gentle one shampoo and conditioner,  then I apply the wow dream coat and Miss Jessie’s gel to my soaking wet hair and I brush it through with a wide tooth comb. I then split it into two sections and my bangs and I apply not your mothers gel. I finger coil the pieces around my face and by my neck. I spray it with Sebastian shaper + hairspray then once it’s dry is scrunch out the crunch with Moroccan oil.\n\nMy hair usually looks ok on day one but there’s no conceivable way for me to get to a day 2 without refreshing in some way. My hair has no “longevity” if that makes sense. If I lean on it the wrong way my curl pattern just turns into frizz. I can’t diffuse it at all. I’ve tried so many different ways and it destroys my curl pattern and creates a very high level of frizz. My hair gets frizzy so easily and it kind of defaults to the texture of cotton candy. I’ve tried so so many products. All of the curly products that are moisturizing make my hair feel like straw and it impacts my curl pattern. \n\nDoes anyone have tips.

      "content": "Hey everyone,\nThought I’d share my 4200-graft HT journey since this sub helped me so much when I was deciding what to do.\n\nI’d been thinning pretty fast in my late 20s. My hairline was almost gone and the mid-scalp wasn’t looking great either. After months of lurking here and stalking results, I ended up going with Dr. Heena Kudyar. A few people here had mentioned her, and I liked how natural her hairline designs looked.\n\n\nConsultation:\nSuper straightforward. She checked my donor, talked honestly about what could/couldn’t be fixed, and suggested around 4200 grafts to rebuild the hairline + add density through the front and mid-scalp. No pressure, no sales pitch.\n\n\nSurgery day:\nLong day but surprisingly chill. They drew the hairline (looked way better than anything I’d tried imagining myself), numbed me up, and the extraction/implantation was smooth. I was awake the whole time and the team kept checking if I was comfortable.\n\n\nRecovery:\nFirst two weeks were the usual paranoia: “Did I sleep wrong? Did I knock a graft out? Why do I look like I got head-butted by a goat?”\nBut everything healed normally.\nResults:\n\n\nMonths 3–4: sprouts\nMonths 5–6: big jump\nBy month 9, honestly… I couldn’t believe it.\n\nMy hairline looks natural, density is way better than I expected, and people who hadn’t seen me in a while literally thought I just “changed my hairstyle.”\nZero regrets.\n\nPosting because I know how scary it is to commit to 4k+ grafts. If you’re on the fence, I get it. Feel free to ask anything—happy to help someone the way this sub helped me.",

It was only the helpful pharmacist and my further research which made me realise the potential impacts of doxycycline.\n\nSo my questions are: What kind of acne is this? What over the counter products can I buy that may help &amp; how to use them? Is doxycycline worth taking for my acne?\n\nThanks everyone for your help",

She quickly prescribed me 100mg of spironolactone which was a nightmare. I was on my period for 2 months straight and felt like I was going crazy. She then tried to give me tretinoin, the lowest dosage, but my face just couldn’t tolerate it no matter how slow I went.\n\nI stopped seeing her and starting playing around with otc actives + laser treatments which was probably a mistake. Now my skin barrier is fucked so I’m back to cleanser, moisturize, and sunblock. \n\nI drink tons of water, I try to eat healthy, I try to physically be healthy. I wash my face at night with lukewarm water. I wear sunblock everyday. What else should I even be doing ????\n\nFor reference, my skin type is oily acne prone.

In hindsight should have bought 40 vol too and mixed it with the 20 I guess :/)\nAnyway. I did this on virgin hair.\nCan't see the colour, didnt lift much. Unless I stand directly under a potlight. I can tell it was the right shade though but it just didnt lift much of the natural black colour and deposited dye to dark hair so you cant see it. Even in daytime have to look very hard or at certain angles but barely.\nI 100% want to avoid bleach bc I know it'll end up touching my skin and burning me, that's why I did this process but didn't know I only had one shot at it, if that's the case, bc hair isn't virgin anymore. Not that the instructions said virgin hair is needed it just said use on naturally dark hair but didn't say anything about whether it'll work on previously dyed hair or not. Like naturally dark hair that has already been dyed. \n\nI got 40vol developer now. \n\nQuestions:\n1. Can it work if I try to redo the process with stronger developer or is it not going to work bc the hair is no longer virgin? Like what does naturally dark mean, natural=virgin or simply referring to the natural base colour it'll work for regardless of dye?\n2. What if I use anti-dye? Does that help return hair closer to \"virgin\" hair? Is this something I should do? \n3. Will it help to wait a month like wait a few washes for the dye to fade out a bit? \n\nThanks for your help guys! \n",

      "content": "I recently discovered I had wavy hair after being one of those poofy straight hair people my whole life. Basic rundown on my hair, it is quite wavy after being freshly washed, but if it air dries (which I usually do) it turns poofy straight with a few bends here and there. It's pretty low porosity with fine strands (asian hair). Like I said, after watching a few TikToks I realized my hair might actually be wavy, so I've been trying to bring out the waves rather than brushing it out.\n\nSince I'm not exactly sure how wavy my hair is yet, I haven't bought styling products yet because I'm still doing my research. So for now, I've just been using leave in conditioner (Moroccan Oil brand), squeezing a bit of that into my hands, and then scrunching up my hair. The thing is, when I do that (or when my hair is scrunched even with no product), my hair makes really nice wavy little curl casts and it actually looks good (and like the tutorials I've been using show). However, as my hair dries, it starts straightening out and losing the cast and I just end up with either the bendy straight hair again or some weird half wave situation. I tried diffusing, same thing happened.\n\nThe weird thing is, when I style my hair with a wavy hair routine, it ends up straight but not poofy like it does when I don't style it.\n\nI'm super confused right now and I need some advice on how to get my waves to hold as they dry.\n\n  \n",

Lately I have severly disliked my hair and have not wanted to go outside because of it. I do not like my face, body, or anything like that and my hair seems like something maybe fix.  My routine is pretty basic, I just go into the shower, get it wet, comb it, and sometimes use a shampoo. The shampoo is Shea moisture curl shampoo.  I then kinda just try to keep out of my face and stuff and scrunch it. I don't use products because I don't know how and also I can't afford. I don't like how the top looks. It just looks like an A shape sometimes and I don't like that. I just want my hair to look clean and elegant, but also on the longer side.  I want to cut it shorter, and like my bangs, but also it is super frizzy.  How do I fix that and what to I do.  I feel super embarassed posting this so please be nice and Ill be happy to answer any questions if I'm unclear or picture is bad.",
