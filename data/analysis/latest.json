Yeah so Tretinoin really does work if used according to your skins needs. (If you want to ask about peeling, then yes it peeled for first one year and now also it peels but significantly low peeling, and strangely the peeling kinda reduced when I jumped from 0.05% to 0.1%, so yeah it might take different durations for your skin to adapt to the peeling). If you have acne like me just know that tret can fix this, you just gotta trust the process.",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

My curl pattern used to be tighter before i decided to blow it out for the past decade.\n\nRoutine:\n\nShampoo 2x- Dove Dryness and Itch Relief \n\nMask- Not Your Mother’s bond building Curl Talk\n\nConditioner- DevaCurl One Condition\n\nCurl Creams- DevaCurl styling cream and Oribe Curl Control silkening cream\n\nPraying hands with cream, shook my hair to create clumps and gently scrunched, plopped go like 30 minutes, air dried for another hour and finished with the defuser.\n\nIt’s the best it’s ever looked and I’m nervous to go to bed because a bonnet always falls off, I have three different ones an elastic band, elastic tie, and a stiffer satin tie. I’ve also tried wrapping my hair in a scarf and that also falls off.\n\nPineappling also flattens my hair, I’ve tried with loose satin scrunchies too within a bonnet and it doesn’t stay. All the bonnets and hair wraps are either too loose or if they’re actually gonna stay on my head I have to tie them so tight that it hurts my head and I can’t sleep. I’m also a restless sleeper.\n\nI feel like my curls will disappear if I just breathe the wrong way, any advice to maintain my hair would be so much appreciated!!!",

      "content": "Natural ingredients aren’t bad. They never were. The problem started when “natural” began to be used as a marketing method to quietly position “chemical” as something harmful.\n\nOver the last few years, “Natural” stopped being a description and became a value judgment. It began to mean safer or better, while “chemical” was framed as harsh or artificial. \n\nThat contrast sold products, but it also created a false divide\n\nIn reality:\n\n• Even plant-based ingredients go through extraction, purification, stabilisation, and preservation. \n\n• Without this, they wouldn’t survive storage, transport, heat, humidity, or daily use, especially in warmer climates.\n\n• Some people do well with mostly plant-based formulations. Others need lab-refined actives when dealing with concerns like acne, pigmentation, barrier damage, or ageing.\n\n• Often, “chemical” ingredients simply help speed up or target a process that would take much longer otherwise.\n\n• What often gets missed is that many ingredients people trust today are still labelled “chemical,” even though they’re derived from nature.\n\n• Retinol is derived from vitamin A. It’s refined to work faster and more effectively than its natural forms. \n\nIt comes with guidelines (like using sunscreen everyday) not because it’s harmful, but because it’s powerful. Chemicals need more understanding, not fear.\n\nSkincare doesn’t fail because ingredients are chemical. It fails when ingredients are poorly formulated, or marketed through fear instead of outcomes.\n\nCurious, how do you decide what works for your skin – ingredient labels or actual results?",

      "content": "Hi everyone! Photos show my hair now air dried and not styled, brushed, and then back when my hair was shorter (also air dried). \n\nI’m kind of at a loss, I’ve always had \\*some\\* type of wave in my hair, but I’ve never figured out a proper routine. I have quite fine, soft hair, but a lot of it. My issue is, when my hair is short, the waves do come out way more. When my hair is long, it’s almost as though it’s too heavy to hold the waves properly anymore? And no matter the length, it always gets much more intense waves with the baby hairs/face framing pieces around my temple. I’ve tried many a routine with types of shower products, gels, mousses, salt sprays… but everyone seems to just weigh my hair down and it still dries in the weird half hearted wave. If I blow dry it, it’s momentarily straight, but then still shrivels up into what the photos show in like an hour. Any advice is appreciated! \n\nRoutine at the moment: wash my hair 3ish times a week with Pantene pro volume shampoo and conditioner, once every couple weeks using garnier’s hair filler system instead (it does seem a little wavier when I do this). Using revlon heat protectant spray, blow dry and style only my curtain bangs. Then, either blow or air dry (with heat protectant) the rest of my hair. Once 99% dry, throw in a loose French braid and let dry fully. Use dry shampoo and wash bangs in the sink in between. Usually loosely braid hair to sleep, however I suffer from bad migraines and can’t have my hair up all the time sleeping (it’ll trigger one) ",

I use masks, conditioners, apply oil pre and post shower, I use good shampoos, I use good products, and yet my hair still looks like an undefined, frizzy mess.\n\nFor context: I (think I) have wavy hair, which is very thick (and I mean very!!!). It's always dry and puffy when I brush (I only brush with wide toothed combs, and just messy and everywhere when I dont. Its vaguely wavy but wavy in random directions, if you get what I mean. Some parts are straight, others have a slight bend, and others are downright curly. Its so confusing!!!! I don't know my hair's porosity, and im sure that matters. It goes from soaking wet to damp quickly then takes decades to go from damp to fully dry (only slightly an exaggeration). It feels coarse and gritty. I used to have some parts bleached but I cut those off and only the tips remain slightly fried. I don't use heat that much and when I do i use heat protectant. \n\nSorry if this is messy, I genuinely dont know what to do. I can't get obscure, specific products because they arent accessible from where I live, so if possible don't suggest such a thing. I don't want a miracle product, I want the idea of a miracle product (vague statement, but basically I want the description of what good products would be for me so I can find matching ones).\n\nPlease help. Im really ugly so my hair is my last chance to look good (only slightly an exaggeration).",
