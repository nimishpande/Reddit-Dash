      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Sorry, long rant I’m just feeling sorry for myself.\n\nI had been seeing the same stylist for about 10 years and she always gave me a good cut. I went regularly every 3 months. COVID came along and I didn’t get a haircut for about 2 years, just trimming it myself. I finally went back in 2021. That first post-COVID cut was the best. I restarted my every 3 month schedule. The next 5 cuts were horrendous, each one worse than the last. Unwanted short layers that spring up leaving the look of a bowl cut with awkward length in the back that looked like a mullet. After the 5th non-consensual mullet I decided I had enough with that long time stylist and needed a break. \n\nI spent the next year growing out the terrible layers and trimmed it myself to minimize the mullet effect while the top layers grew out. I finally screwed up enough courage to seek out a new stylist after a full year of growing it out. I researched all of the stylists in my area who do curly hair. I finally found one that was highly rated by fellow curlies and booked an appointment. I told her all of my trauma and what looks bad on me: short layers. What does she do? Give me a cut with short layers and my hair overall too short. I’m coming up on the 1 year anniversary of that last cut, I’ve been trimming it myself again while trying to even out the layers. It’s still shorter than I’d like due to the layers.\n\nI’m scared to even get back in the chair now.\n\nI get it, when the hair is uneven you need to take off more to even it out, but how do I get it through to stylists that I absolutely do not want layers? They just wind up looking horrible.\n\nRoutine: daily wash and conditioner with Pantene (I don’t care this is what works best for my hair)",

I pineapple and wear a bonnet but still wake up with crazy curls in the morning that I have to \"relax\" and redefine. I'm pretty sure I have 2C/3A hair? It varies lol\n\nHere's my typical routine when I style: \n\n1. Wet hair, brush through with a wet brush and bounce curl conditioner\n2. Rinse\n3. Follow with leave in conditioner (ends only)\n4. Head flipped over I coat and rake finger through with bounce curl defining creme\n5. Section and use bounce curl defining brush, and scrunching. \n6. Follow with Curlsmith gel 8 hold (I add a bit of water), coat and scrunch with prayer hands. \n7. Air dry without touching\n8. If crunchy I usually break the cast with bonding oil by olaplex. \n\nAdvice? ",

Consistenly, without any breaks, maybe missing 2-4 days through this whole period.\n My hair before starting was reaally thick and curly but I had widow peaks that were getting bigger.\n After 10 months of usage, my hair is still shedding everyday with more than appx. 70 hairs on my pillow every morning (terifying). Hair has just became a lot thinner. My widow peaks are somewhat the same, with tiny hairs popping out, but overall the density is just getting worse, especially on the top and middle. \nI have tested my DHT levels and I have very low DHT levels with a normal to high TEST levels, also don't have any other blood issues that could cause hairloss. I have seen a lot of black, dog like hairs on my head in past few months, now a lot less.. I am not really sure what to do, I really liked my thick hair and could probably have hidden my peaks by a different hairstyle, but now can't really do anything.\n I'm not depressed by this anymore, just fairly dissapointed.. \nMy question is, how often does dutasteride make a difference in people's cases and HOW should i implement it? Do i put it in a weekly rotation in the beginning? Any advice would be helpful.",

What's your hair texture? :-)\n\n\\--\n\nI know everyone swears by applying stylers (gels, creams, etc.) on soaking wet hair, but this past wash day I tried styling on truly damp hair... wow! My hair looks and feels so much better.\n\nFor context, I have very coarse, dense, wiry, chronically dry hair and I've never really been able to get a gel cast when styling on soaking wet hair. I think the extra water might be diluting my products too much. Normally, I gently squeeze out excess water with a damp t-shirt after styling, but this time I went further: I used a microfiber towel to really absorb the excess water before I styled and didn't re-wet my hair at all during the process.\n\nSome sections were starting to dry out by the time I got to them, so instead of adding water, I just added a bit more product. The result? My hair feels moisturized, defined, and I finally got a cast! I'm realizing I may have been under-moisturizing all along. I always follow the advice of YouTubers with fine or medium hair who use lighter products, but my hair clearly needs more moisture. Lesson learned, lol. Do what feels better to you!\n\nMy routine: \n\n* Shampoo, switch between a few: Ouidad VitalCurl Clear &amp; Gentle, Amika Hydro Rush, Ouai Detox\n* Conditioner: Redken All Soft Mega Curls, Ouidad VitalCurl Balancing\n* Stylers\n   * Fenty Home Curl Cream (LOVE!!!!) or Rizos Curls Defining Cream\n   * Ouidad Heat &amp; Humidity Gel (red bottle) or AG Care Liquid Effects Gel\n   * Sometimes I use a mousse: AG Care Mousse Gel, but the added grit makes my hair feel like straw lol. The volume is nice though!",

Between the wind and humidity you can see how that turned out. \n#3 &amp; 4 is post wash using Mielle (not for my hair type but so far it’s about the only thing that doesn’t leave my hair tangled and feeling dry) and then Briogeo superfoods mask, I rinsed most of it out but not all. While it was wet I added some garnier curl sculpt gel and plopped it in a t shirt for about 30 minutes, then scrunched in some NYM’s curl cream and let it air dry\n#5 is the next day after adding some NYM’s curl refresh foam and vegamour hydr-8 oil \n#6 is my hair a year ago. Still not its best but much more manageable. \n\nI don’t use heat tools on my hair or color it, but it obviously has quite a bit of sun bleaching going on. I had dark blonde hair until my mid twenties so that may be why it lightens so easily in the sun. My hair started thinning back in 2020 so I have less than half the amount of hair that I used to which doesn’t help. I have pretty fine hair with low porosity. When it’s healthy I get cute little ringlets, but even in its current state I get them without doing anything. I just don’t know how to encourage them lol I know my hair needs a pretty big chop but I haven’t worked up the nerve to do it yet so I trim every few months and snip off split ends as I find them. I am open to any and all advice. I just want to have pretty hair again. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone, spent a little time on this sub but never posted here before. As a lot of people know, Pelage recently raised $120M in Series B funding. There's been a couple posts regarding this, but I don't think anyone's really discussed the significance. \n\n$120M is a very large amount for Series B in general, even for capital intensive businesses like biotech. Just for reference, OpenAI raised between $100M Series B, and the company for VDPHL01 raised $75M. $$$ doesn't directly = success, and venture investing is betting on a lottery winner out of a bunch of lemons. But from a valuation perspective, and especially in biotech, the dollar commitment is a reflection of the investor's probability of success, after looking through trial data, etc. \n\nPelage hasn't released much information to the public, except for the one or two cherry-picked statistical points everyone keeps speculating on, but investors would demand and have access to the full data. **Basically all this hints the 2A trials look really, really good, beyond what we've been given.** \n\nFurthermore, Pelage has one product in their pipeline, and it's a cosmetic treatment, a sector of pharmaceuticals that sits lowest in terms of demand and priority. So from that angle, $120M means even more, because it means investors see potentially large future returns on a consumer discretionary basis. \n\nAlso by now, Pelage and PP-405 has been covered by many media sources, not just by shoddy hair treatment or clinical news sites. In itself, this doesn't mean much, but it makes me cringe when people compare it to shoddy third-world products like GT20029, Kintor, etc and make the comments about \"5 more years\". Pelage is private and hasn't released a valuation, but if I had to make an educated, conservative guess based on the Series B and everything I've seen, I'd estimate in low billions as is now.\n\nJust for reference, I don't have any medical background, and don't have any experience with the biotech or pharmaceutical industries, and everything here is just my personal opinion, but I do work on Wall Street as an investor. Personal background is ivy league to investment banking to private equity, and I currently work at a large hedge fund in credit. The shop I work at has a venture and biotech sleeve, and I have spoken to a couple people there about Pelage out of personal curiosity, and from what I've gathered, it's not their focus but they've heard about Pelage before. Word is it's not so easy to get a meeting there, and they're oversubscribed in funding as is. \n\n**None of this means the product will be a success**, because that's based on science and biology, but from a financials perspective, all the noise points towards something good.

      "title": "is my hair suited for layers?",
      "content": "My hair is struggling to curl. It only curls at the ends, and i feel like for the most part it's because my haircut has no layers (i only have face framing pieces).\n\nHere's my issue : last time i went to the hairstylist (first pic is the most recent, 2 months after i went there), she refused to give me layers and told me my hair was too thin for that. Individual strands are indeed thin (would the right term be fine hair?) but i feel like my hair is still a bit dense, and with a blunt cut, i kinda look like a cocker dog. \nIs she right, or just lying to me cuz she wouldn't know how to style it?\n\nThen, she proceeded to cut it as straight as she could and for a few weeks even my ends stopped being curly.. She once tried a curl \"routine\" on my hair but just dried it, brushed it and then added a curl cream. The detangling part was really rough too. It obviously looked terrible.\n\nHere's my routine and what i know about my hair :\n- honestly any shampoo, sometimes a sulfate free one. doesn't seem to change a thing\n- sometimes garnier banana hair mask/cocoa butter\n- garnier avocado conditioner or energie fruit coco conditioner\nI add a very small amount of banana hair mask as a leave in after every wash. I make sure my hair is not stuck to my roots and i scrunch properly. When i refresh, i spray water mixed with my leave in. I wash every 4 to 5 days, and these days i sleep in a braid since my hair won't curl correctly anyway.\n\nI don't use a gel because i don't like how it feels; it's hard to remove the crunch and i mess it up most of the time. It looks better when i stop at the leave in.\nI just stick to drugstore products because i'm tired of buying stuff that doesn't seem to do anything.\n\nI think my hair is low porosity and it seems to be straight at the roots. I don't think it's a routine issue, it's just how my hair is supposed to be. It looks wavy overall but i can see small curls pretty much everywhere and if that matters, it's even curlier around the neck/ears. That's why i'm wondering if it could look curlier.\n\nShould i search for another hairstylist or should i stick with this hairstyle?

      "content": "Hi all. So in July this year I decided to get extensions. I have always had pretty dense and naturally thick hair that’s curly. I always would get compliments on how thick my hair was but since I use heat on it it’s hard to grow it in length.\n\nI decided to get extensions because I had gone through a pretty shitty period (health related) and I wanted to treat myself. I got weft extensions and about 180g in 3 rows (I needed the weight to match my natural fullness).\n\nFirst time I got them done it all went fine and u grew them out perfectly. Second time I got them done it feels off…\n\nI don’t remember too well but I think they might have been pulled too tight? Either way as the weeks passed i noticed the beads were falling out or slipping. My bottom weft eventually was hanging on by one single bead so I went in to ask if they could fix it.\n\nUpon looking at my hair the lady was surprised to see two bald spots where they do the little bead things… She got her colleague and they pretty much told me it looks like alopecia bc it’s white smooth patches and that might have been why my beads were falling out or slipping.\n\nThey reattached it for me for free. They put it higher up to remove stress from the area. They also said that I should call them if I notice any beads being loose again.\n\nI am quite shocked and I am just wondering… is this really the problem of my hair or did they possible sew them too tight?\n\nI am now at home with the row placed a bit higher and I this time for certain notice a bit of pain. None of the 3 times that I’ve visited so far have I had the same person helping me but that’s my own fault for not requesting it..\n\nAs I said my hair is naturally very thick and I don’t have any issues with thinning normally. I am having a full reinstall done in a week and a half and we will see what it looks like then.\n\nOn this photo you can see the spots and I think it looks like they maybe were done too tight and it ended up pulling? I don’t know.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Was it improper installment or is it just my hair not being able to handle the extensions. When I was little I would always have braids (I’m mixed) and I never experienced balding from that.\n\nI will also be seeing a dermatologist soon… I am just not sure on what to do since I love the extensions and idk if I should go elsewhere since maybe they are just doing it too tight.\n\nPic one is now that they reattached it and pic two are the bald spots.

I used the bounce define brush today😕\n\n\nI did just get a shag type haircut a week ago, the layers are a bit on the short side i know but it revealed how unmanageable the bottom layer of hair is.
