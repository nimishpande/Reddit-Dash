Apply GENEROUS amounts of curling cream after every wash when still wet. Style by sectioning into small strands and detangle each separately by pulling between fingers until it runs smooth. Takes about 20 minutes. Air dry and never diffuse. Scrunch once dry.  \n\n\nMaintenance: Sleep with a bonnet. Loosely tie with a silk or fuzzy crunchy under the bonnet. Retie or style in the morning as needed with wetted hands. Trim ends every four months to keep curls healthy, hair doesn‚Äôt curl as nicely with damaged ends.  \n\n\nProducts: OGX argan oil of morocco shampoo and conditioner. Marc Anthony coconut and shea curling cream.  \n\n\nPictures taken at end of each day",

I worked last night (yay night shift) so my husband and mom got her ready for school. However, we all struggle with her hair. \n\nShe has long curly hair. When wet, it‚Äôs to her waist. Dry, probably mid back. We are okay with her having it long because she lets us brush and style it. We just suck at it.\n\nThe sections around her forehead are very short and frizzy regardless of what we try. \n\nRight now this is what we do. Bath twice a week using shea moisture shampoo and conditioner. When she gets out we put in leave in shea moisture leave in conditioner and brush out with a fine tooth comb due to knots. She‚Äôs a crazy sleeper. Let air dry. We try to keep in a basis at night when she sleeps.\n\nWhen I style her hair I usually just run my fingers through her hair or I‚Äôll take a large brush and a spray bottle and completely wet her hair. My go-to hair styles are down, high pony, half up.\n\nMy husband and mom dry brush her hair (which I ask them not to do). Their go-to hair styles are singular braids.\n\nHere are pics.\n\nI just need advice. Products. Routine. Styling. My daughter is a girly girl who likes taking her time to look nice and we are failing her.\n\nThe front facing pic is from today when she got made fun of. The apple dress picture is air dried. The red dress is slept on hair no braid.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry for yapping so much. Thank you in advance for any advice.

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe‚Ñ¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "# \n\nHey. So I've noticed that my hair has thinned out a lot over the years. I dont have any obvious shedding going on, so this caught me off guard. I've been on anti-hair loss treatments for 14 years so Im not sure what else I can do? Here is my history:\n\n* First 8 years on finasteride 1mg - worked great, until i started shedding heavily one. Lost a lot of ground. Derm told me it was TE, but I was paranoid so I jumped on DUT\n* 6 years on 0.5 mg Dutasteride\n\nI have the worst kind of hair loss - diffuse. So its hard to notice as it progresses.  \nIm not sure what else I can do - Im getting desperate. I know minoxidil exists, but that does not stop hairloss so its useless to me.\n\nAt this point Im considering jumping on RU58841 or spirolactone.  \nOr just throwing in the towel and going for a system.\n\nAny advice?

      "content": "A friend randomly got me a hair mask when returning from a vacation because my hair got overwhelmingly frizzy during moist weather (never had curly/ wavy hair). After giving it a chance and using it twice a week for a month my hair has natural curls... I am wondering which ingredient in here could have made the difference? I am still absolutely astonished this happened, any thoughts?\n\nRegarding my past month's \"routine\": I would wash my hair with a cheap no brand shampoo daily since I work out and have to wash it, and twice a week I'd apply the pink hair mask (pic attached) for 2-3min, then rinse it out, air dry, nothing else applied. I'd appreciate any guidance y'all may have : )\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0z6e61hid9uf1.png?width=675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d06dc67f76b7e5fd79274363e0221ceebea4d80",

This is definitely the longest I‚Äôve ever had it, and I‚Äôm keen to keep growing it out but needing some advice on maintenance, if I should go for a trim to help it grow out better or just stick it out longer then go for a cut.\n\nMy hair is thick, and pretty curly, and although it‚Äôs long now it tends to ‚Äúfro‚Äù out. I shower daily because I work in healthcare but condition only and shampoo maybe once or twice a week.\n\nThen I apply a leave in condition and some sea salt spray and comb it back and either lock it in place with a hat or hair band while it dries. Somedays if I‚Äôm going out, once it dries I apply some hair wax to keep it formed up more but the volume of hair is hard to keep down lol. I hate the feel of gel and stuff that makes your hair hard so that‚Äôs why opt for wax.\n\nDo yall think if I keep growing it out length wise, eventually the length and weight will keep it down more and prevent the ‚Äúfro‚Äùing out ?\n\nAlso to mention, when I did it keep it shorter, it was always shorter on the sides and back with length up top. Which obviously is affecting the way it‚Äôs been growing out. Normally rock it wit a middle party, but thinking about just tryna pull it back like in last pic.\n\nThanks any advice appreciated.\n\nRoutine is Dr Squatch Conditioner\n\nShampoo : Dr squatch and sometimes head and shoulders only shampoo 1-2 a week\n\nOdele Leave in Conditioner\n\nSuavecito Sea Salt Spray when going out and sometimes Suavecito Matte Pomade",

      "content": "Hey guys, I‚Äôm 19 and I‚Äôve been dealing with hair loss for a bit over 2 years now. I first noticed diffuse thinning around February 2023, when I was about 16 and a half (I was born in July). At the beginning it wasn‚Äôt too bad, just some shedding and weaker hair.\n\nIn January 2024 I went to a dermatologist who put me on minoxidil spray (Carexidil, 15 sprays at night). At first it worked amazingly well , my whole hairline came back and density improved a lot. The only weird thing was that the new hairs didn‚Äôt really grow long, but they were dark and clearly visible.\n\nBy October 2024 I started losing all those gains. My temples especially began to thin out again. Around Jan/Feb 2025 I added topical finasteride (Caretopic, 3 sprays a day on temples and midscalp). Honestly, I didn‚Äôt see much improvement. Lately it got even worse, especially in the past couple of months.\n\nNow, October 2025, my situation is much worse than when I started. I‚Äôve definitely been shedding a lot and my temples look drastically thinner. But when I look closely, I can still see tons of tiny, miniaturized hairs on my temples ‚Äì they‚Äôre not gone, just super thin and almost invisible.\n\nSo my question is: as a diffuse thinner, if I start oral finasteride, could it actually help protect those weak hairs from DHT so they can thicken up again with minoxidil? Basically, do I have a real chance of regrowing my temples back to how they were when I first started minoxidil, or at least close?\n\nThanks a lot for any advice.",
