I realize that I've responded very well to the medication and that results may vary. But in 90% of cases, at least the anecdotal ones I've seen, it at least stops the hair loss. \n\nI started to loose my hair at 25-26 and jumped on oral Fin when i was 27\n\nIt's probably the best decision I've ever made, my only regret is not hopping on it sooner \n\nTake this encouragement for whatever it's worth :)\n\nEdit:\nOh, incase anyone was wondering why the before pics are blacked out and the after ones are not, it's because i originally posted these pics on a different forum, and didn't want to get recognized. Nowadays i don't care if someone that knows me sees my Reddit acc. \n\nHere's the link to my original thread. \nhttps://www.hairrestorationnetwork.com/topic/51099-do-i-have-mpb-or-could-it-be-something-else/#comment-598733\n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "\nI’m a 20 year old woman and have struggled with acne since I was about 12. When I was going through puberty I had acne on my forehead just typical puberty acne. In recent years I have struggled with acne on my chin. \n\nThe area around my chin and under my nose is super red. I get small bumps, but also cystic acne. I have some spots and it looks like closed comedones, but I can’t tell what it is. \n\nI have tried everything. Changing toothpaste, diet changes, spent thousands on skincare, anything you can think of really. About 6 months ago I decided to go to my GP. I told her I thought it was perioral dermatitis, she didn’t agree and put me on antibiotics for a week which did absolutely nothing. Then she referred me to a dermatologist. Dermatologist said it was perioral dermatitis after looking at me for literally 2 seconds and put me on 40mg doxycycline plus a topical tacrolimus for 3 months. Honestly it did improve a bit, but once I finished my antibiotics, it came back even worse. A week after I stopped my skin was burning, itching and swelling which also randomly stopped. Additionally, I now have little bumps on my forehead that I haven’t had in years!! Literally last time I had that issue I was 15! It won’t go away either. \n\nHad another dermatologist appointment and she told me she has no idea what to prescribe me after just looking at me for another 3 minutes? She finds it weird it’s only around my mouth area and that it’s so red. Mind you I pay €120 per appointment. Then she put me on another round of antibiotics AGAIN, but this time 4 months. I have to pay for it myself and it is super expensive. I ofcourse want to try everything and I know it is a low dose, but I don’t want to risk destroying my body with the antibiotics.\n\nI personally think it’s a combination of hormonal acne and perioral dermatitis. She said it’s not acne, but I get cysts always around / after ovulation. I know it partly is acne. \n\nAnyway the purpose of my post is asking if anyone went through something similar or has any tips? I feel helpless, because it ruins my self esteem. It’s not even the acne, but my whole mouth / chin area looks so red I can’t look at myself in the mirror. ",

I think that caused the pore right in the middle of my nose to become enlarged, so it fills with sebum and clogs quickly. Then it gets inflamed and turns red. It's sometimes not AS red, but as soon as I start sweating and my pores expand, it gets really red again. Doctor didn't think it looked like skin cancer, so I'm not worried about that thankfully.\n\nI stopped picking/squeezing over a year ago. I'm cleansing twice a day with witch hazel and use colloidal oatmeal moisturizer (which is non-comedogenic, I think). I use a 3.5% glucolic acid face wash a few days a week, and a 10% benzoyl peroxide wash once a week (this is for my perioral dermatitis). I also am using sunscreen daily, and then retinol and a peptide moisturizer a few times a week (that one may be comedogenic). I also just started red light therapy twice a week, but I know that takes a long time to show any results.\n\nAny suggestions on something to add (or subtract) from my routine that will help get this pore to get smaller? Or am I cursed with a big red pore forever? 😭 \n\nThanks everyone!\n\n",

      "content": "Aloha guys!\n\nThis is gonna be long..sorry in advance\n\nI know it’s been said that fragrances are usually not recommended for skincare as it «can» potentially damage skin barrier or apparently weaken it over time, cause irritation, exacerbate inflammation etc.\n\nSo ideally I’d like to use fragrance free products to ease my mind &amp; reduce risk of damage. I mean ideally I’d like to not have to use anything at all &amp; have perfect skin (ahhh don’t we all wish lol)\n\nMy skin type is: combo acne prone sensitive skin oily T zone/ normal cheeks. My breakouts are normally localized in my T zone (forehead/nose/chin) w very few occasional breakouts on cheeks.\n\n8yrs ago, I didn’t have a routine &amp; had to go through the headache of building myself a skincare routine by trying out several different products to see what would work for me.\n\nI tried products from cerave/aveeno/cetaphil/neutrogena &amp; maybe more.\n\nFirst I had tried cleansers formulated w actives such as SA &amp; had found that it caused me irritation. ( idk if it was the strength 2%, fragrance or just my skin not agreeing w SA) After trying a few cleansers for acne skin, I figured out that my skin liked a gentle cleanser w/o actives better &amp; instead preferred an acne treatment in gel form…\n\nThe cleanser that worked for me : Neutrogena ultra gentle foaming cleanser for sensitive skin (yes I had tried their non foaming hydrating cleanser, but felt like it wasn’t washing the extra oils off my face on T zone)\n\nNext was the search for a moisturizer It was a lengthy costly &amp; discouraging process. Most moisturizers claiming to be for sensitive skin or non pore clogging always left my skin feeling either greasy, felt sweaty upon application, felt like butter was sitting on my face or would break me out. After thoroughly investigating online I gave Neutrogena hydro boost water gel a try ( their original formula w fragrance)\n\nIt became my HOLY GRAIL. Immediately felt perfect on my skin. Skin felt hydrated but not greasy &amp; didn’t break me out. I was so happy. I then found my acne treatment which became Neutrogena BP daily gel 2.5%\n\nThis was my routine. I eventually added kora organic Noni oil (which contains tiny traces of essential oils) &amp; this also was my holy grail. It gave my skin the extra moisture it needed to compensate w the harsh BP.\n\nThis was my perfect simple routine for over 7yrs.\n\nWell well well. Idk exactly where I messed up but I believe the downfall of my skin could be due to several factors.\n\nI was on hormonal BC for 1yr. It gave me several ovarian cysts issues so I suspect it’s also why I suffered from some cysts on my face as well. However at the time I didn’t connect the dots so I decided to change my routine &amp; completely switched to cerave. It was alright but not great &amp; I feel overtime I got more cysts.\n\nSkin didn’t feel good so I went back to original routine. Then Neutrogena decided to mess w their formula &amp; I, among many other customers was so dissapointed. Their new « fragrance free» hydro boost gel simply wasn’t the same. I also recently found out they changed their BP gel formula &amp; their ultra gentle cleanser formula as well. So now I’m triple confused on what could be the reason for my skin slowly deteriorating…\n\nI know I am at fault for some of the issues though bc when my skin started breaking out more I did what I shouldn’t have done: I started exfoliating more. I suspect I over exfoliated &amp; stripped my skin barrier which lead to more &amp; more &amp; more breakouts.\n\nSo I’ve been in this vicious cycle for over 2yrs now. Taking intermittent actives breaks &amp; trying to reintroduce w/o success.\n\nMy signs of damaged skin barrier are :\n\nNo irritation Increased oil even on my cheeks Inflammation Deeper more visible lines especially forehead Skin feels dehydrated but oily. Surge of breakouts especially cheeks which was never a problem area before.\n\nMy problem is that everyone is saying that you NEED ceramide, niacinamide, gentle NON foaming cleansers &amp; absolutely no fragrances so heal your skin.\n\nHere’s my dilemma:\n\nThe problem is no other moisturizers/cleansers seem to agree w my skin so idk what to do.\n\nNeutrogena since put their original hydro boost gel formula back on the shelves(I believe bc so many people complained) I’m happy bc my skin still loves it. It still feels great, doesn’t irritate my skin &amp; feels soothing even if it has dye/fragrance.\n\nThat’s where I’m confused &amp; my dilemma. In reality, the product feels great… but in «  theory » is a big no no…my question I guess is can fragrance be ok for some people if they do not cause irritation ? I mean it doesn’t sting burn or break me out… but could it be « hurting» my barrier silently? This is so weird… sometimes I’m skeptical of these claims.\n\nIdk what to replace it with.. I tried CeraVe ultra light moisturizing gel which I was hoping to love bc it’s the most similar to my gel but it feels sticky on my skin once applied &amp; simply doesn’t feel right even though in «theory» it would be a better option for skin repair purposes &amp; skin barrier health… I also tried their peptide night cream &amp; I can see sweat emerging from my pores immediately after application… it’s like none of the «  recommended products » work but all the products that wouldn’t be advised ( aka fragrances &amp; essential oils) feel great 😭😭😭\n\nIdk what to do. I did a 2 mths break from exfo + actives maybe 6 mths ago. I was using my same fragranced moisturizer &amp; kora Noni oil during that «  healing » time . I obv had breakouts &amp; skin felt so oily &amp; congested bc I wasn’t addressing my acne w actives. I then reintroduced my BP slowly &amp; exfoliation as well. I successfully cleared my skin after 2mths but I guess I messed it up again w only 1 too many exfo. One week I did ONE sulfur mask &amp; it completly  wrecked my skin so I had to start another 2mth active break again… now I’m wondering if the reason why my skin got messed up so quick by only 1 use was bc it was never repaired all the way &amp; barrier is weaken..I’m wondering if the fragrances in my moisturizer + oil are preventing my skin barrier from healing all the way. But my problem is I can’t find anything else that feels right other than what I currently use.  Should I just stick with what I use since it feels good on my skin even tho it has «  fragrances » &amp; just listen to my skin ?\n\nDid you guys ever repair your skin using products that contained fragrances or essential oils? I mean they don’t irritate my skin …&amp; everything else I use feels weird on my skin.\n\nAlso I suspect my Eucerin advance hydration 50 spf may be causing some breakouts it’s soooooo greasy anyone has suggestions? I love Supergoop unseen &amp; their mineral option for reef but it’s so pricey.\n\nTo whoever read all of this I appreciate you forreal 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽",

      "content": "Hey all, I'm the only person in my family with curly hair and have spent the last year teaching myself how to care for and style it. Honestly, I've got the routine and washing process down, but I'm having such a hard time with drying it. The drying process has been entirely hit or miss for me, and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. \n\nThe individual strands of my hair are quite fine but I have a very full head of hair. The underneath of my hair has tighter curls (mayber 3b or 3c) and curls up well regardless of products or drying method. The top layer of my hair is coarser, looser (3a at its best), and drier. After getting out of the shower I rake in a curl cream, brush style my hair in sections, and then scrunch in a gel. I normally also flip my hair upside down and scrunch in more gel when my hair is around 75-50% dry to make sure there's good hold because it will become a fuzzball in less than a day if not. \n\nI used to diffuse my hair but find it takes a very long time from start to finish. I am a college student and don't have 1-2 hours to spend in front of the mirror, especially when my hair ends up looking bad anyways. I find the diffuser gives my hair almost too much volume and it also causes the top layer of my hair to sometimes frizz up completely, like not even a hint of curl. Sometimes I diffuse my hair and it looks amazing, and other times I look completely disheveled.\n\nFor the past few weeks I've been quickly blowdrying my hair upside down and then using a cotton t-shirt to scrunch until dry but find the results can also be inconsistent. For example, it looked amazing the first 3 times, but on the fourth, my curls looked very loose and flat and genuinely took 5 hours to dry. \n\nI cannot just let my hair air dry because I find it super overstimulating and will just end up tying it back in a low ponytail. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips on what might help, or something that I might be doing wrong? I'm really at a loss with this. I'm trying to feel confident in my curls, but am finding the inconsistent results to be so disheartening. ",
