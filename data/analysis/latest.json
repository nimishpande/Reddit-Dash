      "content": "I’ve been using Ayurvedic products for years, and there are a few simple, inexpensive ones that I feel deserve way more attention.\n\n1.\tKailas Jeevan – Honestly, this is my go-to for anything skin-related. Burns, cuts, pimples—you name it. It works quickly and soothes the skin really well. Apparently, it can also be consumed for digestive or internal issues, but I haven’t personally tried that.\n\n2.\tBoronil – Super effective for dry or irritated skin. I like to keep it on hand; it’s like an Ayurvedic moisturizer with healing properties. I use it for face lips and hands.\n\n3.\tTup Anjan (ghee-based eye balm) – This one’s underrated! I use it for dry or tired eyes, and surprisingly, it helps me sleep better too.\n\nWould love to hear if others have discovered lesser-known Ayurvedic or traditional remedies that actually work for everyday use. What are your must-haves?",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I have high porosity 3a/3bish fine hair.\n\nI started out with SheaMoisture products but they were too heavy and my hair ended up looking \"wet\" and stringy and it wouldn't really curl.\n\nOn my next wash I ended up just shampooing it without any products or styling techniques (didn't even use conditioner), put it in a microfiber towel for 10 minutes, and then let it air-dry, and I came out with the prettiest curls I'd ever had. They were bouncy and voluminous and they clumped really nicely. The only problem was that they looked dry as hell.\n\nA couple of hours later I wet it again and used more lightweight products (The INKEY List Inkey Chia Seed Curl Defining Hair Cream + Umberto Giannini foam + Umberto Giannini curl serum) and brush-styled it then diffused it. It still ended up looking kinda limp like when I was doing a SheaMoisture routine, albeit a bit better.\n\nNot sure where to go from here. Any advice/product recs?",

My hands are probably a lost cause tbh with how often I thrust them into cardboard boxes, but I would love some tips for my face.

      "content": "Hi everyone - I’m at my wits end with my acne and am finally turning to Reddit for some advice. I apologize in advance for the length and am super appreciative of any advice you have to offer!!\n\nI have been on an acne journey for the last 15 years. I struggled heavily with hormonal acne in high school. I started with birth control pills which helped my chest/back but didn’t help my face. My parents didn’t want me to jump straight to Accutane so I tried literally every topical and pill first - clyndamyacin, doxycycline, tretinoin, minocycline (pill &amp; topical), benzoyl peroxide, etc. I even went to an Amish doctor that prescribed a bunch of herbal supplements which - shocker - didn’t work. I finally went on Accutane and my skin was perfectly clear for about a year and a half and then it came back, although not as intense. I tried doxycycline again bc they said acne can become less resistant to medicines after a round of Accutane but it was still persistent. A few years after, I tried Accutane for a second time but had the same result - clear skin for 18 months only for it to come back with a vengeance. I started Spironolactone shortly after and it helped but I was still dealing with small breakouts every week. After a few years of this, and losing faith in dermatologists that would only suggest a third round of Accutane and offer no other solutions, I finally decided to cut off dermatologists and go to an esthetician. I got chemical peels for 5-6 months in a row and finally felt like I had my hormonal acne somewhat under control. About 6 months after this, I relocated to a different part of the country and faced a new issue: fungal acne. I was diagnosed by an esthetician who basically said I had to scrap my whole skincare routine for FA safe, which I did, and my FA cleared. Of course right after this, my hormonal acne came back. \n\nAnd now I’m truly at a loss for what to do next. I’ve been considering TCM/acupuncture as a next step, but also wondering if I should just invest in a hormonal balancing supplement (do these even work!)? or do I bite the bullet and go back on Accutane (6 years since my last round)?? \n\nI wash my pillowcases 1/week and flip my pillows every night. I’ve tried cutting dairy but that didn’t help. My current skincare is Malezia cleanser, moisturizer, and benzoyl peroxide and I exfoliate a couple times a week w Paula’s Choice BHA. \n\nTLDR; i have a mix of persistent hormonal and fungal acne. I’ve tried Accutane twice and multiple topical and oral medications over the years. What do I do next??",

In my experience, washing 24 hours after color shouldn’t affect the longevity because the color doesn’t continue processing &amp; the conditioner seals with an acidic pH. I’m confusedddd",

I started seeing a dermatologist at 18, and while the acne has mostly been controlled, the pigmentation has never truly improved.\n\nWhat treatments I’ve tried\n\n\t•\tTopical creams prescribed by my dermatologist\n\n\t•\tChemical peels — they temporarily even out my skin for about 1–2 weeks, but the pigmentation always comes back\n\n\t•\tI’ve been prescribed Golite cream multiple times, but I honestly don’t see any noticeable improvement\n\nMy current routine (derm-prescribed)\n\n\t•\tAcne Moist moisturizer\n\n\t•\tGolite cream\n\n\t•\tEye cream for dark circles\n\nCurrent concerns\n\n\t•\tVery dull, oily skin (no glow or freshness)\n\n\t•\tDark circles (I know poor sleep contributes)\n\n\t•\tSignificant pigmentation, especially:\n\n\t•\tNeck (I was born with torticollis, which may have contributed)\n\n\t•\tFace (uneven pigmentation)\n\n\t•\tUnderarms\n\n\t•\tOverall tanning on my body\n\n\t•\tMy face looks aged and tired for my age\n\nSunscreen issues (major problem)\n\nAlmost every sunscreen I try pills or leaves a heavy white cast:\n\n\t•\tAcne UV — terrible white cast\n\n\t•\tAcne Wash sunscreen — same issue\n\n\t•\tMinimalist sunscreen — feels weird on my skin and doesn’t fully absorb\n\nBecause of this, I end up using far less than the recommended amount, which I know defeats the purpose.\n\nEven with moisturizer, my skin still looks flat, lifeless, and dull, not healthy or youthful.\n\nMy questions\n\n\t•\tIs repeated chemical peeling really the best approach for long-term pigmentation?\n\n\t•\tWhy might Golite not be working, even after consistent use?\n\n\t•\tWhat kind of treatment or routine actually helps with:\n\n\t•\tChronic pigmentation\n\n\t•\tDull, oily skin\n\n\t•\tEarly signs of aging\n\n\t•\tHow do I fix sunscreen pilling and absorption on oily skin?\n\n\t•\tShould I consider changing dermatologists or asking for different treatment options?\n\nI’m feeling quite stuck because I’ve been consistent and patient, but I don’t see real progress. I just want my skin to look healthy, fresh, and age-appropriate again.\n\nAny advice, experiences, or product/treatment suggestions would be really helpful.\n\nThank you in advance 🤍",

      "content": "I have shoulder-length curly/wavy hair and sleep in a bonnet every night. However, due to how fine my hair is, there is always a lot of leftover space in my bonnet, and I end up sleeping on my curls and crushing them. When I use a scrunchie under the bonnet, then the hair stays on top of my head but the curls around the scrunchie get squished and never look the same. I’ve been trying to find a bonnet that keeps my hair all the way off the back of my head and piled on top instead, but haven’t had much luck. I even tricked myself into thinking I could just add more product to my hair and that would keep it nice even if I slept on it, but obviously that didn’t work (my normal routine is just mousse applied to damp hair, diffused and finished with hairspray, because adding much else really weighs my hair down!). \n\nFrom what I can tell, an ideal bonnet for me would be small, have a wide band, and have most of its space up on top of my head (if there’s a bonnet with ruching at the nape of the neck, I think that might help?), but honestly I’m willing to try anything!
