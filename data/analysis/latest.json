      "content": "\n\n\nHey everyone,\n\nAfter reading so many transformation stories here, I finally gathered the confidence to share my own. It’s been a full 12 months since my journey began, and honestly, choosing to go ahead with a hair transplant has been one of the best decisions of my life.\n\nI’m a 41-year-old doctor, but for years I looked much older than my actual age. I had a very large forehead, strong frontalis muscle activity, and a badly receding hairline. It affected me more than I’d like to admit. I avoided mirrors, disliked being photographed, and slowly my confidence started fading. I run a small hospital, so looking constantly tired or stressed didn’t help either.\n\nThe Surgery &amp; Choosing the Right Doctor\nI had been thinking about a hair transplant for a long time, but time was always an issue. Traveling to another city felt exhausting, and I was very clear about one thing—I didn’t want a “hair mill” setup where technicians do everything. I wanted a qualified doctor who personally performs the procedure.\n\nThrough one of my colleagues, I came across a doctor in Patna, and from the very first consultation, I felt comfortable. What impressed me most was that he didn’t just talk about the number of grafts—he talked about aesthetics. He carefully studied my face, age, muscle movement, and skin laxity, and explained why my case needed a customized approach.\n\nFirst Sitting &amp; Setbacks\nMy first surgery involved 3,500 grafts. Unfortunately, soon after the procedure, I went through a very stressful personal phase. Because of that, I couldn’t follow the post-op routine properly—diet, supplements, and overall care were not ideal for almost six months. Naturally, this affected the results.\n\nBy the 8th month, the outcome was decent, but deep down I felt something was still missing.\n\nSecond Sitting – A Grateful Moment\nWhen I discussed this with my doctor, he was incredibly understanding. He agreed to a second sitting for refinement—free of charge, except for a minimal OT cost. I wanted a slightly lower hairline and better density, and around 1,800 additional grafts were added to enhance the hairline peak and blend everything naturally. I’m genuinely grateful for his honesty and support.\n\nHairline Design – The Game Changer\nThis is what truly changed everything.\n\nInstead of giving me a straight, artificial-looking hairline, he designed a:\n\nTriangular, age-appropriate hairline\n\nOne that perfectly matches my face shape and muscle movement\n\nNot too low, not too youthful—just natural and balanced\n\nThe Real Journey (No Sugarcoating)\nMonths 1–3: Shedding, anxiety, stress, and poor aftercare\n\nMonths 4–6: Early signs of growth\n\nMonth 7: Good density, but I wanted a lower hairline\n\nMonth 8: Second surgery for refinement (1,800 grafts)\n\nMonth 12: Major transformation\n\nSome areas are still improving, and since it’s only 4 months after the second sitting, I feel I might gain another 20–30% density.\n\nHow I Feel Today\nFor the first time in years, I don’t look constantly stressed or older than my age. I finally see a version of myself that feels right. The confidence this has given me—both personally and professionally—is something I can’t put a price on.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nA hair transplant isn’t just about getting hair back—it’s about getting your confidence back.\n\nIf you’re thinking about it:\n\nChoose a doctor who designs, not just implants\n\nBe patient—it’s a long journey\n\nTrust the process\n\nI’m finally at a place where I truly like how I look, and that feeling is priceless.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or share pictures if anyone wants",

      "content": "Heya, I’m a trans woman and around early November, I started using retinol (The Ordinary 0.5% retinol in squalane) to help with anti-aging and combat some other skin concerns (discolouration, texture etc). My skin has actually had no negative reaction at all, which is why I’ve decided to increase the frequency.\n\nIn late October, I did two sessions of laser hair removal (can’t do it for long stretches because it’s very expensive for me atm) at a new place, which actually gave me better results than the place I went to before, and after just two sessions, I thought I could now transition (heh) to shaving every three days instead of every other day. I get bad irritation on my neck from shaving, so that would’ve been great. However, since increasing the frequency of retinol in the past two weeks, I’ve noticed an increase of beard growth to the point where it’s actually more visible halfway through day 2 than it has been for the past two years. The only change I’ve made is increase the retinol frequency, so I’m pretty sure that’s the only thing it could be.\n\nI’ve looked online as well and it seems like there is something to it, with some cis women reporting similar things (mildly increased hair growth and even some darkening of that hair).Tretinoin seems to promote hair growth in androgenic alopecia in humans, and there seems to be some evidence in mice that it increases hair growth (I know, mouse evidence doesn’t necessarily apply to humans but still, it’s a hint). Given that retinoids increase cell proliferation, all of that makes sense.\n\nNow, my actual question is: Does anyone have any advice on how to combat this? I can’t afford regular laser appointments and unfortunately, the skin concerns I’m trying to combat with the retinol are present in the areas where there is facial hair growth, so it feels like a catch 22. Increasing the amount of times I shave would be possible but would also cause much more irritation around the neck. Thinking about reducing the frequency of retinol again because the increased hair growth makes me quite dysphoric and makes it more difficult to get gendered consistently by strangers.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

      "content": "Hi all. I have extremely thick curly hair, type 3a / possibly 3b about halfway down my back in length, and decently healthy/taken care of. However, I'm at my wits end trying to manage the physical pain that it brings me. \n\nIt feels like everything I do with my hair brings me pain. My wash-day brushouts hurt like hell and take me near an hour each time. Putting my hair up to protect it after a wash hurts, taking a clip or scrunchie out of my hair to take it down hurts, sleeping with the weight of my hair on top of my head hurts, anyone touching my hair hurts-- it just never stops. \n\nI've gotten a mat in my hair twice in the past two months, both times from simply sleeping with my hair in a low ponytail for one night. Those both led to me struggling to brush it out for an hour plus (sectioning all the other hair away, brushing from bottom to top) and eventually just cutting a small chunk out of my hair to make the pain stop. \n\nIf anyone has advice for how to help at all, it would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to cut my hair short again, as this is the longest it's been since I was a kid, but I really don't know how much more I can handle. \n\nMy care routine is:\n- Wash my hair 2-3 times a week using Mielle rosemary+mint shampoo and Marc Antony Simply Curls conditioner \n- Brush my hair out with a wetbrush in the shower every wash when soaking wet and full of conditioner.\n- put up in a towel for about 10 minutes and then bundle it all in a claw clip on the very top of my head to sleep.\n\nI typically wear my hair up in large claw clips, in two low braids, or in a scrunchie/low bun when close to wash day. I feel like these are pretty protective styles, but it feels like no matter what I do, I get endless tangles. \n\nI have tried sleeping in a tie-front silk bonnet but it won't reliably stay on my head overnight. \n\nI'm not someone who does well with long care routines or tons of products as I just simply don't have the time and energy to devote so much more to my hair than I already do. \n\nAny advice/suggestions/ideas/anecdotes welcomed.

I apologize if this isn't the right subreddit but I thought it would be helpful since I know curly, thick hair can be hard to manage.\n\nShe has beautiful, long, red hair. It is very thick and curly. Like Merida from the movie Brave. I do not remember off the top of my head what shampoo she uses (I know I should). She uses a lot of oils on her hair and I know she talks a lot about how important it is to moisturize. That is as far as I know for her routine.\n\nDoes anyone with similar hair have any good hair diffuser that I could get her for Christmas? Preferably found on Amazon. I'm willing to spend good money on this for her so I just really care about the quality. After searching on Amazon, I saw that some of them did not get hot enough (she complains about this with her current hair dryer), and some other ones got too hot to the point where it burns hair and melts.\n\nI don't know much about haircare, especially with her hair because she is really careful with what she uses.

      "content": "Hi, I’m the guy who posted a week ago after getting a breakout from Nizoral. I want to thank everyone who replied to my last post.\n\nMy skin has improved since then. I’ve been using only SVR Topialyse Gel Lavant, and at this point I’m confident that my acne (or folliculitis) is bacterial.\n\nIf you look closely at the photos, you can see many small, skin-colored bumps. I suspect they might be closed comedones (what do you think?), and that they could be contributing to bacterial overgrowth and inflammation.\n\nWhere I live, I can’t find benzoyl peroxide washes, only gels. Also, because of the bleaching issue, BP wouldn’t have been my first choice anyway.\n\nI was thinking of trying salicylic acid to help exfoliate my skin. Do you think it could be effective in reducing new pustules?\n\nI’m leaning toward a salicylic acid wash because toners might be inconvenient to use on such a large surface. I’m just worried that washes might not be as effective.\n\nI’ve been looking at CeraVe Blemish Control Cleanser, which contains 2% salicylic acid. Are there better options?\n\nI also think my skin is quite dry (can you tell from the photos? I’m having a hard time finding out my skin type), although it doesn’t feel tight or itchy. I’m aware that salicylic acid can be drying, so I was thinking of starting by using the cleanser every other night and eventually increasing the frequency if necessary.\n\nI’d also start using a moisturizer. I was thinking of Purito Oat-in Calming Gel Cream or Purito Bamboo Panthenol Cream. I bought both, and I plan to apply one on my right pec and the other on my left for a week before starting the salicylic acid wash, just to make sure they don’t break me out. I’d also like to hear your opinion on these moisturizers and any recommendations for better ones in my situation.\n\nSorry for the wall of text. I really hope this situation improves because it’s frustrating.",

I tended to use curly marketed products already because other products made my hair puff out or feel greasy. When it’s wet, it arranges itself like pictures I’ve seen of 2c— small bundles that sometimes twist around themselves and sometimes form short S shapes- but usually it air dries looser and with straight portions especially towards the top of my head. \n\n But taking care of that was hard enough without trying to figure out a routine to encourage curls 😂 I got a shoulder length haircut a few months back and my hairdresser commented that my hair texture had definitely changed and had started curling a bit as he cut it. TBH didn’t think much of it until it got chilly in my house and I decided to break out a diffusing attachment my sister got me. \n\nPretty much all the layers below my eyes started forming larger C shapes at the ends as opposed to the long S I usually get. I thought it was cute and thought I’d try changing my routine a little to try and get more definition to the wave I already have and maybe encourage it to curl more if it would like to 😊 \n\nI like the shampoo/conditioner and infusium I currently have— so I’d be aiming for Technique and leave in conditioner/gel(?) recommendations! \n\nAttached pictures are from right after I used a diffuser on my hair :)\n\n\\-Soapbox argan oil shampoo and conditioner (wash roots with shampoo, condition through full length of hair and rinse after 5 minutes)\n\n\\-squish out some water, then spray until wet with Infusium23\n\n\\-sit there toweled up until it’s less drippy, then apply Anika Supernova Moisture and Shine Cream (usually I use the Aussie curl cream)\n\n\\-diffuse hair, plopping 1/6 of my hair right on that diffusing head of a hair dryer\n\nNowadays I sleep with a poly satin pillowcase, loose or in braids depending on my mood :)",

Shampoo twice (Head &amp; Shoulders, then Ors creamy Aloe Shampoo), then conditioner (currently I use SheaMoisture curl conditioner and Aussie deep conditioner in rotation). \n\n2. I apply curl cream (SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie) into really wet hair, think seaweed hair. I brush it through completely. Then I apply Herbal Essences Volumizing Mousse and brush it through completely. It is my favorite hold product.\n\n3. I brush style it in sections and carefully scrunch afterwards.\n\n4. Sometimes I apply a gel cast after brush styling, but this time I didn't do it. If I do, I would mix Aussie Instant Freeze Gel with water in my hands and carefully apply it all over my hair.\n\n5. Diffuse carefully. First 10 mins hover diffusing upside down, then a mix of pixie diffusing and cup diffusing until dry.\n\n6. When my hair is 100% dry, I rub hair oil (Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine) in between my hands and gently scrunch my hair and shake out my roots.\n\nIn order to keep my hair looking like that pretty much throughout the week, I use a silk pillowcase and just carefully flip my hair over from underneath when sleeping. When taking a shower, I put my hair in a ponytail, fix it with a clip and then use a shower cap.",

I was using Cantu curl cream and mousse for about 5-6 months, then stopped because I thought it was starting to strip my scalp. Since then I tried Miss Jesse’s Multi-Cultural curl cream, which didn’t work AT ALL. I normally use a t-shirt to let my hair dry and then let it air dry.\n\nI’ve been trying to search for a good leave-in conditioner for about a week or now because I wanna start using products in my hair again, but I don’t want to dry my hair, at the same time I want to make my hair more curly. I would try Shea-Moisture, but their Manuka Honey Shampoo and Conditioner dried out my hair, so I’m weary of trying their leave-in. I’m just confused on where to start or what brands to get.

I've never been completely satisfied with the color which is why I've changed hair dressers 3 times. \nEvery time I go in for highlights they try to convince me highlights are outdated, and dont look as good as a baleage. I've given in every time because I'm a pushover, even though I really prefer the look of highlights and want the color closer to the roots. \n\nWhy do they do this? Is it just so they can charge more? I know upkeep is easier with a bayleage but I've had my highlights with a good root blend last just as long as my bayleage. ",
