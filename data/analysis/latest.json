      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

What can I do to help my curls be more uniform. At the moment I brush before I wash, wash with “only curls” products. Then I add curl cream while my hair is soaking, brush that through then I use gel to scrunch again while soaking. Then I use a T-shirt to scrunch some of the water out before plopping. Then I will add moose after about 20 mins then defuse. Sometimes I add an oil after defusing if it’s looking frizzy. \nThanks! ",

      "content": "I asked for an angled lob, and happy to have the back go as short at the back to the nape of my neck. I showed two inspo pics. \n\nThe issues I have with the cut: \n- I feel my front angles are uneven. \n- The back is not a sleek line but very uneven which matches the front angles. \n- The back only looks straight if I push all my hair to the front which feels a little unnatural, and then I get a tuft come out on the longer side. \n\nThe issues I have with the stylist: \n- I am worried the stylist took one of the inspo pics to be uneven but I said it was to show the angle of the cut. Plus it's a mirror flip. The inspo pic doesn't have this issue. \n- I had to ask her twice to keep cutting it short to closer to my nape if it allowed. She said to come back in a month. And I said I've had chin length hair before, I'm happy to go shorter. \nShe said okay let's do it. I felt she was rushed for her next appointment. \n- i have used this stylist before and I was happy with her.  I wanted to go shorter last time but she didn't go shorter. She said to come back in summer. Which I did. And it still felt reluctant to go shorter. Not that this is an issue at all but maybe for context, English is not her first language but she is proficient. \n\nQuestions: \n1. Is it worth to go back to the salon to fix it up. I feel a bit uncomfortable as I was there was ages. She won't be there tomorrow but I need to get it fixed as I have an event on.\n2. Is it fixable by another stylist? \nE. Is it noticeable? Am I overreacting? \n\nThank you. I feel stressed but I'm a little stressed at the moment in general and thinning about my hair that I paid a lot of money for and felt like I didn't get what I was after but not sure if the inspo pic threw it all off. She didn't look at it for long. \n\nThank you. ",

Under strong light, it always looks like my skin has been under immense stress.\n\nMy dermatologist suggested a chemical peel if I was really concerned about the aesthetics of it, but the downsides seem to outweigh the benefits. I also tried Salipil, which did not seem to work much.\n\nSo, I was wondering if anyone can suggest and have experience with more gentle but effective exfoliants (or any other routine I could adopt).

      "content": "I went to an aesthetic clinic yesterday as I was having a severe breakout and redness, and I asked for topical/oral medication, then I was prescribed with the following :\n\n• Accutane pills twice daily for the first five days, then once daily onwards\n\n• Roxythromycin (antibiotic) twice daily\n\n• Levocetirizine (anti-redness) once daily\n\n• Azelaic acid cream twice daily\n\n• Their cleanser with salicylic acid(BHA)\n\nI asked for the specific dosage(mg or concentration) but they refused to disclose explicitly, so I'm concerned with combining the 2 actives with accutane. I've asked if the dosage for each are low and safe enough, but I haven't gotten an answer. Do you think it's fine for me to \"risk\" it and just go exactly with the doctor's prescription and recommended routine, or should I change to a gentler cleanser? (I have CeraVe's Foaming Cleanser)\n\nnote: i've never tried accutane before so this will be my first time..\n\n\noh and, a bit out of topic, is Aiken's Prebiotic Water Jelly Moisturizer Hydra Plus enough hydrating for my moisturizer during accutane? and is Aiken's Prebiotic Glowing &amp; Primer Sunscreen good enough for my main sunscreen? The doctor told me to use strictly water-based sunscreen and gel-like moisturizer but idk why(maybe bc of my oily skin and prone to fungal acne or idk)",

This makes the lamination appointment not even worth it since with mascara and daily make up removal it makes the effect go away faster.\n\nWhat should i do? Or should i just let this beauty standard of unrealistic long eyelashes just go from my head. I expect to wake up in the morning like that when in reality is just because i see it everywhere on social media and now i want it too bcs my eyes feel naked.\n\nIf u do go to the salon and put eyelash extansions, do you just do it forever?

Love Beauty &amp; Planet Blossom &amp; Tea Rose Body Scrub - Not a fan 🙅‍♀️ Took forever to finish and always left my skin feeling sticky with a weird oily film. Ig it’s discontinued now, which honestly feels fair. WNRP. \n\n2. Hyphen All I Need Lip Screen - Bought it for the SPF, felt decent and moisturising at first, but it started smelling weird way before expiry. 🤢So it’s leaving my stash early. Not an actual empty, but definitely a goodbye. WNRP.\n\n3. Within Beauty Daily Dew Barrier Restore Gel Moisturiser - Used this religiously for a whole year. Lost count of how many bottles I finished. But a couple months ago it just stopped working for me. Felt barely nourishing, left my cheeks and even my ears flaky (and it wasn’t even cold!). Retiring it now. WNRP.\n\n4. Axis-Y Dark Spot Correcting Glow Serum- On to my third tube now and it works like a charm. Fades dark spots, evens things out, and plays nicely with the rest of my routine. It’s the only niacinamide I use and I’m like two tubes away from calling it my holy grail. WRP. \n\n5. Dr. Sheth’s Ceramide &amp; Vitamin C Oil-Free Moisturiser - Very no-nonsense and my sensitive skin thrives on it in summers. I’ve finished multiple tubes already. WRP in the warmer months. ☀️\n\n6. Chemist At Play Underarm Roll On - A regular in my vanity and completely non-negotiable. Does what it says without any drama. Will always repurchase. \n\n7. Bath &amp; Body Works Hydration Cream (Orange &amp; Ginger) - Picked it up for summer and it lasted me the whole season. BBW creams are my go-to for body moisturising. Already moved on to a winter scent. Solid WRP. 🩵\n\n8. Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence - Used it as my only sunscreen for 2 years because it’s waterproof and easy to wear while swimming. But it always stung my eyes if water touched my face, and I recently learned it has alcohol in it. Letting it go now. WNRP.\n\n",

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
