I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

However, most of the advice I can find on here and elsewhere for people with wavy hair is for hair that is much thinner than mine or for hair that is similarly as thick but much curlier. My hair is dense enough that I could stick a pencil in it, shake my head around and it would probably not fall out, but it's also not really curly. I rarely wash my hair with anything other than water and didn't previously have any other hair care routine. I have recently started using Give Me Four Curls leave in conditioner. The conditioner sometimes works quite well, and my hair will even start to form ringlets when I use it, but it's also quite inconsistent. My hair also takes an entire day to dry when I use it, and when I wake up in the morning I basically have to start the process again. Not really sure where to go from here?",

I'm going to list my routine and my products, and I'm open to new product suggestions, changing what I'm doing, you name it.\n\nAM\n\nSplash my face with water and dry it, do red light therapy.\n\n[The Ordinary Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Solution 20% with vitamin F](https://theordinary.com/en-us/ascorbyl-tetraisopalmitate-solution-20-in-vitamin-f-vitamin-c-100406.html) \\- I wait 5-10 minutes for this to soak in.\n\n[Live Clean Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.liveclean.ca/products-liveclean/live-clean-after-sun-aloe-vera-gel/) and The Ordinary Matrixyl 10% with HA - I wait 5 minutes for this to soak in.\n\n[CeraVe Moisturizing Cream](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream#key-ingredients), I wait another 5 minutes after this.\n\n[Pipette Mineral Sunscreen](https://www.pipettebaby.com/products/mineral-sunscreen-lotion-spf-50) with Squalane.\n\nI don't wear makeup or put anything else on.\n\nI haven't been sure whether to use The Ordinary AT first or after aloe vera, or somewhere else since it's an oil? But if I forget to put it on I still seem to have the same pilling issues.\n\nI've also reduced the amount of product I'm using with both the aloe vera and the cerave, and increased the amount of time to let products soak in. That's helped, but when I put on my sunscreen I still tend to get pilling. Am I just using too much/many products, too hydrating, specific ingredients in the products, what do you think? My skin does really seem to love the hydration, I have dry skin and live in a really cold/dry climate during the winter.\n\nI really love the mineral sunscreen, as I can't wear chemical sunscreens (they always sting my eyes and also make my mouth taste strange?? Even without getting it in my mouth?). I've tried probably a dozen mineral sunscreens. I got it as a much cheaper dupe for [Biossance Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen](https://www.biossance.com/p/squalane-and-zinc-sheer-mineral-sunscreen/15243371/?affil=thgppc&amp;switchcurrency=USD&amp;shippingcountry=US&amp;bvstate=pg:5/ct:r) which I also loved, both of which are the only mineral sunscreens I've found that don't have a white cast and aren't super drying. I'm open to other options here.\n\nHere's PM routine too, just for reference:\n\n[Bioderma Cleansing Oil](https://www.bioderma.ca/en/all-products/atoderm/cleansing-oil)\n\nSame aloe vera and The Ordinary matrixyl\n\nPrescription retinol cream\n\nSame Cerave\n\nThe Ordinary 100% Plant Derived Squalane\n\nThank you for any help!\n\nP.S. Just saw the post about The Ordinary and Estee Lauder - open to alternatives for my TO products for this reason, too! ",

I am a trans man and got top surgery last year- I'm really excited to go to the beach shirtless, and I don't want my acne to stop me from that.\n\nI am mostly trying to get a handle on my back chest, and shoulder acne, but facial acne help is also greatly appreciated. I'll write a list of my skin condition, current routine, past product combos I've tried. Pics of my skin are at the bottom of the post. Any insight on to wtf is going on with my skin, or any product advice, is greatly appreciated.\n\n**Skin condition:** I have combo skin (always oily but skin feels tight- I think it's dehyrdrated). All over, I have visible pores that easily get filled and turn into closed comedones, blackheads, or inflame and become red. I'm susceptible to cystic acne on my jawline, back, and shoulders. I get hard keratin plugs on my back and shoulders often. I have lots of discoloration on my back and shoulders form acne scarring. I have prominent sebaceous filaments on my nose, but it's been greatly reduced since using BHA every other day. I have some general redness around my cheeks.\n\n**Morning routine:**\n\n* Shower; I use an African net sponge with [CeraVe SA Cleanser Bar](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/cleansers/sa-cleanser-bar-for-rough-and-bumpy-skin#key-ingredients)\n* Body moisturizer: [La Roche-Posay Urea 10% Lotion](https://www.laroche-posay.us/our-products/body/body-lotion/lipikar-urea-10-roughness-smoothing-lotion-3337875852302.html)\n* Cleanser: [CeraVe Balancing Air Foam](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/cleansers/air-foam-foaming-facial-cleanser)\n* Minoxidil (scalp and facial hair)\n* Moisturizer: [CeraVe Oil Control Gel Cream](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/facial-moisturizers/oil-control-moisturizing-gel-cream) \\+ [Biore UV Aqua Rich](https://us.biore.com/products/biore-sunscreen-spf-50)\n\n**Evening Routine**\n\n*Face:*\n\n* Cleanse with [CeraVe Balaning Air Foam](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/cleansers/air-foam-foaming-facial-cleanser). \n* Acid: switch nightly between [Good Molecules Overnight Exfoliating Treatment](https://www.goodmolecules.com/s/good-molecules-over-night-exfoliating-treatment) \\[8% glycolic acid\\] and [Panoxyl 2% Salicylic Acid](https://panoxyl.com/acne-products/clarifying-exfoliant/)\n* Minoxidil\n* [CeraVe Gel Moisturizer](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/facial-moisturizers/oil-control-moisturizing-gel-cream)\n\n*Chest, shoulders, and back: switch nightly between*\n\n* [Good Molecules Exfoliating treatment](https://www.goodmolecules.com/s/good-molecules-over-night-exfoliating-treatment) \\+  [CeraVe SA Lotion for Rough &amp; Bumpy Skin](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/sa-lotion-for-rough-and-bumpy-skin)\n* [Panoxyl 2% Salicylic Acid](https://panoxyl.com/acne-products/clarifying-exfoliant/) \\+ [La Roche-Posay Urea 10% Lotion](https://www.laroche-posay.us/our-products/body/body-lotion/lipikar-urea-10-roughness-smoothing-lotion-3337875852302.html)\n\n**Past product combos:** \n\n*Face:* \n\n* [LRP Effeclar Medicated Gel cleanser with 2% SA](https://www.laroche-posay.us/our-products/face/acne-products/effaclar-medicated-acne-face-wash-effaclaracnewash.html) \\+ [LRP Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer](https://www.laroche-posay.us/our-products/face/face-moisturizer/toleriane-double-repair-face-moisturizer-tolerianedoublerepair.html)\n* [Panoxyl 10% Benzoyl Peroxide](https://panoxyl.com/acne-products/acne-foaming-wash-benzoyl-peroxide/) \\+ [LRP Toleriane Double Repair Moisturize](https://www.laroche-posay.us/our-products/face/face-moisturizer/toleriane-double-repair-face-moisturizer-tolerianedoublerepair.html)\n\n*Body*\n\n* [LRP Effeclar Medicated Gel cleanser with 2% SA ](https://www.laroche-posay.us/our-products/face/acne-products/effaclar-medicated-acne-face-wash-effaclaracnewash.html)\\+ [Curology Liquid Pore Exfoliant](https://www.target.com/p/curology-liquid-pore-exfoliant-with-2-bha-8-aha-pha-and-1-zinc-4-fl-oz/-/A-89146646) (nightly) + [CeraVe rough and bumpy moisturizer ](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/sa-lotion-for-rough-and-bumpy-skin)(nightly) \n* [Panoxyl Benzoyl Peroxide ](https://panoxyl.com/acne-products/acne-foaming-wash-benzoyl-peroxide/)\\+ [Curology Liquid Pore Exfoliant](https://www.target.com/p/curology-liquid-pore-exfoliant-with-2-bha-8-aha-pha-and-1-zinc-4-fl-oz/-/A-89146646) (nightly) + [CeraVe SA Lotion for Rough &amp; Bumpy Skin](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/sa-lotion-for-rough-and-bumpy-skin) (nightly)\n\nAcne pics for reference:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owtlx3p8vpfg1.jpg?width=2406&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=310cf2a9f8271e4aa2d08057c70ca4723da85b19\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ma4xn6p8vpfg1.jpg?width=1444&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c823dd6e19a527ff69eaba01da1ad955035b9f37\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekamf6p8vpfg1.jpg?width=2436&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aa8887059935708abb7243667073d12957fcf63\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bsmt36p8vpfg1.jpg?width=2012&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15f94d9acc43d29b50f49e4b41379fe53286eaef\n\n  \n",

I suspect it's because my hair is very fine, dense and I live in very humid weather.\nThe only gels that kinda worked are these:\n\nUncle's funky gel: looked good, but was too moisturizing for the weather, so it didn't last an hour and kinda never fully dried even under hooded dryer. Never flaked though, just disappeared.\n\nMorocannoil's strong styling gel: expensive, which I wouldn't mind if they had a bigger tube. I think it's meant for straight hair but it's the best one I've used. Cast without flakes somehow\n\nAloe vera: definition, but didn't last at all.\n\nIs there any other way I can define my hair? I'm ok with having a soft definition and having to retouch it daily. I don't need it to be \"perfect\".\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nPrepoo: Sometimes I use aloe vera with crecepelo. I don't tend to pre-poo unless my hair is very dry, which it doesn't tend to be.\n\nShampoo: Helen Seward Remedy 7/S shampoo or OUAI Detox shampoo\n\nHair masks: Crecepelo hair mask, l'oreal elvive total repair 5 (black pot) + occasional protein treatment. \n\nConditioner: Lendan plex forte N.5. But might switch to Redken All Soft Mega Curls conditioner.\n\nStyling: Don't have any \"staple\" styling products but my hair loves Aunt Jackie's quench leave in. It's harder to find lately though (in my country)\n\nI don't mind paying more for a product if it comes on a bigger tube. I use a hooded dryer. Because it's so dense my hair doesn't tend to fully dry unless I spent like 4 hours drying it if curled. But if I have mini twists or will be doing a braid out it tends to take 2.

I have Pcod and have been dealing with neck hair since last 8 years. But I want to know what kind of skincare routine can help my skin, the open pores and pigmentation and all. I'm a complete noob when it comes to using latest skincare, I have always depended on toner- moisturizer-sunscreen for face, that too not very consistent. But I have inclination towards using only natural ingredients because I can't afford expensive skincare and mid range skincare is not even effective as we all know (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong by suggesting good products according to you). Market is so saturated with brands, I'm too overwhelmed to do a manual search so here I am, asking for help. Please help guys 🙏\n\n  \nP.S. whats with all the creeps lurking around in this subreddit.
