      "content": "I feel like my whole life, curly hair isn't something that society deems professional or beautiful.\n\nGrowing up, my mum and other older adults in my life were constantly telling me to straighten my hair. Or like\"do you even brush your hair???\" Giving me endless products that stop frizz. Telling me how much nicer I looked when I straightened my hair. This still happens today.\n\nIt feels like looking after my curly hair takes so much effort just to make it even look presentable. A straight-haired goddess just walks out of bed with effortless-looking, shiny, smooth long locks. \n\nIt will take me half an hour to wash using my routine.  Pre-shampoo (Garnier Fructis Curls Method Shampoo), double shampoo. Conditioner (Natural Look curls boost). Leave-in Conditioner (Garnier Fructis, 3-in-1 Hair Mask). Mouse (SHEA MOISTURE Coconut and Hibiscus), then gel, scrunching and praying hands, and then diffusing (plus a few hours to dry since my hair is so thick). By the time it's all done, it's the evening, and it looks nice for a few hours. I use a stain pillow, but the next day it's all crumpled and sad looking, so it's like all the effort for nothing.\n\nI feel so self-conscious going out with my natural curls. I feel like people look at me as if I do not look after myself when my hair is naturally curly. For events, there is always pressure to straighten or heat-curl my hair.\n\nI do get comments from people who really like my natural curls, but I feel like the majority of people aren't impressed.\n\nJust wondering if it gets easier, and if you've found you sort of grown into your curls more. Thank you.",

      "content": "I’m reaching out for some advice. Lately, I’ve noticed that my hair isn’t curling as well as it used to, even though I’m using the same products and have the same routine (gel or foam). I go to a hairdresser who specializes in curly hair.\n\nNow I’m confused because I’m not sure whether my hair just doesn’t curl the same way anymore, or if it’s simply too long (although I’ve had long hair before, and it used to curl better) or it’s not cut correctly. \n\nI’ve always had the issue that the bottom layer of my hair hardly curls at all – it’s more wavy than curly. When I get a layered haircut, that bottom part tends to stick out, making the difference between the curly and wavy sections even more noticeable. This is why I don't like very layered cuts. When my hair is shorter, the curls are more defined, but the bottom layer still stays wavier.\n\nI don’t know what would be best – to change my hairdresser, cut my hair shorter, change my routine or just accept that my hair doesn’t curl the way it used to or something else?\n\nEdit: my routine: I change shampoo and conditioner a lot, I brush my hair in the shower and then apply Tootilab Styling gel and then in between drying it with a diffuser a spray PoulMitchell Sculpting Spray. As somebody mentioned - I indeed started with new medication (oral contraceptive) two years ago. I was also thinking this could be a reason why my hair curls less (when I was a kid I had completely straight hair, they started curlying in puberty- so maybe hormonal changes does affect my hair a lot).

I figured id try this amlactin thing  now that I’m in Canada for a few months. But im finding it hard to obtain (for a reasonable price) and was hoping anyone could recommend a similar product that works as well, or if amlactin is the holy grail, where to obtain? \n\nThank you all. Any other advice regarding KP is so appreciated, I have purchased those Korean Scrub mitts, hoping they will help a little at least\n\nIll insert a pic of my arm (im embarrassed to do so tbh), but my legs basically look the same, it just felt too intimate to post lol",

I didn't visit any dermatologist for this; I knew what they would prescribe me and the expensive products. Being a teenager, not only do I not earn much (and that too is sometimes I do, sometimes I don't), but also I didn't want my parents to spend a luxury for my skincare. So I did my research, or whatever you'd like to call it, and started using my savings to purchase all these products one by one from a generic pharmacy. \n\n**Slide 1: Prior to May 17, 2025**  \nAM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra\n\n**Slide 2: Prior to August 26, 2025, till Sept 2, 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: AcMist  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nActive: Adapalene 0.1%\n\n**Slide 3: From Sep 3 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC (Using this as a moisturiser base provides better sun protection.)  \nActive: Azelskin - Azelaic Acid 10%  \nSunscreen: FixDerma Shadow SPF 30 (cheap and gets the job done for me)\n\nIn-between AM/PM (occasionally only if I am at home):  \nCleanser: Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC  \nActive: HQ 4%\n\nElse not at home:  \nSunscreen reapplication\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Minimalist B5 10% Moisturiser  \nActive: Melapik (0.0125% tretinoin, 2% HQ, 1% allantoin) **// Not a steroid cream**\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\nYes, I am aware of the ochronosis risk using HQ. But cycling it, 2 months use (alternative) and then stopping for a few weeks and then starting again will keep the melanocytes sensitive. So I will not encounter any of it, as most side effects happen due to long-term abuse without any protection and carelessness, and I am not at all careless.\n\nAll of the supplements I take are within the safe limits; I will mention the dosage and the frequency in the comments.\n\nI am looking forward to starting microdose isotretinoin. \\~7 mg / day.  \nEven weeks: 20 mg Thrice  \nOdd weeks: 20 mg twice\n\nAvg weekly intake: 50 mg\n\nWill be monitoring my lipid and liver panels every 3-4 months and ensuring they are within the ideal range.\n\nAny review and insights would be helpful.\n\nThank You",

My t-zone and eyelids are SUPER oily, but my cheeks are more normal to dry.\n\nI kind of fell off the skincare wagon a while ago, and I've only been doing cleanser (CeraVe Foaming Facial cleanser) &amp; moisturizer (currently just fragrance free Lubriderm daily moisture) and also SPF (this changes- I don't have one in particular that I love so I just try new products as I run out; currently using Hawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch 60 SPF), but I want to reintroduce the products I was using before: Good Molecules hyaluronic acid &amp; niacinamide, Paula's Choice 2% BHA, and a vitamin C serum (I just purchased the e.l.f. one but I'm open to suggestions that won't break the bank.)\n\nI don't remember my exact routine before, but I feel like it was very top heavy in the AM.\n\nExample:\n\nAM-\nCleanser\nVitamin C\nHA\nNiacinamide\nMoisturizer\nSPF\n\nPM-\nCleanser\nBHA (only 1-2x per week)\nMoisturizer\n\nWhich steps can I move from AM to my PM routine? I like to keep it simple on BHA nights, so I'd keep just those three steps and only add the other one on the other 5-6 nights per week.\n\nI'm thinking something like this maybe?\n\nAM-\nCleanser\nVitamin C\nHA -or- Niacinamide\nMoisturizer\nSPF\n\nPM-\nCleanser\nBHA\nHA -or- Niacinamide (whichever is not part of AM &amp; only non-BHA nights)\nMoisturizer \n\nOR\n\nPutting both HA and Niacinamide in the PM on non-BHA nights?\n\nI'm obviously going to have to ease back into a routine so I've got time to figure it out. I've only reintroduced hyaluronic acid at this point and it's been like a week. Any tips would be appreciated!",

      "content": "(16 M) What I’m trying to say is, am I really improving or is this just false hope? So to start, I’ve been dealing with moderate acne for 2-3 years now. Most part is prob my fault because I was doing too much to my skin, we’ll touch on that later. Anyways, I’ve tried many different products and things over the years. Benzoyl peroxide, witch hazel. Nothing worked. Until I found salicylic acid. That’s the only thing that calmed down my acne, so I got excited and started using it in so many forms. And it did help, for a small period of time, then I kept getting pimples in patches and that’s when I stopped. \n\nThis August, later in the month, I stopped all actives and reset my routine. And I’ve been doing this since: \nMorning: cetaphil daily gentle cleanser, cerave daily moisturizer (just got a sunscreen one I’ve been using but nothing has happened because of it)\nNight: up&amp;up salicylic acid cleanser, thayers toner (every other night), peach slices dark spot serum, and cerave daily moisturizer. \nAnd with this routine, I’ve noticed a huge difference. My skin is much clearer than before, all that’s left is dark spots and light scarring. My pimples have become much smaller when they do form, and they don’t form in large chunks like before.\n\nNow back to my question, is all this a sign of something good? Only because this is the first time something’s ever worked like this for this long for me. Granted, I barely have made it past the purging weeks, but I already see and feel a huge difference, so I’m very optimistic. The only thing that is a little bothersome is the hyperpigmentation and dark spots left by my pimples, no matter how gentle and don’t mess with them, they all leave dark spots. But, I know those fade and the dark spot serum I’m using should be helping.\n\nEdit* I put urgent as I kind of need to know whether or not my routine will go somewhere, but it’s kind of a touchy subject that’ll take too long to explain. Also, I know it’s hard to tell with such limited information, but any feedback or advice is appreciated!",

But wouldn't a damaged skin barrier at least allow for better penetration of the active ingredients? After all, the skin's protective shield is broken.\n\nI have read up on the subject and already found a lot of information. Chemical peels like BHA and AHA. Mechanical peels like scrubs. Mcroneedling with a derma roller. Apparently, benzoyl peroxide (PanOxyl) also clears the pores, allowing the active ingredients to work better. A hot shower could also help open the pores and make the skin more permeable.\n\nI already have all of the products listed, but I don't think it would be a good idea to use them all at once.

She even listed all the products so I could get them and recommend substitutes. So here is my current routine, the same routine she gave me to get these curls. 1)Wash: I use shea moisture shampoo and conditioner with warm but not hot water. 2) Style: I go section by section with a leave in, (curls smiths), a gel (innersence) and the wet brush. I can’t describe the motion I do with the brush but it s like brushing and twisting it at the same time. 3) Dry: She used a salon grade dryer but recommended I use a diffuser but not touch my hair with it just hover around it until it’s completely dry. 4)Serum: I break the gel cast with innersence serum. She was very specific about using a serum not an oil. I do all of this but my curls never come out like hers. Am I missing a step? Mine come out very frizzy no solid or strong curls. ",
