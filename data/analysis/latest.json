Im back again with my reviews. + I USED AZIDERM 15\n\nDifference: Well ignore the huge brown one in the centre that scar is quite recent so i dont expect it to be gone anytime soon. THE SCARS AROUND IT HOWEVER. I have had them for around 2 and 1/2 years after picking on  my folliculities. MY DERMAT DIDNT HELP BTW. And just after 30 days THEY ARE FINALLY FADING OMG IM GONNA CRY. EVEN MY MOM (BIGGEST HATER BTW) SAID THEY BE FADING 😭🙏🙏🙏🤙🤙🤙🤙💌💌💌💌. I wear makeup everyday to hide em marks but well except for hiding that big centre one i got recently others require minimal to no makeup AT ALL. BLESSING OH GOSH 🙏🙏🙏🙏🥀🥀🥀  ANYWAY ONTO THE REVIEW\n\nFIRST OF ALL ID LIKE TO THANK \n\nAZIDERM 15 \n\nI used to use azeliac acid 10% The ordinary. Never really worked much. BUT THIS STUFF CHANGED EVERYTHING. Its very grainy and if you dont pat ur face fully dry before applying IT ITCHES AND STINGS but worth everything. I use it every next night, pea sized amount WHOLE FACE. Dot forget ur Sunscreen!! 8/10 \n\nMOVING ON TO SUNSCREEN\n\nUV DOUX D TAN \n\nWell sorry but it works but does have its own disadvantages. You need to blend it in superhard until all the white stuff disappears and trust me 2 fingers worth of it dont blend in that easily. Its quite moody AND PILLS OCCASIONALLY. Enough blending prevents pilling but if ya dont blend it for 15 full mins 🥰🥰💔💔💔💔 u are cooked. But I do feel like it provides awesome protection. 6/10\n\nMOISTURIZER\n\nHOLY GRAIL. ATODERM IS PEAK IN THESE HARSH WINTERS OH GOD. LOVE LOVE LOVE 10/10 💌💌💌🙏🙏🙏🙏\n\nSERUMS\n\nMINIMALIST NIACINAMIDE,ALPHA ARBUTIN AND RETINOL I think play a pretty huge role too \n Niacidnamide 9/10\nArbutin 8/10 (too foamy)\nRetinol 7/10 (I dont like the base oil)\n\nEYE CREAM\n\nMinimalist Retinal eyecream. Does literally nothing btw. Waste of money 3/10 just for the cooling effect. \n\n\nTHATS IT YALL BYE BYE 🔥🔥🔥🤙🤙🤙🐎🐎💦💦💦💦",

      "content": "I’m very new to skincare, and I don’t know much about the different products. But after a horribly stressful year, I have fine lines that I’ve *never* seen before. I was hoping I could tackle it myself with the advice of some friends, who said adding in a retinol would help. But in doing even an ounce of research, I think I’m in over my head when it comes to mixing and matching products. \n\nSo, my two questions are: (1) should I add a retinol to my current routine? If not, what should I add? (2) Are there any other changes you’d recommend? \n\nI’m currently using the Neutrogena hyaluronic acid serum and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer (salicylic acid 0.5%) every morning or immediately after I shower. I only wash my face every couple of days when I shower with the Neutrogena oil-free acne wash (salicylic acid 2%). I’m not passionately attached to Neutrogena; it’s just what my mom bought me most often when I was a teenager. I’ve never had an issue switching things up if she brought home something different. \n\nThe combo is okay, but I don’t see much of a difference using the acid + moisturizer vs just the moisturizer. I think it might be the brand of hyaluronic acid because I was in love with the Quench hyaluronic acid serum from Ever. (It was a magical thing when coupled with the Hawaiian Tropic aloe after-sun lotion when I got really sunburnt. I was glowing.)\n\nOne of my biggest issues with skincare is that I hate the feeling of lotion more than the average person. If the product feels like it’s still moist or oily after a couple of minutes, I won’t use it. It makes me want to crawl out of my skin. Sunscreen and I are mortal enemies for this exact reason. (I still use it when I’m at the pool/beach, but I’m not happy about it.) With this in mind, it’s even harder for me to know what products I’d like **and** will accomplish my goals. I’d love any and all guidance! \n\n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Now because of the weather and the winters, my skin gets sooooo dry. I have tried so many things. The only thing I’ve found so far that seems to help is an over the counter intense moisturizing body lotion, which I can’t imagine is too good for my face.\n\nI was at the mall yesterday and stopped at kiels and they did a skin test. 52/100 for moisture (luckily 100/100 for skin barrier wooo). They gave me samples of their new moisturizer. Doesn’t seem to do much.\n\nI also go to Sephora pretty regularly and try samples, but nothing seems to actually help. I tried out drunk elephant while I was there and it seemed to maybe work, but it’s expensive and I don’t want to buy a bottle if it’s not going to work.\n\nI’ve tried different cleansers, hyaluronic acid serums, oil cleaners/masks.\n\nI even bought a shower water filter in case it’s an issue with chlorine or additives in the water.\n\nAny advice?",

Sebomoist – moisturizer \n\n2. Benzoyl peroxide gel – He told me to apply it daily in the morning on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer \n\n3. Clindamycin + Nicotinamide gel – To apply in the afternoon for 1 hour and then wash my face \n\n4. Tretinoin gel 0.025% – He told me to apply it in the evening for ½ hour on the affected areas on alternate days, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer \n\n5. He also prescribed some tablets \n\nI asked him which moisturizer I should use, so he wrote one himself. I also asked him about sunscreen, and he said there was no need since there would already be a lot going on on my face, and suggested that I just cover my face if I go out. I told him I have to attend a wedding, and he then said it was fine to use sunscreen, but he didn’t suggest any specific one.\n\nI currently use Neutrogena sunscreen. Should I continue with that?\nAlso, which face wash should I use with this routine?",

Please feel free to add your own advice to this post in the comments!!\n\n1. Get a skin test done. Places like Sephora do them for free. I was using products for years for acne, just to find out that actually I have dry skin and the products I was using were drying my skin out. I switched and my skin got so much better. \n\n2. Take advantage of beauty stores. Places like Sephora and Ulta have people working there who are knowledgeable in skin care and can help with your specific concerns. A lot of these places do FREE samples of products. So you can test drive new skincare products and routines until you find something that works. \n\n3. Make sure you have healthy habits first! Change your sheets and your pillow cases at least every week. Physically exfoliate in the shower (they sell really good exfoliating mitts at places like Meijer).\n\n4. Do NOT forget to hydrate every single day. It’s so important. \n\n5. Consider an oil cleanser. \n\n6. When in doubt, look at other possible culprits. I added a hard water filter to my shower head and it helped with dry skin overnight. Other people have recommended cleaning out your washing machine. You can also try detergents for sensitive skin. \n\n7. Shower order matters!! Wash your face and body AFTER you condition your hair and rinse it. \n\n8. Carry around face wipes. Use them before bed if you don’t feel like washing your face. \n\n9. Try a serum during your skincare routine. ",

      "content": "Hello, I’m hoping this question is answered with kindness—I’m really struggling right now.\n\nMy husband and I bought our first home in November. We’ve found that the sellers hid a lot of things from us/the inspectors. The home has a crawlspace that’s causing moisture issues/musty odors. The smell is dominant in a single room on our first floor, the rest of our house truly does not smell (several visitors have confirmed this too)\n\nWe’re doing everything we can to remediate it, but it’s been really difficult.\n\nI’m finding that the musty smell is really sticking to my hair. I’m washing my hair frequently, using a clarifying shampoo (often double shampooing), yet the smell clings to my hair within hours of being clean.\n\nIs there anything I can do to get rid of the smell when I’m out/keep my hair from absorbing it so much? I feel so embarrassed in public, I can smell it on myself. I’m sure others can smell it as well. \n\nFor context: there is not toxic mold in our house. We’ve had mold testing &amp; remediation. Unfortunately, I think this is an issue that just needs time to dry out &amp; fix. \n\nThank you in advance ❤️",

      "content": "Skincare rookie here who's excited to learn more! I would love your advice on my skincare routine and whether there are things I should be thinking about adding or deleting...there are so many actives, etc. out there and it's hard to know where I should be focusing from here. \n\nContext: 33F, combination skin (leaning quite dry in winter), relatively sensitive especially when trying out new products (can cause inflammation and breakouts). As long as I'm not fiddling with too many face products, my skin is generally very clear and I get complimented a lot on the glow. Pores seem fine, a little enlarged on the nose but the normal kind. \n\nPlease note that before I started working on my skincare I was using Oil of Olay on its own and nothing else - has been that way since I was a teen. I was taught less is more and was scared to cause inflammation or breakouts by changing things up and also used to not believe in clinical studies funded by the companies themselves, so took a very uneducated / ignorance-is-bliss approach to skincare...which seemed fine given my skin was also very healthy. However I am now 33 and eager to pay more attention to my skin.  \n\nP.S. Avene Cicalfate works so ridiculously well at moisturising my skin without causing any inflammation risk at all that I was also deliberating on using it as my one-and-done night time skincare routine, but it's so gentle that I can't help but think it's missing a lot of the actives, etc. that you'd ideally want to incorporate at night...what do you guys think?\n\nMy current routine is (bear in mind I am completely new to skincare so just learning as I go) -  \n\nAM\n1. La Roche Posay Effaclar foaming cleansing gel\n2. Estee Lauder night repair serum \n3. Beauty of Joseon Dynasty cream\n4. La Roche Posay Anthelios SPF 50\n5. ...Followed by makeup (NARS radiance primer, Charlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin foundation, NARS creamy concealer, etc.)\n\nPM\n1. La Roche Posay Effaclar foaming cleansing gel\n2. Weleda skin food (however I'm seeing early signs of clogged pores so have stopped this for now and replaced with BoJ Dynasty...considering Avene Cicalfate. I need some moisture in the winter)\n\n",

It's sometimes wavy to slightly curly in the summer. Recently, I spent a week down south and my hair became curly in the humidity. It was fun to try work with. Back to the northern climate, and I'm a dry, mostly flat mess. It's shorter than this photo now, since I can't grow length well with the dryness. ​\n\nHow can I care for hair that really only curls when the climate suits it? (Unless I use a zillion products.) How can I deal with fine, dry hair frizz and an oily scalp? What does this mess need? Please help. 🙈\n\nCurrent routine: Whole Foods brand unscented shampoo &amp; conditioner. Comb through conditioner in the shower, let sit. Rinse. Air dry. I very rarely use heat on my hair.",
