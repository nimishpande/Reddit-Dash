      "content": "Hello, I’ve decided to be a bit vulnerable here. But I thought it would be a good idea to post it anyway, because I want to provide hope for others struggling, either with alopecia or with their curly hair. \n\nIn 2021, I first discovered the alopecia. It started out as a tiny spot, which quickly grew to a large one over time. It got so bad, I was finding hair constantly throughout my home. I finally shaved it off in summer of 2021. In spring of 2022, I started prioritizing my own health, started working out, lost some weight and started taking multivitamins. I didn’t expect it, but my hair, it started growing back! So I let it do its thing. But my previously wavy hair started growing back super curly!\n\nIt was definitely an experience. As it grew back, I ditched my previous habits of heat treating and bleaching, and focused solely on health. No heat treatment, no color of any kind. \n\nNow, my hair is much longer, healthy, and much curlier. It definitely gets less curly the longer it grows, but that is a trade off I’m willing to take. \n\nI still struggle some days, but for the most part I’m very happy with how my hair looks and feels. My curl routine is as follows:\n\nClarify 1-2 times per month with v05 clarifying shampoo. Regular washes 3 times per week with all about curls low lather shampoo, and all about curls conditioner. \n\nI use all about curls gel on the lower half of my hair only, and all about curls mouse through out my whole head. I do this because the mouse is lighter than the gel and I’ve found it doesn’t weigh the roots down nearly as much. \n\nI sleep in a silk hair bonnet to minimize split ends. I’m going to continue growing it out, I think my goal is to eventually have it reach my elbows!\n\nFor anyone struggling with their routine or alopecia, give it time! There’s always hope ❤️",

Over the last year I let my roots grow out and decided to get my hair coloured to get a more natural look as I'm tired of re-doing the roots. The hairdresser I went to suggested to blend the roots and lengths of my hair with a sort of like highlights (she used another word but I forgot now). Anyway, here is a before and after of my hair:\n\n[before](https://preview.redd.it/lg2lre2gu80g1.png?width=442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56ce5a60ea3b1a3b6f0a5c080f43d4cd213e9bc1)\n\n[after](https://preview.redd.it/2glu3zwht80g1.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7e012a6b49a082fc53a258dae5bd5fb2c18d005)\n\nI have quite thin but long hair and wash it about once or twice a week. The ends are quite dry and had several split ends, eeek! I think I have combinational skin and my roots get oily after 2-3 days (not sure if this is normal or too quick).\n\nThe hairdresser suggested the FarmaVita Amethyste Color Mask and looking into the Lidl dupes of Olaplex as they're supposedly quite good. The question is, I know bleached hair is very porous so what products should I use to help avoid or stall the colour from fading? As well as help with the dry ends. I live in Europe so please keep that in mind when suggesting things.",

      "content": "Stopping Tretinoin for three months during pregnancy was a tough decision to make but the consequences were almost immediate: my skin was a shadow of its former self. The very fine lines on my face, which I thought were gone, started surfacing again. All this made me think that my skin had perhaps become very much dependent on the treatment. Is it true that “rebound dullness” is a phenomenon associated with stoppage or am I just imagining things? Some say that the benefits obtained through Tretinoin get reversed as soon as the treatment is stopped while others argue that the collagen constructed through the years remains for decades. I don't know what happens precisely at the cellular level when Tretinoin use is discontinued. Does the skin revert to its original turnover rate right away or does it slowly taper down? A question that pops up in my mind is that whether stopping suddenly is more harmful than reducing frequency gradually. For those who have experienced stoppage after long-term use, how long did it take for you to notice the first changes? And when you came back, did your skin need another adjustment phase or did it just resume from where it left off?",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

I honestly feel like I've seen no difference with the vitamin C or the eye cream, as I regularly have dark bags under my eyes. Also, cheeks easily flush but do not feel sensitive. I do Grace &amp; Stella eye masks on wednesdays and would love a good facial mask on Sunday. I just started using disposable facial towels. For makeup removal, I just have some Neutrogena HydroBoost remover towlettes, but will probably use Micellar Water after they're done unless there's a really awesome alternative. I wear makeup 1-2x/week. \n\nIt feels like a solid routine but could be ... better perhaps? Refined? I don't love the CeraVe tinted sunscreen, it makes me look more oily than glowy. The glycolic acid has done wonders for my facial texture. \n\nFeel free to critique and influence! I'd love some guidance on what seems good and what seems bad. ",
