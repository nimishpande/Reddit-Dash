      "title": "[B&amp;A] Forehead Closed Comedones &amp; Blackheads Progress",
      "content": "**Background** (feel free to skip this part): I had been suffering with closed comedones for years, starting since i was about 22 (I am now 26). When it first started, I admittedly did not have any skincare routine aside from the obvious facial cleanser (micellar water + face wash).\n\nThe first time I tried to get rid of them (2023), I was introduced to tret which fucked me up. I introduced a moisturizer with it and was using the sandwich method but fast forward a few months and my closed comedones were worse than ever (no pics since they are on my old phone). I used it as much as people were recommending (can’t really remember how many x a week now since its been so long) but i guess it damaged my skin barrier enough that my whole forehead was covered in clusters of closed comedones.\n\nAfter that, I was focused on just repairing my skin barrier and tried every ‘barrier repair’ moisturizer and every ‘non-comedogenic’ moisturizer in existence with no results. \n\nThe only thing that helped was monthly facial extractions - which was not ideal because I would be left with post extraction marks that took 1-2 weeks to go away, after which i was welcomed by more closed comedones (though never as bad as the tret aftermath) - and repeat.\n\nI know BHAs and AHAs are widely talked about here but after my tret experience, I was very reluctant to try any acids on my face in fear of damaging my skin barrier so I just kinda lived with it, getting monthly facials for god knows how long.\n\nI finally got tired of it and decided to buy Paula’s Choice 2% BHA, which is highly recommended on this sub, and the results have been amazing. I am beating myself up for not trying this sooner and for letting myself suffer for years before this.\n\n**Progress:** First pic is not anywhere close to what the worst of my skin has looked like but it’s the only one I have - keeping in mind this is 1 month after a facial extraction. Second pic is now - 2 weeks into Paula’s Choice BHA (using 1x/week). I know its annoying when people post pictures in different lighting but I took the first pic at some random place and can’t really replicate the same lighting - but hope it gives you the idea.\n\nI know its not yet perfect but for 2 weeks progress… I am shocked. As you can see, there are still some small bumps (blackheads/cc’s or whatever they are) but not obvious enough for me to feel the texture when i touch my face - which was my biggest anxiety trigger. Gonna keep this going and probably gonna slowly increase the frequency until I’m using it about 3x/week or every other day but I am for the first time seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n**Problem / Advice Needed**: I have been using a very lightweight non-comedogenic gel moisturizer (Skin Game Kind Watery Moisturizer) because I had always assumed it was comedogenic ingredients in cream moisturizers that clogged me up worse (e.g. think Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Moisture Cream). Now since using BHA, my skin is very very dry and it’s not that I have any issues with it right now but I’m pretty sure this won’t be good in the long run(?) - so any suggestions are more than welcome! I have also been thinking of adding an AHA (recently bought the COSRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid) but not sure if it’s a good idea.. please let me know what you think 😭",

Basically any tips, tricks, or advice from anyone here that has the same or similar hair type as me or anyone familiar with working with my hair type would be much appreciated.\n\nPhoto #1 was before I quit the constant bleaching and hair dye \n\nPhoto #2 is day one trying to bring out the curls \n\nPhotos #3 &amp; #4 are from today \n\nClearly something is happening cuz it’s curling’s heck of a lot more than when I started but I also am not feeling very confident with my natural hair texture so far and feel like I’m doing something wrong. \n\nMy routine currently is using the not your mothers curl talk line \n\nIn the shower:\n\n\\-I wash my hair/scalp every 3-4 days with NYM curl talk bond repair shampoo. About a half dollar amount\n\n\\- then I use the NYM curl talk 3 in 1 conditioner. About a quarter size amount \n\nAfter shower: \n\n\\- I apply NYM curl talk leave in conditioner (just a 2-3 spritz).\n\n\\- then I follow with about a golf ball amount of NYM curl talk mousse and scrunch it in once I work it thru my hair. \n\n\\- lastly I use a dime size of NYM curl talk sculpting gel and work it thru my hair and scrunch with a cotton t-shirt once dry I re-scrunch out the crunchy bits. \n\nRefresh days: a half dollar size of mousse on damp hair, re-scrunch, let dry then I scrunch out any crunchy bits. \n\nI try to diffuse on low heat when I have the energy but I get dizzy holding my arms up so long so I tend to air dry most days, and I do sleep with a silk pillow case (I don’t use bonnets because don’t like the sensory of something on my head while I sleep)  \n\nFor additional relevant detail/context, I have fine hair, medium density and high porosity.",

      "content": "have been on 1mg fin since january of 2023 and was on topical min from february of 2023 to august of 2024, saw amazing progress like all of my hair grew back. i then switched to oral min in august of 2024 (5mg) as it was getting annoying applying topical min to longer hair as well as concerns with a cat. I lost some of my gains but in retrospect i should’ve stayed on it and my hair looked great still. So in april of 2025 i switched back to topical min( grave mistake) as i thought the oral min was making me lose all my hair, i then went on to shed soooo much hair and realized you really can’t be on topical if you have pets as you will be stressing about it all the time. in mid july i switched back to oral min and my hair has not been growing back. at a loss of what to do and wish i never screwed with my stack. don’t know if i should hop on dut or go for a transplant, can’t tell if my hair is still minituarizing or if it’s just a minoxidil shed. \n\nit’s insane to me how i grew all of my hair back and hair loss was out of my head for so long and now it’s at the forefront again\n\nat a loss of what to do right now it’s been basically 5 months back on oral min and i don’t see any ré growth is happening or it’s hard to tell and i also feel like in the back of my head that the fin isn’t working, any of you guys have a story similar to this?",

It’s about medium length past my shoulders and thick. I’m not sure what my type is. My routine is shampoo/conditioner a curl can dream (the one for wavy hair). I detangle it in the shower and let it air dry once I get out.\n\nMy first problem is maintaining it. It holds waves pretty well even after a couple days, but they never look as good as they do when I wash it and let it air dry. Even if I don’t brush it the next day, it still gets really frizzy and tangly. When I do brush it, it gets even frizzier. So either way, it just doesn’t look very good after the first day. I’m not sure how to get them to hold better.\n\nMy second problem is hats. When I have breaks during the school year and over summer, my dad has me help out at his business. The requirement is that hair be up past your shoulders (in a bun since my hair is long) and you have to wear a visor. On the days I help, my hair gets flat from wearing it in a bun and I can’t figure out how to style bangs with a visor so I just tuck them in. I’ve tried tips from Google, and even my mom has tried helping but nothings worked! Is there any bun I can do that will preserve the waves better without leaving a weird dent? Any protective hairstyle? Any way I can style my bangs? Help!\n\nTLDR: How to make wavy hair last, how to wear wavy hair in a bun every day while keeping it healthy?\n\n- In the first photo, it is 90% dry and has no product.",

So NO conditioner and or hair mask whatsoever!!\n\nGRANTED that after the shower, you DO add moisture and hydration ect via leave in hair products? (I have no problem with that)..\n\nThe REASON I ask is because having a full wash routine has become very hard and too daunting to me 😔 I feel too severely depressed and too exhausted to do it all (condition, waiting, rinsing it out ect)...\n\nIs it okay to completely SKIP conditioner &amp; hair masks? I would like to SHAMPOO TWICE and be done with it!\n\nDoes anyone else do this? \n\nThank you!\n\n",

Back-story; I’ve always had a super sensitive face, like my upper cheeks just below my eyes get raw after lightly cleaning off make up with just water or even with micro. water — then the thought of washing my face and putting on lotion just makes my face hurt. This is my face tonight after washing it this am with Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser and then applying CeraVe Moisturizer. I just use my fingertips lightly and use a clean towel and pat dry. I feel like if I don’t wash my face at all it’s always clear it’s just dry and has oil in some places and develops buildup on my nose pretty quickly. It’s like this with basically any face soap and lotion I’ve tried, I’m not really too educated into a lot of face products, has anyone else had anything similar? 😭",

I’ve noticed recently that my pores have been bigger and more noticable. I’ve never really had visible pores, and I’m so scared I’ve done irreparable damage. What should I do? Should I back off the retinol or stop using it altogether? I thought I should note that I used the sandwich method at first (moisturizer before and after retinol) but have changed to using moisturizer only after applying retinol. I think this may be contributing, and I need to be moisturizing more; I’m just not sure if that will completely fix the problem.",

      "content": "Hello r/IndianSkincareAddicts,\n\nI'm a 25-year-old guy from Rajasthan with oily, acne-prone skin, old acne scars, and dark spots. For the past month, I've been using a simple routine, but the last 2 days I've got new breakouts only on my forehead (pics below, no issues elsewhere).\n\n**Current Routine:**\n\n* Cleanser: Simple Kind To Skin Refreshing Facial Wash, only when I feel dirty (not daily).\n* AM: Minimalist 10% Niacinamide Serum all over face daily. On alternate days (4-5 times total), swap for Minimalist 10% Vitamin C Serum instead (still apply niacinamide at night). Sunscreen when I go out.\n* PM: Minimalist 10% Niacinamide Serum all over face.\n\n**Recent Changes:** Attended a 2-day wedding, ate way more sugar than usual (sweets, desserts). Could that be the trigger? Or the serums/purging? Pics are current breakout only.\n\n**Goals:** Fix this, fade scars/spots, prevent more. Budget-friendly India recs welcome. Derm soon if needed.\n\n\\[Attach forehead pics here\\]\n\nTIA for advice!\n\n",
