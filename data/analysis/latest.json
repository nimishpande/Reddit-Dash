I get ropey waves\n\nSeparating them does nothing other than turn them in skinnier ropes waves and it just looks like I have dreads.\n\nI know my hair can not do this, as it's happened before, and that's because it was the 2nd day, I steamed my curls in the shower and ran my wet hands through them. Unfortunately no photo since it was a once in a lifetime experience I'm sorry.\n\nI don't know why we need to submit a routine just for basic help considering nobody knows wtf products we use if we're not from the US but hey! here you go:\n\n1. Sulkin volumising conditioner (protein) or garnier watermelon conditioner \n2. Redwon teatree shampoo (clarifier) or garnier watermelon shampoo\n3. vo5 megahold gel\n4. sometimes a leave-in conditioner on the ends\n\nOther methods I've tried:\n\n1. Scrunching conditioner in the shower upside down (no)\n2. Only using gel on the ends/mids (no)\n3. Not diffusing my hair (no)\n4. Diffusing my hair (no)\n5. Deep conditioning my hair (no)\n6. Not conditioning my hair at all, just shampoo &amp; gel (no)\n7. Separating my curls when wet or dry (no)\n\nWhat can be done 😭",

      "content": "My son has beautiful curly hair but it’s very fine and gets frizzy and tangly so easily. Is there any way to keep his curls mostly intact overnight? I’ve tried a bonnet, but they typically slip off his head while he’s sleeping so now I do a loose bun on top of his head. Sometimes in the morning, I can take out the bun, wet the hair that gets frizzy around his face and it’ll do in a pinch. If I want the curls to look nice again though, I completely wet it with water and leave in conditioner and comb it out. This definitely works, but I feel bad sending him to school with damp hair, especially in the colder months. Are there any other options to keep his curls overnight or to refresh them in the morning without getting his hair completely wet? Any suggestions would be so appreciated!\n\nI have straight hair and my husband has much thicker curly hair so these types of curls are new to him too so we’re both trying our best to learn as we go.\n\n(The first picture is of his hair still a little damp and freshly washed and the second picture shows his hair let down from sleeping in a bun and fixed up as much as I could without starting from scratch)\n\nOur wash routine: We wash with Honest shampoo and conditioner, then use finger comb through a bit of Alaffia leave in conditioner and let air dry. \n",

Ive always had parts of my hair that were a little more curly but its gotten worse. Here's some info in case any of this is important:\n\n*I'm mixed (half black, half white) &amp; in my 40s.\n*I do straighten my hair sometimes using a Chi Lava plate straightener which is at 250 degrees &amp; always use heat protectant.\n\nRoutine: I don't always use the same products &amp; don't always use a diffuser, but this was my routine today when these pix were taken. However this is an issue no matter what the routine is. \n\nSol de Janiero shampoo, Garnier Fructis Sleek conditioner in the shower. Sprayed a little conditioner/water mix &amp; used a detangling comb for detangling. Small amount of Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine for heat protection. Mizani True Textures Curls, Coils &amp; Waves for definition. Diffused until mostly dry (had to go somewhere &amp; was running late) with a TGIBedhead diffuser (dont know the name but its the one thats JUST a diffuser) on medium heat &amp; high speed.\n\n I'm including pix that show my whole head of hair also so you can get an idea how the majority looks vs the problem areas. I've spent my entire life figuring out how to work with my hair &amp; its still a work in progress so please be nice 🙏🏼. All pix are from today since I needed to include the routine. I would love to know any tips on getting the curl texture back or making them look better. Thanks in advance. ",

I am thinking of buying Mary Kay Satin Hand set again. I bought this 15+ years ago and I feel like it really helped my hands.

Any suggestions as to what may be a good cut? It’s just so flat and unfun. My husband says it’s beautiful and that’s great but it never looks great after attempting to style.

      "content": "Hi everyone, hoping for some help with my acne issues that have been on and off since I was a teenager (I’m now 37). The acne has gotten so much worse lately and I am at a loss for what to do to clear it. I’ll try to give as much info as I can if someone can maybe pinpoint why my skin is so angry right now. The first pic is from today, the other 3 are from Monday the 27th.\n\nAs mentioned I’m a 37 year old female. I live in a very dry cold climate with very hard water. I do notice when I go on vacation to more warm, humid places my skin usually clears up within a week.\n\nI did a round of Accutane in my early 20s which cleared my skin for about a decade. My skin is typically dry but oily at the same time. I have some ocd behaviors which lead to skin picking which I’m trying to improve, but I wish I just didn’t have any acne to pick at in the first place.\n\nCurrently using these products:\nAM:\n- Cetaphil Extra Gentle Daily Scrub\n- CosRX Centella Water Alcohol Free Toner\n- CeraVe moisturizing cream\n\nPM:\n- Anua Heartleaf Cleansing Oil (only if I’ve worn makeup)\n- Etude Soon Jung foaming cleanser\n- Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Toning Toner\n- CeraVe moisturizing cream\n\nI was also recently using (stopped around 3 weeks ago) the Etude Soon Jung 2x barrier intensive cream but started breaking out after using it for a few weeks and so discontinued. \n\nI also recently (around a month) stopped using the APLB Retinol Vitamin C Vitamin E Ampoule Serum and the ANUA Azelaic Acid 10 Hyaluron Redness Soothing Serum as I was concerned I was just overwhelming my skin and wanted to just go back to basics, but if anything it’s continuing to get worse.\n\nI’ve taken Minocycline for my acne which cleared it for a year but my GP didn’t want me to stay on it indefinitely and took me off a couple of years ago. Diane 35 also worked well for my skin for a few years but my GP took me off as I got older. I’m currently on PR Zamine (Yaz but not) which my doctor thought might help my skin but did not. \n\nI’m really hoping someone can point out something obvious that I’m doing or using that might be causing this because I don’t know what to do or change to help my skin. I feel like I’ve tried so many things over the years and everything has only worked temporarily. I’m so tired of having acne AND wrinkles now that I’m nearing my 40/. It doesn’t seem fair, and I also feel like this is my fault for not knowing how or what to use.\n\nI appreciate any input, genuinely. Thank you!",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

Really curious to hear what others think.",
