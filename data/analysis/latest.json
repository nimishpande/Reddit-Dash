      "content": "After weeks of scouring the internet and harassing chat gpt, I’ve finally decided to make my own post about this. \nThis is gonna be a lot, but after spending time on this thread I know I’m not alone at least. \nAfter three months of being off of birth control, I have decided to restart and am wondering if anyone has experience with stopping and restarting due to hormonal acne. \n\nFor context, I started taking hormonal birth control (single month cycle, can’t remember brand) as a teenager for moderate acne on face/chest/back. It helped back then and I continued that bc until about the age of 19 or 20. By that time I had developed PMDD, so my primary care provider prescribed me Simpesse (3 month cycle) to reduce the frequency of having to suffer through the luteal phase. My skin was pretty clear while on it but still with the occasional breakout/ cystic acne. \nI stupidly decided to stop Simpesse in July as I was having breakthrough bleeding randomly and wanted to see how my body would do without it. \nJuly and august I had normal and surprisingly tolerable periods, but was still getting the occasional cystic acne so I decided to ask my dermatologist about spironolactone. \nLess than two weeks into September the breakouts began. It was chest and neck at first, mostly closed comedones and papules. By late September my skin was the worst it had ever been and I thought it was due to the spiro, so I weened myself off. \nTwo weeks after stopping the spiro my skin started to clear, but since then it has only gotten worse. Never in my life has my skin been this bad and it’s now my face, neck, back, and chest. Objectively my acne may not be considered severe, but it is taking a serious toll on my mental health, especially since it coexists with the pmdd symptoms. \n\nLong story short, for the sake of my mental health I have decided to restart Simpesse. I’m a week back on the pill and the acne is still getting worse. I’m hoping this is a “gets worse” before it gets better situation, because I can’t take looking and feeling like this much longer. \nHas anyone restarted birth control or used spiro in conjunction with birth control to speed up the process of rebalancing hormones? \nAnd what potential topical treatments or lifestyle changes have you made that helped move things along? \n\nI am currently doing: low sugar, no dairy, no gluten, minimal egg, no caffeine, no alcohol, drinking spearmint tea, drinking decaf green tea, I’ve been trying salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide seems to make it worse but maybe I need to trust the process. I am using a very basic cleanser and moisture with spf. \n\nI’ll attach some progress pictures. First is late September (what I thought was the worst), mid October (2 weeks off spiro when it started to clear), and now currently. Any advice welcome, I’m desperate lol. ",

      "content": "my skin (oily in summers, acne-prone, often hormonal, clogged forehead and cheeks, dry in winters) was doing so well back in september of 2025. then the weather started getting colder- the snail mucin moisturizer i used wasn’t moisturizing enough. so i had to switch to a thicker cream, like every winters. last winter i used nivea creme, and it worked wonders for me. my routine was- tret (prescribed) once a week, and himalaya aloe vera face wash, nivea creme. pretty basic and drugstore. but this was back in another country which was suuuuper dry. then i came back here, to delhi NCR region. now winters were a struggle. nivea creme broke me out, so i switched to nivea soft. \n\nworked fine for the longest time, then summers came this year and i switched to snail mucin cream. the first two photos are of that- my routine included- \n\nAM-\n- simple face wash (WRP)\nconsious chemist niacinamide + txa + alpha arbutin (still skeptical about this)\n- snail mucin cream (costs a lot, prolly gonna get sebamed clear gel next summers)\n- sunscreen (re’equil ultra matte dry touch) (WRP).\nPM-\n- face wash \n- deconstruct 0.2% retinol 1% peptide (twice a week)\n- salicyclic acid minimalist (once a week)\n- snail mucin cream\n\nthen came colder weather. snail mucin wasn’t enough, so i was looking to go back to nivea soft. but that gave me textured and bumpy skin, closed comedones esp on my cheeks are around my mouth. made my skin look dull. so i looked up some moisturizers and tried foxtale purple one. broke me out more. then i gave it away and after a lot of anticipation, got bioderma atoderm creme ultra- since my skin is technically dry in winters? but now this is my current skin. doing weird things, reddness, dullness, breaking out cystic. i don’t know what to do. \n\nany suggestions could help. i was thinking maybe the serums are the issue but they worked fine in summers? the only thing i’ve changed is moisturizer. and i’m sick of purchasing things. \n\nadditional info:\ncetaphil never worked for me, always broke me out. both the DAM and lotion. gave them away last year too.

      "content": "Hello everyone.\nSo long story short I went to a hair salon with my MIL who knows the owner well and told me I could trust her. She did my colour, I usually dye my hair bright red (I get the products myself online and mix a good red base with a pure red mix), have been doing that for years without any issues. I told that hairdresser and showed her pictures and she said no problem I got the colour, let me take care if it.\n\nIn passing I heard her say \"burgundy\" and for a sec got worried. I told her again, no other colour than red, showed her my MIL tee shirt that was bright red and said that colour, nothing else.\nYou can guess where I am going. She does the colour, washes my hair and I end up looking purple ... Like bright Aubergine/eggplant purple. You should have seen my face... The hairdresser was asking why I looked so grumpy and that the colour was nice.\nNeedless to say I will never go there again.\n\nNow to my hair question. I am not a pro with colours other than red. I have been told that if I apply red right away on my hair now it will not look good as in the purple there is probably some black/blue color that will react with the red and give a weird mix if I apply the red right away.\n\nIs there a way I can \"cancel\" the purple? By apply an other colour that negates it or bakances it? Or do I apply the red right away? Will it work?\n\nThanks again for any tips and advice",

(In her defense, it sounded like an emergency.)\n\nShe's out of the office for a couple of weeks, and I really want to start using it now, so here I am.\n\nIs it okay to use my regular gel moisturizer with this? She did tell me to wash my face as usual and apply the acid, but she didn't tell me about my gel moisturizer. I use CeraVe everything. What order should I apply the acid and the gel if I can use both? And should I use a stronger than usual sunscreen? I know some facial acids make you burn more easily.\n\nAny and all help/advice would be super appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",

Now that I'm older this all kind of blurs together, its easy for me to remember distinct products/looks/etc- but lately I am finding that I simply cannot remember the website that all these youtubers were using and recommending.\n\nIt was veryyyy similar to Ulta and Sephora, but they had smaller indie brands (I remember they were one of the few places to sell lime crime), and I believe a pink design/theme. I am almost convinced that it was based in the UK or AUS and they shipped worldwide, I also believe they had the word \"glam\" somewhere in their name or logo. \n\nI'm mostly looking for nostalgia, but also because it was great to be able to buy all the different brands in one place. I've checked out Beautylish and Cult Beauty, they seem super similar to this website as well. Does this sound familiar to literally anyone or am I going crazy?",

Some times it’s looking incredible and hydrated and soft (for me, which still has never been as soft or hydrated as I’ve liked), other times it’s dry and crunchy mess. \n\nI used to wash every 3 days but due to a sensitive scalp with buildup and dry/flakiness, my stylist recommended I wash every other day. Currently I am using my custom Prose set for shampoo and conditioner. About 2x a month I use my Prose pre conditioner treatment. I also use Aunt Jackie’s Quench leave in conditioner on wash days. I air dry, always. \n\nI know my shampoo and conditioner are probably the biggest causes of my dissatisfaction with my hair, but honestly I would love to start over with a whole new routine from scratch. \n\nI am considering using OrganiGrowHairCo gold bundle for low porosity. I used it back in college (platinum bundle) and it really helped moisturize my hair, but always left it a bit greasy. Any other suggestions out there?",
