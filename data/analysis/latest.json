She makes me so happy I won't lie, but I can't help stop thinking about the fact that I'm balding.\n\nI went for a haircut for the first time in a year and I cut my hair extremely short but was still noticeable and did a fade. I looked so good especially when the barber added fibre which made my hair look fuller and darker. She saw the pictures and complimented my hair and how I look, but that only made me feel worse cause the fibre did the heavy lifting. She doesn't know I'm balding and I feel like if she finds out, she might become less attracted to me. I doubt it but it is a worrying feeling.\n\n\nI hate balding. I miss going for haircuts or being confident to go outside without a hat. I see so many guys with nice hair and beautiful girlfriends and I can't help to feel so much envy. I sometimes feel like crying but fin/dut/min is keeping me going at least. The hope that they will work is what's keeping me together even though it's not guaranteed it'll work. \n\nI'm just so tired.",

The replies to that post were very helpful and I wanted some help on choosing some alternate products or sticking to this routine.\n\n- Moisturizer: should I stick with the ponds or switch to minimalist b12 since I'm using niacinamide and need to protect my skin barrier?\n\n- Sunscreen: this is where I am facing the biggest confusion (so are others when I searched this sub lol), I initially decided to go with the regular minimalist spf 50 but then I found out it has retinol in it (seperate thread on that later, because that makes no sense) which is a big no no with the other actives I'm using so decided to switch to the light fluid one instead. I've also heard korean ones are good as well as reequil ultra dry matte but there's so many choices and not enough budget to go around so please help me choose one :\")\n\nI hope y'all can provide a overall verdict on my routine, I'm scared and excited to be starting this journey for the first time after decades of tanning and negligence of my skin \n\nSee you on the other side 🤎",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

This product is actually a 2 in 1 because not only does it soften your hair it does shape your curls.\n\nAfter that I put on curling gel, I specifically use Marc Anthony Strictly Curls gel. \n\nThen I diffuse. First I use the highest heat possible then when my hair is half dry I go to medium heat. This is to prevent my hair from getting too dry from being exposed from the highest heat for too long.\n\nThen to break up the case made from the gel I use Ciliganic Moringa oil.

      "content": "Hello hair professionals and hair lovers. I am begging for some advice from a hair specialist regarding my girlfriend’s hair. See- she is a “masculine” presenting lesbian with hair that ends right at her shoulders currently. She has asked me to help her choose a new hair cut because she’s gotten quite bored with the current style. The thing is- I have a shit ton of frizzy, wavy/curly THICC hair. She has (and I say this with the utmost respect) the FLATTEST SPINACH HAIR IVE EVER SEEN. I can’t even describe it. She doesn’t even use conditioner yet her hair is always soft and glossy. She’s never had to straighten it EVER. And if we try to put her hair in a ponytail the ponytail just… slips off. Honestly sometimes I am jealous by how effortlessly beautiful her hair looks but it’s also the most frustrating hair texture I’ve ever seen. We tried curling it and not even a minute later her hair was flat again. So now I’m asking the hair gurus for some advice. What haircut can she get that would be something different for once yet still look good in a professional setting (she works as a public servant in an office so she can’t look tooo crazy) ",

I'm a 31 year old male who smoked cigarettes from 16 to March of 2025 and have basically never done any form of skincare. I used to (think) I had great skin and would receive compliments on it occasionally as well, but I know now more than ever that was due to smoking and my skin was probably not really healthy at all. I quit smoking about 10 months ago I have gotten non-stop painful zits all over my body since. I get them on my head, my face, my neck, my arms, chest, legs, butt, and almost everywhere else. It's like every week one or two new ones appear somewhere. Has anyone else experienced something like this after quitting smoking? I've read that this can happen after quitting but from what I read it should of stopped after like a month or two. It feels like my face and body are being destroyed with red scars that are left after they've popped/drained.",

      "content": "I’ve been struggling with acne for years now. About two years ago, I was prescribed isotretinoin, which unfortunately led to severe depression. I only realised the connection after the course ended, when I finally began to feel like myself again. At the time, I was assured by the dermat that the acne would not return.\n\nHowever, it has come back, and this time, it feels worse. It seems hormonal, especially since I also have PCOS. I recently sprained my ankle as well, so my regular exercise routine has been disrupted, which may have contributed to the flare-up.\n\nRight now, I’m using the Effaclar serum from La Roche-Posay at night, along with a few topical creams prescribed by my dermatologist. She is now suggesting a chemical peel as the next step.\n\nTo be honest, I’m feeling quite exhausted and overwhelmed by the process. I double cleanse at night, religiously follow AM-PM skin care regimes - will this never go away?\n\nWhat has worked best for you if you have faced similar issues?\n\nTL;DR: Acne has returned after isotretinoin (which caused severe depression), likely hormonal due to PCOS. Current topicals aren’t helping much, dermatologist suggests a chemical peel. Feeling exhausted and unsure how to proceed.\n\nPS. Clicked this picture on one of the better days unfortunately ",

I think this is the best my hair has ever looked, really wish I had more pictures with it. Switched bc my hair started feeling really greasy and product heavy to the point I was washing nearly every day.\n\nPic 2: Cantu leave-in conditioning repair cream, Cantu coconut curling cream, and Aunt Jackie's flaxseed elongating curling gel.\n\nThought these products would stretch my curls more but somehow the opposite happened. Heavy, greasy feeling was even worse than previous routine. Look wasn't bad, tighter curls are just not what I'm going for personally so certainly not worth washing every day for.\n\nPic 3 (Current routine): Carol's Daughter devine strength leave-in cream, Not Your Mother's Curl Talk defining cream, and LA Looks extreme sport gel.\n\nGreasy feeling is gone and I'm back to only washing my hair once or twice a week. My hair is stringy and frizzy however. Any hold I get is lost within a few hours and my hair is left a frizzy mess because my gel won't leave a cast at all with these products under it.\n\nSo either my hair feels bad and I have to wash constantly but it looks the best it's ever looked, or my hair looks bad but feels okay. Do I just suck it up and accept the greasy hair? Any other product recommendations or styling tips?",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "I have developed what I THINK is nodular/cystic acne (not sure which) at age 37 and it’s giving me hell. The hyperpigmentation is so bad and it’s resistant to literally everything. Ive read through most posts here about it but Ive already tried all the solutions offered; \n\nLasers, peels, micro-needling, PRP, IPL, RLT, high frequency, dermarolling, peptide injections.\nI’m on HRT and all my levels are good, including birth control, which I’ve been taking for 20 years. It’s not tied to my period, not limited to my jawline.\nI’ve tried accutane, epiduo, antibiotics, zinc, DIM, histamine blockers, cortisol shots. They will work occasionally or for small windows of time and then either backlash or stop working. \nIve seen 3 doctors, plus homeopathic specialists and estheticians.\nI rarely wear makeup, I have 5 pillow cases and buy new ones AND a new pillow once a month. \nI never touch my face, I don’t pop them, I use differin acne patches. I get regular facials. \nI don’t eat dairy, and rarely sugar or any processed foods at all. I have no gluten intolerances or gut issues. \nIm not on any other medications, I don’t take any other supplements. \nI’ve tried all the actives, all the exfoliants, all the acids, most make it worse.\nAnd I drink lots of water.\n\nThe only thing that gives me a window of relief is foaming cleanser, double wash, cica spray, b5 serum and high frequency wand, every day twice a day. But even then it’s like holding back a wave, and the same spots keep erupting again and again. Any effort to reduce the HP is thwarted by more eruptions. \n\nDoes anyone have any secret they’ve been gate keeping? Is there anything out there I haven’t tried? I’m at a loss, my skin is getting worse and I don’t know what to do. It feels like I’m being punished for escaping puberty with nice skin! \n",
