      "content": "Early male, 20s. I have two toned lips but nothing really helped with that pigmentation, so I'm not gonna talk about it and I made peace with it. I'll review the spf and non-spf ones separately:\n\n#SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Chaptex spf 15 🟢\n\n- My derm prescribed me this when I had extremely dry and cracked lips (turned out to be cheilitis)\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, no fragrance, doesn't taste bitter, has humectant (D-Panthenol)\n\n- Has only spf 15. I see most people suggesting to use at least spf 30 or higher. I wish they made a spf 30 version\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##2. NMFe spf 40 🟢\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, has slight fragrance (I like it), has humectant (aloe vera extract)\n\n- It tastes bitter, that's the only complaint I have\n\n- Overall: 9.5/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##3. Sebamed spf 30 🔴\n\n- Has slight fragrance (didn't like it), very expensive, wasn't that moisturizing\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##4. Minimalist spf 30 (not in the picture) 🟢\n\n- Super cute packaging (but the lid broke after a few months 🥲), fragrance free, has humectant (Hyaluronic acid)\n\n- it's waxy, not quite easy to spread\n\n- Overall: 8.5/10. Will probably repurchase.\n\n___\n\n___\n\n#Non-SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Vaseline lip therapy Creme Brulee 🔴🟢\n\n- The caption under it says *for deliciously kissable lips* which hurts even more because it reminds me I have no-one to kiss 😭💀\n\n- It smells exactly like the Vaseline lip therapy cocoa butter one, it's very hard to differentiate the smell. Quite moisturizing, love the smell obv\n\n- Little heavy on the pocket (probably because it's imported?)\n\n- Overall: 8/10 (subtracted 1 for the caption). WNRP\n\n___\n\n##2. Vaseline skin protecting jelly (indian version) 🟢\n\n- Almost every Indian household has it lol. It's good, does its job\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##3. Vaseline BLUESEAL pure petroleum jelly (imported) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT! I wish they sold this here in India everywhere instead of the skin protecting jelly\n\n- I bought it from Amazon but I was skeptical initially because of the picture the seller put on Amazon lol.\n\n- It's AMAZING! Seals the moisture very well and I also use it for slugging in the night. It's smoother and more buttery compared to the Indian version we get\n\n- I don't use it on the lips alone, I'll be mentioning my current routine which is helped me the most at the end of the post\n\n- Overall: 11/10. WRP! HG\n\n___\n\n##4. Nipcare 🔴\n\n- Bought it at the expense of weird looks from the pharmacy guy (didn't know it is used by lactating mothers for sore nipples)\n\n- It smells really awful (Lanolin, can't complain), didn't really do much for my lips and it's also not easy to spread it\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##5. Laneige Lip sleeping mask (berry) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT 🐐 helped me so much with my dry lips. Not a big fan of that smell but it doesn't bother me. Leaves a white film on lips and I rub the entire thing off in the morning after waking up and there you go, plumpy soft lips!\n\n- It's probably a little overpriced but it lasts really long so can't complain ig\n\n- Overall: 10/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##6. LRP Cicaplast B5 baume 🔴\n\n- I didn't know you can also use it as a lip balm until I read some of the comments here but it didn't do anything for my lips and they felt even more dry in the morning \n\n- it's good as a barrier repair cream tho, helped me with redness and irritation near nose corners when I increased my tret frequency \n\n- Overall: 0/10 for lips, 8.5/10 for barrier repair\n\n___\n\n##7. Vaseline lip therapy tin (cocoa &amp; original) 🟢\n\n- It was a pain in the a*s to open the packaging but I bought the original one recently and it was super easy to open. Glad they changed its packaging (not sure about the cocoa one tho)\n\n- It's thick, does its job as an occlusive\n\n- Both of them are good. The cocoa one smells heavenly but I personally found the original one to be better.\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##8. Vaseline lip care total moisture (tube) (not in the picture) 🟢🔴\n\n- I love the smell, it's amazing! Very glossy finish and hydrates well. Affordable!\n\n- Hard to apply with that spherical base and I don't like touching it \n\n- Overall: 7/10. WRP\n___\n\n##9. Nova ayurvedic cream 🔴\n\n- My grandma suggested me this one. It's good with the hydration part but the fragrance is veryyy heavy and the lips kinda burn initially after application \n\n- Overall: 3/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##Current routine:\n\nAM: NMFe\n\nPM: Laneige lip sleeping mask + Vaseline BLUESEAL \n\nThis routine helped me so much with dry lips. But not applying lip balm for even 1 day makes my lips dry again. My derm suggested that I use lip balm at least thrice a day and asked me to reapply whenever they felt dry. \n\n___\n\n##HONORARY MENTION: Brillare natural coconut lip balm \n\nWHAT DO I EVEN SAY? Hate is a strong word and I hate this lip balm with a passion. The texture of it is ugly af, it literally sticks to my finger. It smells like shit. I have tried applying it only once and was weirded out with the texture but still wanted to try and apply. This idiot doesn't even spread, it's that thick and sticky. THE WORST LIP BALM I'VE EVER SEEN 🏆",

I then used my bounce curl to curl each section and finished by defusing my hair. \n\nI still see a bit of frizz at my root so I probably needed a bit more gel there. But over all I’m happy with how my hair turned out for last nights event. \n\nI will say my day two hair is still struggling a bit especially at the root but it was extra foggy this morning and wet so that probably did me in.

      "content": "Hello my fellow curlies!  It’s been a long couple of years trying to figure out how to manage the chaos that is my curls, but I’m finally figuring it out!  The biggest thing I’ve learned is to not fight what your hair naturally does.  For years I was self conscious about how flat my cowlick is.  So I put way too much emphasis on volume and that caused years of bad frizz and was just way too poofy.  My hair dresser has helped immensely with figuring out my routine.  Chat GPT was also a game changer as well.  \n\nAlright so let’s talk about the routine.  I use Ouidad vitalcurl shampoo.  Right now I’m on day 4 without it, yesterday I used as I am coconut co wash and honestly I probably won’t need to shampoo for a couple of days.  When I shampoo or co wash; I use verb hydrating conditioner after.  And I’ve learned to always always always apply leave in conditioner while still in the shower.  I use Sheamoisture leave in conditioner with Jamaican black castor oil everyday.  I very gently detangle with a detangling brush when I use my leave in.  After that I take a handful of water and scrunch upwards.  The detangling brush just ensures that the product is evenly distributed, and be gentle when detangling curls, cannot emphasize that enough.  \n\nAfter the shower, I use a microfiber towel as little as possible.  I only use it when I have drops of water falling out of my hair while getting ready for the day.  So I’ll just lightly push upwards to give it a light scrunch as gently as possible to remove that excess moisture.  And then I just try to avoid touching my hair as much as I possibly can while it’s drying.  In the past I have used deep conditioner and olaplex no. 3; the routine I’ve had up until about a week or so ago was probably the only reason I needed that stuff.  I probably won’t need it anymore.  \n\nThe only hard part of my routine now is just trying to avoid getting the leave in into my roots, when that happens my scalp just gets kind of itchy. But today I think I figured out the trick, had almost no itchiness.   \n\nNow I just need another year or two to pass to get my hair at the length I want.  Figuring out the right routine was the hardest part.  Now I just need to continue the good habits and I’ll have my dream hair in a matter of time, I’m super excited!  ",

I’ve used 2 colour strippers in it from the colourless brand and I’m happy that it stripped most of the pigment but as you can see it’s still there. I used schwarzkopf live purple and pink in the permanent option on my natural dark blonde hair. However I have a trip in January and wish to get foils to maybe achieve a honey blonde. But I don’t know whether that’s possible or recommended since it might damage my hair or simply not work. If that’s the case is there any solutions I can use to strip the colour out completely or should I just wait it out?",

After a lot of researching and trial-and-error, I’ve realised that my skin barrier is probably damaged, which might explain why my skin is constantly oily no matter what I do. I also have these lines on my forehead and around my brows that never seem to improve.\n\nI’ve tried applying moisturiser on damp skin, but it didn’t really make a difference. I also started using the iUNIK Beta-Glucan Power Moisture Serum about a week ago, but so far I haven’t noticed any changes. I’m not sure if I should keep waiting it out, but honestly, I’m starting to feel pretty discouraged.\n\nI’m also wondering if I should stop using a cleanser in the morning since it might be too harsh and making things worse — but at the same time, I’m worried that not cleansing will just clog my pores and cause breakouts.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar or found products/routines that actually helped repair their skin barrier? I’d really appreciate any advice.\n\n\nCurrent routine\n\nAm \n\nNuetrogena hydrating facial cleanser \nBeta glucan power moisture serum ( on damp skin ) \nPurito oat in calming gel ( 2-3 min after serum )\nCosrx lightweight sunscreen \n\n\nPm \n\nNuetrogena hydrating facial cleanser \nLactic Acid 5% ( only on Sunday, Wednesday and Friday )\nBeta glucan power moisture serum ( not applied when applying acid ) \nPurito oat in calming gel ( 5 min after acid ) \n",

The blackheads just won’t disappear and I’m constantly oily, I use oil removal papers on my face but these don’t stop the oil production.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

As you can tell this is too much in the way of moisture; my hair is soft but frizzy (even when wet), is not very defined, is rubbery after being washed, and mushy after being wet, and unless I am mistaken these are all indicators of a lack of protein. I cant get rid of the sheamoisture and Cantu at this time, so i thought j might as well solve the other issue. what are your recommendations for a protein masque and conditioner which balance cost with effectiveness?

I told them I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts, especially from oil-based products. The one I ultimately decided on was this one:  \n[MECCA COSMETICA To Save Face SPF50+ Matte Sun Serum 50mL | MECCA](https://www.mecca.com/en-nz/mecca-cosmetica/to-save-face-spf50-matte-sun-serum-50ml-I-070609/)\n\nI liked it cuz its feels light on my skin and not greasy at all.\n\nThough what I have noticed is that after using it, I get these small white heads. **I'm not 100% sure if its from this sunscreen** but I've just noticed a correlation. They don't turn into massive pimples and don't last very long, but still extremely annoying as I can't seem to find a sunscreen that works for me.\n\nI also use 5% benzol peroxide wash and the \"Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Nourishing Cream\".\n\nI have also seen something that I should be exfoliating to avoid these kinds of pimples but not sure.\n\nDo you think it could be from this sunscreen? Any advice is greatly appreciated.",

But even after consistent use, I've only seen moderate improvement. Basically, less everyday break outs, which is the bare minimum to expect from a cleanser. But the blackheads, closed comedones, and occasional bad whitehead still stands undefeated, so I was wondering what you guys would recommend.\n\nMy daily routine is\n•CeraVe SA Cleanser\n•Naturium 10% Glycolic Acid Resurfacing Gel\n•Glow Recipe PHA+BHA Toner\n\nSometimes on a bad skin day I'll use the Clear Pore Benzoyl Peroxide Mask from Neutrogena without the SA cleanser to try and draw some of it out, as well as an occasional scrub to get some extra dry skin off. Recently I've been prescribed a tretinoin cream by my dermatologist, which has had some moderate success on some body acne. But when I used the cream on my face, even without the SA cleanser, my skin got irritated and broke out worse than before. Basically, all attempts have proved to be at most moderately successful, damaging at worst.\n\nI would love to see what you guys have to say or recommend, and if it's anything I haven't tried before. Give me your best shot ❤️",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
