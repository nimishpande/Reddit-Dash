      "title": "Updated curly hair routine, in the hopes it will help someone! Can be found under the photo",
      "content": "Hello hello! If you're here then I'm assuming you've come to look for my hair routine and what I do to get results like these, and you've come to the right place!! It's taken me over a year to figure out how to look after my hair because I'm the only one in my family with curly hair, but thanks to my lovely friends and tiktok of course, I've been able to get better at doing it! I've got a long way to go to find what works for me but here is my latest curl routine.\n\n1. I start by wetting my hair in the shower. Then I detangle. I only ever do it when it's wet and as soon as I'm able to run a brush through my hair without it catching, that's when I know I'm good! \n\n2. I then double shampoo, the first time being to get rid of any gunk or whatever on my hair, the second time to actually clean my hair properly. The first time, I use head and shoulders because that's what my dad buys and it cleans my scalp nicely, and the second time, I go in with a hydrating shampoo. Currently I'm using the one by Phyto. \n\n3. I go in with some Sukin Hydrating Conditioner.Thiw is an Australian brand so you may not have it where you are, but I find this works for me really well. If not though any old hydrating conditioner will do. \n\n4. Depending on how dry my hair feels, I sometimes go in with a bit of a hair mask by Tsubaki. I'm not really sure which one or where to get that because it was a random one my mum didn't want and have me but as with all my other products and things I use, any old hair mask will do! \n\n5. Sometimes I like to use a Denman brush to brush style in the shower. I do this and then make sure I don't disturb the curl clumps before I get out of the shower. Recently though I've taken to using a dupe of the Bounce curl brush that I found at City Beach for $10. If you decide to use that, it can be done in or out the shower, but if out the shower, it should be done after resetting and applying leave in and curl cream. \n\n6. After getting out of the shower, I use a bit of Garnier Aloe Vera leave in conditioner. I don't like to use too much because I don't like when my hair feels product heavy but feel free to experiment with how much you need! \n\n7. Then, curl cream. I like the one by Hask. I only ever use the teeniest tiniest amount to again prevent my hair being product heavy, we're talking a literal smudge for each section of hair. I don't always section but if I do, then it's into top and bottom and left and right. if not though I just use a slightly bigger smudge of curl cream and add it into my hair \n\n8. I plop my hair in a t shirt until it's 50% dry. I don't own a diffuser and don't intend to get one because I don't like the idea of heat damage, but I do fine without one anyway! Plopping helps my hair hold its shape a bit before I add gel to set it \n\n9. After plopping, I go in with gel. I use a decent amount on each side because of course I've taken my hair out of its sections and it's just left and right, and I'd describe it as how much you'd put if the gel were moisturiser for your face if that makes sense? And I never rake it through. I use praying hands and then scrunch my hair to really get it in there. Lately I've been using the one by Umberto Giannini but I also love the one by Cake! It smells absolutely delicious \n\n10. I leave my hair to air dry and then I'm done! I try to avoid touching it as much as possible. Then once it's dry I scrunch out the gel cast with my hands and separate any huge curl clumps. And that's all! I typically wash my hair every four days because I can't stand leaving it any longer but it lasts me well provided I take the time to do a good job\n\nI hope this helps someone here!! Any questions feel free to ask me!! ",

      "title": "Help me, my curls keeps falling flat ☹️",
      "content": "(Btw first picture is how my curls looked in the summer, second is how it looks now, and third is all the products i use. Oh and this isn’t my hair, i’m a hijabi so I can’t show my hair but this is very very similar to how my hair looks and looked)\n\nSo I have what I think are 3a curls. For my whole life, I just thought I had frizzy straight hair until people told me I should try a curl routine. Last summer, I finally tried curl cream and mousse. Surprise, surprise, it actually looked nice for the first time ever! I went down a total rabbit hole wanting to define my curls even more. Since my hair was down to my butt, I decided to get a layered cut to help with definition.\n\nI went to a hairstylist while on vacation in my home country. I only asked for a layered cut, but she ended up pressuring me to blow dry and straighten my hair. I caved and did it, even though it totally defeated the purpose of me going to the salon. When I got back and washed it, I expected my curls to bounce back, but they didn’t, they just stayed straight. I waited, thinking they’d come back, but fast forward seven months and my hair is still only slightly wavy and barely curly compared to how it was last summer.\n\nI don’t think it’s heat damage because my hair is still very soft, I get regular trims, and I haven't used heat since I was 10 years old until that one day. Before the cut, my hair was straight in length and I had plenty of bouncy ringlets. Even before my hair dried, the curls would be pretty prominent. Now that I have the U/V shape layers, it’s done the opposite of what I wanted. I have maybe 2 ringlets in the front of my shirt that falls flat as well after a few hours. I’ve been told by some people that it’s the cut, and by others that the salon straightening ruined my pattern.\n\nAt this point, I’m just trying to make my curls look good again. Whenever I style it, it looks okay ish right after I put products in, but after a few hours of air drying, it falls flat and looks more wavy than curly. I sleep in a bonnet using the pineapple method, but by the second or third day, it falls even flatter. By day four or five, it looks like 2a waves if I'm lucky. It’s so frustrating.\n\nFor my routine, I shampoo twice, use a hair mask for 20 minutes, and then the blue Skala conditioner. Out of the shower, I use the orange Skala leave in, curl cream, style with the Bounce Curl brush, and finish with mousse.\n\nBack in the summer when my hair looked best, I only used cream and mousse, no masks or leave ins. so I don't know if I'm weighing it down or if it's the lack of a diffuser and gel. My mom won't let me buy or use gel because she’s convinced it bad for your hair.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to make my hair hold its shape for more than a few hours? Thanks 🥹🙏",

I'm 6 months post-op from my hair transplant in Turkey and wanted to share my research process since I see a lot of questions about going abroad.\n\n**Background:** 28M, Norwood 3, been on fin for 2 years which stabilized things but wanted to address the temples. Got quotes from 3 US clinics ranging from $12k-$15k for \\~2500 grafts. That's when I started researching Turkey.\n\n**My Research Process:**\n\nI spent 3 months comparing options. Here's what I looked at:\n\n**Turkey Options I Researched:**\n\n* **Smile Hair Clinic (Istanbul)** \\- 4.9/5 on multiple platforms, 4900+ reviews\n* **Vega Hair Clinic (Antalya)** \\- Solid reputation, beach location was tempting\n* **MediHairs (Istanbul)** \\- Good reviews, slightly higher price\n* **ꓧеаꓲtһꓧор packages** \\- Found them through Reddit actually, they work with vetted clinics and handle all the logistics ([https://healthhop.com/hair-transplant-turkey-exclusive-package/](https://healthhop.com/hair-transplant-turkey-exclusive-package/))\n\n**What I compared:**\n\n* Surgeon credentials (this is CRITICAL - don't just go for cheapest)\n* Actual before/after photos (not stock images)\n* What's included (hotel, transfers, aftercare)\n* Technique (FUE vs DHI)\n* Reviews from multiple sources (Reddit, RealSelf, Google)\n\n**My Decision:**\n\nEnded up going through ꓧеаꓲtһꓧор's all-inclusive package ($2,700 vs their regular $3,300 - caught a promotion). Here's why:\n\n1. They pre-vetted the clinics (saved me anxiety)\n2. Everything coordinated - hotel, transfers, translator\n3. 24/7 support (used it twice, super helpful)\n4. Same surgeon did my entire procedure (some clinics use techs)\n\n**What was included:**\n\n* 3 nights at a legit 4-star hotel\n* All transportation (they picked me up at airport)\n* The actual procedure (\\~2800 grafts, they went higher than estimate)\n* Post-op kit and meds\n* Follow-up care\n\n**6 Month Results:**\n\nNot gonna lie, months 2-4 were rough (shock loss, ugly duckling phase). But now at 6 months I'm seeing real density. My hairline looks natural, not pluggy. Still have 6+ months of growth to go but already worth it.\n\n**Cost Breakdown:**\n\n* Turkey (ꓧеаꓲtһꓧор): $2,700 all-in\n* Flight: \\~$800\n* Extra expenses: \\~$300\n* **Total: \\~$3,800**\n\nvs US quote: $12,000+ (just the procedure, no hotel/travel included)\n\n**Saved: \\~$8,200**\n\n**Would I do it again?** 100% yes. But DO YOUR RESEARCH. Not all Turkish clinics are equal. Some are hair mills. I spent hours reading Tressless posts, checking doctor credentials, and comparing options.\n\nHappy to answer questions. Also still on fin (1mg daily) and added min to the routine post-op.\n\n**TL;DR:** Did extensive research, went with vetted Turkey clinic through medical tourism coordinator, saved $8k+ compared to US, 6 months in and results looking solid.",

Once they had a little natural length, I soaked them off, then got a gel manicure on the natural nail with some cute designs.\n\nIt’s been about a week and I already had three nails break/peel, several are cracking, and most are super bendy. I know one salon visit isn’t going to undo 25+ years of biting, but it honestly feels like the acrylic set and then gel set made already thin nails even weaker.\n\nI’m thinking I need to go back to basics: let them grow under regular polish and forgo enhancements for now. I’m going to the salon today to get plain polish, but I’d really like some advice on pre-treatments or strengthening routines I can do before or ask them to do first.\n\nSo I guess my questions are:\n\n• Any recommended brands or products (serums, oils, hardeners, etc.) that helped you?\n\n• Any salon-appropriate preps or in-chair treatments I can request?\n\n• Should I avoid certain salon services while building strength?\n\nIt’s discouraging to see progress and then have them snap off, so I want something that actually helps instead of just masking the problem.\n\nThanks in advance!",

After washing my face, but before applying moisturizer, my cheeks and the lower half of my face would feel tight. I would then use CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion for normal to dry skin.\n\nA few weeks ago, I switched to the CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser for normal to dry skin because I thought it would help with the dryness and tightness.

      "content": "Please help y’all I cant for the life of me find something that my hair actually soaks up. It takes me like 3 hours to do my hair and it’s always a let down because it never comes out juicy. I’m currently growing out my keratin treatments for the first time in my 23 years of life. I have never dealt with my natural hair, I’ve gotten relaxers and keratin treatments my whole life. It’s impossible to deal with its always poofy, the front doesn’t curl its just a poof mess. I’ve tried miche gel and it works a but better than anything else but it still doesn’t help the front clump up and curl.\n\nMY ROUTINE: I don’t really use any curly hair shampoo and conditioner. I use whatever shampoo I find in the bathroom (ik tragic) and I skip conditioner and just go in with  Manuka Honey &amp; mafura oil Intensive hydration hair mask by shea moisture , I steam it with a steamer especially my roots. then I either use jamaican black castor oil strengthen and restore leave in conditioner by shea moisture . If I don’t style then I wait for my hair to air dry and put in a single braid. If I do style, I go in with miche gel in sections, focusing on the roots, and use a define brush. I have to force some type of curl in the front bc it just frizzes up and even when i force a curl it’s an extremely poofy curl in the front. In this particular pic I actually just twisted the fronts and when it dries I separate them a bit so they don’t look like just twists only in the front lol. Then I defuse and I make sure to focus on the roots first so they dry first before anything else. I have low porosity hair so even defusing it takes like an hour because it just takes forever to dry.  At night I use a silk bonnet, and silk scrunchy when i pineapple it.\n\nIdk how to refresh my hair without ruining it either lol so I literally just wet everything, brush it out with any conditioner (i dont have a specific curly conditioner) so i’ll just use the maracuja skala in the shower and rinse it out, and then do the miche gel steps again and defuse.\n\nI have two different curl patterns currently (thank u keratin treatments) so I just need help making the roots juicier and not as dry looking as I transition back to my natural hair. My mom is lowkey my biggest hater when it comes to my hair so I just want to prove her wrong that I can take care of it and I can make it look good.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

I have fairly dry/damaged hair due to all the styling I did before, and live in a very dry climate. I feel like I have a fairly good wash day routine going, as I'm always happy with the look and feel of my hair after wash day. However, the morning after I wash it, my hair seems to have lost most of it's volume, and kind of mushed together if that makes sense. What can I do to fix this? Routine/care below, thank ya'll!: \n\nShampoo with camille rose black castor oil shampoo, then follow with Camille rose black castor oil deep conditioner for 20 mins. Rinse that out, then apply a small amount of Camille rose black castor oil +chebe buttercream as a leave in on wet hair. After that, I scrunch in camille rose curl maker gel and spiked honey mousse, and diffuse. Then, I break the cast with an oil, usually the cocoa nibs and honey oil from the same brand. I sleep in a bonnet, and refresh my hair when needed in the morning with the camille rose honey dew liquid moisture refresher. I usually wash my hair every other day, sometimes every 2 days.",

So recently I visited my dermatologist again after seven months, so she said that I have a lot of acne  scars. That is why this problem is looking more dominant and again, she suggested me to use retinol and asked me to done have some procedures done like micro needling  and chemical peels and also said only applying topical will not help me. I should go for some chemical treatment as well.\n\nShould I change my dermatologist and consult someone else? Or stick to this one and apply the topicals like retinol and nicinamide which are prescribed and i also use sunscreen daily .\n\nMy primary goal is to have an even skin texture and tone, like I want my face skin tone to be somewhat similar to my natural skin, which is on my chest and other body parts.\n\nSuggest me what should i do!",

Since we moved to an apartment with very hard water 2 years ago, everything got even worse.\nThe routine that makes my hair look like in the picture:\n- L'oreal Glycolic Gloss Shampoo, Conditioner and 5-minute intense hair lamination\n- Brush hair with conditioner in it, Plopping and  then air dry\n(From one of my other posts in this community I was being told that I maybe use too many after shower products (incl gel) and should focus on shower care and masks and maybe try something with Glycolic acid to help with the hard water issues. Thats why I skipped all hold products to see the \"ground state\" of my hair, which is Hagrid..)\n\nI have issues with my scalp so I can't do the cgm without shampoo or just co-wash since my scalp is falling off from this (tried several times within the past 10 years). My hair also dries sooooooo slowly (10-14 h) and if I add hold products like gel it takes even longer. Once there is slight humidity outside, my curls basically look like the picture again. Since I have a very busy work week and also do cardio several times per week, I usually only get 2-3 hours per day after work, I just gave up on these extensive curl routines after showering because they were draining the life out of me even more 😅\n\nIm just so fed up of never having a real hairstyle and never really being able to wear my hair down. I feel like my hair just massively downgrades my overall looks which is dragging on me lately 😅\n\nIs there really no solution to make my hair somehow look acceptable without having to spend tons of money or invest many hours per week? If anyone has been at my point and can offer any advice, I would be so thankful..",
