      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m helping a friend with skincare and could really use recommendations.\n\nHer main issues are:\n• Sensitive skin that burns/stings easily\n• Redness &amp; flushing (especially within ~20 mins of waking up)\n• Bumpy skin texture (not traditional acne, more like rosacea bumps)\n• Oily but dehydrated (she looks oily but feels dry underneath)\n• Lives in a humid climate, so heat makes flushing worse\n• When she stops using products, skin gets dry very fast\n\nCurrent routine:\n• AM: rinse with water → Aveeno Calm + Restore Oat moisturiser → Biore UV Watery Essence sunscreen (has to use a thick layer otherwise skin feels dry/dehydrated)\n• PM: Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser → Aveeno Calm + Restore Oat moisturiser\n\nObservations:\n• The Aveeno moisturiser calms, but doesn’t hydrate long-term or help with redness.\n• Most other moisturisers she’s tried don’t hydrate well or make the flushing worse.\n• The Biore sunscreen seems to calm redness, but doesn’t hydrate and likely contains alcohol, which feels drying and may worsen barrier damage.\n• She avoids strong actives but still always feels dehydrated, flushed, and heated.\n\nWhat she’s looking for help with:\n• Product recommendations that work for rosacea, sensitive, and dehydrated skin (especially hydrating + calming)\n• Rosacea-safe sunscreen options that don’t dry out or sting\n• Suggestions for improving the skin barrier\n• Any routines or must-avoid ingredients\n\nThanks so much in advance!! Any help would be incredibly appreciated! ❤️",

(pics 2 and 3 were rn)\n\ni really feel like i fucked myself over. i would do almost anything for my skin 5 months ago. i dont know if the tretinoin is helping (0.025% dosage), and my skin feels inflamed and disgusting all the time.\n\nroutine\n\n* wash face with orien oil cleanser over sink (dry face)\n* get in the shower and rinse it ALL out\n* sandwich method cetaphil moisturizing cream ultimate with .025% tretinoin\n\nthats literally it. i stopped with the q tips (pic 4) at the end of september until yesterday when i got a 300 pack from amazon. its so tempting and i know it fucks my skin over, but i dont know how to get rid of the sebum plugs. i feel like if i leave em my pores will stretch but if i extract them they will do the exact same. i dont know how to remove them, and its a mix of sebum and keratin plugs. they are hard, and im not sure how to get rid of them since i have sensitive-ish skin)\n\nplease forgive me i am an academically stressed out teenager.",

      "content": "I hate being ugly. I hate the fact that i don't have any photos of myself that I like. I don't have any photos with loved family members that I like. I hate the thought that if they died and all I have to look back on is a photo with them but not likening how I look. I hate how I sound so selfish when saying this because they are much bigger issues in the world than what I look like. I can't tell what's true and what's not. I will look in the mirror one hour, the next I look completely different. I don't know what I truly look like. I feel like a beast. I would be one of the witches in one of the old movies. It makes me go insane not knowing what I look like. And it may not make sense to anyone else, they say look in a mirror or get a photo taken. But I look different in every single one. I hate the fact I can't just walk down the street without being conscious of how everyone is staring at me and they are all thinking the same thing. How can she be so confident when she looks like that. I fake my confidence. I have no idea how to truly act or be. I can't explain my feelings it only truly makes sense to me. I remember being 5 years old in primary school looking in the bathroom mirror wondering why I'm so different and why nobody likes me. And still to this day I think the same thing. My brain feels like it's going to explode. It's been such a big thing for me that consumes me every single day of my life. Life would be so much easier if I was naturally beautiful. I think back to my first ever childhood best friend. She was perfect. She was skinny, she had the prettiest face, a tiny nose, thick dark brunette slick straight long hair, the bluest eyes, normal ears and a pretty smile, an amazing jawline and a tiny chin. Me on the other hand, I have frizzy curly ginger hair, I have a weird lob sided jaw, I have a huge chin that sticks out when I smile, I have a huge bridge nose, tiny brown eyes, deformed ears, im fat and pale. Teachers always saw me different too. I was the ugly duckling. And because I was so quiet that didn't help either. So I would always observe every little thing and I guess over the years I put it down to me being unattractive meant nobody would ever like me. I tried lots of different things to change myself. Dye my hair, use fake tan, change my style, straighten my hair, use makeup, not eat anything to loose weight. So on so on. Nothing ever worked. I was always seen as the quiet weird ugly kid. In high school things got worse. Even my own best friend saw me as ugly then. That hurt the most. Having her blank me in class because she was with the pretty popular group and I wasn't apart of that. I'm crying my eyes out writing this. I guess my brain coming the the conclusion that the feeling will never go away. Knowing that I've tried for years hoping that maybe it's all a false illusion when it clearly isn't. Knowing that for the rest of my life I'm never going to have photos of me to look back on where I look pretty. It kills me. Being a teenage girl on a night out trying to enjoy herself with someone you thought was your friend and being called ugly by some stranger on the street. Being a teenage girl and only ever being used for your body for sex. Never being truly liked as a person. Never truly being seen as pretty or beautiful. Never having a boyfriend. Never been in love. Never been loved. Makes you question what's wrong with you. Knowing you have the sweetest souls ever and is kind to everyone and is never mean to anybody yet being treated the worst. My dad said I got scouted to model as a kid. He turned it down as he wanted me to have a childhood. Now I'm grown up I wish he took that chance. Maybe I would had saw myself as beautiful. Or if the modelling industry is just as bad they scout people who look different and I'm not actually beautiful. Do people stare at me because I'm ugly or because I'm pretty but quiet and mysterious and they wonder what a girl like me is living so ordinarily for. I don't know maybe that's the other side of my brain being delusional to survive and have a different outlook on things so I can survive. People say looks don't matter but they do. They impact everything. Every little thing. No matter how busy I make myself to distract myself from my appearance it never goes away. I see everyone else as beautiful though. I love humans. Humans who are kind anyway. Travelling around the world makes you see things differently and makes you appreciate what you have a lot more. I have so much yet why can't I be happy with myself. Seeing other girls my age, being able to go out and enjoy life and take photos and kiss boys, they are all so photogenic. Why not me? I feel like a waste. It's like I'm in a prison cage locked behind a window constantly watching others but never able to join in. I can't speak for the life of me. Why can others do it so naturally. It just makes me question myself over and over until I have a meltdown and harm myself because I hate myself so much. I feel like I'm trapped inside my body and can't escape. And time just keeps going fast and faster and I feel so lost. Like I'm missing out on so much life even though I am living. I wish I could make sense of my own brain.",

I feel like a lack of proper nutrition could be one of the reasons but I also don't have any solid skincare routine too. I dont use sunscreen rn because what i bought didnt work and i dont know what to buy. Minamalist one was too heavy and i got pimples. MY FACE AND NECK ARE 2 DIFFERENT SHADES . I also tend to pick my skin a little i think that explains the many mark of my forehead...but in general I have many small bumps on my forehead. I also feel my face needs hydration!!\n\nReddit pls help me.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nNeutrogena gentle cleanser\n\nI was using simple moisturiser but it's done...tried using niven light and aveeno moisturiser but its too heavy. Might repurchase simple but feel free to suggest a better one.\n\nLooking for affordable options...within 400 500.\n\nThank you!",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "Hi all, I am a 19 year old college student who recently began a combination of the typical doses of oral minoxidil and finasteride.\n\nTo those wondering, I did initially experience adverse side effects, like decreased libido and ED (at 19, crazy right), but they have since gotten much better 😉\n\nMy medication trajectory played out just as you might’ve imagined; I began and experienced an insane shedding. Now, keep in mind that I decided to take action against hair loss early; I probably could have gone another year without even noticing I was balding. However, I decided to be proactive. So I ended up losing a ton of volume in my hair, which stopped after about two months of constant shedding.\n\nSince the shedding stage stopped, I noticed small, ever darkening baby hairs growing at my hairline—I had hope. I felt that I was taking control of something that many cannot. However, I got ahead of myself.\n\nMonths have gone by, and I have noticed a gradual thinning of hair all over the top of my head. This has made it so that my once thick and luscious hair is now the consistency of thin strands of spaghetti. On top of this, it appears that my hairline is continuing to recede. The only affected (noticeable) parts during my initial shedding stage and overall alopecia before beginning the medication cycle was at my temples, or the corners of my hairline. I have since noticed that the mid section of my hairline is gradually going backwards. While there are many nearly invisible baby hairs growing here, I am very discouraged at the moment. The hair regrowth i experienced at my temples is also receding—but not as you might think. Somehow, the initial hair that has already began regrowth remains, but the hair behind it is receding?? I don’t get it. You can see it in the series of photos I’ve attached.\n\nToday marks month 5 of treatment, on the dot. I don’t know how to explain what’s happening because it’s truly been a rollercoaster. I don’t know if this is expected or if the treatment is even working at all. Did I experience a temporary positive from the minoxidil? Is the finasteride not slowing recession at all? I would love some sort of explanation or comparison if anyone here has any words to offer from their own experience or an actual scientific explanation.\n\nIf anyone can offer any words or advice or simply an explanation, that would be much appreciated. I truly thought this was going well and that starting so early would be a plus, but it doesn’t feel like it.\n\nThank you. If you have questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.\n\n5 MONTHS IN 🫡",
