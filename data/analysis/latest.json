      "content": "I have heard that blowdrying your hair can cause heat damage, and that products to prevent heat damage can cause build-up on the hair that can weigh it down and make it seem limp and heavy. I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

I apply Cantù leave in coconut deep conditioner while my hair is still super wet, I section my hair but not too seriously.

      "content": "I genuinely don’t know what I’m supposed to do anymore. I have tried everything. I used every stronghold gel on the market and yet my hair turns straight. Most curlyheads rave on about getting a poofy mess in the morning after waking up when mines the complete opposite, I wake up with thin pin straight hair and if I don’t add water or some type of leave in conditioner, it will be stuck straight forever. Is my hair some type of hybrid???\n\nMy routine:\n\nI shampoo and condition once a week using the based shampoo and conditioner. Then I style with either the As I am bond leave-in or the based leave in followed by the based curl creme and gel. I usually like to switch it up and use different products such as multicultural curls or pillow soft curls from miss jessies or something like the bee girl gel from doux.\n\nI also co-wash once a week using the based conditioner and following it with the same routine above.\n\nFor every product I usually scrunch it in or brush style, but if I’m feeling fancy I’ll finger coil(this takes WAY too much time though).\n\nTo protect my hair while I sleep, I use a silk bonnet but sometimes I get lazy and just sleep without it, I don’t think this really matters because I also use a silk pillowcase.\n\nFor drying, I diffuse my hair until it’s a complete gel cast and I scrunch it out with this generic jojoba oil from my local dollar store. Sometimes if I’m in a rush, I just diffuse until its at least 50% dry and just it air dry for the rest of the time(still using oil after tho).",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I don’t need super heavy repair — I mostly want to keep my skin regularly moisturized so it stays comfortable and calm.\nIdeally, I’d love something that is vegan and cruelty-free, but that’s not a strict requirement if the product is really good.\n\nMy biggest issue: I absolutely hate the feeling of lotion sitting on my skin. I’m looking for something that absorbs very fast, is not greasy at all, and leaves no residue — basically that “is it even there?” feeling (if that’s even possible 😅).\nIf you have any recommendations for lightweight, fast-absorbing body lotions, I’d really appreciate it.

      "content": "Hi all! Just posting a victory really. Yes I still bleach and dye my hair. As much as I love my curls, I love changing colours more. I’ve learnt how to do this without (completely) ruining my hair and I’m proud of myself for it. \n\nWhile my routine works, I would love some advice as I do wash my hair 3-4x a week, and I’d like to cut back on my wash days. I just feel my hair gets too greasy if I don’t. \n\nI usually wash twice a week with a clarifying shampoo, then a colour and/or curl protect shampoo. Any other wash day I just use my curl protect shampoo. Sometimes that’s Aussie, sometimes it’s the Loreal Elvive “Extraordinary oil”. The latter smells amazing!\n\nAfter washing these out, I use L’Oréal Elvive dream lengths or the extraordinary oil conditioner, sometimes I use both. I’ve never had my hair feel so nourished apart from this shampoo! I might also use a Garnier Hair Food mask if I’m gonna be in the shower for a long time. The cocoa butter “curl-restoring” is my fave.\n\nTo dry, I leave my hair soaking wet, section so that there’s a triangle at the front, and clip that up. I use one of those pronged curl brushes to brush through Umberto Giannini’s curl activating mousse, then massage that in, then use a tshirt to scrunch my hair. Once I’m happy with how my hair looks scrunched, I use Umberto Giannini’s Curl Jelly/scrunching jelly (pretty sure it’s the same thing as the normal one but I use the vanilla gelato scented one), then I diffuse my hair on high until bone dry. \n\nRepeat with the triangle section of the bangs.\n\nIf I want to save my curls for the next day, I sleep with my hair casted. I use Aussie’s “Work that Curl Oil” to break my cast. \n\nIt’s taken forever to find a method that works for my waves that I’m happy with! I’m still learning too, eg like cutting down my wash days, how to protect my wavy hair while sleeping (pineapple method is NOT working), and how to keep my curls fresh the next day. After I break my curl cast and sleep sometimes they lose 50% of their volume so I’m still learning how to fix that. However, I’m happy with my progress! ",

      "content": "I had a whole mental breakdown in 2020 during quarantine and went complete buzz cut. yeah it looked good etc. but that's not the point. as it grew back out I kept the sides short. it was like that for years until my family started telling me \"your brother's wedding is in a year you should grow your hair back out\" and I realized I'm not about to wear a wig to his wedding so it's basically gonna grow back out. I never ended up going (money) but continued to grow it back out. I was using argan oil on the roots after washing and conditioning to help. At one point ordered Spoiled Child so it can grow faster. Eventually getting into the awkward phase, I used smaller curlers to keep them stay tame. If I didn't use curlers ...well ....I'd have a frizzy head. The strip down the middle of my head is still curly. the sides....not so much. I'd have 2C hair on bad days and 3A hair on good days. But the sides? A constant \"tucked behind the ear and stuck\" look. I want my curls back! I feel like if I'm not artificially curling the hair on the sides, they're not gonna curl anymore. It's not straight hair just....goes out into a weird arch around my ears 😐\n\nRoutine for reference: I've been mostly using OGX shampoo and conditioner and Shea Moisture curl cream afterwards with Shea Moisture frizz serum as well. I'm down to using Tresemme shampoo and conditioner plus Cantu curl cream cuz I can't afford any decent product right now. Back when I was working in 2022-2023 I would use Nexxus. That's so far been my favorite brand. I don't wear a bonnet to bed. I hate things touching my neck, forehead, and ears (got a bit of the 'tism) and I don't have a silk/satin pillow. I've tried the cotton T-shirt method to dry overnight and it still doesn't stick.\n\nMy question is, did I mess up by continuing a buzz cut on the sides and letting the rest of my hair grow normally after a full buzz cut? Did that, by any chance, have an effect on how curly my hair is going to grow back out? If so, what can I do to get it back? My hair is now layered from ear to shoulder length. Somewhere between short and medium hair. I would post pics but I want to stay private. ",

      "content": "\\[Acne\\]\n\nI (23F) am suddenly experiencing a significant increase in acne on my back and chest (mainly my back), which began about a month ago.\n\nI used to have pretty bad acne and frequent breakouts all over, but that was years ago. For the past four years, my skin has remained about the same. I still get acne, but it’s much less frequent — just the occasional pimple or breakout here and there.\n\nAbout a month or so ago, I started breaking out and noticed an odd amount of pimples on my back and chest. At first I thought it was just a breakout, but it hasn’t cleared up — if anything, it’s gotten worse.\n\nThe oddest part is that I’ve actually been leading a healthier lifestyle during this time. After New Years, I did a detox and completely cut out refined sugars, wheat, most dairy products (just a little grass-fed butter here and there), and alcohol for a few weeks. At first I thought maybe it was just my skin reacting to the detox and flushing out toxins, but it’s gone on too long for that to be the case.\n\nI have since ended the detox but am still eating healthier and drinking much less frequently than I used to. I shower daily (unless it’s a day where I’ve just been sitting at home and haven’t sweat at all), workout, use unscented soap, and wash my sheets and clothes very frequently. I also recently started washing my body after I condition my hair, since I saw a post where someone said they didn’t realize their conditioner was causing backne for years (though this never seemed to cause backne for me before).\n\nFor body skincare, I keep things very simple. I use a benzoyl peroxide wash on my back and chest, avoid harsh or scented lotions, and only moisturize if I’m feeling dry (occasionally beef tallow). I’ll use Bio-Oil here and there on older acne scars, but nothing heavy or fragranced. This routine hasn’t changed recently.\n\nThe only other change I can think of is that I started a new probiotic around the same time this began. I originally started it to help with recurring yeast infections/BV, and it does seem to be helping with that, but now I’m wondering if it could somehow be contributing to the acne.\n\nAm I missing something? Any ideas as to what might be causing this? I’m genuinely at a loss at this point. All of my skincare and most of my habits have remained the same, and the only changes have been healthy ones.\n\nTYIA 🙏\n\nTLDR: Suddenly having back &amp; chest acne beginning over a month ago even though the only changes I’ve made are healthy ones. What could be the cause?\n\nEdit to add: any product suggestions are also welcome :)",

I moisturize head to toe immediately after every shower and without fail I’m back to being uncomfortably dry an hour later. And if I go too long without moisturizing I start flaking so much I can see dead skin all over my clothes. It’s gross. Ive tried an array of different body oils paired with lotions and body butters and I’m tired of buying things that aren’t working🥲 the most success I’ve had so far is with the la roche posay triple repair lotion, but I go through each bottle so quickly and it hasn’t been great for my budget.

I’d really appreciate hearing from people who have actually used GHK-Cu before.\n\nA few things I’m especially curious about:\n\n• What skin concerns did you use it for, and did you notice visible results?  \n• Any common mistakes beginners make with this peptide?  \n• How do you usually store it to keep it stable?  \n• Did you experience any irritation or purging in the beginning?  \n• Is it better suited for certain skin types?\n\nFor context, I have oily skin and I’m mainly interested in overall skin health and texture.\n\nNot looking for medical advice but just real user experiences so I can make informed decisions.
