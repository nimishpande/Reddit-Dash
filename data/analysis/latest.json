First two pictures are pretty quickly after I’ve brushed it but the last two are what it looks like most days due to my lack of knowledge. For reference my hair is board straight, like it air dries straighter than some people after a straightener. So I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing with my daughter’s curly hair. \n\nI’ve got good product I think, color wow spray. And I know to spray it wet before brushing (now…) but halfway through the day it’s always frizzy and the curls fall out and lately she’s getting BAD knots and some matting. The day starts good but I’m clearly doing something wrong. \n\nWe wash it 3 times a week, more or less is better? We use fairy tails curly Q shampoo conditioner, is that good? Does she need a silk pillowcase? Some kind of bonnet (if she’d even wear it)? Do I need an unbrush? Why is it so frizzy halfway through the day and how do I fix it?",

All of this has lead to a lot of hair fall. I used to have thick, long hair and now I’m left with barely a third of it. \n\nI tried rosemary oil, hoping it would help with regrowth, but it only caused more shedding so I stopped using it. Everything I read suggests “managing stress” and “regulating your nervous system” but I don’t know where to start. \n\nI’d like to focus on: \n\n1. Learning how to regulate my nervous system and manage stress \n\n2. Regrowing my hair\n\nIf anyone has any advice for me, I’d be so very grateful 🌸",

      "content": "Long story short, I took oral Fin for 7 years until it seemed to lose efficacy.  I have been on oral Dut for almost 3 years and still losing ground quickly.  I have a constant itch in the balding areas but my derm has confirmed that there is no inflammation, no dermatitis, no dandruff, etc.  My derm has suggested that my genetics are simply pulling me down the baldness path and that he can't help any further (I'm also using keto shampoo, laser cap).  Other than increased estradial, my bloodwork is all good.  I've been considering a topical adunct treatment such as Pyrilutamide or Alfatradiol but I'm not sure why one might work better than another.  When I research both products, both seem to offer a different type of assistance.  For an itch and constant miniaturization, why would one work better than the other?  Curious if anyone else had to make a similar decision and how it went.  ",

Before, they only showed when I’ve been eating out a lot but now they’re consistently there. Could it be from my lactose intolerance or iron deficiency?

I mostly have dry skin except I’m oily on these two problem zones (T zone area). \n\nMy current skin routine is\n- oil cleanser on my t zone (kose)\n- gentle skin cleanser (cetaphil)\n- cosrx aha/bha toner\n- cosrx snail mucin 92 or equate/ponds dry skin facial cream\n- bondi sands sunscreen",

It does a great job at maintaining my curls. But the front of my hair and curtain bangs often get stretched out from the scrunchie meaning I have to redo them in the morning, which is frustrating.\n\nI’ve tried just putting my hair in the bonnet with no scrunchie, but it didn’t work and just made my hair look like a mess.

I’m thinking maybe the Elizavecca products are adding too much protein to my hair but for a while they made my hair very soft and healthy feeling. \n\nSo, I’m wondering now - do I get another haircut and stop using products with a lot of protein, while incorporating the mask more?

It’s gotten a little better into my 30s with finding products that work for me. I have mild acne with some blackheads most of the time but have been getting 8-10 zits that are painful the week before my cycle. It hasn’t been this bad in years. It feels like by the time I get my skin back together it starts getting bad again and it’s so frustrating.\n\nWondering if I should change my skin care for the week or two before? I have historically oily skin but live in a drier climate now so would say more combination. My skin seems to like gentler products like oil cleansers, hydrating toners, and lighter moisturizers but willing to try anything to make this better. Also would love recommendations for spot treatments while I work on figuring this out. Thanks!",

My hair is not so greasy anymore, and it feels great. But now I have a new problem.\n\nI live in a hot country (37°C currently here, and it's not even summer yet), I workout every day, and I also already sweat a lot. Think \"armpits get soaking wet if I just laugh too much\" kinda sweating. \n\nSo even if my hair isn't greasy, it itches and smells. And now that weather is hot again, it's unpleasant for me and everyone around me. \n\nBut back when I'd wash it every day, I'd get really greasy hair by 5pm. I really don't want that anymore. \n\nWhat do I do? Anything obvious I'm completely overlooking? If it matters, I do oil every 4 days for about an hour before washing, and when I wash it's about three rounds of shampoo, and then conditioner. I don't straighten or curl, and I often keep my hair in a half-assed french braid after it dries. ",

My skin is combination but errs on the side of dry. It is not sensitive and I rarely have acne, except for this texture. I moved from a very dry climate to a humid climate about 2 years ago so I’m thinking that could be a factor. \n\nMy routine is simple\n\nAM: \n- Cerave hydrating face wash\n- Cerave spf 30 sunscreen before applying makeup\n- seldomly will apply vitamin c serum but not consistent enough to make a huge impact\n\nPM:\n- double cleanse with Beauty of Joseon cleansing balm and Cerave hydrating face wash\n- Rhode beauty hydrating milk and barrier cream\n- 1-2x a week 0.25 Skinmedica retinol complex\n\nWhat do you recommend? I suspect I am missing an active to tackle this but I’m hesitant to introduce without putting some solid thought first. \n\nTIA!! ",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

It’s gotten to the point that I can’t tell if it *is* actually wavy or if it’s just dry/damaged at the ends. (As I’ve been told children’s hair often is) \n\nThe very front section of her hair is smooth and straight but everything behind her ears isn’t, even after it’s brushed.\n\nI’m not so much bothered about it “looking nice” (she’s a toddler, any “style” becomes a victim of her abundant energy!) I just want to make sure I’m caring for her hair properly, as I know wavy hair needs more TLC than straight.\n\nAt the moment our “routine” is we use Johnson’s UK baby shampoo and a children’s conditioner because without a conditioner it’s incredibly frizzy and knots. I’ve also had to incorporate Johnson’s UK baby leave in conditioning sprays because once her hair dries it tangles very quickly. We air dry because she is terrified of a hairdryer!\n\nI’ve attached photos of her hair after it’s been misted with water (and brushed through). ",

      "content": "I got my hair cut on Saturday.  My husband and I have been seeing the same guy for ages and he always kills it with my hair!  Don't know what happened this time.  Maybe we got to talking and we just weren't paying attention, maybe I just didn't notice it before I left the salon, I don't know.  I'm usually really good about saying \"Hey, this looks a little off, can we fix it?\" if I see something that doesn't look right, so this is definitely an oversight on my part, not my barber's.\n\nI usually wear my hair down, but the first picture shows kinda what my bangs look like right now with my hair up.  Second pic is how I normally wear it, I ran my fingers through it and positioned it to where you can see the lack of angle or blending.  Third pic was taken earlier this year.  I chose that one specifically because that was exactly one week after getting it cut and it's grown out a bit.  Notice how the bangs are blended and tapered.  Same barber.\n\nMy question is... What do I do here?  I feel like there's not enough length on them right now to properly cut and shape them, but they're really bothering me (I'm also luetal right now, so every tiny thing is driving me absolutely banana sandwich).  My husband doesn't go back for a haircut for another three weeks (we go together), so I'm looking at possibly having to deal with this until the 22nd.",
