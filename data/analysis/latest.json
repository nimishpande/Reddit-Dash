      "content": "Went to a dermatologist for a full skin exam since I‚Äôm a new patient. I brought up my concerns - uneven skin texture(no acne), fine lines starting on my face and neck, under-eye puffiness, smile lines, and wanting more hair volume(no dandruff or other conditions), laser hair removal, and laser and LED devices uses and benefits for me.\n\nHonestly, I got almost nothing out of the visit except a prescription for tretinoin (which I specifically asked for). No suggestions on procedures, skincare routines, or new technologies that could help. I left feeling like dermatology visits have become quick, transactional stops, easy money for minimal insight.\n\nI do not understand why dermatologists don‚Äôt prescribe certain treatments unless I insist. Most of the time, they just tell me to buy products over the counter or give me specific instructions written on sticky notes, rather than providing a prescription. Strange as it is, I feel like I visited a medical intern rather than a qualified doctor. Is it common amongst dermatologists to not bother unless it's a concerning skin disease?\n\nSo now I‚Äôm wondering: if not a dermatologist,¬†**who‚Äôs the right person to talk to**¬†about real, customized solutions, whether it‚Äôs treatments, procedures, or tech-based options for skin and hair?\n\n* Cosmetic derm?\n* Aesthetician?\n* Med spa provider?\n* Plastic surgeon?\n\nCurious to hear what‚Äôs worked best for others who‚Äôve been in this ‚ÄúI want to age well but don‚Äôt know where to start‚Äù phase.\n\n  \n",
