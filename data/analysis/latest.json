I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

My leaves in are applied by mixing the leave in conditioner (nickel sized amount) with the hair honey (a pump) and apply it everywhere but my scalp, taking a pump of the coconut milk oil and apply it everywhere I put the conditioner and hair honey, and then mix a quarter pump of each oil to out on my ends and scrunch. Every 2 weeks I use organic coconut oil everywhere but my scalp and use argan oil on my scalp. I wash my hair every 3ish days and let it air dry.\n\nMy hair is very dry, it MATTES into itself if I do not use my leave ins, even with conditioner in the shower. It is a nightmare to detangle, even with my detangling brush.\n\nI tried diffusing once but it didn't seem to work. As long as I use my leave ins, it is easy to brush when dry but it goes straight (barely wavy).\n\nI have satin pillowcases and I own a satin bonnet but I can't find it at the dollar moment.

I own a Dyson and that used to work great but one section down and my hair was BRITTLE (which I guess is par for the course with bleached hair but I guess as a baby blonde I panicked a bit). I rough dried a bit and then just put it in a silk bonnet and I’m heading for bed\n\nI’m terrible at doing a blowout but I’ve heard that’s the best method to get your hair looking nice. What would you guys recommend? Also does anyone have any good recs to get a nice lift at the root? My hair has always been pretty flat on top haha\n\nFor products I always use a leave in conditioner on the ends, heat protectant, scalp serum and hair oil to finish it off. Any other recommendations to not look insane tomorrow? Thanks everyone!",

I might just be going through a hating my hair phase, so maybe I need to just be talked off the ledge a little bit or given more ideas.\n\nMy curls are between 3a-3c. Right now it just reached shoulder length after I cut it to a chin length bob back in September of 2025. I am just unhappy with my hair, as many of my curls used to be kinkier and I had a lot of volume. I have gotten highlights in my hair in the past, but I have a great hairdresser and I noticed minimal to no damage in my hair. I typically keep up with my maintenance cuts whenever my bangs reach my eyes, but unfortunately I have hit a financial block, so haven’t been able to since my last cut in 2025.\n\nMy routine is filled with Moroccanoil everything, and I love them. I use their shampoo and conditioner Volume line, I use their Smoothing Lotion, Morocannoil Treatment, and their Voluming Mousse. I typically run my fingers through my hair with the Smoothing Lotion, then crunch the oil and mousse into my hair as I hang my head. I let my hair air dry. I put the oil treatment in my hair when I go to sleep, while also wearing a silk bonnet every night.\n\nMaybe I need a new product, or maybe I should cut my hair shorter, like a pixie? I’m just stressing out because I’m unhappy with my hair, and my hair is super important to me and my image!! Please lend me your thoughts and advice if any. Thanks everyone!!!!\n\nEdit: added more info to my routine!",
