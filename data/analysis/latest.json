If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I’m 30 years old, male, and I have very rough hands because of my job. I work as a firefighter, and due to my passions—sports and working on cars (mechanical work)—my hands are very rough. They are always clean. I place great importance on keeping my hands hygienic and clean. Especially with regard to my girlfriend, I make sure my fingernails are always trimmed and clean, just like my toenails.\n\nWhen I compare my hands and fingers to those of other men, I have the feeling that my fingers simply don’t look very nice. On the sides, both left and right, there is noticeable callus, which is sometimes also palpable, and I would really like to change that.\n\nNevertheless, my fingers simply don’t look very nice. I think about this a lot and wonder what causes it and how I could change it. I have very rough hands, and of course my girlfriend can feel that too when I touch her. Thank you very much.\n\nHave a great weekend",

They're all sensitive, unscented types, so I don't understand why he says it burns. He only has that sensation on his forehead, eyebrows, hairline, and upper cheeks. (FYI: checked his skin and he's red all over those areas 😭). He obviously doesn't have barrier damage from overusing skincare, as this is the first and only thing he uses, he doesn't have any history of rosacea or eczema, its just like hes allergic to every moisturiser??? Not even cerave or decubal works, so im at a loss. He says it burns for like 30 minutes and then it goes away, but his skin is irritated as hell.\n\nHow do I help him without giving him facial burns? Ive had that happen to me twice, one was just bad for everyone (avoid cosmica), and the other was some la roche thing, but most moisturisers are fine on me, but he's seemingly allergic to everything.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

I have normal combination skin – as far as I can tell. I grew up in the desert and have some dark spots. I have red undertones. My current routine is as follows\n\nAM:  \nLa Roche Posay *Effaclar micropeeling cleanser*  \nSkinceuticals *CE Ferulic*  \nCerave *Intensive moisturising + hydro-urea*  \nLRP Anthelios\n\nPM:  \nLRP *Effaclar micropeeling cleanser*  \nLRP *Effaclar serum* (every other day)  \nCerave *Intensive moisturising + hydro-urea*\n\nIf I have an extra dry areas I'll apply Avène *Cicalfate+.* My main questions are:\n\nI just started using the Cerave as a face moisturiser because... I already owned it? Before I used the *Cicalfate+*but I think that clogged my pores. What moisturiser would you recommend for this routine/my skin? Happy with no frills – Kiehl's?\n\nHow can I manage redness? Azelaic acid? Where would I put this in my routine? Any recommendations on products?\n\nMy skin gets quote red when I apple LRP *Effaclar serum*. It is okay after 30 mins but should I drop it and go for a gentler BHA?\n\nThank you in advance and any other advice/input welcome!",

Double cleanse with Garnier Fructis Curls Method Curly Hair Shampoo\n3. Garnier Fructis Curls Method Hair Mask for Curly Hair\n4. Slightly dry my hair with a very soft cloth\n5. Apply Garnier Fructis Curls Method Hair Mask as a leave in conditioner and scrunch\n6. Apply the Garnier Fructis Curls Method Refreshing Curl Spray\n\nAfter that I just go to bed and when I wake up my hair is dry and nice. So my current routine seems to be working fine. However, I want my hair to have more volume. Hence, I am thinking of buying the Bounce Curl Volume EdgeLift brush. I am also not sure if buying a diffuser is a good idea. What other products should I add to my routine? Curl cream, gels, oils? \n\nI looked through lots of posts on this sub and watched a ton of tutorials on YT and I am kinda overwhelmed😅. So please give me some suggestions and recommendations that you think would fit my routine or improve it.\n\nThank you!!&lt;3",

I've looked at local stylists Instagram, gone and got haircuts, asked for recommendations from friends...still no luck. Finally, desperate I find a salon about 40 minutes away with great reviews and I love the vibe of the place. I get a haircut from a newish stylist. Its turns out ok. I'm used to not being 100% satisfied with cuts bc my hair is very fine and I like the girl so I rebook for a color. My color does not come out light enough but it still looks nice and I think over time the hairstylist will become more experienced and I will communicate more effectively in the future.\n\nAlmost a year later I come back to the same stylist and I tell her I want to go even lighter.  I want dramatic and I'm not worried about what my hair will look like when the color grows out.  Its my birthday and I'm starting a new job so nows a good time for change. My hair is now darker then when I went in. My hair lifts VERY easily. A level 7 is not hard to achieve with my hair. I've been platinum many times before. Maybe the undertone is throwing her off. Anyways, I'm going this afternoon to have her fix it. She offered bc she could tell I didn't like it. I'm not sure if we should try to fix it or if I should ask for a refund. With 20% tip it was a little over $300. ",

Now after reaching my twenties, I really wanted to get this done right. (Get pimples semi-easily, huge god damn pores). Saw a dermatologist a few weeks ago and after some chatting, left with retinol. I was told I need to pay attention to moisturizing and have been following all of their their advice thoroughly. Now after a few weeks of using it, I seem to be going through the \"purge\". I started to wonder if I could use anti-spot gel on the breakout spots, but dont know if it's ok to use while using retinol? The anti-spot gel I have is used for drying out the spots, but since retinol needs so much moisturizing, 1 am now afraid that the anti-spot gel will not be ok...Help!\n\nTLDR: Can I use anti-spot gel ((has alcohol, glycerin, polysorbate 20, propylene glycol, panthenol)) while using retinol? If not, any other way to fight breakouts while using retinol?",

My current routine is absolutely nothing, but I really want them gone both because they look horrid and because I'm trans MtF and they make me look significantly more masculine. My skin is naturally quite dry and my routine is absolutely nothing right now. Not sure if this is relevant because idk if stress can impact the formation of these, but I have been violently stressed (more than ever in my life before) in the past month or two. Hope y'all can help, thanks!",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nLooking for some experienced opinions here.\n\nI started topical minoxidil 5% in June 2024. The recommended dose was 6 sprays morning + evening, but for practicality I only applied it once daily in the evening. Over the first year, I honestly saw very limited results.\n\nIn June 2025, I added oral finasteride while continuing topical minoxidil. Since then, the results have been very noticeable and I’m genuinely happy with where my hair is at now.\n\nBecause of that, I’m wondering whether I could eventually come off topical minoxidil. I find it uncomfortable, it makes my hair look dirty, and it’s the part of the routine I dislike the most.\n\nIf I did stop, I would obviously taper it very gradually over several months, not cold turkey, to reduce the risk of a shed / effluvium.\n\nHas anyone here successfully stopped minoxidil while staying on fin?\n\t\nIs it reasonable to assume that fin is now doing most of the heavy lifting, given that results only really appeared after starting it?\n\nWould really appreciate hearing from people who’ve tried this or understand the mechanisms better. Thanks!",
