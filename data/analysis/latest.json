I want to add that I’ve avoided posting because I know you guys are about to fry me lol.\n\nI’ll admit I was very fortunate and uneducated in my youth and early adulthood - I could put whatever on her and she flourished.  Her best look was when I was using healthy sexy hairs tri wheat leave in and garniers spray gel. Then one day I thought I should start using actual curly products and it all kinda went to hell from there, slowly but surely. \n\nCurrent routine is:\n\n\\- wash every 2 days with redKen all soft \n\n\\- oribes hair alchemy fortifying treatment for leave in \n\n\\- I’ve tried numerous gels and mousses but the current one I’ve had luck with is miss Jessie’s pillow talk lotion which I comb throughout my hair then scrunch with a t shirt \n\n\\- air dry \n\nYou read all that correctly - I use no masks, have no protein (I just learned this is a big necessity which is wild), etc, no clarifying shampoo, etc.\n\nI’d like to also note I HAVE to wash every 2 days. I have tried and tried to prolong it with a bonnet, wrap, satin pillowcase, etc and my hair wads up and gets oily. Any tips for that is great too! When I do refresh, I use a tiny bit of oribe oil on the tips to give some hydration back to them. \n\nBack when my hair looked its best, I’d like to note how that looked: \n\n\\- wash every day with tresemme moisture shampoo and conditioner\n\n\\- towel dry, and when damp, use healthy sexy hairs tri wheat soy leave in and then brush out with a wet brush (still use this) \n\n\\- garnier spray gel, sprayed throughout then scrunch with hands \n\n\\- air dry \n\nIf you are wondering why I strayed from this - my hair began feeling dry and curling weird, so I swapped things out until my hair was soft again but at the cost of my curls it seems\n\nI’m here because she has really stopped forming full curls around my face and at my root/crown. All of my ringlets start at collarbone level and go to my ends. They also have started tangling together and wadding up (I hope that makes sense.) I’ve began wearing my hair up in a clip to avoid this and i actually have an appointment to cut it to shoulder length again tomorrow (it’s currently a little longer than mid back.) \n\nSo my question is what do I do? What do you recommend? When I began searching, I found a million answers to what I COULD do, but then determined the best route was to actually show you guys my hair and embarrassingly admit that I don’t do much. I need products, a routine, all the things. Is cutting it going to be good for it? I know it’s heavy and weight can impact how it curls up top. Anyway - sos send help and thanks in advance 😭",

It can be a PITA to find a hairdresser who will even do this \\*but\\* if you do find one, it’s often cheaper than even a normal cut as they don’t have to wash your hair.\n\nThe dry cut gets the shape right. Then I go home and wash/style it myself (to get it to curl again - it’s always crazy after a cut), and then I cut it curl by curl.\n\nYou want 2 snips per curl - one on an angle and then one to just take the tip off what you’ve just cut. You’re not trying to change the overall shape of your hair or make it shorter, just a shallow ish angle for the first cut and then the tip for the second. \n\nEach time I wash/style I’ll have a quick look for curls that need a snip, but generally it’s only a few that need a snip for the next couple of washes and I’m good to go until I need a proper cut again. \n\nIt’s actually hilarious cos my current hairdresser makes me send her pics when it’s ‘done’ so she can show other customers, but she doesn’t know I’m doing a secret squirrel curly cut at home after she shapes it 😂\n\nRoutine: professional dry cut, snip, snip!

      "content": "Hi everyone! \n\nMy wedding is 2 weeks away and my skin has started to misbehave! \n\nI have been trying to get my skin to be perfect but it just does not want to listen right now. \n\nPhotos of my skincare products and skin above. \n\nMy skin is usually normal and never oily. Sometimes can get dry. I am also very pale, so any blemishes stand out like a sore thumb. \n\nMain concerns: \n\n\\- Large pores! (They usually are not this bad!)\n\n\\- random pimples popping up in different spots all over the face. \n\n\\- uneven tone and texture.\n\nHonestly, I have been using a bit of everything you see above in my skincare collection. After some research, probably not great!\n\nI would really appreciate some help in getting my skin as best as it can be before the wedding with the products I have. \n\nBonus points if somebody could give me a proper 2 week routine morning and night! But that is a lot of work and I do not expect that. \n\nI appreciate any help and tips! \n\nThank you guys! ",

What has worked well for you and what do you not recommend? \n\nI think I’ve really messed up my curl pattern by shampooing (and maybe brushing) way too much, and I would like to fix it but am not sure where to go from here. \n\nMy husband and I own a renovation business and we do literally everything by ourselves, so my hair has been exposed to a lot of icky things but I think the real issues are drywall dust and mortar/grout dust. We don’t do those specific jobs  every day, but when we do do them it takes multiple days. From just minimal exposure, the dust typically causes my hair to matte and is pretty unmanageable, so I was trying to get ahead of the curve and just keep it as clean as possible and I messed it up. \n\nWhen I’m working with stuff that I know messes up my hair, I wear a little slouchy hat/hair covering (sorry I’m not sure the right word for it!) but it feels like a lot of the dust still gets through. \n\nI’d appreciate any guidance or suggestions! \n\nRoutine:\n\nSome of these are very recent additions( bought this week) and I’m already seeing progress! \n\nNew Products: \n\nPattern Bounce Back Pre-Poo (used once do far, didn’t shampoo afterwards bc I’m trying to get my scalp back to its natural oil level)\n\nPattern Leave In Conditioner \n\nPattern Jojoba oil blend \n\nRizzos Curls Brush (literally the first time I’ve been able to brush my hair without so much pain lol) \n\nRegular products: \n\nPattern Hydrating Shampoo\n\nPattern Lightweight Conditioner \n\nI don’t really have a specific schedule or specific routine, I just go with what feel right on whatever day \n\nThank you!!",

I apply it before going to bed.

Conditioner is a no for me as it tends to make my hair poofy, no brand and I mean any brand at all of conditioner has ever worked for me even leave in conditioner. After gently scrunching to remove excess water and I mean GENTLY AS POSSIBLE I apply a small amount of amla oil to 3/4 of my hair with my fingers making sure to evenly distribute the oil, I also apply a homemade all natural oil blend to my scalp (castor, rosemary, pumpkin seed, peppermint and a few others). Ive been using this routine for about 4 months now and my hair has really seemed to like it, my waves and curls have come through more (2 hair types, top is wavy and bottom is more curly. I was wondering if yall had any opinions on this routine and if yall have some recommendations for my routine? I only use natural products as my hair and skin don’t react well with heavy products. Picture above is with my hair still wet from the shower after applying amla, I prefer to let it air dry slowly instead of blow drying as it helps keep the curls.",

I get pimples around my T-zone and mouth/chin a few weeks before my period starts, so idk if it’s hormonal? i’m guessing it is. But looking at some pictures of like pustule rosacea I’ve been wondering if it could be that. Not really sure if there’s a way to tell the difference. \n\nAnyways rn my routine is basically just cleanse with an SA cleanser every other day and moisturize with the byoma gel cream every few days (basically when i remember). \n\nI have acne but my skin is also like dry so idk if it’s the SA that’s making it like that? is it my skin barrier? is it my faces PH? idk. \n\nI’m actually terrible at keeping up with a routine (yay for adhd) unless i really love it or something. \n\nI’m mostly wondering if there’s any serums or something i can add that i don’t necessarily have to do \\*every\\* day. I’ve been debating on getting the skin1004 centella ampule serum, and taking probiotics (i’ve heard probiotics can help with acne) ",

Mine are often brittle and broken due to my job, so extensions are in order.\n\nI am going alone because I live quite far from her (and the other bridesmaids) and so these nails will have to last for at least two weeks and a flight. Is gel, acrylic, gel powder or SNS dipping powder best for this? I am looking for something simple, not too long, but I actually have zero idea of what any of that means, so I put all the options from their webpage here.\n\nAlso, am I allowed to bring my own nail polish to the salon? I am quite worried they won't have the color I need... Is that rude?\n\nThanks for all the help!",
