I'm a 22F with sensitive, dry, acne prone skin struggling on and off for a few months now with acne along my lower cheeks and jawline (like [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/rgdwuh/acne_never_used_to_be_breakout_prone_but_all_of_a/#lightbox) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3uemi8/acne_i_have_never_in_my_life_even_had_a_blemish/)) and I don't know how to get rid of it. So far, even with my routine, the only way for me to actually get rid of these closed comedones(???) is by squeezing [these little things](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/91ee2u/acne_anyone_else_extract_bulb_like_sack_things/) out which ends up giving me really bad hyperpigmentation that takes forever to fade. Is it something in my routine that's giving me these or is it something else? (mold exposure possibly from my new apartment, diet but that hasn't changed since high school, lack of sleep and/or stress, menstrual cycle hormone changes, pillowcase???) Please help me and let me know if there are better/more effective products that I can use 🙏 Any advice and opinions are appreciated!",

      "content": "Hi! I started straightening my hair when I was around 10 years old because I was made fun of for my natural hair. It was seen as “masculine” to other people. I’ve recently noticed how heat damaged my hair is. There’s split ends everywhere, which is why I want to stop using heat tools on my hair. The only thing is that I don’t know which products are best for my hair, and that I know my hair will look ridiculous for a little while because of how damaged it is. I want to train my hair back to its natural pattern. This is my air dried hair after sleeping with no products in it whatsoever, so I don’t really have a routine. I don’t use a fancy pillowcase and I have a bonnet but don’t usually use it. I washed my hair with the Tresemme Flawless Curls Conditioner and the Tresemme 24 Hour Volume Shampoo. All advice to start my hair healing journey is appreciated!!",
