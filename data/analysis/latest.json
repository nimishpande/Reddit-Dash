      "content": "I swear my acne is worse now than when I was a teenager. It’s been years of trying literally everything including cleansers, toners, antibiotics, topicals, supplements, peels, facials, different diets, cutting dairy, cutting sugar… you name it. My derm has had me on spironolactone, tret, azelaic acid, and even antibiotics at one point. I’m allergic to benzoyl peroxide so that’s off the table too.\n\nThe worst part is I do everything “right.” I double cleanse, change my pillowcases, never sleep in makeup, sanitize my phone, avoid touching my face… and still wake up with 3 new cysts every week. My doctor told me recently that for some people, acne just never fully goes away because it’s “genetically hardwired.” Hearing that honestly crushed me.\n\nIt’s not even vanity at this point - the constant inflammation and pain that wears me down. My cheeks and jawline always hurt, I avoid eye contact with people because I feel like they’re staring at my skin. I don’t take selfies anymore. I can’t remember the last time I looked in the mirror and didn’t feel angry or hopeless.\n\nIt’s exhausting. I feel ugly and broken and resentful of my skin and my genes. I hate that something as dumb as acne can affect my self-esteem this much, but it really does. Just needed to vent because I feel like I’m running out of both options and emotional energy only due to this endless dumb loop.",

My hair grows pretty fast and I had pretty grown out roots when i had it done so i can’t imagine it’s damage from that. I use a hairdryer to dry my hair but other than that not much heat on my hair. If anyone has any advice or even just what could be causing it I would be so greatful. Thank you ",

I’ve never been good at maintaining a skin care routine because one, I don’t like buying a lot of expensive products, and two, I’ve never seen results from anything. My skin concerns are dryness, acne, and enlarged pores/sebaceous filaments. I’ve always had issues with complexion products like foundation because my skin looks terrible with makeup on top. I tried to post pictures of my face with no concealer, I don’t have any closeup photos of my skin. My current routine is barely one, but it’s this:\n\n-Try to wash my face every night with neutrogena hydro boost face wash but in reality it’s like once a week. When I shower I just wash with water if I don’t use the neutrogena.\n-moisturize with neutrogena hydro boost water gel either after washing my face or when I take my makeup off with micellar water. \n-I was trying to do a bha chemical peel from the Ordinary once a week but I fell off and don’t do it anymore.\n\nThat’s it. Is there a serum I should be using? Also, are there any other ways to exfoliate besides chemical peels? I find my skin too sensitive to handle it for even a minute. I’d like to keep my current two main products if possible. Thanks.\n",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",
