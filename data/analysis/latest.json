This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

      "title": "Thinking about trying semi and demi permanent colour on 20% grey hair",
      "content": "I (54F) have 2B-3B 20% virgin grey hair, and I'd like to try something fun with it. I was thinking about trying a semi permanent colour, something fun and vivid, like deep red or royal purple, that would really make the white streaks that frame my face pop. However, when I've tried semi permanents in the past, my curl does NOT like it. My hair gets drier, curls don't clump properly and get looser. I've already lost so much of my curl pattern since menopause (gone from a solid 3B with lots of density and consistent curls that needed minimum help to define or style to much looser overall, with a real mix of mostly 2B-3B, and a couple of small pieces that are closer to 2A. But I am not happy with my hair - I'm 20% grey,  especially around the front (incl. 2 cool white streaks at the temples) and the loss of volume and curl means it's so much flatter and harder to style than it used to be.\nI have dyed my hair before, about 8 years ago, with E-Salon, when my hair had a tighter more consistent curl pattern and full density (I've lost 25-30% of my density since then), and it always took a few weeks minimum to recover. Now, with the current density and curl pattern, as well as being on the drier side of normal, I'm worried that I will just end up losing much of the remaining curl and volume. \nHas anyone had any experience playing with colour on their curls? What effect did it have on condition, curl pattern and styling? \n\nMy routine:\n\nShampoo: Carole's Daughter Goddess Strength (once or twice a month)\nDaily conditioner: Carole's Daughter Goddess Strength (every shower)\nMask: alternating between Carole's Daughter Goddess Strength and Verb Hydrate Mask \nClarifying shampoo: L'Oreal Everpure (as needed - I don't get a lot of product building up as I don't use a lot of product)\nLeave In: LUS All in One for curly hair\nStyling: LUS Sea Moss gel. Have also tried Curlsmith Curl Souffle and FX texturizing paste.\nMethod: squish to condish, then before getting out of shower, apply the LUS All in 1 prayer style, comb through w wide toothed comb, wrap in microfiber towel to soak up excess water, then section and curl brush and either air dry or, if going out, apply LUS Sea Moss gel to hair prayer style, section and curl brush to clump, then combo of scrunch/hover diffuser on low gentle heat until about 80-90% dry (live in a very humid climate). If I'm using texturizing paste, I do it right after taking off the towel, but don't use both that and gel.\n\nAlso, please note that photos show my hair air dried, not diffused and styled (which would be fuller and curlier). And I'm planning on getting a shorter cut to reclaim some of my curls and volume.",

I did some research and bought Cerave Foaming Cleanser and kept on using Ponds Super light gel (which I've previously used for more than a year)\nThe texture of my skin improved a bit but there were many closed comedones and acne kept on coming back. Not very big, red ones but like normal small pimples. In January i switched from Cerave to Minimalist Salicylic acid face wash and started using Deconstruct oil free moisturizer. \nI was really irritated by my acne and went through the posts here and used google/chatgpt and learnt that adapalene would be a good treatment. I started using adapalene again (a pea sized amount) . Also, my moisturizer got empty and i changed my moisturizer to Minimalist B5 one. I used adapalene after washing my face and then immediately applied moisturizer layer on top of it. I did it for 2 nights, skipped a day, used again and then this pic is of yesterday. I really can't understand what to do and how to atleast look presentable. Also, if it helps, i shaved my beard too this week. My gf says that after I apply moisturizer, this much damaged skin (as in above pics) is not visible, only the inflammed/bumpy portion around nose is noticeable. And for the scar on my right cheek, that's due to chickenpox - not acne.\n I just really want to have a good skin texture, Any advices and suggestions would he helpful.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I guess I was one of those people. My whole family has curly hair, and my sister has the prettiest ringlets. I always kinda felt left out. \n\nAnyways, my question is, why does some of my hair curl and some of it stay straight while most of it is wavy? Why is it so inconsistent??

      "content": "Hello! I have recently decided to actually try to take care of my curly hair lol. The issue is, I have no idea what I am doing.\n\nMy curl type is maybe 3a, but that probably doesn't matter.  My hair type is thick, coarse, and absorbs product well, I think? Most likely dry. I just started using curl cream (unscented Not Your Mother's), mouse (also unscented, same brand), and curl gel (Odele). Sometimes I use an Odele volume foam, but not too much. I have the Odele hair oil too, but haven't used it really. I use the Wet Brush Curl Detangler. It kind of looks like a hand? lol.\n\nThe first pic of my hair is after swimming in the ocean, no product or styling. The second doesn't have a product either, I believe.\n\nHere are my troubles:\n\n1. I flip my head upside down and apply products. The bottom half looks really nice! However, the sideburn areas tend to be kinda straight-ish, as do the top half of my hair. The curls lose their magic the longer after wash day. Any curl refresher product recommendations?\n2. I've tried doing a pineapple bun and a bonnet at night (the tie with a ribbon kind). I wake up with it slipped off a bit and feel like my curls look kinda flat/frizzy. It's also not the most comfortable.\n3. I LOVE volume. Especially at the top of my hair! Is it possible to get this and a good curl definition? So far, I'm lacking in both areas.\n\nDoes anyone have routine advice? How often should I wash my hair? My hair doesn't get too greasy. What do I do after washing? What should I do in the morning and at night daily? How do I refresh the curls to last longer?\n\nI don't diffuse because I'm a tad bit nervous about heat damage (silly, I know). But I am open to it!\n\nLet me know any product recommendations! As you can see from what I listed, I prefer unscented or minimal, naturally derived fragrances.\n\nWould love any advice! Thank you.",
