I only shampoo my scalp and let the foam run down, then condition the mid to ends and detangle while it’s wet. Once a week I use a hair mask instead of conditioner and that helped a lot. After the shower I don’t towel dry, I put my curl cream on while it’s still soaking wet and scrunch, then add a bit of gel. I squeeze the water out with a T-shirt, let it dry without touching it, and once it’s fully dry I scrunch with a little serum. Way less frizz and way more definition so far 😌\n\nProducts I use:\n\nJoviality Curl Wonder Shampoo\n\nBless Conditioner\n\nRaw African Maya Hair Mask\n\nThe Hair Addict Frizz-Off Curl Activator\n\nBio Soft Flaxseed Gel\n\nLocken Glossy Hair Serum",

      "content": "This might be a little neurotic, but I’m curious if anyone else does this.\n\nWhen I do my skincare, I only use one hand to actually touch my face. My dominant hand handles the packaging (picking up bottles, jars, tubes, pumping or squeezing the product), and I dispense everything onto my other hand, which stays “clean”.\n\nProducts that have lids that require two hands to open are loosened prior to washing and drying my hands. Once one hand touches the outside of the packaging, I think of it as less clean. So the hand that never touches the bottle or jar is the only one that touches my face.\n\nI don’t think this is a form of OCD as I’m not obsessive about skincare or even particularly compulsive about this particular method of applying it, it’s just something that makes logical sense to me.\n\nSkincare products are kept closed for a reason; you don’t leave lids off because bacteria and dust would just creep in. So in my mind, the outside of the packaging isn’t exactly “clean”, even if my hands are freshly washed prior to handling.\n\nDoes anyone else do something similar, or am I just overthinking it?",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

My hair is dense enough that I could stick a pencil in it, shake my head around and it would probably not fall out, but it's also not really curly. I rarely wash my hair with anything other than water and didn't previously have any other hair care routine. I have recently started using Give Me Four Curls leave in conditioner. The conditioner sometimes works quite well, and my hair will even start to form ringlets when I use it, but it's also quite inconsistent. My hair also takes an entire day to dry when I use it, and when I wake up in the morning I basically have to start the process again. Not really sure where to go from here?",

They didn't give me any sort of cream or treatment after, and just said to apply sunscreen and fucidin in the morning and evening. Has anyone else had this done and had such dark bruising after? How long did it last and how soon did you start wearing foundation/concealer afterwards?

If it goes well, I am considering buying raw shea butter instead of the body lotion. \n\nAlso, is there a reason to choose Shea Butter or Cocoa Butter?
