      "content": "I got my first ever curly cut march this year and I absolutely loved it. My curls were healthy and I loved the shape. The curls in the first photo is from September this year so about 3 months ago, and the second photo I took at the beginning of this month. I’m extremely upset with the way my curls have been looking. I know that the longer your hair gets, the more the curl pattern stretches out. However, I don’t understand how so much can change in such little time. In the second photo the shape is off and my curls are really..thin? I’m not sure how to describe it. I’m noticing some pieces start really thick and then towards the bottom it really thins out. I’m not sure if this is breakage? I haven’t really done anything different so I don’t understand why this could be happening. I shampoo and condition once a week, I sleep with a silk bonnet, I detangle my hair with a detangling brush and lots of conditioner, I don’t use any heat besides diffusing, ect. I have always had the same routine and it has always worked for me. I just don’t understand why suddenly my hair appears so damaged. After my curly cut I wasn’t getting regular trims because my hair seemed to be growing healthy and I didn’t feel the need so I don’t know if that could be the reason? Now I’m thinking about doing a big chop but I’m not sure if there are anyways I can save my curls?",

I’m not trying to diagnose or treat anything, just curious what’s helped others manage discomfort during in office or at home procedures.\n\n I’ve tried basic lidocaine creams with mixed results and have heard people mention options like EMLA, but I’m more interested in how well numbing creams actually worked for you, application timing, and whether they affected results or irritation afterward. Totally understand everyone’s skin and pain tolerance is different, just looking to learn from real experiences. Thanks in advance!",

I really want to take care of my underarms. \n\nBackground:\n\n\t•\tI used razors only for several years (stopped \\~2 years ago)\n\n\t•\tAround a year ago, I had a wax burn from Rica wax\n\n\t•\tSince then, I switched to hard Brazilian wax, but I feel my underarm skin keeps getting worse\n\n\t•\tI have thick, coarse hair\n\n\t•\tMy skin is PIH-prone — even mosquito bites leave dark marks for months before fading\n\n\t•\tCurrently using Chemist at Play underarm roll-on\n\n\t•\tOccasionally used alum for odor\n\n\t•\tRarely used The Ordinary Glycolic Acid with a cotton pad\n\n\t•\tRecently exfoliated gently with Dove body polish (pink variant)\n\nCurrent issues:\n\n\t•\tPersistent dark pigmentation\n\n\t•\tUneven tone\n\n\t•\tBumps after waxing (they go away, but darkness doesn’t)\n\n\t•\tSkin gets irritated easily after hair removal\n\nWhat I’m confused about:\n\n\t•\tIs epilator better or worse than hard/Brazilian wax for someone like me?\n\n\t•\tShould I completely avoid root hair removal?\n\n\t•\tWould switching to a trimmer actually help pigmentation fade?\n\n\t•\tAny routines/products that helped you personally?\n\nLaser is not an option for me right now, so I’m looking for realistic, affordable solutions.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with similar underarm pigmentation or sensitive skin, I’d really appreciate your experience or advice 🙏\n\nPlease be kind — this is something I’m genuinely trying to fix.",

Wash with Difeel rosemary shampoo and conditioner every day.\n2. Before blowdrying it, I use a Kerastase hair oil (Elixir Ultime) on the ends and try to apply it up until the middle section of my hair, but not the roots.\n3. Blowdry it with medium heat.\n4. Apply a heat protection spray.\n5. Then iron it.\n\nI do this every day. My hair is quite burnt up and dry, but if I don't do this it looks awful.😭 What should I do, could you suggest a routine? Also, if I cut the end, how much should I cut of it?\n\nI dried it with a blowdrier in these photos.\n\nThank you if you can help!🙏🏻 (Excuse my English, it's not my first language.)\n\n",

I’ve already undergone Dermapen (microneedling), laser treatments, and chemical peels, but my scars are still visible.\n\nI also have uneven texture on my forehead, which makes my skin look rough and bumpy, especially in certain lighting.\n\nI wanted to ask what actually worked for you in treating deep acne scars and uneven skin texture? Are there any advanced treatments, skincare routines, or lifestyle changes that genuinely made a difference?\n\nAny advice, personal experiences, or dermatologist-recommended options would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

Over the past months I’ve developed a cheesy smell in certain areas: behind my ears, scalp, corners of my nose, and sometimes even my earwax. It’s only noticeable when rubbed and fades quickly. There was also a time when my belly button became extremely itchy and smelled cheesy for days. This all began after a depressive period where I sometimes went days without showering. I’m now back to showering daily, but if I miss even 1-2 days, the smell returns. I never experienced this before, even in the past when I skipped showers.\n\nI’m trying to understand how to reset my skin/body back to normal. This has been making me really anxious because I hate the thought of smelling bad or being perceived as unhygienic.\n\nMy current routine\nFace: Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser, Aveeno Oat Gel Moisturizer, Adapalene 0.1%. Body: Dove Sensitive soap and Aveeno Daily Moisturizer. I’m looking for long-term solutions that restore balance, not just temporary fixes.",

(Louder for the ones in the back) but barrier + hydration support.\n\nIngredients that help:\n\nHyaluronic Acid → hydrates, reduces tightness\n\nColloidal Oatmeal → beta-glucans soothe inflammation\n\nGotu Kola (Centella) → strengthens repair + reduces heat (my personal favourite!!)\n\nSqualane → replenishes lipids + restores flexibility\n\nIf your skin flares up easily but also calms down with gentle care → you have reactive skin, not sensitive skin.\n\nHope this helps someone who’s been confused by their skin’s behaviour!\n\n(Not medical advice,  just sharing what I see often in my practice)",

      "content": "Hi, this is my first time posting so hopefully I’m doing this right. I’ve always had 3B hair, but after a boxed dye job and a lot of blow-drying, I’ve lost quite a bit of my curl definition. The damage happened slowly, so I didn’t really notice until recently.\n\nI don’t think my hair is damaged enough to need a big chop, so I’m planning to slowly cut it over time and experiment with lengths/styles till most of the “damage” is gone by midsummer. While I do miss my curls, I’m trying to embrace my looser pattern (around 2B/2C), and honestly I kind of like them.\n\nMy main issue right now is frizz/poofiness. When my hair was curlier, it was easier to accept frizz because the curls were more noticeable, but at its current state its much \"poofier\" and simply looks uncared for by Day 3..\n\nIs there anything I can do to make it look shinier and clumpier? I’ve been looking into products with a laminating effect, but I’m not sure how healthy that is long term. Has anyone tried hair gloss? Would love to hear any thoughts or suggestions.\n\n* *L'Oreal Paris EverPure Sulfate Free Hair Gloss Glossing Lamination Mask* \n* *Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray*\n\nRoutine: \n\n1. *Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean Shampoo*\n2. *Tresemme Moisture Rich with Vitamin E Conditioner*\n3. *Curlsmith Weightless Air-Dry Leave-in Conditioning Cream*\n4. *Olaplex No. 7 Bonding Oil + Jojoba Oil + Olive Oil*\n5. *Bumble and bumble Heat Shield Thermal Protection Hair Mist (New Addition &amp; Only If Using Hair Dryer)\\** \n\n* *Wash 1-2x Week; T-Shirt to Dry; Satin Scarf for Sleep; Trim \\~1” every 9-10 weeks* \n* *Products used occasionally: Bumble and bumble Hairdresser’s Invisible Oil Heat Protectant Leave In Conditioner Primer, Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Gel*",

I have watched a lot of makeup tutorials (some are helpful, others are not) and I am very overwhelmed. I have many questions, (some are stupid) for each makeup step and I hope I could get some answers/advice./help, Thank you in advance (it's a lot of questions, sorry in advance), My skin is combo in the summer/spring and dry in the winter/fall\n\n(When I ask \"How do I know it is blended\" I mean how do I know if there is a harsh line and if it looks even because after staring at myself for so long, my face kind of looks like one blob)\n\nOverall: What does patchy mean? What are some things that I should avoid while doing each makeup step? What is good lighting to do makeup in? What is the right steps to do makeup?\n\ntools: What are some brushes I need for good application? Brushes or sponges or other tool? What tools are the best for each step?\n\nskin prep: what are some good ingredients for skin prep?\n\nfoundation/concealer/skin tint: How do I know it is blended? How do I know it is the right shade? (if I step outside after applying, how do I know it will look the same/be the same shade?) What does \"cakey\" and \"creasing\" mean?\n\ncontour/bronzer: What is the difference? How do I know it is blended and doesn't look like mud? How do I choose the right shade? Are both necessary?\n\nblush: How do I know it is blended? How do I choose the right shade? How do I tell if it is emphasizing my texture? Should I do cream then powder or vice versa (and when in the routine)?\n\nhighlight: How do I know it is blended? How do I know if I put too much? How do I know choose the wrong/right shade?\n\neyeshadow: How do I choose the right pallet?\n\nmascara: Are falsies or mascara better? What does \"clumpy\" mean? Should I choose volume or length?\n\nbrows: How do I know if they look natural or \"blocky\"? What is a good natural brow routine?\n\nsetting powder/setting spray: Pressed or loose powder? Should I do setting power then setting spray or vice versa?\n\nlip: How do I choose a lip liner shade? How do I know if it looks good on me?\n\nThank you so much in advance, also please leave any makeup recommendations if you feel comfortable",

However, I recently found out that it might contribute to my closed comedones, so I’m trying to figure out how to maintain enough moisture without clogging my pores.\n\nI currently use The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid on damp skin, followed by my moisturizer. A few times a week, I use Paula’s Choice BHA, and I use CeraVe retinol every night.\n\nI remove my makeup with Bioderma micellar water and cleanse with a cleansing milk from Caudalie. Sometimes I also use the Propolis Cleanser from Apivita.\n\nI have recently bought TIRTIR Milk Skin Toner and the Oat Gel Cream from Purito, and now my questions are:\n\t•\tCan I still use hyaluronic acid, and should it be applied before or after the milk toner?\n\t•\tWhere can I improve my routine?",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",
