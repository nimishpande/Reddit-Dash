Hv approached many dermats as a kid n nothing helped. So I basically gave up on skincare n stuff. Only time has healed my skin. I still get acne. Like 5-10 a month including period acne) I randomly landed up on reddit skincare pages n was basically scrolling through it. Heard from some how micellar has helped them with comedones and stuff. Decided to give it a try. And ngl, with 2 days I could see drastic changes in my skin. The comedones have drastically reduced on my forehead. Micellar also helped me with acne. If there's any acne flaring up, I just use micellar on it and the next day the acne is gone pretty much.\n\nI used Garnier pink cap.\n\nHow do I use it:\nNight: I clean my face with micellar water using cotton pads or any clean smooth cotton cloth. Then I wash my face with a cleanser. Then proceed with my night routine. (Which is basically just applying moisturizer. I use ponds super light moisturizer as I hv oily acne prone skin)\n\nMorning: I clean my face with micellar water (my face gets all super oily in the morning) and then I wash with a cleanser. Apply moisturizer and sunscreen (I use solasafe sunscreen)\n\nPs: I still hv some comedones on my skin. But micellar has made a huge difference. Also it's been a week + since I started using it.\n\nI now hv to work on my skin texture too.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "title": "2 years on Dutasteride/Minox, so much hair loss, not sure where to go from here",
      "content": "10 years ago I started Finasteride and topical minox (rogaine) once a day. At the time I think I was a norwood 4 and now I believe a weird 5. Back then I had a huge bald spot on the crown with a couple hairs left, temples were receding, hair all over was thinning. But I still kind of had hair. I've been shaving my head for 20 years, but not everyday if I am lazy about it. Even with the receding temples I still didn't mind my head that much back then because I shaved it often and I could see that 5 o clock shadow covering a decent part of my bald head at least looking at me straight on. I guess that is what I mean by I kind of had hair. I wasn't happy, I was balding, but I had something. I thought I was doing something great for myself by starting these meds. I had high hopes for Finasteride and Rogaine. But it didn't work. I was very slowly losing hair. Not aggressively, but I could see it happening. I hung in there for years hoping something would change for the better or I would at least stop losing hair. Heard about Dutasteride 2 years ago and jumped on it. Slowly made the transition to Duta from Fin with advice from Reddit people. I really thought this would work. Still doing my topical minox. But in the past 2 years things have gotten worse. The crown's bald spot is getting bigger, my temples are really receding big time, and my hair is thinning out really bad especially in the front to mid scalp. The biggest change I have noticed on Duta is the receding hairline. And the thinning of the front/top. I should note I also tried microneedling when I first switched to Duta. Hoping between the switch to Duta and Minox and microneedling, I'd have a good chance. I'm honestly not sure if microneedling worked. It might have just a little bit. A little bit wasn't worth it to keep going because I didn't enjoy that at all. I did what I read on here. 1.5 dermaroller, once a week. I just can't see myself doing that forever. Lack of visual results is discouraging as well. I wasn't seeing anything new happening. So I stopped after about 2 months. \n\nSo nothing has worked and I'm depressed about it. Yes I shave my head. But I am not happy being bald. I'm just content with it if I have somewhat of a 5 o clock shadow there. But there is no question my hair has gotten much worse since starting Duta. I can tell when I am bald and when I grow my hair out a little. I can't say \"Duta cause this\". I just know hair loss accelerated once making the switch. That's all I know. I'm not sure if I should hang in there. I feel like I will be completely bald in a year from now at this pace. I am thinking of switching back to Fin because at least I was very slowly losing hair. But then I am switching back to something that wasn't actually really working. Fin wasn't stopping my hair loss. Just stopped it better than Dut. After 10 years of this I am just very annoyed. I can't give up though. I'm not okay being bald. I've looked into other stuff. The SMP I've thought about a lot but 99 percent of the ones I see do not look natural and I can't imagine it looking any better up close in real life. But, I still consider it because might be my only option. It's just, when I shave my head, there are no dots on my head, not even small ones. I'd want SMP to match my shaved head and I don't think anyone can pull that off. I don't want dots. I've never seen it in real life though so I have no idea. And then I could do Hair transplant - well what is the point if I can't even make these medications work right? I really don't want to spend the money on a transplant anyways. But I would to get hair. But all those doctors say you have to stay on Fin or Dut to make it work so what's the point. I believe oral minox would give me results. But, I just can't. I do not want more body hair or face hair. I have enough problems. I hate body hair and extra face hair. It's so crazy how to get hair back on my head I have to get hairy all over. I've read enough people saying they get really hairy everywhere. I guess that doesn't bother them but it bothers me. If I was guaranteed a full head of hair on oral minox, sure make me hairy all over. But with my luck. I'll just lose more hair on my head and gain more hair on my body. I saw one of those red light therapy baseball caps on Amazon tonight for under $100. Could that work? lol. I mean right next to it is the helmet for $800. So I guess that would mean the $100 is junk? I can't spend more than $100 to test one of these things because I have no idea if they will work. I do Keto, and take no vitamins. Maybe that would help? But I don't see that turning things around much at this point. I see the pills for saw palmetto but not sure. Biotin but not sure. I'm reading about topical fin and topical dut. But I don't know. How would I decide between the 2? Flip a coin. If the pills and minox don't work why would they though? Could taking 2 pills of Dut a day make a difference? Or one of those full 5's of Fin a day? I asked my derm and she said she won't prescribe that. When i first started this HIM's was not a thing. Now I see it everywhere. Should i be going through them for the same stuff? Maybe there is something magical in there? \n\nSome of you have great dermatologists. The derms I have gone to promote that they do hair help, yet seem to know nothing. It's as if they read an article or two. And I bring up what I read on Reddit and they say \"stop reading Reddit\" lol. The people on here know much much more than the derm's I have met.  I had an appointment yesterday and asked her what I should do and she just said it's up to me and rushed me out. Is there somewhere else I can go to talk about these medications? Bosley or something? I called them and they just wanted to talk about hair transplants though. I can sit on here and read every posting and in the end it's not really helping.

Do you guys do the same or do u do front middle back (in terms of sections).Also how do you do it so the already product-ed hair sections don’t get in the way? I try to move it to the back but even with long hair it gets in the way and falls back. I swear every time I try and put it in a pony tail, it gets a ponytail dent and kind of clumps together. I hope this makes sense and I’m open to anything!\n\nHere’s my routine:\n1)detangle in the shower with ouidad curl quencher\n2)put in pattern moisture milk \nAnd not your mothers mousse\n3)use a curl comb (the one with ridges on the side)\nThat’s it (if you have suggestions please leave them!

She is naturally a mousey brown.\n\nIt's ended up with more of a dark olive colour with bits of that green still in it, and I want to help her work out how to correct it. Would anyone be able to give any advice on how to get it closer to the brown colour she wants? She is trying to recover her hair a bit health wise so she'd rather avoid bleaching it if possible, and it is really bothering her. But whatever works to be honest!\n\nThanks!",

      "title": "Tips for better curly/wavy hair routine?",
      "content": "Long post ahead. FWIW, I think my hair is probably more wavy than curly, but I definitely have some curly pieces and I figured it would be better to post here than [r/wavyhair ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wavyhair/)because this sub seems to have more activity. Images above are my hair after getting wet and then air-drying with some scrunching, but no product.\n\nFor some background, I used to have very curly hair as a toddler but then it straightened out somewhat as I got older. My parents never really knew what to do with my hair, as it’s always been very thick and unruly— my mom’s hair has only the slightest wave and from what I’ve heard, my dad‘s used to be pretty curly, like perfect ringlets, but he grew up keeping his short and now doesn’t have any, so not much help. Basically I’ve gone through my whole life with my hair looking like a puffy mess— I regularly attack it with a plastic brush, and sometimes I use detangler too, but still it’s pretty much a pyramid of frizz by the time I get home every day. It also has a tendency to develop snags and tangles in specific patches— there’s a pretty nasty one in the back that always seems to develop no matter what I do. I’ve grown up being told by stylists that my hair has some natural curl to it, but I don’t know how to treat it so I just default to the treatment I was raised with meant for straight hair, and the cycle repeats itself. Until very recently, my routine has just been whatever shampoo and conditioner we keep in the shower, then brushing my hair out once it’s dry, but clearly that hasn’t worked very well for me. For the past few weeks, I’ve been washing with Super Nature Aloe Shampoo (not specialized for curly hair, but the label says it is sulfate-free) and Aussie 3-Minute Miracle Moist Detangling Conditioner every couple days, going through with a wide-tooth comb in the shower, scrunching, and wearing a bonnet to bed, and that’s definitely made my hair easier to manage, but it’s still not quite where I want it to be. I just feel so overwhelmed with all the different products and routines and I’m not sure where to start.\n\nMy main goal is simply maintaining my overall hair health, as I think years of treating it like it’s straight have probably led to some damage, judging by how easily it gets frizzy and tangles. But I’m also hoping for a more defined wave or curl pattern. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to get it back to where it was when I was little, but as you can see from the pictures, it‘s pretty curly in the bottom layers and closer to my neck, then the outer layers are more limp, with just a few curly pieces. I’d like to get that same kind of definition on the outer layers too if possible, but I’m not really sure how to achieve this.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

That's because I used niacinimide from the ordinary in the past plus sunscreen and my skin didn't look very good. So l stopped that completely, just resorted to water and it became way better.\n\nAlso I noticed, when in was on a vacation in South-Asia (more humid and hot) my skin was perfect! Literally perfect (only used sunscreen).\n\nMy skin is very sensitive, I easily blush and get red (especially now in the cold months -Germany+snow).\n\nMore on the drier side, but relatively normal.\n\nI would just love to know what this is called, it doesn't look like typical acne?, what I have so that I could research it myself.

      "content": "I bought a lot of skincare because I was really excited about my skincare journey. I started project pan officially this year but since a couple of months ago I made the conscious decision to use what I have until I finish all my products, and then just rebuy HG and simplify my routine. Thank you in advance!\n\nPlease rate/roast my routine. I’m in my early 30s, fitzpatrick IV, with combination and acne prone skin (due to PCOS that I control with birth control pills). My main concerns are keeping my acne (including white and blackheads) at bay, hyperpigmentation, and fine lines and wrinkles (especially under my eyes and marionette lines).  I live in a humid environment that really works for my skin because when I travel to dry places, my skin “evaporates” and suffers. I guess I’m combination leaning dry.\n\nAM routine\n- Cleanser: I usually just use water or the SKIN 1004 madagascar centella hyalu-cica gentle cleansing milk if I feel like I need to wash my face. I like it. \n- Essence: I use both the I’m from mugwort essence and Dr. Ceuracle vegan kombucha tea essence almost everyday, I think both have reached HG status. Sometimes I use COSRX advanced snail 96 mucin power essence, I really like it but in the future I might not repurchase it just because I think 2 essences in the morning are enough, but maybe it could be part of my PM routine.\n- Serum: SKIN 1004 madagascar centella tone brightening ampoule, SKIN 1004 madagascar centella poremizing fresh ampoule, or Numbuzin No. 3 skin softening serum. I try to use the SKIN 1004 ones when I don’t wear makeup and the Numbuzin one before makeup. It’s summer where I live so I haven’t been using them so much. \n- Eye cream: COSRX advanced snail peptide eye cream. Just when I remember and when I’m not wearing makeup. I think it’s an ok product but I won’t repurchase it, I’m just trying to pan it. I also have the Abib collagen eye patch that I try to use after cleansing when doing home office, it’s an ok product I’m trying to pan and won’t repurchase. \n- Moisturizer: Dr. Idriss major fade active seal. It has vitamin C and after I finish it I plan on using the APLB azelaic acid peptide facial cream.\n- SPF: haruharu wonder black rice moisture airyfit (HG), numbuzin No. 1 clear filter sun essence (HG), Skin Aqua super moisture UV essence (trying to pan and won’t repurchase), Skin Aqua super moisture barrier UV gel (trying to pan by mixing it with foundations I want to use as skin tints, not using it as actual SPF), and Skin Aqua UV super moisture milk (trying to pan it by keeping it in my purse because is small and using it on my hands). I also have the COSRX ultra light invisible sunscreen unopened that I’ll try later.\n- Lip mask: Tocobo vita glazed lip mask, and Laneige lip sleeping mask in berry. They’re ok, I don’t think I have found my HG yet but I enjoy both.\n\nPM routine\n- First cleanser: Bioderm sensibio miscellar water, Beauty of Joseon radiance cleansing balm, or Kosé softymo speedy cleansing oil. \n- Second cleanser: haruharu wonder black rice moisture 5.5 soft cleansing gel, or Cetaphil hydrating foaming cream cleanser.\n*I also have PanOxyl acne cream wash 4% benzoyl peroxide, and haruharu wonder black rice triple AHA gentle cleansing gel. The PanOxyl I just forget to use but would like to at least once a week and the haruharu AHA I stopped for a while because I’m working on my skin barrier.\n*I also have 3 other exfoliators (Medik8 press &amp; glow (PHA), Medik8 press &amp; clear (BHA), and Dr. Idriss major fade flash mask (glycolic, tranexamic, and lactic acid) that I stoped using for the same reason, my skin barrier. The Medik8 ones I stopped using a looong time ago but I really want to use them again (also because I’m doing project pan) but I don’t know how to incorporate them in my routine. \n- Essence: COSRX the 6 peptide skin booster.\n- Serum: SKIN 1004 madagascar centella probio-cica intensive ampoule. \n- Eye cream: SKIN 1004 madagascar centella probio-cica bakuchiol eye cream, or La Roche-Posay cicaplast gel B5. I sometimes use the cicaplast gel all over my face, I love it.\n- Retinol: Cerave resurfacing retinol serum (face), and Beauty of Joseon revive eye serum ginseng + retinol (eyes and neck). I want to use both on a regular basis but I haven’t because I haven’t been consistent with my nighttime routine. I’m not starting now because I want to make sure my skin barrier is in great shape.\n- Moisturizer: Purito dermide relief barrier moisturizer, or La Roche Posay cicaplast baume B5+. I use the Purito on regular nights and want to use cicaplast on retinol nights. I also have the iUNIK beta-glucan 3X barrier cream unopened. \n- Masks: Beauty of Joseon ground rice and honey glow mask (HG), I’m from mugwort mask (HG, and I use it after shaving my face for a calming sensation), Abib rice probiotics overnight mask barrier jelly (HG, I use it when I feel I need more hydration), COSRX ultimate nourishing rice overnight spa mask, and iUNIK propolis vitamin sleeping mask. The COSRX and iUNIK are ok products that I’m trying to pan, I use them when I remember and at the moment I think I won’t repurchase them unless I see a major difference when I use them more consistently. \n- Lip mask: Vaseline cocoa butter lip therapy. I like it just at night. \n\nOther\n- Miscellaneous: Prequel universal skin solution (I use it mostly in lazy nights after I cleanse just with Bioderm miscellar water because I don’t feel like washing my face with water), Vaseline healing jelly (as a mask at night in a thin layer when I feel I need it), Pair acne treatment (in the morning when I have a pimple), and Hero pimple patch (morning or night when it’s a big pimple).\n- Toner: Numbuzin No. 3 super glowing essence toner, COSRX propolis synergy toner, and Numbuzin No. 5+ glutathione vitamin boosting essential toner. I decided to use these toners on my body so I can finish them. I like all three but couldn’t find places for them in my AM or PM routines. ",
