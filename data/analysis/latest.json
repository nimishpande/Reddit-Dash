I've tried every active under the sun (kojic acid, glycolic acid, etc.), but nothing has given me this glassy, flawless, glowy, smooth skin like Tretinoin has. I seriously wish I'd started sooner.\n\nFor context, I have extremely oily skin and also deal with hyperhidrosis, but focusing on barrier health and diet seemed to be the winning combo.\n\nMy Winning Routine &amp; Key Factors\n\n• Amount: Use only a pea-sized amount for your whole face.\n\n * Application: I've been strictly using the sandwich method (moisturizer, Tret, moisturizer). \n\n* The Pressing Technique: DON’T rub it into your skin, PRESS it into your skin! I found that gently pressing the product in is WAY less irritating for me.\n\n * Moisturizer MVP: The Dot &amp; Key Barrier Repair Moisturiser has been an absolute game-changer. It's truly a godsend for barrier protection.\n\n* Eye Safety: Don’t get it in or too close to your eyes, as it can cause excessive eye dryness. I counter this by using gel drops before bed.\n\n * Internal Support: I've been focusing on a clean diet, packed with lots of fresh veggies and fruit, which definitely helps my skin from the inside out.\n\nI'll be continuing this routine consistently until mid-December to complete a full three-month run.\n\nA Word of Caution: Tretinoin Can Be Fickle!\nWhile my start has been great, I want to emphasize a serious point for everyone in the community. Tretinoin can be a very fickle product!\n\nThe possible downsides are often very dependent on a person's skin and are not necessarily universal. Tretinoin can cause skin sensitivity, redness, eye problems, perioral dermatitis, and lots of other things.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, 1.5 months is a very short amount of time. A lot of people don’t experience these issues until several months or even years into their Tret journey. That is to say, stay vigilant about keeping a healthy skin barrier and monitoring the condition of your skin closely. I love what Tret has done for me, but it demands respect!\n\nAdvice for Tretinoin Beginners: What I Learned: \n\nIf you're hesitant or scared about starting Tretinoin, here is the regimen and advice that worked for me:\n\nTLDR: My Top 3 Lessons\n\n * Start slow!! When I say slow, I mean SLOW, slower than you think you need to.\n * Simplify your routine and cut out all other actives. Let Tretinoin do the work.\n * Don’t overwash to keep your skin barrier intact and hydrated.\nUsage and Application Tips\n * Amount: Use only a pea-sized amount for your whole face. I dot it all over first, and then gently spread it in.\n * The Pressing Technique: DON’T rub it into your skin, PRESS it into your skin! I found that gently pressing the product in is WAY less irritating for me.\n * Eye Safety: Don’t get it in or too close to your eyes, as it can cause excessive eye dryness. I counter this by using gel drops before bed.\n\nGeneral Tretinoin Commandments\n\n * Waxing Warning: For gods sake, make sure to take a week off of it before waxing brows (or any facial hair). You will regret it otherwise!\n\n * Night Use Only: Tretinoin is very drying and irritating, so only use it at night.\n\n * SPF Mandatory: Wear SPF in the morning (and reapply!).\n\n * Moisturize: Give your skin a break whenever it needs it. Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!\n\n * Moisturizer Recommendations: If you need heavy-duty hydration, I recommend CeraVe. If you can get your hands on it, definitely try Vanicream—it’s excellent for sensitive and compromised barriers!\n\nConclusion\n\nFor me, the key was ramping up usage very slowly and keeping Tretinoin as the only active ingredient.\n\nHas anyone else had a smooth start like this that later changed? I'm curious to hear your long-term experiences! \n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "I’ve been double cleansing for about a month now and things were totally perfect at first. My blemishes cleared up nicely after just a week, I was honestly surprised. Then, randomly, about a week ago… things nosedived in the opposite direction! Before I’d have maybe one consistent, very annoying pimple. Within the last week, it felt like things reversed, and I was back to 4-5 at a time and all my dark spots jumped back in to say hello. I now have 14 of them on my face, and they popped up over a couple of days. I heard that you can have a delayed reaction to skincare products before, but I didn’t think they meant this delayed. Before when I used subpar products, I’d still only have about 4-5 pimples on my face at a time… NEVER over 10. What is going on?!\n\nI’ve tried problem solving as well. I do it night at around 8pm and I used to do a little longer than a minute with each step and really massage my face. However, I noticed my face getting oily when I woke up last week, so I figured I was doing it for too long and went to 30 seconds each step. My skin tends to be oil prone, so I figured this made sense. But it didn’t stop the breakouts… or the excess oil. I figured maybe it was the moisturizer then and used less before briefly switching, but my face still remains very oily when I wake up. I also tried using more of the water-based cleanser, still oily. I even tried washing it again after waking up, my face would be oily in a couple hours.\n\nAs I said, I’ve been using it for a month, and the first few weeks I did everything as before (cleansed for a little over a minute each step, used the same moisturizer, etc.) and was getting amazing results! My face had never been oily after waking up until the middle of last week. Why the sudden change? Could it be related to my hormones (period’s rushing in)? Do I have to give up the cleansing oil? The only constant in the equation seems to be the use of the oil. \n\nFor a little more context, my skin type is very oily and localized around my nose. It’s acne prone in the sense that I have literally never lived a day of my life without a pimple, but I don’t get a lot of them at one time. For a long time, when I was using other products, I used to dry it out because I thought that’s what normal skin was like. Maybe that’s affecting it? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾\n\nPS: (Took embarrassingly long to figure out how to get this to actually post, no comment 😭😭😭)",

Even without the back of head cowlicks, it’s persistently frizzy and only holds strong curls on the day I wash it (sometimes I can revive them by spraying with water, but I think I’m allergic to something in the tap water where I live, so I’ve been avoiding that as it makes my scalp itch). I also feel like the longest layer is weighed down and doesn’t curl up as much as the rest? But I would really like my hair to look more put together, ideally camouflaging the awkwardly short bits as they grow out and reducing the overall frizz that seems to like the sides/back of my hair. (Should I cut it? Can I just put products on it? I don’t even know lol)\n\nIn other words, im tired of my hair looking messy when I’ve just washed it!!! (Like in these pics!)\n\nCurrently my routine includes: Neutrogena TSal shampoo (not my fav ever but guys im desperate), a random tea tree oil conditioner I got at aldi, and one of three leave in conditioner products (today for these pics was a mousse by not your mother’s curls, but I also have a Shea moisture foam and miss jessie’s multicultural curls cream in rotation). And I 99% of the time just air dry my hair\n\nMy hair is medium thick, pretty low porosity, and the area where I live has hard water &amp; high humidity, in case those factors impact any recommendations for products/routine. I want to keep the routine low maintenance (even diffusing to dry is a big ask for me on a regular basis lol) but would appreciate advice!!! I was never really taught how to properly care for curls, so it’s all been trial and error. thanks in advance!!",
