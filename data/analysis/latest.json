      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

But with my new routine it comes out bangin’ everytime!\n\nMy Routine:\n\nShampoo and condition with prose custom hair care. Brush through conditioner with tangle teaser comb. Apply prose curl cream on wet hair. I use the “define” bounce curl brush (absolute game changer) to style in sections. Using prayer hands method I apply gel after styling each section. I use the ouidad heat and humidity gel but I also liked the one I got from prose. Scrunch everything together and plop in a microfiber towel. Allow to dry - air drying is best but I also diffuse if I need it to dry quicker. Then scrunch out the crunch with an oil if I have time. I’m using the olaplex bonding oil. \n\nOverall, I think the bounce curl brush and mastering a gel cast have made the biggest difference. I’m slowly figuring out how to get my curls to last multiple days but I’m still looking for tips! I’m putting my hair in a pineapple overnight and using silk pillowcases. I have a bonnet but I kind of hate doing it lol. ",

I’ve noticed some visible/enlarged blood vessels around the nose (you can see them in the picture), and the area around my nose and upper cheeks is often red.\n\n**My current skincare routine:**\n\n**Morning:**\n\n* Rinse with warm water\n* *The INKEY List Bio-Active Ceramide Moisturizer*\n\n**Evening:**\n\n* CeraVe Foaming Cleanser\n* CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum\n* *The INKEY List Bio-Active Ceramide Moisturizer* again\n\nI’m not sure if I’m correct in assuming this is rosacea or if it could be something else. Are the products I’m using okay for this kind of issue, or should I replace or add anything?  \n  \nAlso — should I incorporate a daily sunscreen? If yes, do you have any recommendations that are gentle and don’t irritate redness-prone skin?  \n  \nThanks in advance for any advice!",

I have no idea how to take care of it or make it look decent. It’s super unmanageable and I feel like I’m stuck in that awkward stage where nothing looks good no matter what I try.\n\nI’ve tried a few products but nothing seems to work for my hair, and I can’t figure out what kind of style would actually suit me. I just feel like I really need a change, something that fits my face shape and hair texture better.\n\nI’m adding a photo so you can see what I’m working with. If anyone has any suggestions for cuts, styles, or products that could help me get my hair under control, I’d really appreciate it.\n\n**Routine:**\n\n* **Shampoo / Conditioner:** Dove Ultra Care shampoo and conditioner. I only shampoo once a week, but I use conditioner every day.\n* **Styling products:** I use a coconut cream from Aussie to help detangle and style my hair, plus a bit of argan oil afterward.\n* **Drying method:** I don’t use any blow dryer or heat tools. I just towel dry gently and let it air dry completely.\n* **Other details:** I always detangle my hair after showering.\n\nThanks a lot for reading and for any advice you can share!",

I currently started using Azelaic acid a few weeks ago and can’t tell if it’s making a difference yet, along with my Cerave Daily Moisturizer.\n\nThe only time I feel like it looks better is when I get out of the pool lol. \n\nI get married next year and would be so overjoyed if I could smooth it out before then.

First one is my personal favorite with the last one being my least favorite.  \n[Glass 1](https://ibb.co/g504zCP)  \n[Glass 2](https://ibb.co/jZyY126z)  \n[Glass 3](https://ibb.co/fWTTwqj)\n\nI’m mainly trying to figure out:\n\n1. Which pair suits my face shape best overall?\n2. Does the round style look current on me or a bit off/out of date?\n3. How does the colour of the glasses work with my hair, beard and skin – is the dark tortoise/amber combination flattering or should I go for something lighter/darker?\n4. As a guy, I’m also wondering whether the glasses reads fairly neutral/masculine, or if it comes across a bit too soft/feminine on me.\n5.

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
