      "content": "I just want to share something I wish I had found sooner. If you’ve ever had filler dissolved and feel lost or hopeless I wrote this for you. You’re not alone. Earlier this year I had cheek filler dissolved after regretting it almost instantly. What followed was one of the hardest periods of my life. I lost a lot of volume quickly and my face didn’t feel like me anymore. Not just the way it looked but the way it felt. Unsupported sunken and heavy. Like it wasn’t holding me.\n\nI searched everywhere. Reddit threads forums youtube even clinical studies. Most of what I found was fear sadness or silence. What helped me feel visible progress might help someone else feel less alone. Deep facial massage. Not a spa facial not gua sha or lymphatic drainage only but something that works with tension fascia and deeper things you don’t even realize your face has been holding onto. I found someone who understood that skin health isn’t just topical it’s emotional too.\n\nI never expected this to help me. My muscles softened my skin woke up and I looked like me again not cause something fake was added but cause something real returned. My face held shape again felt more integrated brought back a sense of glow and support. I finally feel like myself again.\n\nAfter the first session I noticed something shift. Not just in how my face looked but in how I felt inside it. My face stopped collapsing inward visually and physically. My eyes and face softened. I can look down again without seeing my skin fall. I feel held and that feeling is really everything when you’ve been walking around trying to pretend you’re okay. This wasn’t some luxury fix. I didn’t need more procedures. I just needed to feel safe and like myself again.\n\nIf you’re reading this and you’re going through something similar please know it’s not hopeless. You’re not broken. Your face remembers you. I have nothing to gain from sharing this except the hope that it helps someone else feel less alone. If this gets taken down so be it I’ll still find a way to share this cause this is a real lived experience and everyone deserves to feel hope again. To feel familiar in their own skin. It is possible.\n\nI’m happy to share photos privately with anyone who’s genuinely interested or going through something similar. I just don’t feel comfortable posting them openly right now. At the end of the day I’m the one who lives in my face every day and I finally feel more happy and confident in it. That’s a blessing in itself and if sharing this helps even one person then I did what I came here to do.\n\nI know there may not be clinical studies on this yet and I’m not claiming it restores literal fat. But for me structural massage brought back lift, support and ease I didn’t think was possible. I’m not claiming massage regenerates fat cells the way an injection might ‘add volume.’ What I’m saying is that it reorganized the structure of my face in a way that feels and looks like support and harmony were restored and that changed everything for me.\n\nThe reason I even shared this is cause I didn’t see anyone talking about it. I dismissed facial massage for so long too until I finally tried it not expecting anything and now I’m here, truly feeling like myself again. And I am so grateful. I’m not here to prove anything. Just to share what I’ve lived. 🤍",

      "content": "Notes from a skin cosmetologist.\n\nIndian skin tans easily, marks easily, and holds onto pigmentation longer. Ik, it's a little sad. Mostly because our melanin response is very active (thanks to sun + heat + inflammation).\n\nIf you're dealing with tanning, dark spots, or acne marks, here are ingredients that actually work, and (istg this is more important) how they work:\n\n1. Mulberry Extract\nA gentle tyrosinase inhibitor. What this does is it slows the enzyme that makes excess pigment. Good for people who want brightening without irritation.\n\n2. Niacinamide\nDoesn’t lighten melanin!\nInstead, it reduces melanosome transfer, which means less pigment gets passed to the surface layers.\nAmazing for acne marks, PIH\n\n3. Alpha Arbutin\nA stable brightening ingredient that also inhibits tyrosinase, but gradually\nGreat for uneven tone without harshness.\n\n4. Licorice Extract\nContains glabridin + liquiritin. Magical as they are, both work as tyrosinase suppressors + anti-inflammatory... Licorice is giving 😌\nSo it treats dark spots and the inflammation causing them.\n\n5. Centella (Cica)\nMy favourite when it comes to formulating! Not a brightener by itself, but reduces inflammation + oxidative stress, which are major triggers for pigmentation.\n\nBiggest rule for pigmentation :\nREDUCE INFLAMMATION FIRST.\nBrightening only works when the skin is calm.\n\nHope this helps!",

I still use the same gel and leave-in conditioner for both of these pics.\n\nDamaged my hair by tying it back in a low ponytail and wearing a hat most days for the last couple years, and only doing the full curl routine like twice a week. I also had some significant shedding last year so I got on finasteride and minoxidil earlier this year which is why I think I'm seeing more short flyaways around my scalp than normal. Hair is also way more matte than it used to be.\n\nOutside of just not pulling my hair back as much and as tight by using silk scrunchies instead of tight hair ties, any recommendations for some tweaks to my routine?\n\nRoutine:\n\n* Wash every 6-7 days with Ouidad Cleansing Oil Shampoo.\n   * Every three washes I will instead use Malibu C shampoo with a dab of aussie miracle curls shampoo to cleanse the hardwater and silicons.\n* Condition with Cantu Argan Oil Leave-In Conditioning repair cream and then rinse.\n* 1.5 pumps of Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-In Conditioner.\n* Around 4 pumps of Ouidad Climate Control Gel - I have to use a lot to keep the frizz in check.\n* Scrunch out some of the moisture with a microfiber towel.\n* Diffuse on low heat with Dyson diffuser for about 15-20 minutes to about 70-80% dry.\n* Around 3 hours later carefully crunch out cast with Olaplex Bonding Oil or some Morraconoil Argan Oil (mostly just cup my ends and press it against scalp for a second or two)\n* On days that I want a quicker routine for work if I don't have meetings or presentations, I just swap the gel for some Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream and don't worry about diffusing. Gets me like 70% of the results as above, but with less active time.\n* As needed I deep condition with Ouidad Moisture Lock Mask.\n\nI use a silk pillowcase and I have tried pineappling at night and have even tried a silk beanie, but I have never been able to really refresh my curls to the point I think they look acceptable. One of the reasons I tied it back so much. My hair is fine/medium fine with low density.",

      "content": "People always say *“Rooney must’ve never taken fin”* whenever his hair comes up, but honestly that explanation is kinda lazy and doesn’t line up with how hair loss meds work in real life.\n\nWayne Rooney reportedly started finasteride around 2009 ([https://www.theonlineclinic.co.uk/news/2009/05/20/RooneyToGoOnPropecia.aspx](https://www.theonlineclinic.co.uk/news/2009/05/20/RooneyToGoOnPropecia.aspx)).\n\nHe then had that famous hair transplant in 2011, followed by another transplant in 2013. Fast-forward, only 3 years later in 2016, his hair looked awful and looked almost completely bald. ([https://www.thesun.co.uk](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/1255974/wayne-rooneys-two-previous-hair-transplants-appear-to-have-flopped-as-he-prepares-for-euro-2016-with-a-threadbare-rug/))\n\nThese days he pretty clearly uses hair fibres to make it look fuller. If fin was this guaranteed “stop button,” none of that should’ve happened. But it did.\n\nA lot of people here like to say *“well he just didn’t take it consistently”*, but the uncomfortable truth is that fin (and even dut) only slow hair loss, they don’t stop it for everyone. Especially if you’ve got aggressive genetics, all they really do is buy you time. For some guys that’s 10–15 years. For others it’s like… 3–5 years and then the loss just keeps marching on.\n\nRooney started losing early and aggressively. Fin likely helped *slow things down*, but it clearly didn’t freeze his hair forever, even with multiple transplants backing it up. And meds didn't save his native hair from continuing to miniaturise.\n\nAnd it’s not just Rooney. There are plenty of normal, well-documented cases of guys who started early (NW2-ish), stayed on fin for 12 years, and still ended up heavily thinned or basically bald. Here’s one of those documented cases people like to ignore: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WxN5ocR6TU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WxN5ocR6TU)\n\nSo yeah, Rooney isn’t proof that fin “doesn’t work”, but he *is* proof that fin doesn’t work equally well for everyone, aggressive hair loss will often win eventually, and meds mostly delay the inevitable, not stop it.\n\nAnyone pretending otherwise is just coping or hasn’t been on this journey long enough yet on.",

When I scrunch it with gel or foam, it forms very defined waves that I don’t like. I prefer looser, more natural-looking waves like the ones in the first photo. I don’t even know if that’s possible with my hair type.\n\nI’d also like advice on how to treat my hair in general, because it only recently turned wavy and I feel very lost. I want to keep it long, btw I know it doesn’t look very healthy right now, but I don’t want to cut too much. Maybe I need a specific haircut to achieve the waves I want, but I honestly don’t know.\nAt the moment, I’m using John Frieda shampoo and conditioner, and a wave gel from Garnier (from my country),I'm always doing a different routine to see if anything changes but no.\nI’d also like to know the best way to dry my hair to get this type of waves, and how to sleep on it without ruining them.\n\nSorry if this is too much,I’m just REALLY lost.😭",

I dont even know where to start in terms of styling &amp; i feel like my head just looks weird— flat top &amp; bottom heavy bc of how its cut. I made an appointment for a different salon to try and salvage it but i don’t know what they can actually do to salvage it? \n\nAny suggestions on how to fix the cut &amp; how to style it in the meantime would be appreciated— i have my birthday trip to europe in a week please help 😭😭😭😭",

She has naturally curly hair, but she’s very low-maintenance with it.\n\nRight now she only uses Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, brushes her curls when they’re dry (which makes them super frizzy), and her ends are really dry. Her hair also looks kind of flat on top, and she has some thinner spots around the crown.\n\nShe doesn’t like spending time on her hair and is very picky about textures and smells, she doesn't prefer mousse and anything sticky or heavily scented.\n\nWhat I’m thinking so far:\n\n\\-She definitely needs a conditioner\n\n\\-Probably a hair mask for moisture\n\n\\-Maybe one very easy, lightweight product to reduce frizz and define those curls \n\nMy questions:\n\nWhich dm products would you recommend for dry, frizzy curls that don’t require a full curl routine?\n\nAre there any lightweight, non-sticky, low-scent products that work for curls?\n\nDoes she need a specific brush or comb to avoid frizz?\n\nIs there a lazy method that improves curls without defining every single curl?\n\nI’m not trying to force her into the full Curly Girl Method, just something that makes her hair healthier, softer, and less frizzy with minimal effort.\n\nI really want her to feel more confident and care for herself as she struggels with her mental health a lot. I would love to see her feel a little bit prettier.\n\nThanks so much in advance! ✨",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

At the moment, my routine is Shampoo/Condition with Love, Beauty, and Planet 5-1 MultiBenefit Shampoo and conditioner. I then use Curlsmith Hydro Style FlexiHold gel, rake and scrunch, then diffuse. \n\nMy problem is, my curls typically start to fall apart by day 2. Not totally, but there’s lots of flat parts. I’m wondering what I should change or add to make this better? My hair is pretty soft with this shampoo and conditioner, but less than it used to be. My hair is blonde and shows product very fast and gets weighed down fast. I’m debating between using a salt spray before gel or switching to a higher hold gel/mousse, but not sure which ones are better without being weighed down. Any recs or opinions?",

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
