      "content": "I have noticed that a lot of brands are reformulating their cool toned products lately, and the new formulas all end up pulling super warm. A few examples:\n\n- Nars Orgasm is now just orange/peach glitter with no pink color base\n- Mac reformulated lipsticks such as Angel, Creme Cup, etc. that now are warm nudes that pull orange \n- OPI just completely discontinued Russian Navy (we ride at dawn) \n- No new eyeshadow palettes include a shade/shades of blue or emerald green like they did in the 2016 eyeshadow palette era \n\nThe excuse being given a lot of places is that there is a blue pigment shortage or an increase in costs of blue pigments in the cosmetic industry, so they are reformulating their cool products to no longer be cool. Anyone who loves a baby pink lipstick or gloss can feel my pain in that I can spend 45 min in Sephora swatching all the pink glosses in the store and can’t find a good frosty baby pink like the ones I loved years ago. \n\nI even saw a TikTok recently of a girl who pulled some 90’s L’Oréal lipsticks that were all super cool funky 90’s style cool toned browns and nudes, and purchased the modern day versions which were the exact same shades. She put the OG on half her lip and the new one on the other half, and the new versions were all almost totally sheer and orange as hell. \n\nSo what’s really going on? I’ve seen articles saying there is in fact NOT a shortage of blue pigment. These are multi-billion dollar corporations for God’s sake, are we supposed to believe LOREAL can’t afford the color blue? \n\nI’ve tried to deep dive to see what I can find about who owns these pigment companies and can’t find anything meaningful, but all I can say is that I’m pissed lol. \n\nDoes anyone have any insight here??

The last few haircuts I've had have been really bomb!! Despite this, my hair always looks so bad. It's not damaged, I never use heat or straighten my hair, I don't colour or bleach it. So it should be very healthy but it's always frizzy af!\n\nI have always just let my hair air dry, or blow-dried it with a regular hair dryer on low (which is terrible), because I could never figure out how to use a diffuser!! I finally decided to invest in the shark flexstyle hair dryer and it comes with a diffuser attachment... Omg it's a game changer. My curls have never looked better! Air drying always left my hair so flat and simultaneously frizzy, and now I have nice juicy voluminous curls! It's amazing. I definitely recommend the shark or whatever kind of fancy diffuser you're looking at getting! People complain that the shark is loud, but honestly, as a sound-sensitive person, it really isn't that bad as long as you're not aiming it directly into your ear haha.\n\n*(Routine: shampoo (Ouai detox), conditioner (AG curl fresh), out of the shower I spray the innate life's neroli primer on my hair, then used the mielle Rosemary mint cream, and AG CARE mousse-gel. Then diffused with shark. Amazing)*",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

But since I use 5 mg, I have finished my pills in half the time and i am not able to get anymore refills because the prescription can only be renewed at a much later date.\n\nI tried using GoodRx, but they are asking for $245/year upfront. I am not able to just get a prescription and have it sent over to Cost Plus Drugs.\n\nSo I am confused as to what to do right now. If anyone knows what I can do to get my [Ro.com](http://Ro.com) prescription renewed or get some suggestions for different cheap online prescription provider it would be of great help. Thanks !",

On the hunt for a new, non-comedogenic moisturizer for my dry ance-prone skin but it feels like every time I find something I might like it has niacinamide hidden in there which my skin hates for some reason. I recently tried out the Sofie Pavitt omega-rich moisturizer which I really loved but it’s pretty pricey and there isn’t enough product to justify the splurge every other month, so looking for some more budget-friendly options that won’t leave my skin feeling angry and irritated.\n\nFor reference, my skin is definitely on the drier side and I do struggle with mostly hormonal ance, which I’m currently trying to rectify with a low dose of spironolactone - also just started Differin Adapalene gel a few times a week which I know can be quite drying as well. I’ve been focusing on barrier repair lately so really trying to find a great moisturizer to add to my super simplified cleanser/moisturizer/retinoid routine - any help/advice is so appreciated!!",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

But I’m home for Christmas in a very dry, cold climate and after washing and diffusing, the curls were so loose, the next day it was basically straight lol. I know humidity can make curly hair curlier, but is there nothing I can do to replicate the results in a dryer climate? Or is what I’m seeing in this dryer climate more true to my actual curl pattern? It’s seriously making me wonder if I even have curly hair. \n\nI just recently started embracing my natural hair so this is my first time back at home styling my curly hair. \n\nRoutine: \n1. Shampoo and conditioner - dove curl repair \n2. I don’t use a leave in as I have fine hair and I find it’s too much product for it. I use the Marc Anthony strictly curls curl cream and the umberto Giannini scrunching jelly (at home I usually use a mouse as well, but I didn’t bring it with me)\n3. I style in two sections, my bottom layer first and then my crown. I apply the cream, then gel, style with my bounce define brush and scrunch. I do the same for the top layer\n4. I use a cotton tshirt for the excess water and then diffuse until fully dry and scrunch once more with an oil \n\nHeres a picture of what my hair typically looks like. \n",
